1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:03,260
Let me go!

3
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,470
It's not my fault.

4
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,390
This is not fair.

5
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:08,710
Let me go!

6
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:09,389
Wait.

7
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:13,590
See?

8
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,460
Here comes the "hero"

9
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,670
to save the damsel in distress.

10
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,350
Mr. Si,

11
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:40,630
if you send the fake to cheat the clients,

12
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,829
Si Yan's live room will be...

13
00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:47,110
I just wanna stop her
 from working as this live streaming host.

14
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,550
Welcome to my live room.

15
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:57,030
Today I'd like to share with you a red carpet beauty routine

16
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,790
and secrets on how to choose your Haute Couture.

17
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:06,950
Miss.

18
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:08,950
We are overwhelmed by bad comments.

19
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,990
You know, about the fake goods,

20
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:16,670
who on earth is behind all of that?

21
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:17,710
Our competitors?

22
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:18,630
Or someone on our side?

23
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,660
I think...

24
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:24,390
soon there will be an answer.

25
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,230
Miss.

26
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,540
The fake goods have...

27
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:33,710
I'll tell you one more time!

28
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:36,150
I never sold any fake goods in my live room.

29
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:37,430
Sorry, Miss.

30
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,550
I didn't mean it.

31
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:39,110
If today

32
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:40,630
I get to see another negative comment,

33
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:40,950
you will be fired.

34
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:41,710
I'll do my best.

35
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:53,829
Greetings, Lady Min.

36
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:57,390
It hurts! Let go of me!

37
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,750
You are mistaken.

38
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,310
I'm not Lady Min.

39
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,430
She is.

40
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,029
Greetings, Lady Min.

41
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,510
What's going on here?

42
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:24,990
Pardon me, Lady Min.

43
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,070
We're sorry to bother you.

44
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:28,350
We are kicking this maid out

45
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:30,150
from Makeup Service at East Mansion.

46
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:31,510
And she went all maniac.

47
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,750
You are making all that up.

48
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:39,670
I've always heard that 
Makeup Service at East Mansion

49
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:41,510
is the fashion leader.

50
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,590
Now I can say

51
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:43,940
they do deserve the name.

52
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,030
My makeup today

53
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:47,100
is done by my maid.

54
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,270
It's a popular Persian makeup
called Gold Leaf Makeup.

55
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,750
I didn't expect that

56
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,670
your maids can do this as well.

57
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:55,670
My lady.

58
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:58,510
They are not exactly the same.

59
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:01,750
But no matter how she picked it up,

60
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:04,270
she has learned little.

61
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,830
Shame on me.

62
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,510
If I'm being kicked out for poor techniques,

63
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,550
I'll take that.

64
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:12,590
But they are just too conservative,

65
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:14,270
saying that it's a sin

66
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,270
to put on too much makeup.

67
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:16,630
And that a maid shouldn't be prettier than their lady.

68
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:19,630
If a lady were hideous,

69
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:20,870
should the maid just disfigure herself?

70
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:26,110
Just let her go.

71
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:27,270
She's kind of interesting.

72
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:29,510
Since Lady Min said so,

73
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:31,710
we will give this girl

74
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:33,030
another chance to stay.

75
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:35,110
We do this because Lady Min helped you.

76
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:36,790
I will go easy on you this time.

77
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:39,110
But your insubordination

78
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,030
got you rated as class C.

79
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:42,310
I...

80
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:00,990
Do you know this girl?

81
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:03,470
No.

82
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,470
Why does she look so familiar?

83
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:10,470
Never mind.

84
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:12,670
NPCs all look the same.

85
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,070
Who was that lady?

86
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,270
She's a lifesaver.

87
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,870
You've never heard of Lady Min?

88
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:26,630
She is

89
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,950
the only daughter of General Min,

90
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:30,190
who assisted the king to repress the Northland riot.

91
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,150
I heard that

92
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,990
she is here for blind dates with the princes.

93
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:35,110
I bet that

94
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:37,270
she's gonna be our Lady in the future.

95
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,780
That sounds more like a heroin storyline.

96
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:44,030
Have I been played by Jack?

97
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:45,870
What are you mumbling about?

98
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,030
Nothing, nothing.

99
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:49,790
Have you cleaned it up?

100
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:17,990
Director Hua,

101
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:18,990
Today

102
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:21,590
you defended me before Cui.

103
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:24,470
Otherwise, I might get relegated.

104
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:25,830
I did nothing.

105
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:28,190
Your makeup skills are good.

106
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:32,110
And I'm a friend of the Hu family,

107
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:34,430
otherwise, I wouldn't have helped.

108
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:38,550
I was framed by a rat.

109
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:39,110
Otherwise,

110
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:41,670
who knows where I would be sent for class C.

111
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:44,909
After I get my place in the Mansion,

112
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,550
I have to rely all on you.

113
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:51,310
No wonder that Hu Ying is so arrogant.

114
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:53,710
She's bribing Director Hua.

115
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:55,110
Who's there?

116
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:57,110
Sure enough,

117
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,790
connections mean everything everywhere.

118
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,710
You almost frightened me to death!

119
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:05,380
Fine, tell me

120
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,350
how much money

121
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:07,310
do I have in this game?

122
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:13,510
Zero?

123
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:17,030
Without money, 
there is no way to pull any strings.

124
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,870
Why is it zero?

125
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,830
Hasn't my dad topped it up for me?

126
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,430
Or did you

127
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:24,750
pocket his money?

128
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:25,910
Miss. Si,

129
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:27,550
we are an awakening system,

130
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:28,700
with no paid features.

131
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:30,110
But

132
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,030
this game allows you the greatest flexibility.

133
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:33,590
Players can farm through the instance

134
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:34,990
to earn rewards and money,

135
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:38,390
Stay at the Station or Go to the Market

136
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:39,830
Choose to stay at the station,

137
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:41,470
you can continue the main storyline.

138
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,350
Or you can go to the market

139
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:44,990
to run into some subplots

140
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,990
or secret tasks to earn rewards.

141
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:47,710
Two choices

142
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:49,750
represent two different paths.

143
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,070
Please choose carefully.

144
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:52,390
I've passed the boring test

145
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:53,630
with no money earned.

146
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:55,270
And no newbie rewards.

147
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,790
Money in hand makes a confident woman.

148
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:00,470
I choose to make money.

149
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:05,190
Last time we talked about

150
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:07,630
the end of the Northland war.

151
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:10,350
Prince Yi took the secret report for real,

152
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,910
leading a thousand riders

153
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:14,990
to corner three thousand Northland soldiers.

154
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:15,750
Three thousand.

155
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,510
Three thousand.

156
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:16,990
Brilliant.

157
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:17,790
Really?

158
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:18,870
Who would have known?

159
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:20,670
There were thirty thousand instead of three thousand.

160
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:23,630
And Prince Yi became a rat in a hole.

161
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:26,110
And at this key point, who came?

162
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:28,630
Prince Teng of East Mansion!

163
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:31,950
He penetrated into the enemy's force
 all by himself,

164
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:33,550
rescuing Prince Yi.

165
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:35,190
That scene

166
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:37,470
was more than solemn and stirring,

167
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:41,910
And Prince Teng ended up 
with thousands of arrows through his chest

168
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:46,270
East Mansion lost their Prince Teng.

169
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:49,310
It was also unfortunate for Lady Min,

170
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:51,870
who engaged with Prince Teng since they were children.

171
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:54,510
She had to live as a widow then.

172
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,870
To make up for the family of Min.

173
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:58,030
the Lord of Qi Family gave the order,

174
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,430
letting Lady Min choose her husband

175
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:03,710
among the princes of Qi.

176
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:05,670
The Lord Qi is taking this seriously.

177
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:07,550
He let Lady Min choose from princes.

178
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,910
You have no idea who this lady is.

179
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:12,150
She is the only daughter of General Min.

180
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:15,630
And the Second Lady of the Qi Family was her aunt.

181
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:18,430
General Min has guarded the border of Northland for long.

182
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:20,790
Even the Lord of East Mansion will show some respect to him.

183
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,430
For those princes,

184
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:25,900
if one of them made it 
to the position of General Min's son-in-law,

185
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,950
he would be expecting to take

186
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:30,750
the title of Young Lord of East Mansion.

187
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,390
These princes

188
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:34,990
are all extraordinary men.

189
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:24,150
Prince.

190
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,580
The silk you ordered from the South has arrived.

191
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,900
It took twelve tailors to weave for seven days and nights.

192
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,270
And it was sent here 
by a strong horse in a hurry.

193
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:32,590
Top-tier hand-made product with no doubt.

194
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:36,110
Many thanks. Please deliver them to the Mansion.

195
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:36,870
You're welcome.

196
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:38,990
Brother,

197
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,350
I can see you put in a lot of money.

198
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:42,030
How generous!

199
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:43,990
Is it for the one?

200
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:44,710
It's for Wan.

201
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,470
She came here from the South with me.

202
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:49,790
The journey was tiring.

203
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:51,350
And she could be home-sick.

204
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:53,350
But she chose to come here for me.

205
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:54,590
So I have to treat her well.

206
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:02,910
If others see this,

207
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,750
they might think you are a womanizer.

208
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,030
How about those ladies in your house already?

209
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,590
Do you still treat them well?

210
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:09,310
Be careful!

211
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:10,950
What should I do then?

212
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:14,390
I can't tell you how to deal with your lovers.

213
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:16,670
You're lost in lust.

214
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:20,070
Brother,

215
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:21,390
where is brother Yi?

216
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:24,830
He went to pick up the one at the station.

217
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:28,430
I heard that Yi was in the middle of patrolling.

218
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:30,710
And he hurried to pick up Lady Min after he got the message.

219
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:34,110
He is the Prince of East Mansion.

220
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:35,550
No need to be so desperate.

221
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:39,950
Others don't even get the chance to do so.

222
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:40,350
You...

223
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:42,270
Brother Da,

224
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:44,100
Just joking. Don't take it seriously.

225
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,340
Brother.

226
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,790
You tell me.

227
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:49,070
Does brother Yi really want to marry Rui?

228
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:52,230
You ask him.

229
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,350
But why are you here?

230
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:56,270
Father said you were still young.

231
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,310
No need to rush into marriage.

232
00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:59,910
I haven't met Rui for long.

233
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:01,150
Catching up with her would be nice.

234
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:03,550
Speaking of this,

235
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:06,910
you also got yourself so many "good friends".

236
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,910
What has brought you here?

237
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:14,710
Who can say no to a beauty?

238
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,020
Clowning.

239
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:17,670
Cheesy.

240
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:19,750
Big brother,

241
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:20,860
you don't know this.

242
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:25,270
This is called romantic.

243
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:26,390
Nonsense.

244
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,180
It's so lively here.

245
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,070
These people look like real ones.

246
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:51,150
Are those the four princes?

247
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,670
Their influence can almost

248
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,430
compare with me as a beauty guru.

249
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:58,020
But here I am in the market.

250
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,300
Where is the task?

251
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:05,790
Stone Bridge in Distress.

252
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:10,070
Aren't you looking for hidden tasks?

253
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:11,630
Why didn't you take it?

254
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:14,390
Why are you following me everywhere?

255
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:15,630
And,

256
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,230
your tuxedo

257
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:19,270
doesn't really fit in here.

258
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,390
The NPCs in the game

259
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:21,270
cannot see me.

260
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:22,870
And you need my guidance

261
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:23,790
at the beginning.

262
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,470
They cannot see you?

263
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:31,830
Stone Bridge in Distress.

264
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:33,630
The name doesn't sound right.

265
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:35,590
Who knows what trouble it can get me into?

266
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:41,150
Why is it under my feet again?

267
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:43,310
It can move on its own?

268
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:47,470
Where's he?

269
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:53,550
Miss, could you help me?

270
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:55,580
A heartless man robbed me.

271
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:57,230
I'm sorry. I'm occupied.

272
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,070
Miss, please help me.

273
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:01,390
A heartless man robbed me.

274
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:02,350
I told you that I'm occupied.

275
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:03,110
Don't you understand?

276
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:05,660
Miss.

277
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:07,510
A heartless man robbed you, right?

278
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:08,470
Yes. Yes. Yes.

279
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:10,110
Miss, could you help me?

280
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,590
Is this the so-called task?

281
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:17,710
I've finally found you.

282
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:18,790
Where is he?

283
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:19,830
What did he steal?

284
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:20,750
I will take him down.

285
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:22,230
Let me show you.

286
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:22,710
Okay, okay.

287
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:23,230
Let's go.

288
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:32,990
Where is she?

289
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:39,430
What are you looking for?

290
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:41,990
Nothing.

291
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:43,390
I'm just checking where we are.

292
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:47,110
Prince,

293
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:51,590
are you really willing to
 go on a blind date with Lady Min?

294
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:52,910
Yeah.

295
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:55,070
Indeed.

296
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:57,540
That's what First Lady has wished for you.

297
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:59,550
Also,

298
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:01,710
the other princes might finally give up.

299
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,790
A man so handsome like Prince Yi,

300
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:14,510
if you get married,

301
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:16,790
many girls will be heartbroken.

302
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:19,790
Nonsense.

303
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:21,110
I mean it.

304
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:24,190
If one looks for no more than

305
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:25,750
a beautiful face,

306
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,830
that's the least desire I've seen.

307
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:31,630
My prince,

308
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,430
you are a wise man.

309
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:40,670
Where?

310
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,510
This stone bridge again?

311
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:55,310
That prick

312
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:56,390
heartbreaker

313
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,350
played me for fun,

314
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,390
broke my legs,

315
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:01,950
and robbed my mother's heritage

316
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:04,069
for his new lover.

317
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:05,430
What a heartless man!

318
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:07,700
You see that one.

319
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,030
That carriage.

320
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,109
That one, huh?

321
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:12,300
Fine.

322
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,230
I've run into this anyway.

323
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:14,030
Wait here.

324
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:19,430
He's the guy behind the carriage!

325
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:22,670
Stop.

326
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:26,670
Who this crazy woman is?

327
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:27,589
Haven't you heard my name?

328
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:28,150
Give it to me.

329
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:29,470
What are you doing? There are people inside.

330
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:30,110
Give it to me.

331
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:30,950
Move away.

332
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,550
You shall be punished

333
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:35,510
if you mess our things up.

334
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:37,550
Shut up, you filthy man.

335
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:38,710
Give it to me.

336
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:40,190
Nice acting. 
I'll give you more money later.

337
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:41,750
What the hell?

338
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:42,670
Give it to me.

339
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:43,390
Look at her.

340
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:45,390
Robbing a man on the street.

341
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:46,980
Shut up you rat!

342
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:47,510
Give it to me.

343
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:52,790
Go get her.

344
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:53,990
Wait.

345
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,750
I see, here you are.

346
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:11,470
You rich boy, knowing nothing but sleeping around,

347
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:13,150
repels me the most.

348
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:21,030
Give it back.

349
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:22,070
No.

350
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:24,110
Go get her.

351
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:25,390
Come here!

352
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:26,550
Hurry!

353
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:28,030
You are mistaken.

354
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:30,190
Didn't you say the man in the carriage?

355
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:30,990
Don't move.

356
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:34,070
I mean the man behind the carriage.

357
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:37,030
If you don't return it,

358
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:38,510
I'll send you to the police.

359
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:42,510
Sir,

360
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:43,670
you are always generous.

361
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:44,740
Please pardon her.

362
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,870
It's all my fault.

363
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:47,990
Let go! Let go!

364
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:49,270
Stop it!

365
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,150
If you don't,

366
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:53,230
I will throw this down to the river.

367
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:54,430
Wait.

368
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:55,990
All of you stay back.

369
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:12,190
Prince!

370
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:18,150
Prince!

371
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:19,390
Somebody helps!

372
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:16,150
Yi,

373
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:17,870
you'll survive.

374
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:19,310
Brother Teng!

375
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:21,590
Teng!

376
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:39,030
Who can swim?

377
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:41,350
Who saves our prince will get a thousand tael

378
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:42,390
A thousand tael.

379
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:46,230
I didn't expect to earn money in this way.

380
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:49,350
Fine.

381
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:50,430
Just a game.

382
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:53,790
Hurry.

383
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:55,510
I can do this.

384
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:58,590
A girl jumped in!

385
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:29,590
He's so heavy.

386
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:32,110
What is this?

387
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:56,500
Will he die?

388
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,550
Wake up!

389
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:58,870
Are you all right?

390
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:05,790
Prince.

391
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:09,070
You hired me to stop the carriage. 
Where is it?

392
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:10,270
You? Stop the carriage?

393
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:12,630
Then who she is?

394
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:15,670
Is he dead?

395
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:17,230
Prince!

396
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:18,870
Prince! Are you alright?

397
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:20,390
Go get the doctor!

398
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:22,230
If he died,

399
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:23,750
I would also lose my reward right?

400
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:24,750
If he dies,

401
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:25,790
all of you will die with him.

402
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:26,750
With him?

403
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:28,350
Prince!

404
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:30,070
I can't lose both of my money and my life.

405
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:32,190
You get up.

406
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:41,070
CPR.

407
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:42,590
Will this work?

408
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:45,220
Look at him. Any reactions?

409
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,030
No.

410
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:47,750
Not at all.

411
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:49,670
Well then.

412
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:51,830
Artificial respiration.

413
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:54,510
You lift his chin up.

414
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:55,350
Pinch his nose.

415
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:56,870
Take a deep breath and breathe in his mouth.

416
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:58,150
Lift his chin up.

417
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:00,070
Pinch his nose.

418
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:01,180
Take a deep breath.

419
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:03,190
And breathe into his mouth!

420
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:04,910
How?

421
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:06,350
Get up and I'll show you.

422
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:08,070
Hurry, you do that.

423
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,790
What the heck!

424
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:12,390
I didn't save my first kiss for this.

425
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:24,870
Prince!

426
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:29,550
See?

427
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:30,180
He's awake.

428
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:31,830
Where's my money?

429
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:32,630
Money.

430
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:33,830
Come and get her.

431
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:34,750
Yes.

432
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:36,060
What?

433
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:36,830
I saved him.

434
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:38,750
What are you doing?

435
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,670
Let me go!

436
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:42,110
This is returning favors with hatred.

437
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:44,630
I feel like I was punched in the chest.

438
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:46,550
No.

439
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,430
Not at all.

440
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:48,660
Who dares to do that?

441
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,710
This is taking years.

442
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:53,310
I've fixed my makeup three times.

443
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:55,870
What makes you so anxious?

444
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:00,350
I'm just so curious.

445
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:06,270
Here they are.

446
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:26,910
Greetings, Prince Da.

447
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:29,470
Gre...Greetings.

448
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:33,350
We should have visited East Mansion by ourselves.

449
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:35,350
Sorry you have to come all the way here.

450
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:36,430
We're so sorry to bother you.

451
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:39,150
Come.

452
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:39,750
The box.

453
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:44,230
Let's hurry to the Meeting Tower.

454
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:46,030
We shouldn't keep others await.

455
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:48,100
Please.

456
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:58,820
Prince Da is so silent.

457
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:00,990
He couldn't speak less.

458
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:03,190
Why is he the one

459
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:05,710
sending this Box to me?

460
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:12,150
Get in there.

461
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:27,270
Pick one.

462
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:29,710
The Guide to Torture Device.

463
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:48,670
I'd rather not.

464
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:49,860
No?

465
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:50,790
It's not up to you.

466
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:51,390
Hurry!

467
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:56,750
Okay.

468
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,270
Okay, I'll pick one.

469
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:00,470
Alright.

470
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:15,030
Maybe this one is for tickling.

471
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:20,630
This.

472
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:22,870
I'll pick this one.

473
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:24,430
Are you sure?

474
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:31,020
It's just tickling.

475
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:32,950
I can deal with this.

476
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:38,990
What is this!

477
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:41,630
I thought that's for tickling.

478
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:43,630
What are you doing?

479
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:46,110
Sir

480
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:47,350
Sir, pardon me, please!

481
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:48,790
Sir!

482
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:50,230
If you dare to touch me,

483
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:51,820
I am gonna delete this damn game!

484
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:53,030
Stop!

485
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:55,510
Director Hua.

486
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:57,350
How dare you!

487
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:59,350
She's the prep maid for East Mansion.

488
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:00,550
Don't you touch her!

489
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:01,510
And look how you made her.

490
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:03,110
I will be responsible for this!

491
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:04,030
Listen to Director Hua.

492
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:05,630
We'll let her go.

493
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:07,910
It's just someone asked us to

494
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:09,550
make it difficult for her.

495
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:12,470
Director Hua,

496
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:14,670
She pushed Prince Yi into the river.

497
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:20,030
Director Hua.

498
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:21,670
Punish her.

499
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:22,270
Yes.

500
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:24,270
Director Hua.

501
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:26,670
Please don't!

502
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:28,340
I'm sorry.

503
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:30,110
I'm sorry!

504
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:31,790
Help! Is there anyone?

505
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:32,510
Wait!

506
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:35,230
Please stop.

507
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:39,500
What happened today

508
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,350
was all my fault.

509
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:43,190
This girl is innocent.

510
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:44,630
Just let her go.

511
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:51,230
Fine, fine.

512
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:53,590
The girl belongs to

513
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:56,110
our East Mansion anyway.

514
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:58,230
I'll take her back and deal with her my way.

515
00:27:59,220 --> 00:27:59,990
Yes.

516
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:12,030
Thanks to you.

517
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:13,470
It's my fault.

518
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:15,670
Why did you say so?

519
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:17,350
He was the one to be blamed.

520
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:19,670
But I'm sorry that

521
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:21,500
I couldn't get your mother's object back.

522
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,910
I got it back already!

523
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:24,220
Sis, you have no idea.

524
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:26,710
That heart-breaker was sent to prison as a thief.

525
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:27,470
Really?

526
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:32,270
These tael weigh good.

527
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:33,830
The police just mentioned that

528
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:35,510
you are the maid of Palace Makeup Service.

529
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:37,070
This is our family heritage.

530
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:38,150
It might help you.

531
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:40,820
A recipe?

532
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:49,190
The Secret to Eyebrows.

533
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,390
After all this?

534
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:58,830
I fell into the river and got punished,

535
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:00,270
only for a silly book.

536
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:02,030
This is all the Prince's fault.

537
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:03,350
Don't let me see him again.

538
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:05,310
Keep going.

539
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:07,500
You wanna be sent back here again?

540
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:10,350
Okay, I'll go.

541
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:35,630
It was Prince Da who visited Lady Min

542
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:37,030
with White Jade Box?

543
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:40,110
How's your going?

544
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:40,900
All is well.

545
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:43,230
Lady Min will be counting on you then.

546
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:44,750
Since you are not convenient,

547
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:47,350
I'll take this over for you.

548
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:54,190
Well.

549
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:55,870
Well.

550
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:58,070
See what have you done.

551
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:59,150
Everything was going well.

552
00:29:59,150 --> 00:29:59,990
I didn't expect that

553
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:01,150
there was a crazy woman,

554
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:02,670
who made Prince Yi fall into the river.

555
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:06,870
Was it Prince Da?

556
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:09,150
I bet it was him

557
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:11,550
that did this on purpose.

558
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:13,550
He's not gonna make it.

559
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:17,550
How's Yi now?

560
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:19,350
He catches a bit cold.

561
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,830
The royal doctor has taken care of him.

562
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:24,110
It's just...

563
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:25,220
What?

564
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:27,030
The river water was dirty.

565
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:29,270
And the prince took some sip of it.

566
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:30,990
He just took the medicine and lied down.

567
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:32,990
Arrange Lady Min

568
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:34,870
to stay in the Peace Pavilion next door.

569
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:37,070
And send more guards there.

570
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:37,750
Yes.

571
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:39,270
Go.

572
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:40,230
I'd like to see Yi.

573
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:43,700
You...

574
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:45,630
Stay on your knees.

575
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:56,430
Mother.

576
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:58,510
Save it.

577
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:02,950
I let you down.

578
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:04,470
The marriage thing was just fine.

579
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:06,990
The most important thing is that

580
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,990
you cannot offend General Min.

581
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:09,670
Yi,

582
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:11,420
East Mansion

583
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:12,710
might seem peaceful.

584
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:13,510
But if...

585
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:16,910
So,

586
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:18,710
I need to plan this for you.

587
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:21,630
What you need now

588
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:23,110
is a loyal ally.

589
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:26,390
Mother, you have planed so much for me.

590
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:29,750
I was reckless

591
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:31,670
and ill-conceived.

592
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:34,510
That's all.

593
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:38,030
It is what it is.

594
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:40,510
Take care.

595
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:42,430
In a few days, we will hold

596
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:43,950
the Flower Feast.

597
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:45,390
Do not screw it up

598
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:47,630
at the Feast.

599
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:48,870
I will bear this in mind.

600
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:49,830
Go rest.

601
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:05,390
Have you heard this?

602
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:08,430
Si Yan pushed Prince Yi into the river,

603
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:09,910
then ended up in prison.

604
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:13,790
Like she's stupid or something.

605
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:16,070
Hu Ying.

606
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:17,310
Don't say that.

607
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:23,150
Seems like she's a tough one too.

608
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:27,550
What a jinx!

609
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:28,550
Si Yan,

610
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:30,070
don't take their words seriously.

611
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:30,870
You can sleep by my side.

612
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:33,390
It's okay.

613
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:36,310
I shall thank them for making room for me.

614
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:37,470
Exactly what I want.

615
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:44,390
This is my first time enjoying such a big bed.

616
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:45,590
Not bad.

617
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:46,780
Pretty spacious.

618
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:49,590
It's almost 11PM.

619
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:50,590
It's getting late.

620
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:51,710
Let's go to sleep.

621
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,180
It's only 11PM!

622
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:58,150
If I weren't here,

623
00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:00,150
I'd say it's just the beginning of my day.

624
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:02,670
Lan Miao.

625
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:03,670
Do you happen to

626
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:04,990
have any acquaintances in the Mansion?

627
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:06,150
We can pull the strings

628
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,430
and get us promoted.

629
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:10,300
Lan Miao.

630
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:11,990
Lan Miao.

631
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:16,470
Falling asleep already?

632
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:20,910
Easy for you.

633
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:22,230
Sleep early,

634
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:23,510
and rise by the crowing of a rooster.

635
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:30,670
Anyway, today was quite

636
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:31,870
an exciting day.

637
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:35,070
I fell into the river and got into prison.

638
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:36,870
And I have to share my bed with others.

639
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:40,430
I've never lived like this before.

640
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,630
Where's the moon tonight?

641
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:09,670
And when can I return to the real world?

642
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:13,150
Once you complete all your tasks, Miss,

643
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:14,230
then you will wake up.

644
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:16,989
You frightened me to death!

645
00:34:16,989 --> 00:34:18,830
Stop jumping out like this!

646
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:22,980
Why did you change your clothes?

647
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:23,909
You said that

648
00:34:23,909 --> 00:34:26,150
the tuxedo was weird.

649
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:27,030
How about now?

650
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:35,750
So many options!

651
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:38,550
Which one do you like?

652
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:42,270
This one.

653
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:02,660
This color means bad luck. No.

654
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:08,230
This one will do.

655
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:18,270
This looks good.

656
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:20,990
Looking good.

657
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:23,350
It's a pity that only I can see you.

658
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:24,910
What a waste of all this!

659
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:27,150
I'm am all for you anyway.

660
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:30,310
Don't just stand there. Come and sit here.

661
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:36,030
Seems that you're the only one

662
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:37,750
that wants all the best for me in the world.

663
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:41,350
Miss Si

664
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:42,870
It's my duty to take care of you.

665
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:47,620
That's quite touching.

666
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:49,630
Thanks.

667
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:55,180
I can't touch you.

668
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:57,430
I didn't know that the butler is untouchable.

669
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,180
As your butler,

670
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:01,900
I am made up of codes and data.

671
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:04,910
I am not an NPC.

672
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:07,140
So I can't be physically in this world.

673
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:14,470
Such a handsome butler,

674
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:16,380
but out of my reach.

675
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:19,990
I'll go back to sleep.

676
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:24,110
Are you gonna crowing?

677
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:25,510
Quit that! I haven't gone to bed.

678
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:31,430
You know how to dodge, huh?

679
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:35,870
Come here!

680
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:38,190
Stop!

681
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,550
Don't crow! I need to sleep.

682
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:41,790
Freeze!

683
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:44,630
Stop shouting.

684
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:21,670
Run!

685
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:24,310
That's all you can do.

686
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:29,870
I can tie your beak up, 
how's that for you?

687
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:02,260
Look!

688
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:04,070
A flying rooster.

689
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:14,750
Si Yan, here you are.

690
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:17,630
It's said that the rooster was missing this morning.

691
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:18,110
so

692
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:19,550
everyone got up late.

693
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:20,740
Director Hua was very angry.

694
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:21,910
Don't play with him.

695
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:25,990
Once you get in,

696
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:27,830
you hear your name,

697
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:28,790
Get your doorplate.

698
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:30,350
And go enlisting.

699
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:31,470
Remember,

700
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:33,710
although you are assigned to different departments,

701
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:35,990
you all belong to Palace Makeup Service.

702
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:37,910
There will be a routine test once a month.

703
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:40,230
Those who pass the test will get promoted.

704
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:42,510
If not, they will be relegated.

705
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:45,430
If you get relegated three times in a row,

706
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:47,230
you will be asked to leave the Mansion.

707
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:48,460
Do you understand?

708
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:50,110
Yes.

709
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:55,550
Qi Ran.

710
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:59,180
You will serve First Lady at Virtue Pavilion.

711
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:01,830
Yes, Director Hua.

712
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:02,870
Go report to your Lady.

713
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:16,710
Lan Miao.

714
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:18,500
You will serve Second Lady at Jade Pavilion.

715
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:20,990
He's calling you.

716
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:38,830
Hu Ying.

717
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:42,190
Yes, Director Hua.

718
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:45,750
Si Yan.

719
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:55,430
I told you I would make my way 
into the Palace Makeup Service.

720
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:21,910
Where are you going?

721
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:25,990
The same as you do.

722
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:28,860
Are you sure?

723
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:32,270
Si Yan, read your doorplate.

724
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:37,230
Beekeeping Site.

725
00:40:57,470 --> 00:40:58,310
Useless!

726
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:00,430
You can't even keep a rooster.

727
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:02,430
Don't move.
