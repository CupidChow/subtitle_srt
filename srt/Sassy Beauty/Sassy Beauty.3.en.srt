00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:58,870
It'll go to the highest bidder.

177
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:59,900
500 tael.

178
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,140
500 tael.

179
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:01,710
One thousand!

180
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:03,350
1,500!

181
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:03,990
1,500.

182
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,110
2,500 tael.

183
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:07,750
2,500 tael once.

184
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,830
2,500 tael twice.

185
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:10,270
2...

186
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,150
5,000 tael.

187
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:13,910
5,000 tael?

188
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:15,670
Prince Yi.

189
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:16,950
I didn't know

190
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:19,150
it's you who bid for it.

191
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:21,710
I only did this 'cause I was desperate.

192
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:24,430
So many guests are requesting Luna.

193
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:25,870
If they find out that

194
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:26,750
she's gone already,

195
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:29,350
they'll tear the Cloud Brothel apart.

196
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,270
So you just lie to everyone?

197
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:34,190
I was blinded by greed.

198
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:36,590
Please forgive me, my lord.

199
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:38,670
You're saying Luna is missing?

200
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,790
She went missing last night.

201
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:41,790
She only left this

202
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:43,310
in her room.

203
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:45,350
You can't find her?

204
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:48,070
Luna is extremely popular

205
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:49,790
but she's very mysterious.

206
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:51,870
Not many people have seen her in person.

207
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:53,830
I only learned last month

208
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,230
that she's back in business.

209
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:58,390
My lord,

210
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:00,470
we've checked her indenture.

211
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:01,830
All her relatives,

212
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:02,830
including her parents, are dead.

213
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:04,390
She has no family.

214
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:08,830
Weird.

215
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:10,910
So she came out of nowhere,

216
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:12,540
then disappeared all of a sudden?

217
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,990
This piece of clothes is so heavy.

218
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:23,630
You have no idea

219
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:25,350
how difficult it was to get it out of water.

220
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:28,070
Good thing that our prince got out in time.

221
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,530
Had anything happened to him,

222
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,590
all of us would be dead now.

223
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:53,830
I failed you, my lord.

224
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:55,910
The target survived.

225
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:59,110
But that maid seems like a fool.

226
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:03,110
Don't mind her.

227
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:06,550
Our boss wants her there.

228
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:09,230
Understood. I'll carry out the plan.

229
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:15,430
I get up earlier than roosters,

230
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:17,910
and turn in later than dogs.

231
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,670
Who knew they work 12 hours in ancient times!

232
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:22,470
When I go back,

233
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:23,630
I'll make big changes.

234
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,590
Only five hours of work a day!

235
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:28,910
When I go back...

236
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:33,590
Will I ever make it back?

237
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,150
My skin...

238
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,150
So many pimples

239
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:44,150
and blackheads.

240
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:53,870
Can't fall asleep?

241
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:55,270
Get up.

242
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:56,590
What?

243
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,030
It's so late now.

244
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,150
You can't boss me around

245
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:00,230
after working hours!

246
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:01,270
I'll file a complaint!

247
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:02,430
Get up now.

248
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,630
I said I won't work!

249
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:09,070
[Cleansing Lotion with Plum Flower]

250
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:11,870
You've worked under the sun here.

251
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,310
It's also very windy

252
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:14,310
and dusty here.

253
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:15,950
It takes time for

254
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:17,510
fragile girls like you

255
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:18,950
to get used to it.

256
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:20,590
I asked a friend

257
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:21,830
to get you this.

258
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:24,950
Cleansing Lotion with Plum Flower.

259
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:26,670
A natural remedy for

260
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,550
pimples and sunburn.

261
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:29,190
Your skin

262
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:31,550
will go back to perfect in no time.

263
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:32,830
Take it.

264
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:42,510
I know it's just a commercial,

265
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:44,630
but I'm quite moved.

266
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:45,310
Alright.

267
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:46,900
I've made your bed.

268
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:48,630
Stop whining.

269
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,270
Save the tears

270
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:51,950
for tomorrow's work.

271
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:53,790
Thanks.

272
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:58,630
We've met all the princes,

273
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:00,110
the oldest one, the fifth and the ninth.

274
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:01,750
But Prince Yi hasn't shown up.

275
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:04,630
Word has it that he's young and promising,

276
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,630
and very reliable.

277
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:06,990
However,

278
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:08,990
everyone was saying today that

279
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:11,510
he spent thousands on a dancer's handkerchief.

280
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,070
Such a spoiled rich brat.

281
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,030
I wonder who's telling the truth.

282
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:17,830
Don't you wanna know?

283
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:19,990
No.

284
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:21,550
You really don't?

285
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:28,270
Her ladyship arranged for us

286
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:30,180
to stay next to his place.

287
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,550
Isn't her intention obvious enough?

288
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:34,380
Don't worry.

289
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:38,310
We'll have plenty of opportunities

290
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:39,550
to see this Prince Yi.

291
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,230
You're so wise, my lady.

292
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:56,670
My lord.

293
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:01,870
I've checked all the clothing stores

294
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:02,750
in the East City.

295
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:03,750
And?

296
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:05,550
They said it's not from them.

297
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:06,750
They also said that

298
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:09,030
from the cloth and pattern,

299
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:10,750
the handkerchief looks old.

300
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:11,550
It's not recently made.

301
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:12,950
Maybe

302
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,910
Cloud Brothel had it tailored somewhere.

303
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,630
Find some experienced tailors.

304
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,030
See if the dandelion embroidery means anything.

305
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:22,430
Got it.

306
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:23,630
My lord,

307
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:25,619
his ladyship has requested you for dinner.

308
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,790
Why do you have this handkerchief?

309
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,390
What's wrong with it?

310
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:35,750
These are for maids from the Palace Makeup Service.

311
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:37,510
You sure?

312
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:39,390
Yeah.

313
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:41,310
I remember silk was abundant one year,

314
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:43,910
so her ladyship ordered silk handkerchiefs

315
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:45,190
for maids in Makeup.

316
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:46,670
Even the embroidery

317
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:48,700
was chosen by her ladyship.

318
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:50,350
I remember it very well.

319
00:17:55,930 --> 00:18:00,340
[Jewelry Store]

320
00:17:58,150 --> 00:17:59,590
Such a great jewelry store.

321
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:01,550
Please come often.

322
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:02,710
Goodbye.

323
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:07,180
What kind of jewelry do you like, Miss?

324
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,310
We've got everything here.

325
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:16,390
Follow me.

326
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:29,350
Greetings, my lady.

327
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:32,870
Have you found anything?

328
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:34,990
I've asked around

329
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:36,510
about White Jade Boxes.

330
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:37,630
Two decades ago,

331
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:40,550
General Min and the king chose it as the bride price.

332
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:43,270
It consists of nine makeup boxes.

333
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:44,350
Years go,

334
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:46,670
Prince Teng led a troop to conquer Northland,

335
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:48,070
and they won the war.

336
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:49,590
He was supposed to

337
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:51,300
go to your family and propose

338
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,590
with the makeup boxes.

339
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:55,470
But right before he set off,

340
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,430
Prince Teng

341
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,350
died in battle.

342
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:02,790
And?

343
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:06,510
After he died,

344
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:08,870
his camp caught on fire weirdly.

345
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:11,550
General Min tried to put it out,

346
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,590
but they found out later that

347
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:16,350
one piece of the nine makeup boxes

348
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:17,790

Then the power box in the set now...

351
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:43,790
Well, in my humble opinion,

352
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:45,030
it's probably fake.

My lady,

358

the nine makeup boxes

359
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:04,390
were carved from

360
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:05,390
nine types of wood.

00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:12,190
I think

364
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:13,310
there's more to the story.

365
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,190
You must be extra careful.

366

My lady,

367
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,550
it's the Qi family

368
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:22,710
who lost the Rosewood Power Box.

369
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:23,670
It's not our fault

370
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:25,230
no matter who digs into it.

371

You can still marry into their family.

I'd never thought he's into flowers.

522
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:49,700
But where are the balloon flowers?

523
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,070
They should have been arranged

524
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:52,780
alphabetically like books in a library.

525
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:54,670
It's gonna take me ages to find it.

526
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:03,550
This one is blue. Can it be balloon flower?

527
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:06,950

528
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:11,470

543
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:43,750
It was just a misunderstanding.

544

I already forgot it.

Director Hua, we're short of eyebrow pencils lately.

I just learned that,

She made you fall into water

And now,

she's burnt Hua's eyebrow.

when you have time,

622

my best choice,

693
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:39,950

why would I be afraid of these people?

I must see it to the end.
