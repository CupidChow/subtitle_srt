1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:07,870
I'd forgive myself if it's the first time.

3
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:09,389
But the system had set

4
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:10,350
dangerous events so many times.

5
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,460
Why didn't I realize it sooner

6
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,510
about who I am?

7
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,030
If I had known it earlier,

8
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,300
he wouldn't have been in such danger.

9
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:18,790
What if he's dead?

10
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:19,870
Si Yan,

11
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,390
the plot is destined.

12
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:22,870
There's no need to blame yourself.

13
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:25,070
Why is such a plot necessary?

14
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:26,470
My ultimate goal

15
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,070
is to become the head matron, right?

16
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:30,310
Why do I have to assassinate Qi Yi?

17
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:32,350
If you wait for a promotion,

18
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,350
it'll take you ten years, as it took Lady Cui.

19
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:36,030
But if you assassinate Qi Yi,

20
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,660
help the one who is behind it,

21
00:02:37,829 --> 00:02:38,710
and earn their recognition,

22
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:39,990
you will get promoted

23
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:41,070
in the quickest time.

24
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:42,870
Actually, for each plot thread,

25
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,070
there are hidden tasks.

26
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:45,950
But if you were told of everything ahead,

27
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:47,350
would you still choose the one as before?

28
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:50,950
This is your scam!

29
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,470
This is just a rule.

30
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,190
Qi Yi, the NPC,

31
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,590
is part of your game mission.

32
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:56,710
He will die and you will live.

33
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,630
The system is set like this.

34
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,350
This time you saved him,

35
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:01,390
you are pushing the plot

36
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,870
to somewhere unknown.

37
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,710
Who cares where it goes!

38
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,310
I can restart the game if I die,

39
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,190
but Qi Yi will disappear for good if he dies!

40
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,230
This is not fair.

41
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:15,310
Why do you care about him so much?

42
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,829
He's just an NPC.

43
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:17,950
A set of data. That's all.

44
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,780
Prince Yi,

45
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:40,790
beg for my mercy.

46
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,070
Maybe I will

47
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:44,710
let this girl go.

48
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:54,310
We used to have
so many misunderstandings between us.

49
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:56,900
But this time,

50
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,620
I will not leave you.

51
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,310
Can NPCs talk to me affectionately?

52
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:14,990
Maybe they can.

53
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:17,670
What?

54
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:23,470
Stop talking to me about NPCs

55
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:24,420
all the time!

56
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:25,870
Aren't you an NPC, too?

57
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:28,510
No, I'm not.

58
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,100
I'm your butler.

59
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,470
All though we're all  generated by the system,

60
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:34,190
but I'm different.

61
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,510
I live for you.

62
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,060
I will protect you no matter what.

63
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,350
I don't doubt it.

64
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:47,070
I am just skeptical about the mission.

65
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:48,710
A life for a life.

66
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:50,710
What a cliche!

67
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:52,630
You are here to find a way to wake up in real life.

68
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:53,909
And for that goal,

69
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,750
you have to follow the settings of the system.

70
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,670
Follow the settings?

71
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:59,670
That depends on the players!

72
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:00,830
I don't believe it.

73
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:01,990
What else can it do?

74
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,590
Get exiled to Linchuan Cliff.

75
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,350
Find the blood mica.

76
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:13,430
The system is broken.

77
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,870
The two options are basically the same!

78
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,110
It has left me with no choice.

79
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:20,830
I'll choose neither of them.

80
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,310
The First Lady has ordered

81
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:31,790
to banish Si Yan to Linchuan Cliff.

82
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:39,150
Bao,

83
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:40,260
you came at the right time.

84
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:41,190
I've helped you...

85
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:42,230
Mother,

86
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:43,710
Si Yan will be exiled to Linchuan Cliff.

87
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,030
She's innocent.

88
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:45,830
Please save her.

89
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:48,909
She's just a maid.

90
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:50,390
Why do you care so much?

91
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:52,710
Si Yan is different.

92
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,590
Are you...

93
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:05,750
I like her.

94
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,470
Let's put aside the fact that she's a maid

95
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:12,430
and you are the master.

96
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:13,510
Do you know

97
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:15,670
what others in the Mansion are saying about her?

98
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,710
Do you know what's her relationship with Prince Yi?

99
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:20,310
I don't care about status.

100
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,230
I don't care about the rumors.

101
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,790
All I know is I like her.

102
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:26,110
I can't stand her being wronged

103
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:26,990
and in danger.

104
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:28,750
Mother,

105
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:29,990
please!

106
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:31,230
Please help me persuade Father.

107
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:32,630
He will listen to you.

108
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:34,230
I beg you!

109
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:42,260
Get up.

110
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:51,390
My silly boy.

111
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:55,060
Sit.

112
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:02,430
You are just too soft.

113
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,100
This time,

114
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,750
Prince Yi got in distress at Qixi Festival.

115
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,630
Among all the people involved,

116
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:08,940
who's still alive

117
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:09,950
except for Si Yan?

118
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:16,550
She's being at the vortex of power.

119
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:18,910
Going to Linchuan Cliff

120
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:21,190
is to get away from trouble.

121
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:26,030
If she comes back here at this moment,

122
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:28,790
she will only count disaster and get hurt.

123
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:42,110
You mean I should do nothing but

124
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:43,870
see her suffer?

125
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:47,590
Son,

126
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,830
I've been there, too.

127
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:54,710
But as one of the royals,

128
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:59,710
you have to stay low and be discreet.

129
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:04,150
Once you are strong,

130
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:07,710
then you can protect your beloved ones.

131
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:15,710
Mother,

132
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:19,950
I know what you mean.

133
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:27,030
You know what?

134
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:28,710
Linchuan Cliff is a mass grave.

135
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,230
When the wind rises,

136
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:33,270
you can hear the screaming,

137
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:34,909
growling, and crying there.

138
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,309
And the mountain shakes under mysterious power.

139
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:38,110
Few people dare to be up there.

140
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,700
One night,

141
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:41,510
thunder roared and lightning struck.

142
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:44,950
A barren grave was hit open.

143
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:46,660
A barren grave?

144
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,270
A barren grave?

145
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:49,710
There was golden light shining from within.

146
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,350
Everyone was scared.

147
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,910
No one dared go near.

148
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:54,270
There were some night-watchers,

149
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:55,790
who were brave enough to check

150
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,270
the shiny golden light.

151
00:08:58,870 --> 00:08:59,950
Guess what it was?

152
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:01,780
What was it?

153
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:04,070
A chunk of wood?

154
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:05,230
No way!

155
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,020
It was golden mica.

156
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,910
Good fortune!

157
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:12,230
Golden mica is rare to find.

158
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,470
Makeup products made with golden mica

159
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:15,750
are practically

160
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:17,830
priceless!

161
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:26,230
Da...

162
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:27,550
Sorry.

163
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,870
I should call you "Your Highness."

164
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,710
So, you've known who I am for a long time.

165
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:33,430
Everyone in the city knows that

166
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:35,630
Prince Da's totem is a tiger.

167
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,830
I bet only you can

168
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:39,820
wear this tiger jade pendant.

169
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,070
I know you are not that simple.

170
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:44,430
Tong, have your sit.

171
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:48,350
Although you know who I am,

172
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:49,750
please still call me Da.

173
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,630
I was afraid my identity will

174
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:53,310
leave you under pressure.

175
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,110
It's been a long time since I last

176
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:56,190
had someone to have a nice conversation with.

177
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:57,830
I understand.

178
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,190
Get lost!

179
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:14,790
It seems that everyone has been

180
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:16,380
talking about what happened to Prince Yi.

181
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:17,830
It's said that the King

182
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:19,070
has assigned hundreds of soldiers

183
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:20,470
to search for the assassin.

184
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:21,750
And he even

185
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,790
planted several spies around.

186
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:26,630
You are very well-informed.

187
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:33,510
Prince Yi is

188
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:36,150
the chosen one,

189
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:37,510
the best of the best.

190
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,310
Naturally, he draws the attention of everyone.

191
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:41,110
I don't think so.

192
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:43,390
In terms of virtue and talent,

193
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,510
he is no better than you.

194
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:48,310
Needless to mention 
you have excellent fighting skills.

195
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:50,830
It's just...

196
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,350
Just what?

197
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,270
It's just that you came from a humble family

198
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:57,110
with no patron to rely on.

199
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:00,030
Even you get support from all the royal courtiers,

200
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:02,670
the King will still be skeptical about you.

201
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:04,390
I know all that.

202
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,030
You don't have to remind me.

203
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:09,590
You misunderstood me.

204
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:12,230
I didn't mean to

205
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:14,390
embarrass you by saying all these.

206
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:16,460
Even though you are from a humble family,

207
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:18,550
you can still seek the Min family for help.

208
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,390
You haven't got the King's acknowledgment,

209
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:22,310
and you need a chance to shine.

210
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:24,510
Once you have accomplished these,

211
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,070
you will naturally

212
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:27,150
get anything you want

213
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:28,590
and do whatever you like.

214
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,030
Don't you think 
that I have thought of these?

215
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,470
Miss Min's being around Yi all day.

216
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:34,950
Clearly, she's helpless.

217
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:36,870
I'd be embarrassing myself

218
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,150
to please her.

219
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:43,780
To build your vocation,

220
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:45,750
Miss Min is not enough.

221
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:48,030
If you are determined,

222
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:50,830
I'm willing to help you here.

223
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:57,910
Though we have met 
for a couple of times,

224
00:11:58,430 --> 00:11:59,710
you and I are just acquaintances.

225
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:01,390
Tong, why would you

226
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,830
care so much about my vocation?

227
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:06,710
I'm not sure if you're looking for

228
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:08,670
trouble or profits?

229
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:13,950
I'm just a merchant.

230
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:15,270
Where there is a profit,

231
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:17,870
there is me.

232
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:20,980
If you can make it to the throne,

233
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:23,230
I will be able to benefit

234
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:24,990
as your chief advisor.

235
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:27,550
Please allow me

236
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,470
to support you.

237
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:36,870
Adviser?

238
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,550
Do you think you can shoulder this responsibility?

239
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:44,390
Let's wait and see.

240
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,030
Wasn't I sent here to suffer?

241
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:03,420
And these...?

242
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,790
I'm the Director of the mines.

243
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:06,580
Director Li.

244
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,710
Sorry for the shabby treatment.

245
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:11,070
The miner gets treated so well now?

246
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,030
I wouldn't have been so reluctant if I had known this.

247
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:15,870
May I ask

248
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,030
what are the four pillars of your destiny?

249
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:21,350
Why do you need that for mining?

250
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:23,510
We take this as a rule.

251
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:26,070
Rigorous.

252
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:33,460
Here.

253
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:34,830
That's my date of birth.

254
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:36,430
As for the four pillars of destiny,

255
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:37,510
you can do the calculations based on that.

256
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:38,150
Sure.

257
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:43,830
April 30th, when the rooster crowed.

258
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:49,310
Miss Si, rest assured.

259
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:50,150
You can think of this place

260
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:51,540
as your home away from home.

261
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:53,670
Thank you, Director Li.

262
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:54,990
You should...

263
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:55,790
Have some more.

264
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:56,870
These...

265
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,430
are all prepared for you.

266
00:13:58,430 --> 00:13:59,510
I'm good.

267
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:02,630
You made it sound

268
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:04,430
as if this is my last meal.

269
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:06,550
Miss Si, come here, please.

270
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:07,190
Okay.

271
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:35,230
Who are you guys?

272
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:36,350
Let me go!

273
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:38,790
Why do you kidnap me?

274
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:41,830
What do you want?

275
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:43,150
Let me go!

276
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:44,950
Behave!

277
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,390
I was asked by the First Lady

278
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:49,430
to show you some disciplines.

279
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,510
I've found a nice place for you

280
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:53,470
that saves you the trouble of mining.

281
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:55,420
The First Lady ordered you to teach me
 about manners.

282
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:56,550
It doesn't mean that you could abuse me.

283
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:58,110
Let me go!

284
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:00,150
Or I am gonna mess up your face!

285
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:01,750
Be aware of where you are at now.

286
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,070
Such disrespectful words 
will lead you to no good.

287
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:11,870
Leave her face alone.

288
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:13,470
Otherwise,

289
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:14,710
it may take some explaining.

290
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:19,550
Stop.

291
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:25,590
Director Li,

292
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:27,950
I've found the girl you wanted.

293
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:29,460
She was indeed good-looking

294
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,950
and could be a match for your Yunmu.

295
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:33,220
So,

296
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:34,950
what do you say this time?

297
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:36,110
Director Li,

298
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:37,750
please don't lie to me.

299
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:38,950
Our Yunmu

300
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:40,670
is just an errand boy at the accountant's.

301
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:43,150
Why would he be at the mines on that day?

302
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:45,110
He was accused of stealing mica crystals.

303
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:47,150
Yunmu would never do things like that.

304
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:48,580
How can you prove that?

305
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:50,230
The collapse of the mine

306
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:52,590
buried more than ten miners.

307
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:54,460
Only Yunmu's body was found

308
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:56,470
with mica crystals on him.

309
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:58,830
Can you explain it to me?

310
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:01,070
Give me the mica crystals

311
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:02,710
and you can take his body back.

312
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:04,990
If you keep stalling,

313
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,350
Yunmu will not be able to rest in peace

314
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,070
in the beyond.

315
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:23,390
Go to the posting station outside the city.

316
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:50,070
Go away!

317
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:51,590
Please, calm down!

318
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:52,310
Miss!

319
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:53,350
I work for the East Mansion.

320
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:54,830
If you do anything to me,

321
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:55,990
you will all be killed!

322
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:56,990
Go away! You hear me?

323
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,380
Let go of me!

324
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:05,430
So what if you work for the East Mansion?

325
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:07,109
Even if you work for the Emperor,

326
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:08,589
you'll still have to marry Yunmu today.

327
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:19,430
Let go of me!

328
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:50,070
Si Yan,

329
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:51,500
it's me.

330
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:53,870
Your Highness.

331
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:00,740
Are you alright?

332
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:05,270
Yes, I am fine.

333
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:07,310
Thank you, Your Highness.

334
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:09,110
Si Yan,

335
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:11,030
go back with me.

336
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:14,510
Sorry, Your Highness,

337
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:16,430
but I don't want to drag you down.

338
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:17,870
I'll do anything for you

339
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:20,790
because I like you.

340
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:26,070
I'm afraid that If I don't tell you now,

341
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:28,630
you'll run away from me

342
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:31,190
as you did at the Lantern Festival.

343
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:34,590
Last time...

344
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:36,460
I am sorry.

345
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:41,830
Is it because of Brother Yi?

346
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:45,700
He's got nothing to do with this.

347
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:46,750
Why is it, then?

348
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:49,750
Si Yan,

349
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,710
although we've not known each other for long,

350
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:54,230
I'm sure you're the one I've been looking for.

351
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:55,630
No matter what obstacles await,

352
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:56,590
I don't want to give up on you.

353
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:59,710
Can't you feel my love for you?

354
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,230
Your Highness,

355
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:06,590
I know you have feelings for me,

356
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:08,470
but have you ever thought about

357
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:10,700
why you have those feelings?

358
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,070
What do you like about me?

359
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:13,270
Of course, I've thought about it.

360
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:14,670
I like you!

361
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:15,340
I like that...

362
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:20,990
I like that you're kind.

363
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,430
But I am not kind at all.

364
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:25,870
I like that you're tender.

365
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:28,230
But I am not tender.

366
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:29,630
I like that you're interesting.

367
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,270
You have to admit that!

368
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:33,510
But I am like that to all the people,

369
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:35,030
not just you.

370
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:37,150
But in my mind,

371
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:38,110
you're only kind, tender,

372
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,910
and interesting to me.

373
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:41,630
That was not the real me.

374
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:43,630
I don't know how to explain this to you.

375
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:45,390
Who was it then, if not you?

376
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:47,350
Fine.

377
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:49,430
Even though you've denied all this

378
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:50,710
and don't think for yourself,

379
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:55,670
you should at least think about Brother Yi.

380
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:57,550
Are you

381
00:19:58,390 --> 00:19:59,350
not worried about him at all?

382
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,710
How is Prince Yi doing?

383
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:15,470
The poison has been removed from his body.

384
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:18,350
But he's not fully recovered yet.

385
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:22,510
Si Yan,

386
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:25,190
I know that

387
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:27,310
if it were Brother Qi here to ask you,

388
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,510
you'd go with him in a heartbeat.

389
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:31,820
But he's now in a coma.

390
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:35,830
I want to meet Prince Yi.

391
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,150
Thank you,

392
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:53,030
Your...

393
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:57,750
Qi Bao,

394
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:02,670
for being my friend.

395
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:09,110
Wait for me here.

396
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:12,270
I'll bring the horse.

397
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:58,180
Your Highness,

398
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,030
let's go.

399
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:20,270
Brother Yi.

400
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:30,830
Why can't it

401
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:34,590
be me?

402
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:14,150
Do you think I am selfish?

403
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:15,950
Especially now.

404
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:18,510
I know that

405
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:22,150
I should stop thinking about Qi Yi

406
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,430
and move on

407
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:26,030
as planned in the game.

408
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:27,550
But...

409
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,190
But you're not him.

410
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:37,830
The moon is magnificent.

411
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:39,150
Such a bright full moon!

412
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,030
Thank you, Your Highness.

413
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:58,390
I'll go and find Qi Yi myself.

414
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:09,870
Your Highness,

415
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:11,310
you've still got poison in your body.

416
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:12,510
You can't move.

417
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:14,590
Don't put your life at risk!

418
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:47,870
Qi Yi,

419
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:50,670
are you alright?

420
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:54,350
Maybe Wang is right.

421
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:58,830
Maybe I am bad luck to you.

422
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:02,510
Once.

423
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:04,390
Twice.

424
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:06,190
Three times...

425
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:12,270
It was because of me that you've become like this.

426
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:15,950
Qi Yi,

427
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,830
the only thing I can do right now

428
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:26,590
is stay away from you.

429
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,590
I shall stay as far away as possible.

430
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:38,870
To be honest,

431
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:43,950
I am not used to

432
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:46,950
who I've become.

433
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:49,590
The old me

434
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:52,260
was fearless.

435
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,390
I cared about nothing.

436
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,430
But after I met Lan Miao,

437
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:02,190
Lady Liao,

438
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:04,590
Prince Bao,

439
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,470
Tangier,

440
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:08,470
and you,

441
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:10,430
and especially you,

442
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:13,350
I learned to care

443
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:15,230
and worry about others.

444
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:17,830
Qi Yi, do you know?

445
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:21,670
I am really afraid.

446
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:25,070
I got you in danger.

447
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:27,550
I'm afraid that your family
 would see you as an enemy.

448
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:29,220
I'm more afraid that...

449
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:35,510
I'm more afraid that...

450
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:39,190
I don't know how I should face you.

451
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:50,910
I don't want you to become a casualty
 of me winning the game.

452
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:55,060
Right now,

453
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:58,660
you are not a random guy to me.

454
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:09,190
Farewell,

455
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:12,030
Qi Yi.

456
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:11,780
Don't apologize!

457
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:16,950
Don't say you'll leave.

458
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:19,990
I gotta go.

459
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:33,510
Stay here,

460
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:37,110
even just for a little while.

461
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:44,140
Your Highness,

462
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:47,500
the First Lady is here.

463
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,550
I really need to go.

464
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:53,510
Go and find Qi Bao.

465
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:56,790
Ask him to take you somewhere safe.

466
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:01,270
I still have some unfinished business.

467
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:04,230
Your Highness, take care.

468
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:07,310
Don't come looking for me anymore.

469
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:34,230
Have you decided not to stay by his side?

470
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:42,630
Me staying

471
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:46,270
will only bring him more danger.

472
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:50,030
I don't believe that

473
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:51,910
only one of us can survive the game.

474
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:55,150
But the system is customized for you.

475
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:56,910
Every level in the game

476
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:58,430
has its meaning.

477
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:00,910
But does it mean it's the right thing for me?

478
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:03,630
The calculations in the system

479
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:05,630
are always right.

480
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:08,070
The system has all of your personal data.

481
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:09,630
Besides,

482
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:11,390
every task exists

483
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:12,470
to help you

484
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:14,230
wake up in the real world.

485
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:16,310
What choice do you have?

486
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:18,030
How can you ever run away?

487
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:20,270
For you,

488
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:21,390
you need to choose

489
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:22,430
between Qi Yi and waking up.

490
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:37,390
Choices are for kids.

491
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:39,950
What do you mean?

492
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:43,670
I don't believe there's only one right choice.

493
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:46,670
Maybe I can find whoever's running the game

494
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:48,510
and find a way to save Qi Yi.

495
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:50,270
The man in black

496
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:51,870
and the courtesan with dandelion makeup

497
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:52,750
must be connected in some way.

498
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:53,430
I will figure it out!

499
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:55,390
Where are you going?

500
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:57,830
I'm going to find the blood mica.

501
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:00,670
Director Li looks suspicious to me.

502
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:02,430
Who knows if he's one of the hidden tasks

503
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:03,660
designed in the system?

504
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:20,550
Qi Yi,

505
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:21,710
trust me.

506
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:23,230
I will find a way

507
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:24,270
to change our destiny.

508
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:42,430
Your Highness, you've not fully recovered yet.

509
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:44,350
Do you want to meet His Majesty now?

510
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:46,470
People involved in the case

511
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:47,910
are either dead

512
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:48,790
or have run away.

513
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:49,950
It's so strange.

514
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:51,670
If I don't come,

515
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:53,270
things might go wrong

516
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:54,150
and innocent people might be wronged.

517
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:56,550
You just want to

518
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:58,150
help Si Yan clear her name, right?

519
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:00,910
What do you know?

520
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:11,710
His Majesty is here.

521
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:25,430
Father.

522
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:26,310
Your Majesty.

523
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:27,150
Qi Yi, my son,

524
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:28,870
what are you doing here?

525
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:31,390
Are you feeling better?

526
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:33,190
Sorry to keep you worried, father.

527
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:34,750
I am almost recovered.

528
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:40,550
I ask you here today

529
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:43,670
so that we can find out
 the identity of the assassin.

530
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:45,470
You can all speak your mind.

531
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:48,830
Da,

532
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:50,550
your top priority now

533
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:52,700
is to find the assassin before anyone.

534
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:54,470
Although we've found

535
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:56,110
the female corpse,

536
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:58,070
We still have to be patient.

537
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:00,870
We need to pay attention to

538
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:02,470
what other princes have to say.

539
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:04,110
When the time comes,

540
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:06,230
we will give them the lead.

541
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:11,670
Father,

542
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:14,110
I've been tipped off that

543
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:16,870
the assassin was a spy in the Northland.

544
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:18,550
I asked people to carry out an investigation.

545
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:19,950
We found a handkerchief,

546
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:21,790
which led us to a servant

547
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:23,310
in the Mansion called Qing Yan.

548
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:24,830
The attack on Mother

549
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:25,750
days ago

550
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:27,380
might have something to do with him.

551
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:30,830
In that case,

552
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:32,470
they were in cahoots

553
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:33,670
and all related

554
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:34,990
to the Northland?

555
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:36,670
I dare not make assumptions.

556
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:38,670
But the weapon that hurt me was poisoned.

557
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:40,910
Based on my knowledge of the Northlanders,

558
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:42,430
they loathe the use of poison

559
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:44,310
and think of it as a disgrace.

560
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:45,630
Based on this,

561
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:47,630
it doesn't look like the Northlanders' doing.

562
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:48,830
You ruled out the possibility

563
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:50,230
of spies from the Northland because of that?

564
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:52,550
Brother Yi, aren't you being too arbitrary?

565
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:54,830
Father,

566
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:57,150
the assassins we caught all committed suicide.

567
00:33:57,150 --> 00:33:59,230
I am sure that they are hitmen of the Northland.

568
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:00,750
Besides,

569
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:03,300
there was enmity between Qi Yi
 and the King of Northland.

570
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,150
Qi Xiu,

571
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:14,070
who do you think these people are?

572
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:15,590
Me?

573
00:34:16,949 --> 00:34:17,870
I have no idea.

574
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:24,870
I heard that the assassin held a maid hostage

575
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:25,710
to blackmail brother Yi.

576
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:27,590
Maybe she knows something.

577
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:29,909
Right, brother Yi?

578
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:31,230
Maybe you can ask her.

579
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:32,100
Nonsense!

580
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:34,750
Qi Yi is injured.

581
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:36,469
How could you have him do that?

582
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:37,830
Well.

583
00:34:39,219 --> 00:34:40,230
You shall investigate this

584
00:34:40,699 --> 00:34:41,550
on Qi Yi's behalf.

585
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:43,670
Father, I don't think I can do it.

586
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:44,469
It's such a huge responsibility.

587
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:45,510
Besides, that place...

588
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:45,989
Father,

589
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:48,190
I need to tell you another thing.

590
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,350
A female corpse was found in Hunyong River,

591
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:52,550
with a similar dress and figure as the assassin.

592
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:54,989
Please, allow me to inspect it on site.

593
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:56,750
Okay.

594
00:34:57,390 --> 00:34:58,870
Be quick.

595
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:00,790
Make sure to find the truth

596
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:03,230
and give Qi Yi an explanation.

597
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:04,510
I will, father.

598
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:23,790
Yun Li.

599
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:25,660
Have you found the secret recipe
 of the heartbreak grass?

600
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:27,910
Remember that you need to
 avenge your father's death.

601
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:32,590
Your Highness, have some rest.

602
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:56,780
Let's say

603
00:35:57,350 --> 00:35:58,750
the assassins are not from the Northland,

604
00:35:58,750 --> 00:35:59,910
like Qi Yi said,

605
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,030
who would they be?

606
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:03,670
If they're not outsiders,

607
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:04,910
then they should be one of us.

608
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:09,830
Do you know something?

609
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:12,190
I was just taking a guess.

610
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:13,670
Please be safe.

611
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:18,270
So, Yun Li, you need to stay by my side

612
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:20,070
and protect me.

613
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:25,510
Where are you going?

614
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:26,790
Don't you want to know

615
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:28,150
how Qi Yi begged me just now?

616
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:08,190
Where is the blood mica?

617
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:38,230
This should be it.

618
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:48,750
A hidden compartment!

619
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:01,350
A ledger.

620
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,590
A letter of blood.

621
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:22,070
So, Yunmu, the miner,

622
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:23,110
had known for a long time

623
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:24,790
about Director Li smuggling blood micas.

624
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:27,030
To cover up the truth,

625
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:29,940
Director Li even destroyed the mine

626
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,030
to kill those people.

627
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:32,430
How evil!

628
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:41,070
Since you've known everything,

629
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:42,750
you can't stay alive!

630
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:21,870
The evidence is right here.

631
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:26,150
Since you love blood micas that much,

632
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:28,310
you can dig for them for the rest of your life.

633
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:31,070
Yun Li,

634
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:31,910
take him outside.

635
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:33,270
Your Highness, have mercy.

636
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:34,550
Please have mercy!

637
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:50,110
Your Highness,

638
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:54,390
thank you for saving me back then.

639
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:56,510
However...

640
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:58,180
Did Prince Bao

641
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:00,510
or Prince Yi ask you to come here?

642
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:03,190
Both Prince Bao

643
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:04,630
and Prince Yi

644
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:06,820
are smitten with you.

645
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,510
Who sent you here?

646
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:13,110
Me?

647
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:15,070
Why were you on the parade carriage that night?

648
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:17,940
It was an accident.

649
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:19,620
Why did Luna abduct you of all people?

650
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:21,670
It was a coincidence.

651
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:22,830
What does Luna look like?

652
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:25,390
She's got a burn scar on her face.

653
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:28,590
She painted a dandelion leaf to hide it.

654
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:32,150
Your Highness,

655
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:34,710
don't you think it's inappropriate
 to sit by a maid's bed

656
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:35,950
and ask all these questions?

657
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:45,510
I was almost choked to death.

658
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:46,790
I couldn't recall anything.

659
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:48,310
Your Highness, don't ask me anything!

660
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:52,150
Okay.

661
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:54,630
A pattern of the dandelion leaf...

662
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:55,990
That's enough.

663
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:58,070
I'm not interested in getting involved
 in your drama.

664
00:40:58,700 --> 00:40:59,230
By the way,

665
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:01,310
Qi Yi asked me

666
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:02,670
to tell you something.

667
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:08,790
What?

668
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:12,870
He said that

669
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:15,790
he'll wait for you to come back

670
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:19,270
and enjoy the bright full moon with him.

671
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:46,470
The moon is magnificent.

672
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:47,550
Such a bright full moon!

673
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:06,630
I found this on Director Li.

674
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:11,950
Xue Yunmu?

675
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:13,390
Director Li said that

676
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:14,910
the man who died was called Xue Yunmu.

677
00:42:15,390 --> 00:42:16,710
Xue Yunmu?

678
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:18,140
It's the romanization of blood micas.

679
00:42:18,990 --> 00:42:19,990
Is it a pun

680
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:21,350
designed by the system?

681
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:30,430
Well,

682
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:31,750
it's late.

683
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:33,670
Come back with me tomorrow.

684
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:35,590
If I don't take care of you,

685
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:37,270
Qi Yi and Qi Bao

686
00:42:37,870 --> 00:42:38,630
will not let me off easily.

687
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:50,590
This is yours.

688
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:56,870
Why do you have it?

689
00:42:57,750 --> 00:42:59,430
I lost it at the Imperial Institute of Medicine
 that night.

690
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:01,310
Were you

691
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:04,870
at the Institute that night, too?

692
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:15,630
Where's Lady Wei's medicine?

693
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:21,030
It's you again.

694
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:45,070
You only need to know that

695
00:43:45,310 --> 00:43:46,110
I am not your enemy.

696
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:47,710
Don't ask

697
00:43:48,070 --> 00:43:48,630
other questions.

698
00:43:50,590 --> 00:43:51,510
I see.

699
00:43:52,270 --> 00:43:53,350
I won't ask anything about you.

700
00:43:53,790 --> 00:43:54,870
You shall do the same.

701
00:43:55,390 --> 00:43:56,310
I want to go to bed.

702
00:44:13,790 --> 00:44:14,430
Master!

703
00:44:17,150 --> 00:44:17,750
Master!

704
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:19,270
I know you still care about me.

705
00:44:28,910 --> 00:44:30,350
You can't do anything

706
00:44:30,910 --> 00:44:32,350
other than make trouble.
