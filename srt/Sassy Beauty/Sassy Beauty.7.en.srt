1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:06,510
The Flower Feast begins now!

3
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:16,020
From the South Jiuzhai, Withered Butterfly.

4
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,670
Blue Fire Lotus.

5
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,870
Good. So beautiful.

6
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:07,030
Ghost Orchid from the Northland.

7
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:26,710
This flower is so common.

8
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,950
How can it have such a scary name?

9
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,790
It is named after its shape.

10
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:36,990
In the breeze, these white flowers

11
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:38,620
looks like ghosts.

12
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,550
Therefore, it is also known as Ghost Orchid.

13
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:42,950
The smell

14
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:44,590
is really refreshing!

15
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:46,110
Young lady,

16
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:48,030
I didn't expect you to be so knowledgeable.

17
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:49,340
When I was little,

18
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,750
I used to live in the Northland.

19
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:53,430
Naturally, I know some interesting stories.

20
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:55,070
I've heard that

21
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:57,310
the Northland is known for its poison,

22
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,190
and people there all know some psychic magic.

23
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,870
Since you once lived in the Northland,

24
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:01,950
I'm sure you must have acquired

25
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,150
some rare skills or magic, right?

26
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,270
In my early years,

27
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:07,550
I once met a Zen master by chance

28
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:08,870
and learned some psychic magic from him.

29
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:12,310
If a living person pine for a deceased one,

30
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:15,310
a drop of blood can turn into a spell.

31
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:17,060
Then the two people can meet.

32
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:20,430
It's just a small skill.

33
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,910
If you are interested,

34
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:22,870
you can give it a try.

35
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:24,310
Then can I meet

36
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,510
my sister who passed away

37
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:26,510
many years ago?

38
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:29,750
The magic

39
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:31,830
can only be applied to people
who are destined for it.

40
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:34,710
Not everyone can sense the spirit body.

41
00:04:34,909 --> 00:04:36,550
The spoon handle will point at a person.

42
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:38,590
Then that person will be the destined one.

43
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,350
Then give it a try!

44
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,510
I must be the one who has the destiny.

45
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:43,510
Your Majesty,

46
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,750
I am not feeling well.

47
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:48,030
I'd like to go back to my tent
and rest for a while.

48
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:50,270
When the Makeup Contest starts,

49
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,190
I will come to see Your Majesty

50
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,550
and all other ladies.

51
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:58,230
Go rest first.

52
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:00,470
Yes.

53
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:20,910
Mother, are you okay?

54
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,310
Nothing serious.

55
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,190
Is the rash on your skin

56
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,230
all healed?

57
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:36,470
That the rash can be cured
before the Flower Feast

58
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,190
is really a blessing.

59
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:41,190
Yi,

60
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,070
you are the legitimate prince.

61
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:45,670
Always remember who you are.

62
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:50,670
So many pairs of eyes are staring at you here.

63
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,550
You must be extra careful.

64
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:57,030
We can't let schemers know your weakness.

65
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:58,390
You're right, mother.

66
00:06:59,070 --> 00:06:59,909
I'll bear that in mind.

67
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:02,070
Just now, you...

68
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:04,270
Nothing.

69
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:06,070
I'm just tired.

70
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,150
Go now.

71
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:09,270
You should grasp the opportunity

72
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:12,270
and spend more time with Miss Min.

73
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:16,750
Mrs. Huang.

74
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:17,710
Yes.

75
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,030
Go ask

76
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:20,870
what kind of flowers

77
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:22,510
Miss Min likes?

78
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:23,470
Yes.

79
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:25,030
Balsamina.

80
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:28,670
Go ahead.

81
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:30,870
Yes, Your Highness.

82
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,440
The theme of this year's

83
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,920
Makeup Contest is Flower.

84
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,600
The time limit for the makeup
and style of the First Lady

85
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,880
is two hours.

86
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,440
If you don't finish,

87
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,640
your work will not be presented.

88
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,600
Yes.

89
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:52,200
What is the Makeup Contest?

90
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,440
This is the main event of the Flower Feast.

91
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:56,640
The maids will design a makeup look
for the First Lady.

92
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,960
Winners

93
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,240
will have the chance to be promoted to officers.

94
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,210
How could I not know such good news?

95
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,600
I want to participate too.

96
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:10,880
Hey.

97
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,880
How can people like you

98
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,400
participate in the Makeup Contest?

99
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,400
Only the maids in the Palace Makeup Service
are qualified to participate.

100
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,040
This little piece of cake

101
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,240
doesn't match my talent.

102
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,600
In my opinion,

103
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,480
someone is obviously jealous.

104
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,200
I forgot.

105
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,120
At that time,
princes will attend the contest.

106
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,330
Since you're so capable,

107
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,840
how about

108
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,690
you ask princes for some help?

109
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:38,400
You!

110
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,400
Greetings, Prince Yi.

111
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,320
Do you want to participate in the contest?

112
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,120
I didn't even know

113
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,530
the rules have been changed.

114
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:57,650
Now participation in the contest
even needs a prince to ask.

115
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,560
Since I'm here,

116
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,210
can she participate?

117
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,480
Please forgive me, Prince Yi.

118
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,160
I was just making a little joke with Si Yan.

119
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,960
Thank you, Prince Yi.

120
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,040
If you hadn't told me,

121
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,280
I would almost have forgotten that
I could ask a prince for help.

122
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,280
Now you see.

123
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,200
I hadn't asked him yet,

124
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,880
and he came to help me.

125
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:29,920
I think

126
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,760
for some people,

127
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,400
she will never have this opportunity
in her life.

128
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:34,210
See you at the Palace Makeup Service.

129
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,440
Wait a sec, Prince Yi.

130
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,280
What's wrong again?

131
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,400
Just now, thank you!

132
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,280
Don't overthink.

133
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,320
I agree that you can participate in the contest,

134
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,280
just because I want you to enter the service
as soon as possible.

135
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,730
So that you can continue the espionage for me.

136
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:00,440
I knew it.

137
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:02,400
Since you want me to win,

138
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,610
then you can give me more help!

139
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:04,840
For example,

140
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,560
what kind of makeup or outfits
does the First Lady like?

141
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,080
Or what color does she like?

142
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,280
Don't push your luck.

143
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,650
I'll push my luck.

144
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,080
Hey!

145
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,320
Si Yan.

146
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,120
What are you doing?

147
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:43,600
Si Yan?

148
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:44,760
Si Yan?

149
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:46,960
Are you okay?

150
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:49,960
I'm okay. I'm okay.

151
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,080
I'm looking for inspiration.

152
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,400
I still don't have a clue yet.

153
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,600
Just because of this?

154
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,440
Easy.

155
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,360
You wait for me here.

156
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,880
Hey, where are you going?

157
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,560
I heard that the one called Hu Ying

158
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,200
is the front-running winner of this contest.

159
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,240
I quietly copied her design.

160
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,760
Take a closer look.

161
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,600
Have a plan for yourself.

162
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,360
That's not good.

163
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,240
I was just wondering.

164
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,480
what the First Lady liked.

165
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,240
I want to win by myself.

166
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,680
But since Your Highness tried so hard
to copy that for me,

167
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,200
then I will...

168
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,520
What are you doing?

169
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,170
Sorry, Si Yan.

170
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,080
I didn't mean to do it.

171
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,680
I just wanted to help you.

172
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,200
You're right.

173
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,200
Trust yourself.

174
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,240
You can definitely win.

175
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:56,720
Yes.

176
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,040
Your Highness is right.

177
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,890
Then I'll leave the time to you.

178
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,040
I believe in you.

179
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,920
Thank you.

180
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,330
Si Yan?

181
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,080
Si Yan?

182
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,560
Are you alright?

183
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,240
I'm fine.

184
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:40,520
Don't move.

185
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:00,000
Your Highness.

186
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,720
Wait, Mrs. Huang.

187
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,760
Something's wrong, Your Highness?

188
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:06,650
What kind of makeup look

189
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:07,760
does my mother like?

190
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,360
Peach blossom.

191
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,370
I'm sure I can win now.

192
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:40,960
Si Yan.

193
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:43,010
I want to tell you

194
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:44,920
I really like...

195
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:45,760
Thank you.

196
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,440
I... I'll go first.

197
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:02,000
Brother.

198
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,080
I'll go first.

199
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:16,360
Why are you here?

200
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,120
Is winning that important to you?

201
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,960
What are you doing? So strange.

202
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,560
What do you mean "that important"?

203
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,200
If that's not important,
why should I bother to participate?

204
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,010
I think that's not your real intention.

205
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,600
There are so many people

206
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,560
who offer to help you.

207
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,520
Brother Yi, where are you?

208
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:45,720
Hey!

209
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:47,560
Why do you drag me to hide?

210
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,250
Brother Yi.

211
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,760
I finally find you!

212
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:58,960
Miss Min.

213
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,360
Sit, please.

214
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,200
Even if you are afraid that
Miss Min might misunderstand,

215
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,480
you don't have to drag me so hard.

216
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,880
I'm wearing the balsamina

217
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,090
you gave me on my head.

218
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:41,760
Does it look good?

219
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,080
Brother Yi,

220
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,480
why did you suddenly

221
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,800
send me balsamina?

222
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,930
He certainly knows how to please girls.

223
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:51,080
He even sent flowers.

224
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,880
She is attired in redolent red and tender green
during her efflorescence,

225
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,600
while the chilly butterflies and hungry bees
are both unaware of her presence.

226
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,280
Who wrote this poem?

227
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,680
It's so beautiful.

228
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,560
It's written by my brother, Prince Teng.

229
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:08,120
Don't you remember, Miss Min?

230
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:14,800
It has been too long.

231
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,720
I forget that.

232
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,890
Brother Yi.

233
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:23,400
Let's go play with Prince Bao.

234
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,720
Bao, again.

235
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,760
He even flirts with bees.

236
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,440
Brother Yi.

237
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,800
Are you talking about me?

238
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,440
Goodbye.

239
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,050
It's beautiful.

240
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:20,160
Yours is not bad either.

241
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,520
Hand in your test papers.

242
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:27,650
What now?

243
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,570
If you are afraid of being embarrassed,

244
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:32,000
it's not too late to admit your defeat.

245
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,120
Hand it over.

246
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,320
There won't be any problems.

247
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,880
Don't forget

248
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,810
you are the beauty blogger
with millions of followers.

249
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,960
That's easy to say.

250
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,160
But what if they don't like this?

251
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,330
I believe in you.

252
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:00,280
Any more?

253
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,920
Playing the mystery card.

254
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,920
I'd like to see

255
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,440
how you will lose completely.

256
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:35,880
Let's go.

257
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,000
Begonia before Rain makeup look.

258
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,280
This design

259
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,280
suits old ladies,

260
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,170
not the First Lady.

261
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,840
April Blossom makeup look.

262
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,280
Too messy.

263
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,720
And the colors

264
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,640
are somewhat weird.

265
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,040
Sunlight Lotus makeup look.

266
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,600
Not elegant enough.

267
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,920
It can't reflect Your Highness's majesty.

268
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:29,320
Night Mist makeup look.

269
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,930
The colors are too vibrant.

270
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:34,600
Not suitable.

271
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,400
What's wrong with it?

272
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,280
Do you think

273
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,120
her Highness is too old for this?

274
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,930
I don't mean that!

275
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:44,920
Lady Qian, please don't misinterpret
my good intentions.

276
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,280
Fine. Enough.

277
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,400
Today is to choose
makeup looks for the First Lady.

278
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,040
You two are arguing instead.

279
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:52,800
So annoying.

280
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,600
Smoky Sunset makeup look.

281
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,480
The smoke hangs straight on the desert vast.

282
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,320
The sun sits round on the endless stream.

283
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,880
A makeup look

284
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,600
could be so poetic.

285
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,880
Not bad. Not bad.

286
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,480
Yes.

287
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,170
It's rare that a look

288
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,520
could be so romantic.

289
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,640
The makeup is thin

290
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:34,250
just enough to bring out
Your Highness's beautiful features

291
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:36,280
and enhance Your Highness's
majesty and elegance.

292
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,650
It does meet the needs of Your Highness.

293
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,440
Who designed this makeup?

294
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,920
Your Majesty, Your Highness.

295
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,000
I'm a maid who just joined
the Palace Makeup Service,

296
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,800
Hu Ying.

297
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,160
Nice.

298
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,800
This year, the service

299
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,440
has selected some good maids,

300
00:20:58,010 --> 00:20:59,250
much better than those of previous years.

301
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:01,160
Are there any others?

302
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,680
This is the last one.

303
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:07,560
How can that be?

304
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,440
This is not a makeup look.

305
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,000
This is clearly cheating.

306
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:22,920
Yeah.

307
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,930
How dare you use this method
to make a spectacle of yourself?

308
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,760
What a laugh!

309
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,320
The makeup look I designed

310
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,680
is called Peach Blossom in Dreams.

311
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,730
Although my sketch

312
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:48,080
doesn't meet traditional standards.

313
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,090
But in the contest, there is no rule that

314
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:51,520
you can't do makeup on a real person.

315
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,450
Sometimes makeup design

316
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:54,930
can be as gorgeous as possible.

317
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,760
But I focus more on its practicality.

318
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,080
So I take this approach.

319
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:01,560
The approach won't make my design

320
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,880
become a castle in the air,

321
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,680
looking good but useless.

322
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,960
This Peach Blossom look is good,

323
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,840
but it's not special enough.

324
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:15,680
It's too conventional.

325
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,050
It's as dull as you are.

326
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,130
Well...

327
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:29,200
Shall we try this?

328
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,010
Hi, Chestnuts is back.

329
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:40,200
This is my newly designed
Peach Blossom makeup look.

330
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,240
You see.

331
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,800
Is it very beautiful and special?

332
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,090
I believe

333
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:45,370
you must be interested in

334
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,250
how to do this Peach Blossom makeup look.

335
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,240
So I'm here today

336
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,320
to share with you

337
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,800
how to recreate this makeup look.

338
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,610
It's me who designed

339
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:56,000
this makeup look.

340
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,480
Why did Si Yan say she designed it?

341
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,680
Didn't you read your job description?

342
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:03,520
We recruited a makeup artist.

343
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,330
If you don't want to work here,

344
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:06,520
you can leave at any time.

345
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,760
These two designs

346
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,320
are excellent.

347
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,160
It's hard to decide

348
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,240
who the winner is.

349
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,880
Since the makeup looks are
designed for Your Highness,

350
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,600
then Your Highness,

351
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,960
you can choose who wins.

352
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,480
That makeup just now

353
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,480
is nearly perfect,

354
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,680
but it's a little boring.

355
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,640
On the contrary, this one,

356
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,840
although the painting technique is common,

357
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,200
the look is very innovative and refreshing.

358
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,680
If I want to customize my makeup look,

359
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,320
I would prefer to try this one.

360
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:23,400
Take a look.

361
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,720
You can take

362
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,200
whatever you like.

363
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,160
They are your rewards.

364
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,520
None of these

365
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,520
is what I want.

366
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,730
So what reward do you want?

367
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,000
My lady,

368
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,570
if I may,

369
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,960
I want to ask to

370
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,320
work in the Palace Makeup Service.

371
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:46,880
Wait a minute.

372
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,360
Your Majesty,

373
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:53,720
Your Highness,

374
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,880
the maid of mine

375
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,770
is also good at makeup products and looks.

376
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,160
How about

377
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,720
letting her have a competition with Si Yan?

378
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,440
Is it possible?

379
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,890
Who did I piss off?

380
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,560
She doesn't look easy to be messed with.

381
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,480
The theme of the competition is

382
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,840
Makeup Makeover.

383
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,840
Now your makeup techniques

384
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:39,840
and the ability to innovate matter the most.

385
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,440
Whoever can make the contrast
between before and after makeup greater

386
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,560
will be the winner.

387
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:48,480
Yes.

388
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,360
Yes.

389
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,920
You only have two hours.

390
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:04,080
My lady,

391
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,480
what kind of makeup
are you going to do on me this time?

392
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,240
Who dares to comment on your makeup look?

393
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,800
Now is the time to see my real ability.

394
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,640
It's time.

395
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,200
The makeup look seems so familiar.

396
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,400
The colors used are carefully picked.

397
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:42,040
It's bold and chic.

398
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,360
Miss Min,

399
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,800
your maid

400
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,160
is very talented.

401
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,640
Is she Tangier,

402
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:53,480
the maid who picks up garbage in my courtyard?

403
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:55,560
There is no point in seeing the other one.

404
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:57,090
I think

405
00:28:57,090 --> 00:28:59,800
Miss Min's maid is sure to win.

406
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,840
Next one.

407
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,370
The eye makeup is charming and delicate.

408
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,800
The lip looks chic.

409
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,200
Two parts correspond with each other,

410
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,440
making a woman more alluring.

411
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,280
Even I

412
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,200
can't help but be attracted by that.

413
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,280
She is your maid.

414
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,130
Surely you will like that.

415
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,120
You!

416
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,400
Brother Yi,

417
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,040
is Si Yan going to lose?

418
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,920
She is not as skilled as the other one.

419
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,400
Who can she blame?

420
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:49,560
That's not necessarily true.

421
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,320
Your Majesty, Your Highness.

422
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,200
Your Majesty, Your Highness.

423
00:29:57,810 --> 00:29:58,960
That is a man.

424
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,160
In terms of techniques, I'm sure to lose.

425
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,080
I have to do something unusual.

426
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,160
Interesting. How interesting.

427
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,600
I can't believe she can

428
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,800
make a man look like a woman.

429
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,720
How wonderful!

430
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,320
Wonderful!

431
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:40,800
My dear,

432
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,200
these two,

433
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,600
one is bold,

434
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,690
the other alluring.

435
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:47,120
Which one do you like?

436
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,200
Makeup Makeover is the theme of the competition.

437
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:54,400
Tangier's makeup is better.

438
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,050
Yun Li's transformation

439
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,040
is breathtaking.

440
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,520
The two have their own focus.

441
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,960
It is really difficult to choose.

442
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,280
I know what you mean, dear.

443
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:05,290
Then the competition

444
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,560
ends in a draw.

445
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,280
Ending in a draw?

446
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,040
Reward them.

447
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:18,880
My lady,

448
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,480
I want to...

449
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,280
Your Highness,

450
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,920
Si Yan wants to enter the Palace Makeup Service.

451
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,890
I think

452
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,330
that's a good idea.

453
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:30,960
Si Yan,

454
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,370
starting from tomorrow,

455
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,240
you can work in the service.

456
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,080
Work hard and practice yourself there.

457
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,050
The rewards

458
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:38,960
will still be given.

459
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,410
Thank you, Your Highness.

460
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,280
Miss Si Yan,

461
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,920
congratulations on your promotion.

462
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,170
Did you come here just to tell me that?

463
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:13,770
Thank you.

464
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:15,760
I still have something to tell you.

465
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:18,410
What is it?

466
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,600
Why do you look so serious?

467
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,320
That player's mission is
to develop makeup products.

468
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,280
Wang Zhaojun of the Borderlands.

469
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,600
So?

470
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,680
I suspect

471
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:29,160
her mission overlaps with yours.

472
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,880
And she is in the East Mansion.

473
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,120
She is in the East Mansion?

474
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,040
Doesn't that mean she is around me?

475
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,320
My lady!

476
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,360
My lady!

477
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,680
My lady!

478
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:42,960
My lady!

479
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,520
What happened, Your Highness?

480
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,360
My lady.

481
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,960
Wake up, my lady!

482
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:49,960
Mother!

483
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:50,680
My lady.

484
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,520
What's going on?

485
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,200
My lady!

486
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,160
Don't scare me, my lady.

487
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,320
My lady.

488
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,400
My lady!

489
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,850
My lady, wake up!

490
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:15,970
The rein

491
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:17,760
has been tampered with by someone.

492
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,800
Where exactly is the Rosewood Power Box?

493
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:15,000
I investigated the lotus pattern
on the envelope.

494
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,360
I found there's no NPC in the system

495
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,880
that can match the character.

496
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,040
There may be another player here.

497
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,000
The president has arranged a blind date for you.

498
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:22,880
He is 25 years old.

499
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:23,920
Do my makeup now.

500
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,489
Yes.

501
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:54,600
It's a dream.

502
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:57,280
It must be a dream.

503
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:00,800
How can it be her?

504
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,240
This is your badge.

505
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,080
Remember, your badge shows your identity.

506
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:21,720
If you lose it,

507
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,040
you can wait for your punishment.

508
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,440
The Palace Makeup Service.

509
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,640
Through so many difficulties,

510
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,760
I am finally here.

511
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:44,000
I am hardworking, brave, kind and lovely.

512
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,320
The hard times are finally over.

513
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,760
Newcomer.

514
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,520
Go clean up the yard.

515
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,370
And wipe all the

516
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:55,600
tables, chairs and benches.

517
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:56,680
Hey.

518
00:35:56,970 --> 00:35:57,960
Why should I do these?

519
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,120
I now work in the service.

520
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,880
You want to do something big.

521
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,890
But you must also have the ability to do that.

522
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,610
About my ability,

523
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:07,890
you should know the best, right?

524
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:09,240
You loser.

525
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,650
It's just an admission exam.

526
00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:13,330
Look the way you show off.

527
00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:16,040
What is this?

528
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:18,640
These are top-class East China Sea pearls.

529
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,040
Please grind them all into powder.

530
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,120
If the ladies use the powder

531
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,640
and find the powder is not fine enough,

532
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,240
you'll be kicked out of here for sure!

533
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,400
Let's go.

534
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:43,520
Newcomer!

535
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:45,200
Don't you know how to sweep the floor?

536
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,240
Congratulations, Miss Si Yan.

537
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,400
You finally enter the service.

538
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,770
Don't talk nonsense here.

539
00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:00,760
Look what I am doing now.

540
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,360
A free floor sweeper!

541
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,810
Aren't you curious about
the identity of the new player?

542
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,480
Do you have a clue?

543
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,840
I'm sorry.

544
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,320
The back-end database was locked by someone.

545
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,200
Nothing was found.

546
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:46,520
Then give up.

547
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,760
She plays her game.

548
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,600
I play mine.

549
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,000
We don't interfere with each other.

550
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:50,720
Pretty good.

551
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:53,840
You sound like...

552
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,360
Do you already know

553
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,290
the identity of the new player?

554
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,440
I'm just guessing.

555
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,520
I'm not sure.

556
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,920
But the investigation last night

557
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,080
did yield some results.

558
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,560
The only person
that can lock the system database

559
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,960
is a core engineer.

560
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:11,960
His name is Tong Hui.

561
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,880
He studies human brains

562
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,480
and develops the system interface of the game.

563
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:17,880
Presumably,

564
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,600
this new player must have
something to do with him.

565
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,080
Tong Rui.

566
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,840
Tong Hui.

567
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,610
So, did her father develop this game?

568
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,600
That's why my luck is so bad.

569
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,320
I will continue to investigate

570
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,760
the background of Tong Hui.

571
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,960
But I suggest that

572
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,690
if you know the identity of the new player,

573
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,200
you should try to play with her together.

574
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,960
Maybe that will help you pass the game.

575
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:44,920
How can I know
if the new player is a friend or foe?

576
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,680
What if the player is a foe,

577
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,080
or hates me?

578
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:50,360
That's unreasonable.

579
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,480
Why does the other player hate you?

580
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:55,770
Anyway, you don't have to worry about this.

581
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,410
How dare someone hurt the First Lady?

582
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:01,800
That's outrageous!

583
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,520
I have temporarily closed the East Mansion,

584
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,450
deployed more forces

585
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:06,690
and investigated suspects.

586
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,040
Even if we have to dig up the ground,

587
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,760
I need to know who has done this.

588
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,200
Please calm down, Your Majesty.

589
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,770
Now the immediate priority

590
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:18,160
is stabilization.

591
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:18,960
A few days ago,

592
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,640
General Min defeated the Northland army.

593
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,000
Neighboring countries

594
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,090
just got rid of

595
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:24,130
the control of the Northland.

596
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:25,920
In a few days,

597
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,040
they will send envoys here

598
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,130
to express their gratitude.

599
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:31,040
If the public knows
the attack on the First Lady,

600
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,040
people will inevitably panic.

601
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,200
The newly stabilized situation,

602
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,680
I'm afraid, will be broken.

603
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,040
Yi,

604
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,120
take some people

605
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,170
to secretly investigate the attack.

606
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:47,490
Although it is important
to keep the big picture in mind,

607
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,120
we can't let the assassin off.

608
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,120
I understand.

609
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,560
In the past,

610
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,480
I was accompanied by the First Lady
to receive the envoys.

611
00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:00,520
Now since the First Lady is wounded,

612
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:04,440
then the Second Lady will accompany me.

613
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:20,360
Prince Yi.

614
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:28,720
Qing Yan was

615
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,600
a footboy from the Procurement Department.

616
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,320
Ten years ago,
he introduced himself to the department.

617
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:33,890
I heard that his family,

618
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:35,560
once a major textile manufacturer in the South,

619
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:36,800
declined rapidly.

620
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,080
He then wandered to the East Mansion.

621
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,960
Lady Cui, you not only kept Qing Yan's scripts,

622
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,120
but also his portrait.

623
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:46,520
Prince Yi, don't get me wrong.

624
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:47,370
He and I were...

625
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:49,200
I'm not curious about your past.

626
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,720
But the mansion is unsettled.

627
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,960
Does that have something to do with

628
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:58,200
the owner of the handkerchief
and the dandelion on this?

629
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,320
That's why I am here.

630
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,280
I want to hear your answer.

631
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:12,840
Prince Yi, you're right.

632
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,760
I did hide Qing Yan's scripts.

633
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,520
But that's because I like those.

634
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,960
I don't know who he painted.

635
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,410
This handkerchief

636
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:24,640
is indeed from the Palace Makeup Service.

637
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,080
But this dandelion

638
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,240
should be embroidered later.

639
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,160
As for why they are identical,

640
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,040
and what does it mean,

641
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,040
I don't know.

642
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,520
Why did Qing Yan leave later?

643
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,000
Three years after he joined the mansion,

644
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:40,400
he left abruptly.

645
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,360
It seems to have something to do
with the Second Lady.

646
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,840
Due to purchasing errors,

647
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,370
he was asked to leave.

648
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,120
Did he hold a grudge against the Second Lady?

649
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:48,520
In my memory,

650
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,600
he got along well
with the people in the mansion.

651
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:52,680
Holding a grudge?

652
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,600
I don't think so.

653
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,840
If anything pops up in your mind,

654
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,400
remember to report in time.

655
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,360
Wang,

656
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:01,280
keep investigating.

657
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,080
Since now that we know who he is,

658
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,280
I must see him in person

659
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:05,730
or see his corpse.

660
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,240
Yes.

661
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:15,160
Why is my work badge missing?

662
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,440
How can I find it in such a large mansion?

663
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,280
Is it because

664
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,160
I didn't grind the pearls

665
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,320
and now I'm being punished?

666
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,120
My work badge.

667
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,120
I can do rock climbing,

668
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,000
go hiking,

669
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:37,690
play tennis

670
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:38,560
and golf.

671
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,120
I'm omnipotent.

672
00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:46,440
How can this little thing
be a difficulty for me?

673
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,330
It should be burned by fire.

674
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:00,600
It smells like saffron.

675
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:03,730
What is saffron?

676
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:06,280
Hey!

677
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:08,360
What are you doing?

678
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:12,660
How dare you take off my shoes in broad daylight?

679
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:14,380
Don't you know it's inappropriate?

680
00:44:15,890 --> 00:44:17,400
Would it be a maid in the Mansion?

681
00:44:20,430 --> 00:44:21,390
What do you mean?

682
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:23,320
You're not suspecting that

683
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:24,750
I'm related to
the attack of the First Lady, are you?

684
00:44:27,270 --> 00:44:28,450
I don't think you dare.
