1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:02,990
Why are you being so quiet right now?

3
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:04,950
The King's meeting with the envoy

4
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,110
is of great importance.

5
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,150
The Second Lady will fill in
for the First Lady to keep them company.

6
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:09,990
Why is it that no one wants to take the lead now?

7
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:11,790
You shouldn't only play

8
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,190
hard workers in front of the First Lady.

9
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:14,710
If you make the Second Lady happy,

10
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:16,990
you may also have the chance to shine.

11
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:34,870
If no one wants to go,

12
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:36,790
I'll just assign someone randomly.

13
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:38,070
Another new task?

14
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:40,910
Hu Ying?

15
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:42,390
Do you want to take the lead?

16
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:43,350
No,

17
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:46,350
I want to recommend someone to you, my lady.

18
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:48,550
Who?

19
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:49,660
I think

20
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,190
perhaps Si Yan should take the lead.

21
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:52,950
After all,

22
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:55,150
she is the winner of the makeup contest.

23
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,310
Besides, the First Lady adores her.

24
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:58,700
She'll provide better service

25
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:00,670
for the Second Lady than any of us.

26
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:01,670
Girls,

27
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:02,950
do you agree with me?

28
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:04,670
Yes.

29
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:07,550
Si Yan,

30
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:09,110
are you willing to do it?

31
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:11,070
I...

32
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:12,670
Let me think about it.

33
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:13,790
There's nothing to think about.

34
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:15,550
You'll take the lead.

35
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:20,430
What?

36
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:22,510
They had you take charge of it?

37
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,180
Why are you so surprised?

38
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:27,150
Didn't you say that the Second Lady is friendly?

39
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:27,900
Yan,

40
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:28,910
you've got no idea!

41
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,750
In terms of occasions such as meeting the envoy,

42
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,550
normally, the official wife would be there.

43
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:34,990
We haven't figured out
 how the First Lady got injured.

44
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,550
At this critical time,

45
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,750
if the Second Lady steals the thunder,

46
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:39,790
the First Lady...

47
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:41,710
If the Second Lady steals the thunder,

48
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:44,350
the First Lady will be upset for sure.

49
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,710
If the First Lady is happy,

50
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,500
the Second Lady will hate my guts, right?

51
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:52,700
Well, it's a no-win situation for me.

52
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:55,670
What if you have someone replace you?

53
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:56,430
Just leave it.

54
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,150
Considering my current situation,

55
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,060
no one will be willing to replace me.

56
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:02,390
I knew Hu Ying wouldn't be that nice.

57
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:05,710
Besides, the Second Lady has been upset lately.

58
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:07,310
She wouldn't even go out and meet people.

59
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,030
Why?

60
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:11,110
She looked fine during the Flower Feast.

61
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:14,590
Ever since she got pregnant,

62
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:15,870
she's given up on makeup

63
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:16,790
for the baby's sake.

64
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:19,110
She only went to the Feast because she had to.

65
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,390
Why are there so many red spots on your face?

66
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,790
I was making juice.

67
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:31,830
I may have gotten some on my face by accident.

68
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:43,310
Oh right,

69
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:45,390
I need to make juice for the Second Lady.

70
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,710
She'll be mad if I'm late.

71
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:47,950
There's no rush.

72
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:50,670
Perhaps

73
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,710
she'll even give you a compliment.

74
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:10,390
My lady,

75
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:11,950
Si Yan from the Makeup Service is here.

76
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,230
Go back.

77
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:14,390
I don't want to meet anyone.

78
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:16,870
My lady,

79
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,020
Have a look

80
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,700
at this amazing stuff we brought you.

81
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,390
This is...

82
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,510
This is the makeup we customized just for you.

83
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:31,510
It's all naturally made

84
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,750
with fruits and veggies.

85
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,950
It's natural and edible.

86
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:37,190
It is safe for you and the baby.

87
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:38,670
With this,

88
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:40,060
you can put on makeup without worrying.

89
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,350
So, this is the makeup you made?

90
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:12,310
Try it on for me.

91
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,390
See if the color shows.

92
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,190
We made it, Lan Miao!

93
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:39,430
See?

94
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:40,830
It's colorful and delicious!

95
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,310
It's 100% natural and safe.

96
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:44,270
It is safe for the Second Lady to use.

97
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:58,550
The color

98
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:00,470
looks quite natural.

99
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,830
You did well

100
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:08,910
at the Flower Feast.

101
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:11,510
Thank you, my lady.

102
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,270
I will work harder

103
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,350
and will not let you down.

104
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:18,220
Miss Min is here!

105
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:23,390
Greetings, my lady!

106
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:26,470
We're family. No need for formality.

107
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:27,630
Come, Rui.

108
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:34,430
Guess

109
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:35,470
what this is.

110
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:40,909
Sugared fruits?

111
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:44,110
But it's such a small portion, isn't it?

112
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,590
It's edible makeup.

113
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,070
If I guessed right,

114
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:53,070
Miss Si Yan

115
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,780
had it customized just for you.

116
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:57,230
She really is Glasses!

117
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:59,230
Young lady,

118
00:07:59,909 --> 00:08:01,190
you're so well-informed.

119
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:04,470
How about this?

120
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:06,750
You and Si Yan should design

121
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:09,470
my makeup for the meeting with the envoy together.

122
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:13,510
What?

123
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:14,710
You don't want to?

124
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:17,310
Is it

125
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:18,590
only the First Lady

126
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:20,590
that can ask you to work together?

127
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:26,550
-I will do my best.
-I will do my best.

128
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,429
This is a rose lotion.

129
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:44,510
It has such an obvious top note of lemon

130
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:45,430
and a base note of honeycomb.

131
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,470
You can even smell the vivid fragrance

132
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:48,710
of the Damask Rose

133
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:50,460
from the astringent smell of the stem and leaves.

134
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:51,510
So, to put it simply,

135
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:52,950
it smells of rose, right?

136
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:53,790
Brother,

137
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:56,070
if you're not talented in something,

138
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,270
just let it go.

139
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:59,150
You've guessed wrong 90 times.

140
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:00,470
I say we call it a day, alright?

141
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:01,670
No way!

142
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:02,710
Again!

143
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:05,830
Wait a sec, brother!

144
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:07,950
Why are you interested

145
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:08,750
in makeup all of a sudden?

146
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:10,190
You didn't

147
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:11,830
take a fancy to any girl, did you?

148
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:16,270
I don't know.

149
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,870
I just feel that my mind has gone blank.

150
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,110
I want to see her,

151
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,150
and yet I'm afraid of seeing her.

152
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:39,470
Can you understand me, brother?

153
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,510
I did all the practice

154
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:44,110
so that I can have something to talk to her about.

155
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:46,190
I know it's so last-minute,

156
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,260
but I still hope it works.

157
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:04,790
I need to act spontaneous.

158
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,560
Spontaneous!

159
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:14,270
I don't know how to do that!

160
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:21,120
Done!

161
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:23,160
Lan Miao!

162
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,480
Give me a fruit!

163
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,310
Come on!

164
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:35,360
Lan Miao,

165
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:39,600
if you run into your old assistant,

166
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:40,710
a friend...

167
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:42,630
Well, not really.

168
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,440
Just an old acquaintance...

169
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:45,990
You may have done

170
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:47,630
something that hurt her

171
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:48,870
by accident,

172
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,670
and she doesn't seem to remember you.

173
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:52,750
So, now...

174
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,880
Prince Bao?

175
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,030
Would you own up to your mistake

176
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,190
or apologize to her?

177
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:57,590
If you were me,

178
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:58,990
what would you do?

179
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,910
What are you doing?

180
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:07,990
I...

181
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:09,030
I'm here to see Lan Miao.

182
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,480
Well...

183
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,030
Lan Miao,

184
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:20,760
have a candy.

185
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,430
I heard that you love candies.

186
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,710
Take this as well.

187
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,230
Thank you, Your Highness.

188
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:28,150
But...

189
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:28,990
Aren't these

190
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:30,710
snacks for the pet hamsters?

191
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:32,470
Can people eat these?

192
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:38,640
I eat these all the time.

193
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,190
It's fine.

194
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:40,470
It's harmless.

195
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,670
If there's nothing else...

196
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:51,150
Take this.

197
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:52,590
I'm off.

198
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:11,000
Do you like Prince Bao?

199
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:12,790
Nonsense!

200
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:14,630
I am just a maid.

201
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,510
I wouldn't even dare think about that.

202
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:18,390
Why is everyone having a secret crush on him?

203
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:20,150
What are you afraid of?

204
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,230
If you like him, go for it!

205
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:23,400
Maybe there'll be a plot twist!

206
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:24,640
Plot?

207
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:26,470
I noticed that Prince Bao

208
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:27,800
was looking at you differently.

209
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:29,190
Maybe

210
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:30,230
you'll succeed.

211
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:54,080
Have some tea!

212
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:57,590
Thanks.

213
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,230
Is there

214
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,190
any misunderstanding between us?

215
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:09,470
Why do you think so?

216
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:11,830
On the makeup contest,

217
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:14,270
you challenged me out of the blue.

218
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:19,080
Miss Si Yan, you're overthinking it.

219
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,070
I just thought

220
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:22,550
your peach blossom makeup looked nice.

221
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,430
So, I wanted to compare notes.

222
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,950
That makeup was nothing sophisticated.

223
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:29,030
It's nothing compared to your work.

224
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,870
Come to think of it,

225
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:32,670
I have a friend

226
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:34,910
who's similar to you in many ways.

227
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,790
She's a skilled makeup artist

228
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,270
and an honest person.

229
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:41,590
You two even like the same patterns.

230
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:48,990
Where are you from?

231
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,190
Maybe

232
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:51,240
we've met each other before.

233
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:55,000
Miss Si Yan,

234
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,280
you're so funny.

235
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,470
I was born and raised in the north of East City.

236
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,270
I've never left the grasslands all my life.

237
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:02,600
How could I have met you before?

238
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:04,640
However,

239
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:06,230
the women in the north

240
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:07,990
all have patterns painted on their bodies.

241
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,750
Is it possible that your friend

242
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,430
also came to the north before?

243
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,400
Maybe I'm overthinking it.

244
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,760
Maybe she's already forgotten me.

245
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,310
Well, it's all for the best.

246
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,710
Let's have a discussion

247
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:29,240
about the Second Lady's makeup.

248
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:31,190
Oh, right!

249
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,950
You must have already figured out

250
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:35,470
that we are in a no-win situation.

251
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:36,870
If we were not careful,

252
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:38,480
we'd offend both ladies.

253
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,230
The Second Lady is born beautiful

254
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:42,080
and she's younger than the First Lady.

255
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:43,320
She's also pregnant with a son.

256
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:45,950
She's already envied by all the other ladies.

257
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:47,470
Yeah.

258
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:49,150
Besides,

259
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:51,080
she gets to enjoy the view
 from the watchtower with the King.

260
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:52,560
It's such a rare honor.

261
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,590
She wouldn't be able to lay low even if she wanted to.

262
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:58,240
We can't make her look ugly, can we?

263
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,270
How high is the watchtower?

264
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:04,870
About 55 ft.

265
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:06,840
Why?

266
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:08,430
55 ft.

267
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:10,840
1 meter equals 3.3 ft

268
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:13,160
and 3.3 m equals 11 ft.

269
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,510
So, it should be about six floors.

270
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:17,750
Since the watchtower is so high,

271
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:19,550
the folks may not see clearly

272
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,270
who is standing up there.

273
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:24,430
You mean...

274
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,310
-Look-alike makeup!
-Look-alike makeup!

275
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:49,870
Has she really forgotten me?

276
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:57,030
Forgotten what?

277
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:00,550
Jack, answer me this.

278
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:02,760
Is it true that all the players

279
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,000
in the game

280
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:06,070
will still remember things in real life?

281
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,360
I am sorry.

282
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,390
We're still internal testing the game.

283
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:11,270
We don't have a sufficient sample size
 to conduct analysis.

284
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:12,350
However,

285
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:13,880
all the players who've entered the game

286
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,830
have suffered severe brain trauma.

287
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:18,030
It's normal if they've lost some memory.

288
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:24,030
I need you to do me a favor.

289
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,310
Go ahead, Miss.

290
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:27,510
Kill the romance storyline

291
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:28,750
between Qi Bao and me.

292
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:30,280
Are you doing this for Lan Miao?

293
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:31,590
Yes.

294
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:34,680
She's so nice,

295
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:36,550
and she's met someone she likes.

296
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:37,910
She should go for it!

297
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:38,710
But in the game,

298
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:40,310
I am set to fall in love with Qi Bao, right?

299
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:42,350
I can't ask my bestie

300
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:43,630
to pursue love fearlessly

301
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:45,910
while still developing feelings for Qi Bao.

302
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,520
It feels so manipulative.

303
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:49,400
So,

304
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,120
you should think of a way to kill it.

305
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:52,470
Miss Si Yan,

306
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:54,070
once the romance storyline is activated,

307
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:55,310
players can not kill it

308
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:56,560
unless the NPC rejects you

309
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,550
for the sake of plot development.

310
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,670
I need to make sure the plot develops to a point

311
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:04,710
where Qi Bao can reject me.

312
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:06,790
Theoretically, yes.

313
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:08,190
But in the game,

314
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:10,349
some people are just supporting roles.

315
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:12,150
Some of them don't even have

316
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:13,160
a name or a face.

317
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:14,200
They exist

318
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,240
only to help the players

319
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,470
accomplish the tasks.

320
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:17,510
Don't read too much into it.

321
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:21,430
Jack,

322
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:24,280
I know you want to help me to finish the game.

323
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,200
The old me

324
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,349
would've thought the same.

325
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:29,830
But now,

326
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:32,630
I don't want to hurt my friend's feelings.

327
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:00,670
This one.

328
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:04,390
And this.

329
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,390
Si Yan!

330
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:28,160
Look!

331
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,110
I used orange peels and mandarin peels

332
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:30,830
to make this juice!

333
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:31,830
See if it works!

334
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,790
It's already late.

335
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:34,480
Why are you still here?

336
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:35,630
It's alright.

337
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:36,750
I just want to

338
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:38,040
shoulder your burdens.

339
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,150
What is this?

340
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:47,720
Nothing.

341
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,280
It's...I made it for fun.

342
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:53,600
Bae...

343
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:55,950
Who's this "Bae?"

344
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,790
I thought you're staying up so late for me.

345
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:00,960
I didn't expect that

346
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:03,040
you've been thinking of someone else!

347
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:04,870
Stop it!

348
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,670
We don't want others to hear it.

349
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,080
What are you afraid of?

350
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:09,230
What do you say

351
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,190
I ask Prince Bao out for you?

352
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:12,520
You can give it to him

353
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:14,070
and confess your feelings.

354
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,710
If you keep it to yourself,

355
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:16,760
nothing will happen between you two.

356
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:18,150
It's time to take action.

357
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:19,350
So, you need to do something!

358
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,830
Don't make fun of me!

359
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:23,950
How could Prince Bao

360
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,710
take a fancy to me?

361
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:27,990
In the Lan Mansion,

362
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:29,670
I am the daughter of a concubine.

363
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,440
I am a nobody.

364
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:32,950
My daily life

365
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:35,310
revolves around the kitchen and the yard.

366
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:37,080
I am not well informed.

367
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:39,110
Even if I went to the East Mansion,

368
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:41,150
I'd still be

369
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:42,600
a lowly maid.

370
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:47,870
Have you

371
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,030
heard about this story?

372
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:53,310
Once upon a time,

373
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:54,630
there was a girl in the East Mansion

374
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,550
called Cinderella.

375
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:58,190
She was just like you.

376
00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:59,600
Her parents didn't care about her.

377
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:00,510
However,

378
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,670
she was kind and considerate.

379
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:03,870
One day,

380
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:05,280
she met

381
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:07,160
a fairy riding a pumpkin coach.

382
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:09,350
The fairy gave this girl a pair of crystal shoes

383
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:10,870
and told her that

384
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:13,150
she was 100% qualified to become a princess.

385
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,030
With the fairy's help,

386
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:17,190
she met her Mr. Right

387
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:18,830
and they lived

388
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:20,430
happily ever after.

389
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:22,750
Cinderella

390
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:24,190
is so lucky!

391
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:26,150
Miss Lan,

392
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:27,190
it could be you!

393
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:30,040
Trust me on this! I'll be your fairy!

394
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:32,800
Si Yan!

395
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:34,350
I'm not done with it yet!

396
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:53,670
Your Highness,

397
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:54,950
are you nervous?

398
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:56,910
Nonsense!

399
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:57,910
Go hide!

400
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:23,070
Why are you here?

401
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:28,110
Your Highness,

402
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:29,790
I...

403
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:31,950
I want to tell you something.

404
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:35,270
Does Mother want to see me?

405
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:36,190
Tell her

406
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:37,430
I am meeting an important person.

407
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:38,600
I'll go and greet her later.

408
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:42,070
I am the one you've been waiting for.

409
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,350
I told Si Yan to ask you out.

410
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,190
The pouch was from you, too?

411
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:57,680
I made it.

412
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:59,160
It's not done yet.

413
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:00,470
Sorry.

414
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:01,680
I will go and...

415
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,150
No, no!

416
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:03,510
It's not about the pouch.

417
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:06,190
I've got to go.

418
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:27,830
What is Si Yan thinking about?

419
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:31,230
Does she like me or not?

420
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:34,310
She does.

421
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,200
She doesn't.

422
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:39,870
She does.

423
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:41,750
She doesn't.

424
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,030
She does.

425
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:45,670
She doesn't.

426
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,360
Qi Bao, even if you're upset,

427
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:51,480
you don't have to take it out on my flowers.

428
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:52,270
Qi Yi, my brother,

429
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:53,360
you're back.

430
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:54,550
How did it go?

431
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:55,430
Have you caught the assassin?

432
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:00,720
I heard

433
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,830
it was some servant

434
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:03,440
who colluded with outsiders
 to steal things but failed.

435
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:04,630
Then, Mother saw them,

436
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:06,030
so they clutched at straws.

437
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,270
What brings you here?

438
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:11,640
I...

439
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:14,000
I'm watering the plants for you.

440
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:18,950
Go back if you're done.

441
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,190
It's just...

442
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,000
A maid told me she has feelings for me today.

443
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,190
What's the big deal?

444
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:41,280
I don't know what she was thinking about.

445
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,270
She even asked me out.

446
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:44,110
Does she not know my feelings at all?

447
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:46,630
What's this "she" you're talking about?

448
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:48,240
Someone you know.

449
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:17,750
How could she confess her feelings so recklessly?

450
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:21,590
Love is a complicated matter.

451
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:22,390
Well...

452
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:24,560
What should I do, brother?

453
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:26,550
Qi Bao,

454
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,030
if you don't have feelings for that maid,

455
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:30,790
you should make it clear,

456
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:31,990
in case she misunderstands you.

457
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,390
But...

458
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:36,870
If I turned her down face to face,

459
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:38,840
wouldn't she be even more upset?

460
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,720
I'll give it back on your behalf.

461
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:42,590
Brother, you know I'm not good with words.

462
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,750
Help me out!

463
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:52,870
Cheers!

464
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,790
Tonight, let's forget about

465
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:56,870
all those princes.

466
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:04,790
It was my fault.

467
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:07,070
Why did I tell you the story and jinx it?

468
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:08,390
I forgot that

469
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:11,070
the power of magic spells ends at midnight.

470
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:13,670
How dare I fall for Prince Bao?

471
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:16,680
He's way out of my league.

472
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,910
Don't say that, Lan Miao.

473
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:21,280
It's the game's fault.

474
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,560
We got involved in random romance storylines

475
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,600
without being asked for consent.

476
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:27,640
Let me tell you the truth.

477
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:28,990
It's all because

478
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:30,760
no storylines have been programmed
 for the supporting roles.

479
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,870
So, however many times you confess your feelings,

480
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:32,950
you won't succeed.

481
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:06,520
Are you here to make fun of us?

482
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,430
I don't find the whole thing funny,

483
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:09,200
Miss Si Yan.

484
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:12,400
If I had known that the system

485
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,710
is so unreliable,

486
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:15,430
I wouldn't have set those two up.

487
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,630
I could just stay by Lan Miao's side.

488
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,080
I'll go.

489
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:32,670
Stay here.

490
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:34,670
Let me get it.

491
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:47,880
You act frivolously

492
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:48,760
and don't follow the rules.

493
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:50,070
And you never learn!

494
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:55,110
Why do you have it?

495
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:56,670
I'm returning it on Qi Bao's behalf.

496
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:58,510
I also want to tell you that

497
00:26:59,040 --> 00:26:59,880
you should nip that inappropriate thought

498
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:01,070
in the bud.

499
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:03,510
Lower your voice, will you?

500
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:04,990
Come here.

501
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:08,430
Where is Prince Bao?

502
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,870
Does he not have the guts to show up?

503
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:11,880
You did such an inappropriate thing.

504
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:13,520
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

505
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,510
How dare you bother him again?

506
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:18,230
Why would I be ashamed?

507
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:20,150
Stop flattering yourself!

508
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:25,990
Lan Miao!

509
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:27,550
Lan Miao!

510
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,230
Let go of me!

511
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:33,080
Qi Yi, listen carefully.

512
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,760
You're not nobler than us.

513
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:36,710
Loving someone is not a crime.

514
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:38,920
Please, ask Qi Bao, that mama's boy,

515
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,350
to explain himself to Lan Miao in person.

516
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:42,190
If she ever has feelings for him,

517
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:43,470
I will be the first to stop her.

518
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,310
Who's Lan Miao?

519
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:49,190
What?

520
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:51,510
For a noble prince like you,

521
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,040
a maid

522
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,750
doesn't even deserve a name, right?

523
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:57,040
Everyone is disposable to you.

524
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,110
Lan Miao!

525
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:03,520
Lan Miao!

526
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:23,920
Your Highness.

527
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:24,520
Oh, right, Mrs. Huang,

528
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:27,030
have you seen this before?

529
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:31,190
This is

530
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:33,270
the Palash rouge offered by the outlanders.

531
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:35,150
The First Lady chose it

532
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:36,590
as the prize for the makeup contest.

533
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:37,800
So,

534
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,310
only the two maids who won the contest

535
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:40,120
have this.

536
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:41,190
Yes.

537
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,030
I remember that
 something happened that night.

538
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:45,830
The prize is unique.

539
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,190
You two

540
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:48,870
deserve it.

541
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:52,590
Thank you, my lady.

542
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,310
If we check their shoes now,

543
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,640
they'd already been cleaned.

544
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,600
Keep an eye on

545
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,230
the two maids who won the makeup contest,

546
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:28,750
especially Peach, Miss Min's maid.

547
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:30,190
Yes.

548
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,190
Miss,

549
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,670
they're now suspecting you.

550
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:45,310
Si Yan.

551
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:46,830
I...

552
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,000
Well...

553
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:48,640
Lan Miao...

554
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:53,790
Stop!

555
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:56,230
Your Highness,

556
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:57,750
get out of my way, alright?

557
00:29:58,350 --> 00:29:59,430
We're just lowly maids.

558
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:00,710
We don't dare stay too close to you.

559
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:01,670
Si Yan,

560
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,800
have you misunderstood me in any way?

561
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:07,350
Seriously, I am not an unreliable person.

562
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:08,710
I am just not good with words.

563
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,150
I see.

564
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,520
I need to go and see the Second Lady.

565
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:49,520
Doesn't this color

566
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,150
make me look old?

567
00:30:58,670 --> 00:30:59,870
Mother, you're always beautiful and elegant.

568
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:01,630
Of course, it doesn't make you look old.

569
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:03,470
You're such a sweet talker.

570
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,590
However,

571
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:07,110
since you said so,

572
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,680
then, I'll believe you.

573
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:10,670
Reward them.

574
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:15,310
Thank you, my lady.

575
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:18,760
It was all thanks to Prince Bao.

576
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,310
Otherwise,

577
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:20,750
our plan would've been failed.

578
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:22,830
The lip gloss and the rouge

579
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:24,440
were both made this morning.

580
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,790
How come they've changed colors so quickly?

581
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:28,150
It's a normal phenomenon

582
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:30,150
when fruits are exposed in air for long.

583
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:32,600
Plus, the weather is hot now.

584
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:34,280
Luckily, the makeup we prepared

585
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,310
hasn't gone bad.

586
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:37,440
If only we could add

587
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:40,230
some preservatives to the recipe!

588
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:41,750
But...

589
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,520
But what?

590
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:45,950
I know that

591
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:47,870
garlic and Baijiu can help keep fruits fresh.

592
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:50,230
But I don't think

593
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:51,120
putting them in makeup

594
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:52,600
is appropriate.

595
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:55,720
If only we can find other plants

596
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,030
to replace them!

597
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,760
Other plants...

598
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:08,790
Which master wrote this?

599
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:10,480
It's so detailed!

600
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,960
I didn't know plants can be used in makeup.

601
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:15,680
I've got an idea!

602
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:16,670
Come with me.

603
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:17,070
Let's go.

604
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:22,990
Keeping things fresh...

605
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:24,670
Preservative...

606
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:27,040
What is this amazing book?

607
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:28,150
Let me have a look.

608
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:33,560
Be careful.

609
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,670
This book is precious.

610
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:36,870
Maybe

611
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:37,910
we can find a solution

612
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:39,240
in here.

613
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:42,750
Peach,

614
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:43,670
look through the book

615
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:44,630
and see if there's a plant

616
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:46,070
we can use to keep the makeup fresh.

617
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:53,150
Here it is, Si Yan!

618
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:54,190
Really?

619
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:56,950
Well...

620
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,670
Why is there a page missing?

621
00:32:58,960 --> 00:32:59,840
Have a look!

622
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,590
Let me see!

623
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:04,280
Why is there a page missing?

624
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:07,030
I've been treating it like treasure every day.

625
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,230
He'll blame me for sure if he knows about this.

626
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,150
I heard that

627
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:14,120
there's a bookstall in the city alley.

628
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:16,150
They sell a book called
 The Encyclopedia of Plants.

629
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:18,150
Maybe the content of that book
 is similar to this one.

630
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:19,360
When

631
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,670
you have time,

632
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:21,910
you can restore this book there.

633
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:23,110
Really?

634
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,190
Thank god you're well-informed.

635
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:27,230
I'll have it restored now.

636
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:27,910
I gotta go.

637
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,110
Bye.

638
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:46,150
Look, that's the overconfident maid.

639
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:48,030
A crow trying to mate with the doves.

640
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:06,790
I heard that

641
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:08,830
Si Yan almost blew

642
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:10,199
the makeup try-on today.

643
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:13,030
Luckily, Prince Bao was there to defend her.

644
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:14,350
They seem

645
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,190
to have a special relationship.

646
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:17,760
Think about it.

647
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,790
You've worked day and night

648
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:20,350
to make these for the Second Lady,

649
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,760
and in the end,

650
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:24,389
you were the one who got humiliated before Prince Bao.

651
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,150
Do you know what you are?

652
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:30,510
You're the cat's paw.

653
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,070
Si Yan was doing it for me.

654
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,400
Come on.

655
00:34:34,949 --> 00:34:37,190
It may seem that she's setting you up
 with Prince Bao,

656
00:34:37,429 --> 00:34:39,350
but in fact, she's thinking about herself.

657
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:41,150
Someone once saw her

658
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:42,199
feeding Prince Bao's hamsters

659
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:44,190
while you were not here.

660
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:46,560
She's meddling in your affairs

661
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,070
and playing you like a fool!

662
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:56,239
However,

663
00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:00,590
for the sake of the friendship of our families,

664
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:01,920
as long as

665
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:03,160
you ask for my help now,

666
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:05,880
I will help you teach her a lesson.

667
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,790
Si Yan is not like that.

668
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:12,350
Fine.

669
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:14,520
Wait and see, then.

670
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:17,920
See what she will say

671
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:20,470
when she meets you.

672
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:27,830
Si Yan.

673
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:29,680
This

674
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,520
is a new batch of makeup I made with fruits.

675
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:32,950
Lan Miao,

676
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:34,150
thank you so much!

677
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:35,520
Otherwise, I wouldn't know what to do.

678
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:38,720
She'll sing praises to you first

679
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:41,200
so that she can keep taking advantage of you.

680
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:42,630
Then...

681
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,160
She'll pretend that she doesn't know

682
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,470
Prince Bao has feelings for her

683
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:47,390
and make herself innocent.

684
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:51,550
Last time,

685
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:53,510
I recklessly set you up with Prince Bao

686
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:54,470
and made you upset.

687
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:55,280
I am so sorry.

688
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,640
I saw that Prince Bao had been considerate of you

689
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,110
and giving you candies,

690
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:01,400
so I misunderstood the situation.

691
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:06,400
I'm fine, Si Yan.

692
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:07,920
You don't need to comfort me.

693
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,350
Prince Bao

694
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:11,880
couldn't see how good you are!

695
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:14,000
If he regrets it in the future,

696
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,150
I will make him go through

697
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:16,430
fire and water to pursue you.

698
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:18,350
At last,

699
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:19,350
she'll act as if

700
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:21,390
she knows Prince Bao very well

701
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,910
and hint that it's not over between you two.

702
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,590
She won't mention her relationship

703
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:27,390
with him even a little bit.

704
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:30,070
Si Yan,

705
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:31,750
I need to ask you something.

706
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:33,320
Lan Miao,

707
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,510
I need to go out for something urgent.

708
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:36,040
If anyone asks for me,

709
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:36,630
make an excuse.

710
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:40,950
So,

711
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:43,600
she'll keep taking advantage of you.

712
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,830
Well,

713
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:45,790
if you've already figured out

714
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:47,600
the true intention behind her words,

715
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,120
and still think of her as your bestie,

716
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:51,670
then you can think of what I said today

717
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:52,350
as nonsense.

718
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:09,040
I didn't expect Si Yan to fall for it so easily.

719
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:33,640
The weather is dry.

720
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,470
Beware of fire!

721
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:38,440
Curfew starts at dusk.

722
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,230
Each courtyard shall do a head count.

723
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:53,430
Lady Cui, I...

724
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:54,880
Take her away.

725
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:57,670
Let go of me!

726
00:37:58,110 --> 00:37:58,910
Let go of me!

727
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:00,150
Let go of her.

728
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:11,270
Your Highness, sorry to ask you here
 so late at night.

729
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:12,960
As a maid in the Makeup Service,

730
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,270
she broke the rules.

731
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:15,550
Besides, we're at a critical time now.

732
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:18,030
I will thoroughly investigate this matter.

733
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:24,920
Why did you go out during curfew?

734
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:27,270
I got held up when I was out.

735
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:28,990
It was not curfew yet when I left.

736
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:30,310
Why did you go out?

737
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,030
I...

738
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,440
My lady!

739
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:41,870
My lady!

740
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:43,710
My lady!

741
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:45,150
My lady!

742
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:46,510
My lady, what's wrong?

743
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,590
The rope was rigged.

744
00:38:56,790 --> 00:38:57,630
Oh, right, Mrs. Huang,

745
00:38:57,630 --> 00:38:58,760
have you seen this before?

746
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:00,310
This is

747
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:02,150
the Palash rouge offered by the outlanders.

748
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:03,800
The First Lady chose it

749
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,150
as the prize for the makeup contest.

750
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,230
So,

751
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:07,670
only the two maids who won the contest

752
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:08,640
have this.

753
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:09,510
Yes.

754
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:16,200
Where were you?

755
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:18,830
How could I tell him?

756
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,160
Why are you silent?

757
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:27,520
I went to restore the book for you.

758
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:36,270
Perhaps,

759
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:38,390
she went to destroy evidence

760
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:39,390
with her accomplice outside.

761
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:41,600
I didn't.

762
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:42,830
Don't you dare throw mud at me!

763
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:47,230
Where on earth did you go?

764
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,600
Your Highness,

765
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,080
this maid went out without permission.

766
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:57,470
She has broken the rules

767
00:39:57,470 --> 00:39:58,200
and should be punished.

768
00:39:58,790 --> 00:39:59,920
As for her relationship

769
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,190
with the assassin who attacked the First Lady,

770
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,350
we rely on Your Highness to investigate it.

771
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:11,350
Take Si Yan away.

772
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:13,360
I'll question her tomorrow at the patrol squadron.

773
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:15,000
Yes.

774
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:29,830
Hey!

775
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,710
Well, if it isn't the fearless Si Yan.

776
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,830
How come you ended up like this?

777
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:40,550
Come on, make a scene!

778
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:42,430
See if your beautiful friends

779
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:43,200
and the princes

780
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,190
will come to your rescue!

781
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:46,560
Stay away from me!

782
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:48,640
I don't think

783
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,230
you understand what's going on here.

784
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:51,510
It's fine, though.

785
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:53,150
In a minute,

786
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:55,560
I, Hu Ying, will make your life a living hell.

787
00:40:57,950 --> 00:40:58,830
What are you doing?

788
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:00,000
Hey!

789
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,390
Go away!

790
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:08,030
Hey!

791
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,630
Don't you like to compete against me?

792
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:16,310
Go away!

793
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,310
Today,

794
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,470
you can put on all the makeup you want.

795
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:21,640
Go away!

796
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:24,070
Come here.

797
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,150
Why are you here?

798
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:41,160
Teach her a lesson.

799
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:42,840
Let her know that

800
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,960
you're not someone she can bully.

801
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:07,190
Back then,

802
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:08,550
when you were using Lan Miao

803
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:10,160
to cozy up to Prince Bao,

804
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,390
I bet you didn't think you'd end up like this.

805
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:14,430
You sold me out!

806
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,640
I blame myself for being so vulnerable

807
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:27,840
that I trusted you with all my heart.

808
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:50,630
What a beautiful face!

809
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:53,550
Why is your makeup running, though?

810
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:28,230
The manure is so stinky.

811
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,150
I can't find it anywhere.

812
00:43:38,110 --> 00:43:38,750
Your Highness,

813
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:40,390
I thought we'd already checked it.

814
00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:42,470
Why are we here again
 in this dirty and stinky place?

815
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:48,150
You little prince,

816
00:43:48,150 --> 00:43:48,790
push the carriage.

817
00:43:54,510 --> 00:43:54,990
Stop.

818
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:05,990
This is...

819
00:44:09,270 --> 00:44:10,430
Of course, I don't want to!

820
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,030
Si Yan is not the assassin.

821
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:24,640
Why are you so sure, Your Highness?

822
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:26,390
She can't wear double-piercing earrings.

823
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:27,830
This might belong to the murderer.

824
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:29,790
Go find out!

825
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:32,910
Your Highness, where are you going?

826
00:44:33,830 --> 00:44:34,910
Back then,

827
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,280
when you were seducing the princes to get ahead,

828
00:44:37,790 --> 00:44:39,310
did you think you'd end up like this?

829
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:43,630
Hu Ying!

830
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:48,270
You colluded with the assassin

831
00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:49,710
to attack the First Lady.

832
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,440
How dare you!

833
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:56,350
Hu Ying, you...

834
00:45:05,590 --> 00:45:06,350
There's something on her.

835
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:07,270
Search!

836
00:45:08,470 --> 00:45:08,750
Don't!

837
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:09,510
Beat her up!

838
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:14,950
Stop it!

839
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:24,430
Let go of me!

840
00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:28,040
Don't touch me!

841
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:30,020
Miss Si Yan,

842
00:45:30,350 --> 00:45:31,190
call a time-out!

843
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:32,830
Please, Miss Si Yan,

844
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:34,380
call a time-out!

845
00:45:34,550 --> 00:45:35,770
They are just a bunch of losers!

846
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:37,200
I am not afraid of them!

847
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:39,260
You're so stubborn!

848
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:40,770
Beat her up!

849
00:45:42,870 --> 00:45:43,460
Go away!

850
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:44,380
Go away!
