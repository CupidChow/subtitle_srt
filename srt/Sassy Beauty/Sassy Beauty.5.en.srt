1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,440
Miss Min,

3
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:11,080
you've been bringing soup several days in a row now.

4
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,470
Unfortunately, my master is tied up at work.

5
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,630
He's probably in the royal court

6
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,390
discussing the Flower Feast with the king now.

7
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,390
Please leave it to me.

8
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,720
I'll bring it to him.

9
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:20,960
Director Wang,

10
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,750
is Prince Yi busy?

11
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,829
Or is he avoiding my Lady?

12
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:26,910
Nonsense.

13
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,270
I just got back from my father's.

14
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,270
I didn't see Prince Yi there.

15
00:02:45,829 --> 00:02:47,240
What on earth is Prince Yi doing?

16
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,720
I haven't seen him for several days.

17
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,000
I heard that

18
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:52,910
he's not feeling well.

19
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:56,079
Perhaps he's been to somewhere dirty

20
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,110
and caught something nasty.

21
00:02:59,110 --> 00:02:59,630
Prince Da.

22
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,800
Thanks to Miss Min's concern,

23
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:39,720
I feel much better now.

24
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,160
I have been busy these days

25
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:47,829
and haven't had a chance to visit you.

26
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,160
In a few days,

27
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:50,390
I'll visit you with gifts

28
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,240
and make it up to you.

29
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,440
No worries.

30
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,320
It's all good as you're fine.

31
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,960
Since you are not ill,

32
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,030
why aren't you leaving the house?

33
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:02,600
Brother,

34
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,320
Father asked us to rehearse

35
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,960
for the Flower Feast performance.

36
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,550
Did you forget about it?

37
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,000
I've been staying in

38
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,720
to practice for it in secret.

39
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,550
Don't tell me

40
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,440
you've had it all figured out.

41
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,320
Since you are well,

42
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,790
I'm relieved.

43
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,160
As for other matters, we'll talk later.

44
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:26,720
I'll get going.

45
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:31,000
Then I'm leaving, too.

46
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,550
Prince Yi, please take good care of yourself.

47
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,920
Prince Da always

48
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:49,950
kicks you when you're down.

49
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,070
He's targeting you.

50
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,200
Messing up your prescriptions

51
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,390
must be his idea.

52
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,200
I fought with the man in black.

53
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,880
I don't think he's someone from within.

54
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,950
Da could have hired from outside.

55
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:04,160
By the way,

56
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,670
the maid that I left in Prince Da's court,

57
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,320
did you find anything on her?

58
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,000
I found out a lot about her.

59
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:12,760
That maid, Si Yan,

60
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,600
is something.

61
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,230
I've bribed the pages in Prince Da's court.

62
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:17,790
I heard that Si Yan

63
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,640
slept in the courtyard last night.

64
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,040
Her snorting pattern is three long and one short.

65
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,230
Sometimes it's three short and one long.

66
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,350
Don't you think it's strange?

67
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:27,880
She's using snores

68
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,600
to communicate with Prince Da.

69
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:30,640
Is there anything else?

70
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,550
I've investigated her thoroughly, including generations of her ancestors.

71
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,600
So far,

72
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,510
I've found nothing.

73
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,040
It doesn't need to be complicated.

74
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,440
Just find out her background.

75
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:42,600
Got it.

76
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,550
Take a look.

77
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,600
I listened to you,

78
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,110
and my face is getting much better.

79
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,000
As long as my Lady knows my heart, I'm relieved.

80
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:21,550
This time, I'll make a grand comeback.

81
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:23,670
I will impress My Lord

82
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:25,760
and beat Lady Qian

83
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,040
and Second Lady

84
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,480
with my impeccable beauty.

85
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,270
The main event of this Flower Feast

86
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:35,159
is to match Miss Min with one of the princes.

87
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,830
But I won't let anyone steal my shine.

88
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,920
Matching again?

89
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,070
Everyone knows

90
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,600
this marriage must fall on Prince Yi,

91
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,950
but...

92
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:50,040
But what?

93
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,550
A marriage arrangement is simple,

94
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,830
but the competition over the crown prince is not.

95
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,760
Each prince has his chance, and the behind-the-scene fights are dangerous.

96
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,720
Don't you know that?

97
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:00,390
The one who sent the dowry two days ago is

98
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,640
Prince Da.

99
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,440
Prince Yi seemed to get into some trouble

100
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,200
on the way.

101
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,320
You knew Prince Yi had an accident on the way?

102
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,480
Though I never left my room,

103
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,350
the gossips and rumors traveled fast here.

104
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,880
First Lady

105
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,390
hates that crazy woman so much.

106
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,200
Coincidentally, she came to our place as a maid.

107
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:21,110
I want to see with my own eyes,

108
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,670
how hideous this girl looks.

109
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,320
Si Yan,

110
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,790
it hurt.

111
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:32,790
My Lady, I'm so sorry.

112
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:35,640
That was some ancient history.

113
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:36,720
First Lady is so busy

114
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,830
that she probably doesn't remember.

115
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:40,159
I will come up with a good plan

116
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,000
for your revival makeups for the day.

117
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,600
You're right.

118
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,720
On that day, I must be

119
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,760
the most gorgeous one of all.

120
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:48,920
Yes.

121
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,390
First Lady wouldn't be looking for me, would she?

122
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,510
Nah.

123
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:01,790
She would have searched for me long ago.

124
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,270
Do I pick one now?

125
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,040
Then I'll choose this one.

126
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:29,440
There's a letter for you.

127
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,550
The auspicious clouds in green represent Qi Yi.

128
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:47,840
What is the powder box?

129
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,790
What does that man in black do?

130
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,960
Don't worry.

131
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,710
As the character settings are unlocked,

132
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,880
you'll learn what they represent

133
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,790
soon in the future.

134
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:07,550
Could this letter be poisonous?

135
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:08,960
What if I die right away

136
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:09,960
after I open it?

137
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:12,200
Based on the character analysis of you and him,

138
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,590
to eliminate you,

139
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:14,550
he could have chosen

140
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,350
an easier and more effective way than poisoning.

141
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:19,710
Forget it.

142
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,710
Come to my place tonight.

143
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,320
I'd like to repay you for falling in the water,

144
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:33,670
releasing the thieves,

145
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,880
and all the chaotic mess that had occurred.

146
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,470
Qi Yi.

147
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:41,080
This... What the heck is this?

148
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,910
You and I

149
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:44,440
should never have anything to do with each other.

150
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,000
Are you going, Si Yan?

151
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:51,880
Let me tell you.

152
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:53,440
It is a trap

153
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,590
to settle scores from the past.

154
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,670
So, are you not going?

155
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,550
No, I'm doing for sure.

156
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,520
Didn't you hear what Lady Wei said?

157
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,960
Everyone knows the accident of him falling into the water.

158
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:04,670
If First Lady finds out

159
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:05,960
I am that crazy woman,

160
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,520
Getting my foot into Makeup Service will be out of the question.

161
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:10,280
Whether I can see the sun tomorrow is hard to say.

162
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,550
That's why

163
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:13,030
I have to uproot the problem,

164
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,710
settling our vendetta once and for all.

165
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:16,350
Jack,

166
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,790
I am a human.

167
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:20,400
I can't possibly lose to

168
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,280
an NPC.

169
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:38,150
It smells like medicine here.

170
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,710
A trap with no one here?

171
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,760
Isn't it too sloppy?

172
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:50,520
An apple?

173
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,520
Is the true indigo flower I gave you of good use?

174
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,520
First, you pushed me off into the water.

175
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,910
Then you sneaked into the Imperial Institute of Medicine.

176
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:10,960
Tell.

177
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,840
Lurking in the East Mansion as a maid,

178
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,150
what is your purpose?

179
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,350
Isn't this just a game path?

180
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,350
Does he need to make such a big fuss?

181
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:21,710
Are you admitting that you are ill-intentioned?

182
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:24,080
What ill intention do I have?

183
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:26,670
I was adopted when I was a five-year-old girl.

184
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:28,230
To put it nicely,

185
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:29,960
I was a lady at someone's home.

186
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:32,200
When in reality, I was just a higher-ranked maid.

187
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,520
Doing laundry, chopping wood, and taking hints all the time.

188
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:37,960
I eventually grew up

189
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,670
and came to East Mansion to pursue my dream

190
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:40,840
of becoming a makeup artist,

191
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,760
only to become a crazy woman by mistake.

192
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:45,440
Prince Yi, please be forgiving

193
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:47,470
and pity an orphan girl like me.

194
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,960
Was it all misunderstanding?

195
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,790
Well...You can say so.

196
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,150
Your paranoia

197
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:01,960
should not be my responsibility.

198
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:02,960
Listen,

199
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,640
you are born a nobleman and aristocrat,

200
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,520
but your brothers are divided.

201
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:09,030
As you don't have a good personality,

202
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,280
there must be many who want to harm you.

203
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:13,550
I say that you should change your personality.

204
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,030
Maybe you won't have shitty luck anymore.

205
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,640
You have a sharp tongue.

206
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,150
Thank you.

207
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,550
You should focus on investigating who poisoned you.

208
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,230
There's no need to waste energy on me. Bye-bye.

209
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,030
My hairpin.

210
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,640
Your hairpin...

211
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,910
If I put it next to the medicine that poisoned me,

212
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,880
I wonder what would happen.

213
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,520
What are you up to?

214
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,400
In the matron's room of the Palace Makeup Service,

215
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,910
there is an old register.

216
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,320
Bring it to me,

217
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,640
and I'll let you go.

218
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:50,000
You are framing and entrapping me.

219
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,320
As a prince, you are too despicable

220
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:53,880
to threaten me this way.

221
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,320
Don't want to do it?

222
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:58,640
Sometimes, there is only

223
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:00,760
one way to prove yourself.

224
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:06,550
Am I willing?

225
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:08,590
Of course, I'm willing.

226
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:10,030
I am not willing at all!

227
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:48,960
Your rashes are getting worse.

228
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:51,910
Karma!

229
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,110
You have no shame.

230
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:01,910
It depends on people.

231
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,790
Prince Yi asked me to come here after midnight.

232
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,150
The shameless one...

233
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,840
Shouldn't it be you?

234
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,280
You...

235
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,150
When you are unkind, don't blame me for being unjust.

236
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,520
If you don't return my hairpin today,

237
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,440
I'll stay here. I'm not leaving.

238
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,710
My Lord, First Lady is here.

239
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:24,790
I'm doomed.

240
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,760
What are you doing?

241
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,200
Come here.

242
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:09,350
Qi Yi.

243
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:11,000
When I get you the register,

244
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,150
let's let go of the past and wipe the slate clean.

245
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:14,710
Please stay out of my way.

246
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:15,670
Do you agree?

247
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,000
What if I disagree?

248
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:17,910
You...

249
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:21,550
Why are you here, mother?

250
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,440
Your son is here to pay my respect.

251
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:24,350
It's okay.

252
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:25,790
Doctor,

253
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:27,840
please check on his condition.

254
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,440
Yes.

255
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:29,960
I caught a cold accidentally,

256
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:31,000
and I feel better now.

257
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:32,350
Please don't trouble the doctor.

258
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,840
Still, let the doctor see you.

259
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,550
Prince Yi, please remove your clothes

260
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:45,760
so I can diagnose properly.

261
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,550
I'm all done, Prince Yi.

262
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:13,840
First Lady.

263
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:16,710
How is he?

264
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,230
The rashes on Prince Yi

265
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,440
are getting better.

266
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:22,470
Take a medicine bath every two to three days.

267
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:23,440
Watch for the diets.

268
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,400
Gradually, he'll recover.

269
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,910
Doctor, will Prince Yi be fully recovered

270
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,200
by the Flower Feast?

271
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,590
Skin allergy takes time to heal.

272
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:35,400
First Lady,

273
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,840
it's spring now.

274
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,710
Before Prince Yi completely recovers,

275
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:39,960
he should avoid public appearance.

276
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,840
It's not a big deal. I'll attend it on time.

277
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,080
This year's Flower Feast...

278
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,790
Call it off.

279
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:52,520
Flower Feast is canceled?

280
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,440
Then all my efforts would be in vein.

281
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,000
Mother,

282
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,230
I was reckless.

283
00:16:58,670 --> 00:16:59,670
I shouldn't have hidden my condition.

284
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,350
I beg mother not to cancel the Flower Feast.

285
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,470
These gossips and whispers

286
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:07,069
have circulated the whole house.

287
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:08,560
Do you think you can cover it up?

288
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,560
What if Miss Min heard the gossips,

289
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:12,470
what do you think she'd feel?

290
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:12,829
Mother.

291
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:13,470
That's it.

292
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:15,760
The Flower Feast should stop.

293
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,680
I will call it off.

294
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,280
It's better this way than your rashes

295
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:22,560
being taken advantage of by somebody.

296
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:24,589
Qi Yi,

297
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:27,880
If you were unhappy with this marriage arrangement,

298
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,070
you could have told me so.

299
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,110
You are treating me like a stranger,

300
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,070
and it makes me sad.

301
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:38,000
Mother,

302
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,880
I am determined to marry Miss Min.

303
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,680
Please don't misunderstand.

304
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,070
About today, don't mention it to anyone.

305
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:24,920
Leave.

306
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:39,760
My Lady, please eat slowly.

307
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,710
My Lady,

308
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,680
what are you doing?

309
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,040
Acne and blemishes finally cleared off.

310
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,310
How could you give yourself up?

311
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,230
Flower Feast has been canceled.

312
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,800
What's the point of treating my face?

313
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:59,400
Go and get all the seafood here.

314
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,230
I'm going to eat up today.

315
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:01,070
Yes, my Lady.

316
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:06,110
We both fell into the river,

317
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,310
but only he got a cold and rashes.

318
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,400
How can a muscular guy be in such poor health?

319
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,640
You've also heard it?

320
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,590
Heard what?

321
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:24,040
On the surface, the Flower Feast is canceled

322
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,880
because of the blossoming season delay.

323
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:27,310
In reality, it's because

324
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,040
Prince Yi has STD.

325
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,760
How did you hear about it?

326
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:42,800
You can't do anything well,

327
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,470
but you're quite good at passing on gossip.

328
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:45,880
I didn't start the rumor.

329
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,950
Everyone said that.

330
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,350
Why are you so agitated?

331
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:51,160
Don't tell me that his STD has something to do with you?

332
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:51,760
You.

333
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,230
Cut it out and stop arguing.

334
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,070
Flower Feast is my only chance to come back in favor.

335
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,430
Now the cancellation is a done deal.

336
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,430
It looks like I have to

337
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:04,230
grow old and die alone in Trust Pavilion.

338
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,920
My Lady, please don't give up just yet.

339
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,110
Maybe there'll be a turning point.

340
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,430
How can there be a turnaround?

341
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,430
There are only two days to the Flower Feast.

342
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:18,280
Could Prince Yi's rashes just disappear into thin air?

343
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:24,070
Vanish into thin air?

344
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:26,640
Even the delicate pig girl

345
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,760
can't resist the temptation of hot pots.

346
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,680
But what do you do when you overeat and have a breakout?

347
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,590
When you use the right concealer,

348
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:35,000
you can make acne and blemishes vanish in a second.

349
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,880
The way to apply the concealer

350
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,040
is to apply a small amount multiple times.

351
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,710
Layer upon the area that needs to conceal.

352
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,230
Just like this.

353
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:51,760
Then you pat on the area lightly. Done.

354
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:52,950
Look.

355
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:55,070
Isn't everything hidden? It's magical, isn't it?

356
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,310
That's right.

357
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:01,470
Using a concealer or color corrector

358
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:03,160
can hide the rashes and make them invisible.

359
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:05,070
Stop eating, My Lady.

360
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,520
You are going to look beautiful and attend the Flower Feast.

361
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:08,800
Leave the rest to me.

362
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:14,880
Si Yan, what do you mean? Please explain.

363
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,760
Return all these memorials to the throne.

364
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,110
Ask Prince Da to read and comment on them again.

365
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,230
If he still doesn't get the ins and outs of the royal court,

366
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:23,560
have him go and ask Prince Yi.

367
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:25,110
He can't even do this well.

368
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:27,110
How can he lead the younger brothers by example?

369
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:28,680
Tell him to reflect on himself for a few days.

370
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,160
It seems that My Lord doesn't favor Prince Da.

371
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:32,590
It is My Lord's family affairs.

372
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,760
Refrain from commenting on it.

373
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,590
The impetus for Prince Da to lead is not turning out well.

374
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:43,590
What do you know?

375
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:45,040
It's tough love.

376
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,880
My Lord did say that Prince Da is insufficiently prepared,

377
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,000
but judging from the thorough comments on these memorials,

378
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,830
the efforts are hard to come by.

379
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,470
The dowry sent by Prince Da

380
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,710
must have meanings in the system.

381
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:06,830
Incapable!

382
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,160
My Lord,

383
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,760
Prince Da is still young.

384
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:24,680
Why get mad when all he needs is more guidance?

385
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:27,710
You need to take care of your health.

386
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:29,160
Okay, come this way.

387
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:30,950
Take it easy. Easy, please.

388
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:31,920
Okay.

389
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,800
Sit down slowly.

390
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:39,070
Have some tea.

391
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:41,520
Miss Min has arrived.

392
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,710
Rei is here to greet My King

393
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:46,830
and Second Lady.

394
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,520
Don't be so formal.

395
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,950
I haven't seen you for more than ten years, right?

396
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:54,640
Rei is getting more and more beautiful.

397
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:57,230
You have changed quite a lot.

398
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,110
Come.

399
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:00,830
Come here and let aunty see you.

400
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:13,190
What is it?

401
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,190
It's fine.

402
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,110
Where is the thing I asked you to prepare?

403
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,000
Please have a seat, My Lady.

404
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,160
I'll get it for you.

405
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,640
My Lady,

406
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,190
here is the fragrance from Hu Shang

407
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:47,070
that you asked me to buy.

408
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:51,280
Aunty,

409
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,680
It is the fragrance I got

410
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,590
just for you from Hu Shang.

411
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:57,230
It will refresh your mind and boost alertness.

412
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:58,350
You are pregnant.

413
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,040
It should be of help.

414
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:04,400
Rei is so thoughtful.

415
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,350
Whoever marries you

416
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:08,590
must have had the fortune of the previous life.

417
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:12,070
Aunty, you're teasing me.

418
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Why are you shy?

419
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,640
You've met the princes.

420
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:17,830
Who do you like?

421
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:20,710
Allow My Lord to make arrangements for you.

422
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:22,000
That's right.

423
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,760
General Min has been my right-hand manㄡ

424
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,710
He expanded the territory for East City,

425
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:28,950
contributing greatly.

426
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:30,000
Your father and I

427
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:32,470
arranged the marriage agreement in person.

428
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,880
What a pity.

429
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:37,310
Teng.

430
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:39,280
Forget it.

431
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,680
I'll say no more.

432
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:43,680
Bao

433
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,640
is still young

434
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,040
and not at the age of marriage arrangement.

435
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,310
Da, Xiu, and Yi

436
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:54,190
are suitable in terms of age.

437
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,830
If you like any one of them,

438
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:56,950
tell me directly.

439
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:59,190
Stay in East City longer

440
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,710
and spend time with the princes more often.

441
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,310
Right.

442
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:04,070
Sure.

443
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:06,310
Lan Miao, please get me the pine nuts.

444
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,230
Father, Mother,

445
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,800
and Miss Min.

446
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:17,070
Bao,

447
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,000
look at you all sweaty.

448
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,400
Mother,

449
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,310
I told you

450
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:25,350
not to call me Bao when there's an outsider.

451
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:27,040
It doesn't sound manly.

452
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:29,920
What do I call you then?

453
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,680
Baby Bao or Little Bao?

454
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,470
Mother...

455
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:38,280
Thanks.

456
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:40,470
Look at you,

457
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:42,590
playing with these all day long.

458
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:45,160
When can you help your father with work?

459
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,710
Father,

460
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:49,230
You have brother Da and brother Yi to help you at work.

461
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,160
I should focus on doing my part.

462
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,230
For example,

463
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,590
not upsetting you.

464
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,230
You...

465
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,470
I don't know what to do with you.

466
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:10,160
My Lord, taking three medicine baths a day

467
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,760
is too much for your body.

468
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:13,760
Keep pouring.

469
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,000
First Lady has announced to cancel the Flower Feast.

470
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,310
Why do you bother?

471
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:26,350
I can't bear to see my mother feel sad.

472
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:28,880
Since my second brother passed away,

473
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:30,920
my mother has rarely

474
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,470
been motivated to do anything.

475
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,400
When could you care more about yourself?

476
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,280
It is fine.

477
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:43,430
My Lord,

478
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:45,000
I am a bit confused

479
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,070
about something.

480
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:48,680
About the register for the Palace Makeup Service,

481
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,110
you could have ordered me to take care of it.

482
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,920
Why did you involve that crazy woman?

483
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,520
Since it's simple,

484
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,190
it can test her.

485
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:58,040
Do you think that

486
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,710
the handkerchief incident has to do with the man in the black?

487
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:02,830
I want to know

488
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,520
if she will tamper with the register.

489
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:10,000
Who's there?

490
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:20,920
It's for you.

491
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,800
Meet me at the Spring Pavilion in the early afternoon.

492
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:32,710
I have a way to help you conceal the rashes.

493
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,640
There's nothing I haven't seen,

494
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,760
but stealing is a first.

495
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,880
Register...

496
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:51,280
East Mansion Palace Makeup Service Register.

497
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,640
That's easy.

498
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,040
Well...

499
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:56,680
This teenager game is so confusing.

500
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:25,430
Hold there.

501
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,430
Who told you to take this?

502
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,040
These are makeups for Lady Wei. Get lost.

503
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,920
Palace Makeup Service isn't for just anyone

504
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,000
to come and go.

505
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:36,520
Si Yan,

506
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,000
if I want to have fresh honey,

507
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:40,680
can I still come to you?

508
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:42,710
So much nonsense.

509
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,350
Stop.

510
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,590
Which court are you assigned?

511
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,800
How dare you take the makeup from Haleness Pavilion?

512
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:52,800
Isn't it Lady Wei's?

513
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:19,400
Lady Qian.

514
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,430
My Lady.

515
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:21,430
My Lady,

516
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,310
Si Yan insisted on taking your makeup.

517
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,190
I couldn't stop her.

518
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:27,110
Hu Ying!

519
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,350
I'm from Lady Wei's court.

520
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,640
I was getting the item from the list

521
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,070
to get the makeup powder for concealing.

522
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:36,230
I didn't know someone had switched it.

523
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:37,470
I hope that Lady Qian will understand.

524
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,350
That's not what you said earlier.

525
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,880
Didn't you say

526
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:43,190
this foundation suits Lady Wei the best?

527
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,830
You also said

528
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,830
King would favor her again,

529
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:50,000
and we should see the situation sooner.

530
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:50,760
You...

531
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:59,350
So you are from Lady Wei's court.

532
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,800
No wonder you have no manner.

533
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,680
I heard that Lady Wei had done a lot

534
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,560
for her face.

535
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,110
Now that the Flower Feast has been canceled,

536
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,920
I'm afraid she has to wash her face in tears

537
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:16,400
in Trust Pavilion again.

538
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,640
Never mind.

539
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,430
I'll give the makeup powder to Lady Wei.

540
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,590
Yes.

541
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:34,350
Thank you, Lady Qian.

542
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,430
Such a careless maid.

543
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:02,280
Silly girl, let go.

544
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:04,950
Does Lady Wei even apply the makeup powder on the ground

545
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:06,590
to her face?

546
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,230
Prince Yi!

547
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:34,160
How rude!

548
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:36,350
How can you be so rude in front of Lady Qian?

549
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,560
See how I punish you.

550
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:39,560
You.

551
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:44,680
My Lady.

552
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:13,190
It has been a long time.

553
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:14,880
What a cold-hearted person.

554
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:49,950
That's the one.

555
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:51,680
She dared to make trouble in front of Lady Qian.

556
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
She's over the top!

557
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,310
I gave you the register.

558
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,110
How much longer do I need to kneel?

559
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,040
Isn't it just pretending?

560
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:07,310
I promised to punish you for Lady Qian.

561
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:09,120
Everyone has to see it,

562
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:11,150
so no one misunderstands that I'm partial to you.

563
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:14,000
Qi Yi,

564
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,320
are you kidding me?

565
00:34:16,949 --> 00:34:18,670
Who am I getting concealer for?

566
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,120
It's for your rashes.

567
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:22,230
Don't get smart with me.

568
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,150
Do you think I haven't tried?

569
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:25,800
The concealer won't cover well at all.

570
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:27,150
How would I know?

571
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,280
At least I tried.

572
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,560
It was thankless hard work.

573
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:33,520
Give my hairpin back.

574
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,190
From now on, don't hold any more grudges.

575
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:39,949
Once you come up with a way to hide the rashes,

576
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,190
you can ask your hairpin back.

577
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:49,429
How can I believe him again?

578
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,000
He's a rogue and big liar.

579
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:09,800
Prince Bao,

580
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:12,800
here you are.

581
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:16,040
Here it is.

582
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:17,190
Thank you.

583
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:18,710
But...

584
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:19,950
what is its name?

585
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:23,120
It is Big Wan.

586
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:25,950
It has a younger sister named Little Wan.

587
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:27,760
It also has an older sister.

588
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:29,870
Do you want to know its name?

589
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:31,560
It's extra-large Wan.

590
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:36,870
Little Wan.

591
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,560
It turns out you sent gems and Ferris wheels

592
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:43,000
to it, not a girl.

593
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:45,000
Who told you little Wan is a girl?

594
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,000
This is great!

595
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,910
Big Wan seems like a good hamster.

596
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:52,040
Yes, it is.

597
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,670
It seems more energetic than when it was at home.

598
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,390
How did you do that?

599
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,520
Just starve it for two meals.

600
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:02,710
What else?

601
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,630
That is a whole different subject.

602
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,670
Then teach me.

603
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,390
What happened to you?

604
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
I have something else to do, so I have to go.

605
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,190
Are your legs alright?

606
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:49,470
Shall we call the doctor for you?

607
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:50,520
It's okay.

608
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:51,470
Don't mind me.

609
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,670
But you haven't told me what your name is.

610
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,560
My name is Si Yan.

611
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:15,800
Good-bye.

612
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:19,190
Good-bye.

613
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:09,150
Jack,

614
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:11,950
are you sure this home remedy works?

615
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,520
Believe in science and do as the locals do.

616
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,120
Kudzu root powder can promote blood circulation.

617
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,150
Jack,

618
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:23,150
what do you think the poem means?

619
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,840
Why would an NPC tell a riddle?

620
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:27,800
Could it have

621
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,080
any connection with my clearance?

622
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,390
This miserable verse recalls the past 
and breaks my heart.

623
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,520
I am crazy for you but you don't know.

624
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:37,150
Untitled by Su Shi.

625
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,390
The next line is

626
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,390
"True love is rare in this world,

627
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:46,280
but sorrowful stories are everywhere."

628
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:50,230
No wonder...

629
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:52,230
Each time I encounter Prince Bao,

630
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,040
there'll be pink bubbles and background music.

631
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:55,470
It turns out that he likes me.

632
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,280
Judging from all the signs,

633
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:00,910
you have a crush on him.

634
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:03,470
Nah.

635
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:04,470
In the real world,

636
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:07,150
I've got more suitors than you can imagine.

637
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,800
But you're just a little maid here.

638
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,950
Why would the game make me

639
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:18,910
crush on someone? So weird.

640
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,000
And he's not even the manly type.

641
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,080
The game matches NPCs with missions

642
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,040
to develop the plot.

643
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,470
As your interactions with them deepen,

644
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:29,840
your predetermined relationships with them surface.

645
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:34,120
They can be your friends, lovers or enemies.

646
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:40,000
Hu Ying, Zhiqiu, Director Hua, Qi Yi.

647
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,040
I have quite a lot of enemies.

648
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,000
Starting off the romance storyline

649
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:48,280
may help you to complete tasks.

650
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:49,520
Really?

651
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,560
Then hurry and start it.

652
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,950
It doesn't matter who has a crush on whom.

653
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:56,320
Simply because of the task to reopen the Flower Feast,

654
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,710
I had to follow Qi Yi's orders,

655
00:39:57,710 --> 00:39:59,430
pointing me to the east now and the west the next second.

656
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:01,800
I was injured while on duty.

657
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,870
Do you have any ways

658
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:12,430
to hide the rashes on Qi Yi?

659
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:15,630
You can try skin wax.

660
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,000
What's that?

661
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:21,280
Black technology is better than concealer.

662
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:31,430
Skin wax, also known as plastic wax, wax for scars, etc.

663
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:33,560
It is a soft waxy substance made of

664
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,630
beeswax, pigment, cornstarch, rosin, etc.

665
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:38,520
It has a texture and color similar to human skin.

666
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:50,630
Do you mean Luna disappeared?

667
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,320
She's gone missing since last night.

668
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,320
In the room

669
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:54,870
left this handkerchief.

670
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,390
Has no one seen her?

671
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:58,950
Although Luna is very popular,

672
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,870
she is very mysterious.

673
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:02,710
I only found out last month that

674
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,080
she was making a comeback.

675
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:05,230
It is a handkerchief

676
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:07,230
specifically distributed to the maids in Palace Makeup Service.

677
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:09,230
In that year, silk was abundant,

678
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,710
so My Lady replaced the handkerchief for the maid

679
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:13,000
in Palace Makeup Service with the silk one.

680
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:43,040
This top dancer at Cloud...

681
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:45,430
