1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,590
What do you think is the way

3
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:05,230
to cover up the red rash on Prince Yi's body?

4
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:08,520
You can try skin wax.

5
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,000
There are so many pines in East Mansion.

6
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,079
Just cut them down.

7
00:02:33,829 --> 00:02:35,030
The King's Order.

8
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,030
Pines will be listed as a first-class protected species.

9
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:39,670
Cutting them down is forbidden.

10
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:44,800
What should we do then?

11
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:47,630
Mister.

12
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,190
I'll have the best rosin you have.

13
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,550
Sorry, Miss.

14
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,360
Our rosin sold out yesterday.

15
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,320
I have money.

16
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:54,110
Miss,

17
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:55,160
It really sold out.

18
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,270
It's out of stock everywhere.

19
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:56,960
Please go back.

20
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,390
Why did you drag me here?

21
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,960
I have to find rosin.

22
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,670
Prince Bao was making musical instruments lately.

23
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:06,550
He bought a lot of rosin.

24
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,600
There should still be some left.

25
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,470
Si Yan.

26
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:18,000
The system is so worried about

27
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,630
my love story line.

28
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,630
No wonder

29
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,079
I can't find any rosin anywhere.

30
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,470
Prince Bao.

31
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,720
Why are you here?

32
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,440
You still remember me, Your Highness?

33
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:28,520
Of course.

34
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,160
Did you come here just to see me?

35
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,720
I'd like to ask you a favor.

36
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:34,670
Sure.

37
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,360
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

38
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:54,190
Prince Bao.

39
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:55,470
Sometimes a favor

40
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,910
is not always necessary.

41
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,190
Two people are better than one.

42
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:02,470
And it's fun to make makeup products.

43
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,720
Is there anything else I can do for you?

44
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,520
Well, you can add a bit of loose powder to the beeswax.

45
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:10,750
Not too much.

46
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,270
OK.

47
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,230
This is the rouge.

48
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:19,670
This is the foundation.

49
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,040
Prince Bao.

50
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,040
You

51
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,160
just sit tight.

52
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,880
I'll take care of the rest, okay?

53
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,390
Eat chestnuts.

54
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,880
Who made this?

55
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:39,320
It's breaking my teeth.

56
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:42,640
Me.

57
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:50,640
Actually,

58
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,390
It's quite tasty.

59
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:53,000
The more I chew,

60
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,720
the better it tastes.

61
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,510
Prince Bao,

62
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,880
Actually, you don't have to put yourself to inconvenience.

63
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,390
No, no.

64
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,350
In the future,

65
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:04,270
if you make something bad,

66
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,350
whether it's fried chestnuts or something else,

67
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,270
just give it to me.

68
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,440
And Big Wan and Little Wan.

69
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,440
We'll take care of them for you.

70
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,110
Thank you, Prince Bao.

71
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,720
In fact, in the past,

72
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,110
my mother used to cook for me

73
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:18,350
on my birthday.

74
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,550
But unfortunately

75
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:21,270
I didn't eat it for a few years.

76
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,110
My mother left.

77
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:24,070
So I didn't have a chance to improve my skills.

78
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,600
Sorry.

79
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,230
Don't think too much.

80
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,040
My mother is just separated from my father.

81
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,510
I live with my father.

82
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,320
How can your parents be separated?

83
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:37,390
Did your father leave your mother?

84
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,480
To be precise,

85
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:41,670
It's my mother who left my father.

86
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:43,790
I've never heard about this kind of thing.

87
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,720
In my hometown,

88
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,790
It is quite common.

89
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,390
Si Yan.

90
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:54,640
Your hometown must be very different from here.

91
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:01,270
Yes.

92
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,880
I didn't think it was when I first came here.

93
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,230
But when you say that,

94
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:09,070
I think my hometown is really nice.

95
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:14,320
When can I go back?

96
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,350
Si Yan,

97
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:17,830
You're so interesting.

98
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:24,000
You can't do this.

99
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,760
What is this?

100
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,230
I can do it.

101
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:26,230
Let me try again.

102
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,510
What are they doing?

103
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,510
It's daytime. They're so shameless!

104
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,760
Let's go.

105
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:38,159
Where are these portraits from?

106
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:39,950
I've asked Lady Cui.

107
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,110
She said

108
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:43,640
they were painted by a boy named Qing Yan from the Procurement Department.

109
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,350
Did you check with the register?

110
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,390
There is indeed such a person in the Dressing Bureau.

111
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,270
His identity and background are traceable.

112
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:51,640
Where is he?

113
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:55,000
He returned to his hometown ten years ago.

114
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:56,950
I've sent someone to find out.

115
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,830
I believe we'll soon find out where he is.

116
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:01,350
The portraits have been kept for so long by Lady Cui.

117
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,880
There must be a reason.

118
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:04,350
Si Yan

119
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:05,350
is really something.

120
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,790
I heard that our Prince Bao is being attracted by her.

121
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:09,880
She's just so so, in my opinion.

122
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,920
She's not pretty at all.

123
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,320
She is good at wearing make-up.

124
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:12,760
Maybe

125
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,350
she's wearing some kind of foxy makeup.

126
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,480
and charming Prince Bao.

127
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,600
It's

128
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,440
a luxury for us to see Prince Bao.

129
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,390
But she

130
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:21,040
pester him continually.

131
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,920
It's that Si Yan again.

132
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,720
The other day

133
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,830
She swore she'd help you with your rash.

134
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:30,230
And now she's hitting on Prince Bao.

135
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,550
She's really something.

136
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:35,110
How can you believe her words so easily?

137
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,110
She's just looking for an excuse

138
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:38,000
to get the hairpin back.

139
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:49,440
Bro Yi.

140
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,510
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

141
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:51,200
Give me a hand.

142
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,320
What are you doing?

143
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,320
I've got the best cakes in East City.

144
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:00,950
都搜罗来了

145
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:02,200
Bro Yi, you are a picky eater.

146
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,830
Help me try which one is the best.

147
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:06,160
Come on.

148
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:12,920
Is it delicious?

149
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,000
Try this.

150
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,790
Is this one good?

151
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,920
You like it.

152
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,350
Si Yan must like it too.

153
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:34,440
You gave this to Si Yan?

154
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:37,000
You know Si Yan too?

155
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,000
It's finally done.

156
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,840
I advise you to stay away from that lady-in-waiting.

157
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,320
She's got a lot on her mind.

158
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,400
Don't be taken advantage of.

159
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,230
Bro Yi, you may have misunderstood.

160
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:49,200
Si Yan and I are just good friends.

161
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,470
There's no such thing as taking advantage.

162
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,590
People approach you

163
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:52,520
for your status.

164
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:54,350
You treat her as a friend.

165
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:55,150
But what about her?

166
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,000
Si Yan.

167
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,710
Why do you

168
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,080
deliberately target me again and again.

169
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:10,080
If you had followed the rules,

170
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,400
I wouldn't have targeted you.

171
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,470
You Talk badly about others behind their backs.

172
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:15,960
Don't you feel embarrassed?

173
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:17,470
There are no secrets in this house.

174
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,550
Everything you say and do

175
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:19,550
will be seen by others.

176
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,200
If I'm not embarrassed,

177
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,230
who would dare to be embarrassed?

178
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:33,350
I thought

179
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,110
you know what it's like to be hurt by gossip.

180
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,200
But then I realized

181
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,080
you're no different from those who do it.

182
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,640
Qi Yi is such a villain.

183
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:56,960
I was kind enough to help him with wax.

184
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,320
He is ungrateful.

185
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,230
How dare he slander me?

186
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:03,000
Let him destroy himself!

187
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,440
What you said

188
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:08,230
usually means to leave him alone

189
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:09,520
and let him run his own course.

190
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,440
But Qi Yi

191
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,150
is currently a key part of the mission.

192
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,280
If you let him run his own course,

193
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,550
your mission is in danger of perishing.

194
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,880
Could you please not play the single rhyme at this point?

195
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,080
You must have some way

196
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:24,960
for me to avoid Qi Yi.

197
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,710
and complete my mission, right?

198
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,520
You...

199
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,000
Si Yan hasn't completed his mission yet.

200
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:42,200
Why did the system change the settings?

201
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,280
How did this happen?

202
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,960
Report!

203
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:30,520
Urgent news.

204
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,320
News has arrived from the border.

205
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:32,880
General Min has won a great victory.

206
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:33,880
Good!

207
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,080
Send the order.

208
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,520
Reward the three armies.

209
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,520
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

210
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,760
General Min has done a great job.

211
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:47,000
Reward him with three years' salary and the title of Marquis.

212
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:49,230
Father.

213
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,470
Why not take this opportunity to

214
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:52,880
to reopen the flower feast for Miss Min

215
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,790
as a token of celebration for General Min.

216
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:57,200
This is a good idea.

217
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:59,520
Since we've won the war at the border.

218
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,110
We should have a good time at home.

219
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:05,110
Yes.

220
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,280
The flower feast has been reopened.

221
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,440
As long as I don't help that bastard,

222
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,280
I'm happy.

223
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,550
I investigated the lotus pattern on the envelope.

224
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,550
I found out that the system NPC

225
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:21,030
has no character to match it.

226
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:22,910
Jack.

227
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,400
Can you check the lotus pattern for me?

228
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,280
I have some questions.

229
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:43,200
What does it mean?

230
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:46,520
There may be other players.

231
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,280
Other players?

232
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:04,200
The rash on the Prince Yi is still very bad.

233
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,350
What is Your Highness planning to do?

234
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,910
Since the Flower Feast is going to reopen,

235
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,880
we can't waste this opportunity.

236
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:12,790
Are Your Highness going to...

237
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:17,590
There will be a good show soon.

238
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,710
I didn't realize there were so many people who wanted to harm him.

239
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,590
It looks like he's going to be in trouble.

240
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:36,710
You're worried about him.

241
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,280
How can I be?

242
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,470
What does it matter to me what happens to him?

243
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:44,880
I'm leaving. Prince Bao is still waiting for me.

244
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:50,790
You've just

245
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:52,520
built them a dreamland!

246
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,790
Big Wan and Little Wan

247
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,150
have been dispirited for the past few days.

248
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:01,230
Please take a look at them for me.

249
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:08,200
You're feeding them like this.

250
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,520
Of course they're dispirited.

251
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,670
At this point,

252
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,590
You should make them feel safe in their environment

253
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,960
and give them a sense of space.

254
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:18,880
In plain words this means

255
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:20,150
let them play on their own.

256
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,080
You see?

257
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:31,000
Really, you're the right person to call.

258
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:41,670
Here it goes again.

259
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,910
But he's really handsome.

260
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:03,400
Si Yan.

261
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:05,280
Si Yan.

262
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,280
Are you okay?

263
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,400
I'm fine.

264
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,230
I'm used to being played with like this.

265
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:15,000
Are you still angry with Brother Yi?

266
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,640
It's true that he spoke badly that day.

267
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,350
But he didn't mean to offend.

268
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,520
I'm just a servant girl.

269
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,110
How dare I be angry with my master?

270
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,110
Actually, he wasn't like this before.

271
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:37,790
He was the most troublemaker in the house.

272
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,400
The naughtiest one.

273
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,400
He could be considered the king of the house.

274
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,150
He loved me the most.

275
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:48,350
When I was little,

276
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:49,520
I didn't like to stay in the house.

277
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,030
He would sneak me out of the house with him.

278
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,670
When he saw something unjust,

279
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,710
he'd get into a fight even if he disguised himself.

280
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,910
And we'd come back in a mess.

281
00:15:58,910 --> 00:15:59,960
and be punished by my father.

282
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:01,550
He was the one who smiled,

283
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,520
but didn't admit anything.

284
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,960
In fact, I envy him.

285
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,230
All the servants and maids in the house

286
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:12,440
all like to be around him.

287
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,840
As if whatever he did,

288
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,200
he could bring happiness to everyone around him.

289
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,150
What you are talking about

290
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,230
is this the same person I know?

291
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,910
After brother Teng died,

292
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,280
brother Yi was different.

293
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,400
He didn't smile like he used to.

294
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,590
He no longer confides in anyone so easily,

295
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:41,470
nor did he trust anyone anymore.

296
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:45,000
He is becoming more and more like brother Teng.

297
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,910
He is table and understanding.

298
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,320
The only thing he hasn't changed is

299
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,400
he still loves me the most.

300
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,150
That's why he said what he said.

301
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,280
Don't take it seriously.

302
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:18,560
Cancel

303
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:19,880
this year's flower feast.

304
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,230
Mother.

305
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:23,950
I'm determined to marry Miss Min.

306
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,760
I hope Your Highness will understand.

307
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,920
Actually, Brother Yi wasn't like this before.

308
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,110
He was the most troublemaker in the house.

309
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:35,680
He was the most naughty one.

310
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,280
What you are talking about

311
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,040
is the same person I know?

312
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,520
Don't talk to anyone about

313
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,760
what happened tonight.

314
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,640
Get out.

315
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,800
After brother Teng died,

316
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,040
brother Yi was different.

317
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,230
He didn't smile like he used to.

318
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:54,350
He no longer confided in anyone so easily,

319
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:57,110
nor did he trust anyone anymore.

320
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,040
The rash on Prince Yi's body

321
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,160
is still very serious.

322
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,920
What is Your Highness going to do?

323
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:06,710
There will be a good show soon.

324
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:16,920
Wang.

325
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,110
It's time to apply the medicine.

326
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:41,230
Give me back my hairpin.

327
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:42,760
From now on, we will not interfere in each other's business.

328
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,190
My lord.

329
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:00,920
You...

330
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:13,590
I thought you'd fallen.

331
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,640
The other day,

332
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,920
the swarm of bees that broke into the Private Garden

333
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:17,950
has broken in again.

334
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:19,680
Go and see.

335
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:21,640
It's the bees again.

336
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:23,280
Don't worry, Your Highness.

337
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:24,350
No matter what kind of bees they are,

338
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:26,040
I can catch them all.

339
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,190
What are you doing sneaking around?

340
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,800
It's my bad luck that you got me today.

341
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,000
But I'm very generous.

342
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,190
Use it.

343
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:58,560
It'll cover up your rash.

344
00:19:59,160 --> 00:19:59,800
What's wrong with you?

345
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:01,560
I've done this to you.

346
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,880
But you want to cover up my rash?

347
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:04,400
Do I dare use it?

348
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,520
Do you think these little tricks

349
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,520
can hurt me?

350
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,190
I'm doing this for our beauty

351
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:11,520
to be readored at the flower feast.

352
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,430
I'm trying.

353
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:13,800
Let's say.

354
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:15,520
Even if I'm idle,

355
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,800
helping someone like you who is heartless,

356
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:18,710
is still good for everyone.

357
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:23,760
Wait a minute.

358
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,310
What's wrong?

359
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,800
Be gentle.

360
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:57,680
I haven't even started yet.

361
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,070
Hold on.

362
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:28,470
Look at this.

363
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,800
It's amazing what this wax can do.

364
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:42,430
Remember what I said?

365
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,190
What are you laughing at?

366
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:03,310
I was thinking.

367
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,680
If at this moment,

368
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,230
Wang came bursting in,

369
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,520
and saw the two of us together like this,

370
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:11,190
I wonder what kind of face he'd make.

371
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,640
Why don't you turn around?

372
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,040
Can I ask you a question?

373
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,110
Go ahead.

374
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:06,160
Why do you care so much about the Flower Feast

375
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,400
and hide your illness?

376
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,350
You are the Prince Yi.

377
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:11,920
Why do you make it so difficult for yourself?

378
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,070
It's because I'm the Prince.

379
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,680
I have no choice.

380
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:21,640
And I can't make any mistakes.

381
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:24,760
Who says a Prince can't make mistakes?

382
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,680
I'm born that way.

383
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,230
In fact, you're all quite pathetic.

384
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,880
You may seem to be in high position.

385
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,800
But you're just puppets to be manipulated.

386
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,000
Then why are you helping me?

387
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:50,160
I...

388
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:53,310
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

389
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:56,400
The Flower Feast

390
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,280
is an important barrier to my destiny.

391
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:00,160
I must pass it.

392
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,710
Otherwise...

393
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:03,880
Otherwise what?

394
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,310
Or I'll die.

395
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,350
It's just a book.

396
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,310
How long do I have to find it?

397
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:37,350
Why it is so hard to find a prop?

398
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:42,110
But luckily,

399
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:43,230
I'm very lucky

400
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:44,280
if you'll help me.

401
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,040
What?

402
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,190
A new trick

403
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,470
to get sympathy?

404
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,400
Done.

405
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,710
What a master's work!

406
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:20,590
So detailed.

407
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:23,040
So plants can also be used as make-up.

408
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:25,590
You don't even know this?

409
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:27,920
How can you be a maid in the Palace Makeup Service?

410
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,190
You are so arrogant.

411
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:32,760
Let me borrow this.

412
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,040
No way.

413
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:36,590
My lord.

414
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:37,680
It's time to drink your medicine.

415
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:39,950
You...

416
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:42,160
I...

417
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:43,830
I'll leave now.

418
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:44,470
Stop!

419
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,230
The book.

420
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:50,040
I'm here to borrow a book.

421
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:50,950
Yes.

422
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:52,800
Prince Yi.

423
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,640
It's getting late.

424
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,590
You should get some rest.

425
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,950
My hairpin.

426
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,830
How did she get this book?

427
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:26,680
Who is there?

428
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:36,230
Wang is so annoying.

429
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,430
I've been doing chores for so long.

430
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,160
I'm sorry about that.

431
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,640
I'm the one who's sorry.

432
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:54,920
I didn't scare you, did I?

433
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:56,160
No.

434
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,000
I know you.

435
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:01,000
I haven't had a chance to thank Miss Min and you yet.

436
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,000
Last time at the posting station.

437
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,560
You drew well.

438
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,590
You had a very special idea.

439
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,470
I think I have a good eye too.

440
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,800
It's good we're related.

441
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:16,830
If there's any makeup work from Miss Min,

442
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:17,760
I'll be there for you.

443
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,070
You'll be rewarded.

444
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,800
It's getting late.

445
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:25,040
You should go home and get some rest.

446
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,560
Tomorrow's Flower Feast

447
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,710
will be busy.

448
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,190
Okay.

449
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:53,070
The new player's route overlaps with Si Yan's.

450
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:20,430
You're so pretty!

451
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:21,920
At Today's Flower Feast,

452
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,950
I'm sure you'll be the best of all

453
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:25,590
and be adored by the King.

454
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:27,710
I'm flattered, sister.

455
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,350
Who wouldn't know?

456
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,560
Among all the ladies,

457
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,920
Lady Wei

458
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,590
is the youngest and most beautiful.

459
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:37,350
We're about to leave but she hasn't come yet.

460
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,760
I don't think she'd dare go to

461
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,430
the Flower Feast today.

462
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,760
After all, her face is...

463
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,640
I'm looking forward to it.

464
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,830
She's been in seclusion for so long.

465
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:51,560
I don't know what she's become.

466
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:58,920
Tangier.

467
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,680
Are you ok?

468
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,350
Where is Lady Wei?

469
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:04,520
Zhiqiu took Lady Wei to the back room to touch up and change her clothes.

470
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:06,230
I just saw...

471
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:09,830
This is the powder box for Lady Wei.

472
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,310
Oh, no!

473
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:27,760
Stop!

474
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:30,920
Are all the servants of the Trust Pavilion so blind?

475
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:32,640
You don't even say hello when you meet us.

476
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,590
Greetings to all the ladies.

477
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,590
Wait!

478
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:40,430
Are you allowed to leave?

479
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:41,680
You're impolite.

480
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,400
What's going on?

481
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,520
Second Lady.

482
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,230
Second Lady.

483
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,230
Lady Qian is kind-hearted.

484
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:54,040
The Flower Feast is about to begin.

485
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,070
She even took the trouble to teach me the rules.

486
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:57,760
I'm really touched.

487
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,350
How dare you sneer at me?

488
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,920
The Second Lady is here.

489
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,190
How dare I?

490
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:04,430
All right, all right.

491
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,830
From now on,

492
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:08,830
you'll have to behave yourself.

493
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,760
After all, you can't

494
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:12,920
mock the ladies.

495
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:14,280
You can go away now.

496
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:15,950
Yes, madam.

497
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:19,950
You...

498
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:21,190
Come on, sister.

499
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,070
The Flower Feast is about to begin.

500
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:25,040
Why be angry with a little maid?

501
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:36,190
Lady!

502
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:38,430
Lady!

503
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,520
Come down first.

504
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,430
Si Yan, let go of me!

505
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:42,400
I'll die now.

506
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,920
I don't want to live anymore.

507
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:46,430
Lady, don't do this!

508
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:47,470
Come down first!

509
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,880
I trusted Zhiqiu so much.

510
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,590
How dare she collaborate with others to harm me?

511
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:52,430
Didn't they want to see me become a laughing stock? Just do it!

512
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:53,830
I'll show them and die now!

513
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:55,520
Lady.

514
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:56,160
Is face important?

515
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,310
Or is life more important?

516
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,040
Zhiqiu betrayed you.

517
00:30:59,040 --> 00:30:59,950
I'm still here, aren't I?

518
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,000
Don't worry.

519
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:02,680
I will

520
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,830
fight for you.

521
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,280
Do you really have a solution?

522
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:13,560
Sister.

523
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,830
You don't know.

524
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:17,160
That little girl is very rude and domineering.

525
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,310
She has no regard for her master.

526
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,880
I don't know

527
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,560
is she taught by the Lady Wei?

528
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:23,640
Sister.

529
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,520
Don't bother with a little maid.

530
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:26,920
You can't just

531
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:28,880
ruin her future.

532
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,400
Yes.

533
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,110
Sister you're so kind-hearted.

534
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:34,350
But here's something

535
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,430
I shouldn't have said.

536
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:37,950
I heard that

537
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:40,710
This little maid not only has a relationship with the Prince Yi,

538
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:45,230
she's also been getting on well with our Prince Bao.

539
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:47,830
Prince Yi is always calm and collected.

540
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:49,400
Why would he get involved with a maid?

541
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:51,350
Sister Qian.

542
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,760
Don't keep gossiping

543
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:55,560
at this point.

544
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,350
If the First Lady heard about it,

545
00:31:58,310 --> 00:32:00,560
it's not a big deal if the maid is expelled.

546
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,800
But if Miss Min's marriage is ruined,

547
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:05,230
the Prince Yi will hold a grudge.

548
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,070
You will have troubles then.

549
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,400
As for our Prince Bao,

550
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:13,350
he hasn't grown up yet.

551
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,470
Whoever he is with

552
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:16,470
is just like those little things in his cage.

553
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Don't worry about it.

554
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,000
Yes, madam.

555
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:22,520
Ladies.

556
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,760
The carriage is waiting at the door.

557
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:34,040
Where's her ladyship?

558
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,350
I can't believe she's not here for the Flower Feast.

559
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:36,280
Who's going to do my make-up?

560
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:38,470
I'm going to be a showstopper today!

561
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,880
Can you look at the road, man?

562
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:48,040
Your ladyship, we're here.

563
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:35,520
Look!

564
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,350
How handsome the princes are!

565
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,830
How about he sword dance?

566
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,760
Are you all set?

567
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,040
Of course we're ready.

568
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,470
Don't worry, brother.

569
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:57,190
We won't be any better than you.

570
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,310
I don't think so.

571
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,470
Yi.

572
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:02,760
You'll have to do well later.

573
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:05,520
I won't let you down.

574
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:16,429
The King is here.

575
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,120
The First Lady is here.

576
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,630
Greetings, Your Majesty.

577
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:26,760
Greetings, farther and mother.

578
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,469
Please take your seats.

579
00:34:33,909 --> 00:34:35,120
The Flower Feast

580
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:37,469
is held every year.

581
00:34:39,389 --> 00:34:40,389
But this year's

582
00:34:40,949 --> 00:34:42,429
is very significant.

583
00:34:43,469 --> 00:34:45,040
The borders of the East City

584
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:47,560
has not been peaceful lately.

585
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,360
Thanks to General Min,

586
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:51,840
who was able to retreat the enemy,

587
00:34:53,389 --> 00:34:55,469
our morale is strengthened.

588
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:58,320
Miss Min.

589
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,840
Today, you'll take the credit for your father.

590
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:04,910
Cheers.

591
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,040
Where has Miss Min?

592
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,320
Why isn't she back yet?

593
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,230
I'm sorry about that.

594
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,910
My face is hopeless.

595
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,040
Your ladyship.

596
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:26,800
I promise to make you look amazing.

597
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,360
Didn't Lady Wei say she was coming today?

598
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:35,150
Your Majesty.

599
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,520
I have no idea.

600
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,600
I just heard the Lady said

601
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,560
she doesn't want to come to the Flower Feast.

602
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,120
Let's go, lady.

603
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,710
When the King sees me like this,

604
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:58,320
will he think I'm ugly?

605
00:36:58,910 --> 00:36:59,760
Whether you are good-looking or not.

606
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,710
Just ask the King by yourself.

607
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:01,560
You'll know then.

608
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,190
But...

609
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:02,760
Hurry up.

610
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,280
Let's go.

611
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,600
The Lady Wei has always been like this.

612
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:10,230
She is backed by the favor from the King,

613
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:12,910
and held herself aloof.

614
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:14,800
When the King ordered,

615
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,150
she repeatedly excused herself,

616
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:19,080
and claimed she had a rotten face.

617
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:20,430
In my opinion,

618
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:23,630
she just won't open her heart to you

619
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:25,600
and see you more often.

620
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:26,430
Go.

621
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,670
Bring me Lady Wei.

622
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,120
She must come even if she doesn't want.

623
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,910
I must see her.

624
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,120
Lady Wei is here.

625
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,120
I haven't seen Your Majesty for a long time.

626
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,840
I was nervous,

627
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,390
so I was delayed.

628
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:17,800
I beg

629
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,760
your pardon.

630
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,280
Are you

631
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,600
drunk?

632
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,600
My sister has not been out for a long time.

633
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,910
I'm afraid you drink to strengthen your courage.

634
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:46,040
This is specially painted for her lady.

635
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,280
A drunken face with rouge.

636
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,630
Lady Wei hasn't seen Your Majesty for a long time.

637
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:50,710
and has missed you so much.

638
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,390
Now she has seen Your Majesty.

639
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:53,910
Her state of mind

640
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,430
is just like this intoxicating makeup.

641
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:58,840
She is not drunk in wine, but in love.

642
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,600
Exactly.

643
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:06,120
It has a good meaning.

644
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:07,360
I like it.

645
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,320
Lady Wei.

646
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:10,760
Today,

647
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:13,120
you will pour wine for me.

648
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:16,150
It's a perfect match for your makeup.

649
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,670
Yes, Your Majesty.

650
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:36,840
Be careful what you say.

651
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,470
Lady Qian is innocent.

652
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:41,910
You're the one who has to be a treacherous servant.

653
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,150
Go now!

654
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:09,950
Your lady.

655
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:11,390
Where have you been?

656
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:12,870
I was scared to death.

657
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:13,670
What are you afraid of?

658
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:14,470
I'm here, aren't I?

659
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:17,950
How could this happen?

660
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:20,390
Where's your rash?

661
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:27,120
Da.

662
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:30,840
It's my mistake.

663
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:31,560
I've spoiled everyone's fun.

664
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,430
I beg your forgiveness, Father.

665
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,800
I thought you would improve.

666
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,320
I didn't expect

667
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,870
even your swordplay has regressed.

668
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:39,670
You've really...

669
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:42,870
Mother Huang.

670
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:43,430
Yi.

671
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:43,870
Get some clothes.

672
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:45,600
Are you hurt?

673
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:48,710
I'm fine.

674
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:50,040
Thank you for your concern.

675
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:52,630
Brother was just in a hurry.

676
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:54,080
Please don't blame him.

677
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:55,320
It's my fault.

678
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,840
Don't speak for me, Yi.

679
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:13,630
Ungrateful soul.

680
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:17,630
Your Highness.

681
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:19,150
Take this and wipe your sweat.

682
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:20,910
So you don't catch a cold.

683
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,360
Miss Min is more delicate than a flower.

684
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,470
Together with Prince Yi,

685
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:41,000
what a lovely couple!

686
00:42:46,870 --> 00:42:47,870
Sister Min.

00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:50,520
Why are you only wiping Brother Yi's sweat?

688
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:52,560
I'm sweating too.

689
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:53,870
Bao.

690
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:54,910
Stop it!

691
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,560
It's good to be young.

692
00:43:08,470 --> 00:43:09,360
Hello everyone.

693
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:11,360
I'm your TikTok host, Chestnut.

694
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,230
Like me,

695
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:14,840
I put on a mask before I apply my makeup.

696
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:18,670
This UNIFON amino acid mud mask

697
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:21,000
is for deep cleansing and long-lasting oil control.

698
00:43:21,710 --> 00:43:23,000
It's a very good choice!
