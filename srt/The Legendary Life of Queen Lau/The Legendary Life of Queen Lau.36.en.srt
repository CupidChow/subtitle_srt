169
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,390
Was there something wrong with the liquor?

170
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:53,320
Wait for a moment.

171
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,670
Something was wrong with the liquor?

172
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,670
The men and women didn't sit
at the same table that day.

173
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:04,440
The liquor that the men drank
was infused with herbs

174
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,440
with higher alcohol content.

175
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,950
The liquor that the women drank

176
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:09,350
was the osmanthus rice wine made by Mrs. Niu.

177
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:10,390
It was sweet and fragrant.

178
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,790
His Majesty said
that he would be gone for just a day.

179
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:33,200
But he's still not back yet.

180
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,270
Did something happen to him?

181
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,720
I should've applied

182
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,110
to be His Majesty's escort.

183
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:37,790
Even if His Majesty was going to bring someone,

184
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,390
he should bring me, the guard.

185
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,720
Why would he need a chef?

186
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:42,670
You can't say that.

187
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:44,110
When you are outside,

188
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:45,320
food is more important.

189
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,760
Look at what you cook every day.

190
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,880
Your food is not exciting at all.

191
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,070
Leave, the God of Plague.

192
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,510
Go away!

193
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,110
What is happening here?

194
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:57,790
Go away!

195
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,670
Go away!

196
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,720
-What plague?
-What's happening here?

197
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,550
Leave, the God of Plague!

198
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,110
Go away!

199
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,790
What are you doing?

200
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:14,320
What are they doing?

201
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,320
Go away!

202
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,440
What is happening here?

203
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,270
Stop right there!

204
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:20,440
Who are you?

205
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,640
I am the Imperial Bodyguard, Su Jingtang.

206
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:25,070
I am the Imperial Chef, Chai Tiezhou.

207
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,760
-Let us in.
-Let us in.

208
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,880
No one is allowed to enter!

[Double Happiness]

211
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:41,400
You can read this?

212
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,000
I don't have to read it.

213
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:44,910
Village Head had read it to me so many times.

214
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,400
Tell me about it then.

215
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,470
Okay. I'll tell you about it.

216
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:52,470
This is about the curse of Xianpa Village.

217
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,640
According to legend, a long time ago,

218
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:01,030
the women of Xianpa Village were cursed.

219
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,400
On their wedding night,

220
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:06,590
their husband would die.

221
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:38,000
When they were cursed,

222
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:42,150
the women would perform
an offering ritual to the Gods

223
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,760
and attempt to break the curse.

224
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:49,110
But no matter how much they plead to the Gods,

225
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:52,320
they couldn't break the curse.

226
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,320
The men would still die

227
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,590
after seven days.

228
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,520
Okay. I'm done.

229
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:02,350
That's it?

230
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:04,840
This is already enough to affect everyone.

231
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:07,110
You don't believe in this curse?

232
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:08,440
Of course I don't believe it.

233
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,640
If the curse was real,

234
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,200
there would be no men in this village.

235
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,350
But we have men who are alive here.

236
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,350
Since there are men who are alive here,

237
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,640
why will they believe

238
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,640
in this ridiculous curse?

239
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:19,000
Do you hear yourself?

240
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,960
This is like asking a fool

241
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,000
why he does stupid things.

242
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,230
It's pointless.

243
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:24,880
They are foolish.

244
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,590
That's why they are so gullible.

245
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:27,960
You can't talk sense into them.

246
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,350
In the end, the women
are the ones who are suffering.

247
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,710
Did someone really die
during their wedding night?

248
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,640
Mrs. Niu's husband

249
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,080
died during their wedding night.

250
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,470
What happened?

251
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,320
Don't tell me that you believe it.

252
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:44,910
Of course I don't believe it.

253
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:47,000
But it doesn't matter that we don't believe it.

254
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,470
We have to make them see the truth as well.

255
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:53,350
Let's continue to read it.

256
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:16,520
Yongfu.

257
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:18,960
Xianpa Village...

258
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,200
Xianpa Village is doing well.

259
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,080
Is the letter

260
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,840
telling you about how awesome Xianpa Village is?

261
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:28,350
Not only that,

262
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,790
it's written here
that the curse of Xianpa Village

263
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,880
has come back again.

264
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,440
His Majesty

265
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,080
is dead?

266
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:46,670
What nonsense are you talking about?

267
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,520
I'm still alive. How can he be dead?

268
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,910
Just now, you said

269
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:51,840
that the curse has come back again.

270
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,880
It means

271
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,710
that the death of the husbands will begin again.

272
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:55,760
Jinfeng

273
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,590
has just brought His Majesty there, right?

274
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,350
Don't panic.

275
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,710
According to the letter,

276
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:04,710
all the men in the village are sick.

277
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:10,320
What a disaster!

278
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,000
Yongfu, let me finish.

279
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,350
Tell me then.

280
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,320
The whole village has been sealed off for now.

281
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:20,350
His Majesty and Jinfeng are fine for now.

282
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,590
They are fine.

283
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:23,350
And then?

284
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:26,880
But they chose to stay there

285
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:28,350
to deal with the issue.

286
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:33,960
Now, I'm not that worried anymore.

287
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:38,590
As I said,

288
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,470
a dragon and a phoenix

289
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,840
won't be defeated by a curse.

290
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,230
But I think this curse
has gotten even more serious.

291
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:51,910
It was supposed to happen
during the wedding night only.

292
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,880
Why are all of them sick right now?

293
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:07,230
Grand Chancellor.

294
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:10,590
Why isn't His Majesty here again?

295
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:13,080
Can you let us meet His Majesty?

296
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:14,910
That's right.

297
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:16,790
He is the Emperor,

298
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,760
how can he be so irresponsible

299
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,350
by skipping the morning assembly for days?

300
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:22,350
That's right.

301
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:24,840
What do you mean, Official Luo?

302
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,200
His Majesty has worked hard
to build a strong nation

303
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,520
to bring prosperity to the empire.

304
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,280
Despite being young,

305
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,840
he resolved the internal strife issue
caused by Xiyue Empire.

306
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,670
Now, our borders are secured

307
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,080
and the people are living in peace.

308
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:39,590
Even if His Majesty
attends the morning assembly,

309
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:41,880
the reports that you have with you

310
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,400
are just about some trivial matters.

311
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,230
You can't even solve the issues by yourself.

312
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:49,640
And you want to bother His Majesty
with these trivial affairs?

313
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,520
No wonder His Majesty can't attend
the assembly because of his severe headache.

314
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,670
If you want to blame someone,

315
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:55,710
you can only blame yourselves.

316
00:13:59,080 --> 00:13:59,550
Grand Chancellor.

317
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:01,320
Look. Everything has changed.

318
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,400
Why did the Grand Chancellor defend His Majesty?

319
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,790
Right?

320
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,000
This is so strange.

321
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:08,110
Jinfeng!

322
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:08,840
Yu'er.

323
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,840
We had collected some food
from a few families just now

324
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,760
for you and His Majesty.

325
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,400
If we seal off the village for a few more days,

326
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,840
we'll be tight on food.

327
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,760
Everyone is equal here.

328
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,910
You can't give us all the food.

329
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:20,080
Well...

330
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,030
Distribute

331
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,520
the food to everyone.

332
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,910
We just need this.

333
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:24,960
Okay.

334
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,840
I'll get going then.

335
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,520
Go.

336
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:31,710
Everyone is equal.

337
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:33,520
Is that another rule of Xianpa Village?

338
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,670
That's not a rule.

339
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:36,320
That's just common sense, isn't it?

340
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,790
Everyone is equal.

341
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:39,150
What is it?

342
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:40,790
Do you think that you are so noble
because you are the Emperor?

343
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:42,670
You still have to wear a mask
to guard yourself against the disease.

344
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,150
Do you know that what you said

345
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,910
is punishable by death?

346
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,440
I've said a lot of things
that are punishable by death.

347
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,350
But I'm still alive.

348
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,350
What does it mean?

349
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,910
It means that you are too tough.

350
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,080
It means that you know what I said makes sense

351
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,440
and you can't bear to kill me.

352
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:05,880
I know what's wrong.

353
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:08,520
Have you washed your hands?

354
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:14,030
Wuyu Grass?

355
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,840
You know it?

356
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,960
Is the disease related to it?

357
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,000
That's right.

358
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:21,320
But to be accurate,

359
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,350
it's a plague.

360
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,710
A rat who accidentally ate the Wuyu Grass

361
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:26,320
bit Yu'er's husband.

362
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,080
He didn't think much about it

363
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,960
and attended Xianpa Village's Hundred Feast.

364
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:31,520
During the feast,
the men and women sat at different tables.

365
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,910
So, the men got infected.

366
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:34,350
The Wuyu Grass is the cause of it.

367
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:35,150
No.

368
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:36,320
The rat just ate some Wuyu Grass.

369
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,230
How did it turn into a plague?

370
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:40,790
I asked Laba about it.

371
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,880
Laba said that before this, the villagers

372
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,760
burned the stalks of some ground sorghum
to kill the rats.

373
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,910
What is ground sorghum?

374
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:48,960
Ground sorghum is a local millet
from Xianpa Village.

375
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,150
I think those rats ate the Wuyu Grass

376
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,440
and the ground sorghum at the same time.

377
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,230
Those two things are not poisonous.

378
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:55,520
But when they are combined,

379
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,520
they'll become highly toxic.

380
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,200
I understand now.

381
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,710
So, the rats were infected first.

382
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:01,790
Then, one rat bit a person.

383
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:03,320
So, the person was infected too.

384
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,000
Then, he spread it

385
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,320
to the people who ate together with him.

386
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:06,200
Am I right?

387
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,710
Yes. That's right.

388
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,960
The issue is solved then.

389
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,470
If that's the case,

390
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:14,440
you can just develop the cure and save them.

391
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,280
It's not that simple.

392
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,470
To develop a cure,

393
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:19,790
I need to find out the properties of the toxin.

394
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:21,900
Then, I'll have to find the herbs
that can neutralize the toxin

395
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,300
to make a cure out of them.

396
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,490
Usually, you can't develop a cure

397
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:26,780
in less than a dozen days.

398
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:28,980
You are not an ordinary person.

399
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,100
With your wisdom,

400
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,460
you can develop a cure within half a day.

401
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,610
You know me best.

402
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:41,900
Your Majesty.

403
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:42,540
Did you hear

404
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:43,610
what we said?

405
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,170
Yes.

406
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:47,100
I got it.

407
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:48,660
We have a cure now.

408
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,050
What are you thinking about then?

409
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:51,930
The other issue.

410
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:02,930
What does this mean?

411
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:08,300
This is the Wuyu Grass.

412
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:10,330
And this is the ground sorghum.

413
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:11,210
Nonsense.

414
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:12,820
Of course I know how to reach these words.

415
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:14,130
I just want to know why he wrote them.

416
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,850
Do you remember the story
of the village chronicles?

417
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:19,780
You told me that according
to the legend of Xianpa Village,

418
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,180
during the wedding night,

419
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:22,610
after the cross-cupped wine ceremony,

420
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:24,540
the men would die because of the women.

421
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:27,180
According to the tradition of Xianpa Village,

422
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:29,060
do you always add the Wuyu Grass

423
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,540
during the cross-cupped wine ceremony?

424
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:31,450
That's right.

425
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:35,820
Ground sorghum is Xianpa Village's specialty.

426
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:37,490
It is often used to make liquor.

427
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,580
I think those who died

428
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,210
were probably poisoned

429
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:42,540
by the combination of Wuyu Grass

430
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,450
and ground sorghum.

431
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:46,610
Hurry up and spit it out.

432
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:46,970
Hurry up!

433
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:47,970
What should I spit out?

434
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:49,130
Spit out the liquor!

435
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:51,580
Take a seat first.

436
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:52,130
Calm down.

437
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,780
The liquor I drank is from the palace.

438
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:55,450
It's not poisonous.

439
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:56,540
That's right.

440
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,300
You scared me.

441
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,130
As I said,

442
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:00,020
you are so fortunate. You will live a long life.

443
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:03,450
Your analysis makes sense.

444
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,250
But why did someone die while some didn't

445
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:07,300
during the wedding night?

446
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,820
I think it has something to do with the liquor.

447
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,180
I think the ground sorghum
is harvested in summer.

448
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:14,970
But it takes months to make liquor with it.

449
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:16,210
So, the villagers of Xianpa Village

450
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:17,940
usually drink it during winter.

451
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:19,250
So, I'm sure

452
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:22,420
that only the men
who got married in winter died.

453
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:23,940
Yes.

454
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:26,250
Mrs. Niu's wedding was held in winter.

455
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:29,300
Okay now.

456
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,130
The curse has been resolved.

457
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:31,850
Perfect.

458
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:32,900
What do you mean?

459
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,490
After I tell my analysis

460
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:36,700
to the villagers of Xianpa Village,

461
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,090
the curse will be broken, right?

462
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:46,820
Childish.

463
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:47,820
Shallow.

464
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,210
What's wrong?

465
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,250
You

466
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,210
don't know the women
of Xianpa Village well enough.

467
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,940
You don't know them at all.

468
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,250
Here.

469
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:05,700
Will it work?

470
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,490
No. Don't drink it.

471
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:09,370
Look at your temper.

472
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:10,820
You are still like this
even when you become the Emperor.

473
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:11,900
Let him drink it.

474
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:14,180
If he dies, you'll be the one he blames anyway.

475
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:18,820
He's awake.

476
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,020
He's awake.

477
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,820
See? I know the cure will work.

478
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:23,300
Enough.

479
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,580
You are too pleased with yourself.

480
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:25,940
I'll go and show off with other people then.

481
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:26,580
Go on.

482
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,450
The women of Xianpa Village.

483
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,450
Jin Gang.

484
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,250
You've finally recovered.

485
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:36,820
If you die,

486
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,580
what about me and our daughter?

487
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,730
You've scared me so much.

488
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,180
Jin Gang.

489
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:53,490
This is for Li's family.

490
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:53,820
Okay.

491
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,250
The women of Xianpa Village

492
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,490
are not well educated.

493
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:57,970
They don't know any great theories.

494
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:00,370
And they don't know how
to express their feelings.

495
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:01,780
Unlike others,

496
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:03,090
they don't know how to say pretty words.

497
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:04,540
They just know

498
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,300
how to defend the things
that are important to them.

499
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,820
And protect the people
who are important to them.

500
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,060
It's that simple.

501
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:09,820
You understand, right?

502
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:10,780
Yes.

503
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:13,370
You are kind, but you don't show it.

504
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,490
You are sincere and you don't fake it.

505
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:18,970
Not only do you have love,

506
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:20,660
but your love is true and limitless.

507
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:24,130
Did I say something wrong?

508
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:26,420
Although I don't know what you said,

509
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:28,130
I think you were complimenting them.

510
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:29,490
And it was a good compliment.

511
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:31,730
Didn't you tell me all of those things

512
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:32,820
so that I'd compliment them?

513
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:33,940
No.

514
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,020
I just want to tell you

515
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,450
that you can't convince them

516
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:37,370
to stop believing

517
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:38,060
in that picture book

518
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,300
just by reasoning with them.

519
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,420
They'll still believe in it.

520
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,420
You can't change their minds.

521
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:46,020
I can.

522
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,060
You can't.

523
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:50,700
They believe in that picture book, right?

524
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,060
I can't change them.

525
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,250
But I can change the picture book.

526
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:58,700
[Deity]
Gather up, everyone!

527
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,820
His Majesty has something to say!

528
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:01,700
This way.

529
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,940
Coming.

530
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:03,970
Let's go in. Hurry up.

531
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:07,300
Everyone is here.

532
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,060
Jinfeng.

533
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,020
What are you doing?

534
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:12,210
His Majesty has something to tell you.

535
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:13,970
What is it?

536
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:16,020
It's about the village chronicles.

537
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,130
Your Majesty.

538
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,730
I'm sure you want to tell us
that the village chronicles book is fake again.

539
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,300
But our village has been...

540
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:21,900
You are wrong.

541
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:24,820
I've read through
the village chronicles carefully.

542
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,450
Everything inside is clearly shown.

543
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:28,370
It's real.

544
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:30,970
Your Majesty.

545
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:33,450
You are indeed wise!

546
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:35,490
As I said, those village chronicles are real.

547
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,020
The village chronicles are real.

548
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:40,700
But you read the book wrongly.

549
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,060
Take a look.

550
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:46,730
On this page,

551
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:48,300
it's not telling us that the woman had caused

552
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,970
her husband to die on the wedding night.

553
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:52,730
It's telling us that on the wedding night,

554
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,210
the man had fallen ill.

555
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:57,130
And his woman refused to leave his side.

556
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,180
This...

557
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,940
How can you tell?

558
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:02,970
Of course you can't tell just by looking at it.

559
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:04,850
The magical thing about
this village chronicles book is,

560
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:07,180
the papers originated solely
from the Western Region.

561
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,580
You can't see anything just like this.

562
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,820
But when you put a drop of oil on it...

563
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:13,490
Oil?

564
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:19,580
See?

565
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:22,490
This...

566
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:24,420
There was a woman in Xianpa.

567
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:26,780
Her name was Lian.

568
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,580
She was married to Cui Yuan.

569
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,580
During their wedding night,

570
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,060
Cui Yuan fell ill.

571
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,450
Lian took care of him the whole time.

572
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,700
And they lived happily ever after.

573
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:38,180
It's true.

574
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:39,900
The woman didn't cause her husband to die.

575
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,490
This...

576
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:42,580
Here. Let's look at the next page.

577
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:45,820
This page

578
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:48,250
is not talking about getting rid of the plague.

579
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:51,370
It's talking about equality
between men and women in Xianpa Village.

580
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,210
They are equally blessed by the Gods.

581
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:02,020
This...

582
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:02,780
Yes.

583
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,490
That's true.

584
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:08,210
Here. Next page.

585
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:11,250
On this page,

586
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,490
it's not talking about dying
after the seventh day

587
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:14,490
of the curse.

588
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:17,130
It's talking about the kind and beautiful ladies

589
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:18,900
of Xianpa Village.

590
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:21,700
Because of them,
generations after generations of the people

591
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,060
in Xianpa Village continue to prosper.

592
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:24,180
This...

593
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:26,420
This...

594
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:33,210
Is this true?

595
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:33,970
Yes.

596
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:35,580
It's exactly what it means.

597
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:37,020
It's real.

598
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:39,060
That's good.

599
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:44,850
So, based on the village chronicles,

600
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:46,490
the women of Xianpa Village

601
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:47,820
are not cursed.

602
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:50,940
The book is complimenting you
on your traditional virtues.

603
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:57,540
That's amazing.

604
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,250
Don't you have any questions for me?

605
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,540
Don't you have anything to tell me?

606
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,130
Those words...

607
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:25,940
Are fake.

608
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:28,730
How could you deceive them?

609
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:30,420
I didn't deceive them.

610
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,850
The book did.

611
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:32,940
Moreover,

612
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:35,180
rather than letting them
believe in those bad stories,

613
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:37,130
it's better to let them
believe in the good stories

614
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:38,060
and be happy.

615
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,780
That makes sense.

616
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:41,660
Right?

617
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:45,020
Moreover, although the words are fake,

618
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:47,330
what I thought about them is true.

619
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:49,180
What are you thinking?

620
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:50,970
I'm thinking

621
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:53,300
that all the women in Xianpa Village
are really something.

622
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,420
And the one I have is even better.

623
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,090
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

624
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:16,420
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

625
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:17,610
Finally, I found you.

626
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:18,210
Your Majesty.

627
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:28,210
Welcome back, Your Majesty!

628
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,090
You may rise.

629
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:34,540
When I was gone, the Grand Chancellor

630
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,900
had done a great job
at keeping peace within the nation.

631
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,540
Well done, Grand Chancellor.

632
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:41,090
Your Majesty,

633
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:42,490
since you think I've done well,

634
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:44,300
I would like to ask for a reward.

635
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:47,060
Feel free to do that.

636
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:50,250
I'm old.

637
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,180
I'm willing to donate everything that I own

638
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:53,250
to retire and go back to my hometown.

639
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:57,090
Please approve my request to retire.

640
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:08,090
Grand Chancellor.

641
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:08,970
Hurry up and rise.

642
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:11,540
Grand Chancellor.

643
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:12,970
What is the meaning of this?

644
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:15,940
Now, you are capable enough
to take care of your family

645
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:17,090
as well as the people.

646
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:19,540
You've become a wise and capable emperor.

647
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:21,780
The Late Emperor had promised me

648
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:22,970
that when this day comes,

649
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:26,020
I'll be free to go back to my hometown
and enjoy my life.

650
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:30,060
I have kept my promise to the Late Emperor.

651
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,730
So, I would like to go home now.

652
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,130
Please approve my request.

653
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:35,780
Grand Chancellor.

654
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:37,660
You can go home every day.

655
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:40,450
I want to free up my time

656
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:42,020
to travel around with my wife.

657
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:42,820
Grand Chancellor.

658
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:43,850
Your Majesty.

659
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:45,700
I just have one request.

660
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:48,090
About my donation,

661
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:49,940
don't be too strict with me.

662
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:51,850
I still need some money to take care of my wife.

663
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,250
I understand.

664
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:58,580
I'll grant you your wish.

665
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:03,850
Thank you, Your Majesty.

666
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:21,490
You've worked hard.

667
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:28,330
My consort.

668
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,370
Can you hear me?

669
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:33,490
Yes, I can.

670
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:34,250
I can really hear you.

671
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:34,970
We did it!

672
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,020
What is this?

673
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:38,580
This?

674
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,970
This is my new invention.

675
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:41,660
The Heart-to-Heart Talking Machine.

676
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:42,970
Now, Baiyu can hear me

677
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:44,020
from over there.

678
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:44,940
But you can still hear her

679
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,210
over there without it, right?

680
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:48,130
I thought it was going
to be an amazing invention.

681
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:48,660
But this is it?

682
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,820
The two of you have no imagination

683
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,210
and innovative spirit.

684
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,450
This is just

685
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:55,060
the prototype that we had invented.

686
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:56,300
Maybe in the future,

687
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,700
we'll have something like this

688
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,090
that can allow us to talk to each other

689
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:00,660
across a great distance.

690
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:01,660
How romantic it'll be.

691
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:02,780
That's right.

692
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:03,700
This is called romantic.

693
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:04,610
Do you understand?

694
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,610
Will that really happen?

695
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:07,610
Then,

696
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:09,250
it'll be even better
than what Uncle Longyue invented.

697
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:09,780
Of course.

698
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:10,580
Definitely.

699
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:13,730
(Your Majesty, the Queen,)
