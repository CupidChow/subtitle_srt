My husband tried to kill my father.

171
00:08:28,119 --> 00:08:29,239
That's murder.

172
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:31,000
How can I be oblivious?

173
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,640
Fine. Even if we set that aside,

174
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,959
whatever grudge they have between them,

175
00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:35,040
he shouldn't have used me

176
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,119
in order to kill him.

177
00:08:36,119 --> 00:08:37,359
Is that something Xuan should do?

178
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,479
So that's what you're mad about?

179
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:44,599
What else?

180
00:08:44,599 --> 00:08:45,719
Shouldn't I be?

181
00:08:49,599 --> 00:08:53,239
How about thinking of it another way

182
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:55,080
based on huabens?
(*printed versions of prompt books)

183
00:08:55,359 --> 00:08:56,080
Huabens?

184
00:08:56,599 --> 00:08:57,479
For example,

185
00:08:58,039 --> 00:08:59,719
the handsome Xuan

186
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,799
fell in love with Heipang,
who is the daughter of his enemy Liu Xie.

187
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,960
Both are equally important to him.

188
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,479
Come on.

189
00:09:10,479 --> 00:09:11,799
Let's have a toast.

190
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,960
Grand Chancellor.

191
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,559
How was the hot spring?

192
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:31,359
You look

193
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:33,239
so much better now.

194
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,000
Your Majesty.

195
00:09:34,599 --> 00:09:37,200
The hot spring is indeed very special.

196
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,760
As for what makes it so special,

197
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,359
I'll have to let His Majesty elaborate on that.

198
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:45,919
Zhang.

199
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:48,840
Mother.

200
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:50,840
I...

201
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:53,520
had a good chat with the Grand Chancellor.

202
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:56,359
That's good.

203
00:09:56,599 --> 00:09:58,640
His Majesty and Grand Chancellor

204
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,840
are getting along so well.

205
00:10:00,119 --> 00:10:01,400
I'm relieved to know that.

206
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:03,520
Isn't this great?

207
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:05,880
Jinfeng is dignified and graceful.

208
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:08,440
The two of them are so loving.

209
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,479
This is all so wonderful.

210
00:10:10,479 --> 00:10:11,000
Indeed.

211
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,799
Looks like I'll be getting a grandchild soon.

212
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,000
That's right.

213
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
My dear in-law,

214
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,320
they are still newlyweds.

215
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:20,840
Let's let nature take its course.

216
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,200
If it's meant to be, it will be.

217
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,119
You're right. We shall.

218
00:10:25,119 --> 00:10:26,320
We have plenty of time.

219
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,520
That's right.

220
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:31,119
I was too busy talking.

221
00:10:31,359 --> 00:10:32,320
Let's eat.

222
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,200
Come on.

223
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:33,719
Help yourselves.

224
00:10:33,719 --> 00:10:35,320
We can carry on with our talk after the meal.

225
00:10:36,119 --> 00:10:37,080
Help yourselves.

226
00:10:57,119 --> 00:10:57,760
Mother.

227
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,840
After some thought,

228
00:10:59,239 --> 00:11:00,440
I have something to tell you.

229
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,119
Mother.

230
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,640
Jinfeng thinks the dishes aren't enough.

231
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,520
She wants to have more dishes.

232
00:11:05,359 --> 00:11:05,880
Well...

233
00:11:07,239 --> 00:11:07,880
Mother.

234
00:11:08,359 --> 00:11:09,280
I'd like to use the washroom.

235
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,960
Why do you need to go there?

236
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,479
His Majesty wants to come along too.

237
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,000
Why are they

238
00:11:22,119 --> 00:11:23,080
going to

239
00:11:23,359 --> 00:11:25,239
the washroom together?

240
00:11:26,599 --> 00:11:28,559
They're very close

241
00:11:28,719 --> 00:11:29,479
and affectionate.

242
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,000
That's right.

243
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,960
They're affectionate.

244
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,640
Let's eat.

245
00:11:41,359 --> 00:11:42,000
Tell me.

246
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,799
Greetings, Your Majesties.

247
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,000
Let's talk here.

248
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,640
Yunzhang, Sister-in-law.

249
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,200
What a coincidence.

250
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:52,960
What are you doing here?

251
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:53,960
-Get lost.
-Get lost.

252
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,640
What have I done?

253
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,039
There's no one around here.

254
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:08,719
Let's talk.

255
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,880
About what?

256
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,320
Don't you have anything

257
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,679
to tell me about what happened this evening?

258
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:14,479
I do.

259
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,919
I want to tell you this.

260
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,359
Please don't tell anyone

261
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:19,880
about the incident at Qingchi Palace.

262
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:20,799
That's it?

263
00:12:21,239 --> 00:12:22,599
That's what you're concerned about?

264
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:23,479
Yes, that's it.

265
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,320
Fine.

266
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,440
I'll cut to the chase.

267
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,119
About what happened at Qingchi Palace,

268
00:12:29,119 --> 00:12:30,520
has that been your plan all along?

269
00:12:32,479 --> 00:12:33,840
Even if it wasn't today,

270
00:12:34,599 --> 00:12:36,159
it would have happened someday in the future.

271
00:12:36,719 --> 00:12:38,400
I have to do what I need to do.

272
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,320
It's just that you won't understand.

273
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,440
I don't care what feud you have

274
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,440
with Liu Xie.

275
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,520
You don't?

276
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,880
You two have been at odds for years.

277
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,159
What can I do?

278
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,799
The only thing I care about
is that you deceived me.

279
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,359
Come to think about it,

280
00:12:57,479 --> 00:12:59,039
you've lied to me about many things.

281
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,119
The hot spring was a lie.

282
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,880
The acrobatics were a lie.

283
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,400
Even being weak was just a facade.

284
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,119
But I've pondered on it for quite some time.

285
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,799
I get where you're coming from.

286
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:13,760
You're just like the character in stories.

287
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,520
You fell in love with your enemy's daughter.

288
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:17,320
You can't stop fighting against Liu Xie,

289
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,520
and you don't want to hurt me.

290
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:20,799
So you lie to me time after time.

291
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:24,039
I'll give you a chance today.

292
00:13:24,359 --> 00:13:25,400
What else are you keeping from me?

293
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,440
Just come clean.

294
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,679
If you apologize

295
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,000
and be nice,

296
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:30,440
I can forgive you after I struggle,

297
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,200
feel hurt, and hesitate for a while.

298
00:13:36,719 --> 00:13:37,679
What's so funny?

299
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,559
I laughed

300
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,479
because I don't care if you forgive me or not.

301
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,679
They must be anxiously waiting for us.

302
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,719
Let's head back.

303
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:56,320
I'm being very understanding here.

304
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,520
Don't push your luck.

305
00:13:58,479 --> 00:13:59,919
You might not find a good wife like me

306
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:01,239
in Donghao.

307
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,599
I'm not even blaming you
for trying to kill my father.

308
00:14:05,599 --> 00:14:07,239
Why won't you apologize?

309
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,479
Blame me? What for?

310
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:09,799
Do you know

311
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:11,479
how I got through all these years?

312
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,359
Apologize?

313
00:14:15,119 --> 00:14:16,640
I did nothing wrong.

314
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,679
Let alone needing to apologize to you.

315
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,919
You're a lost cause.

316
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,239
Since you think you've done right,

317
00:14:24,359 --> 00:14:26,239
why can't people know
about what happened at Qingchi Palace?

318
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,359
You can tell the world.

319
00:14:27,359 --> 00:14:28,080
I can even help you.

320
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,159
You don't have to thank me.

321
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:31,000
Everyone, listen up!

322
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,719
His Majesty...

323
00:14:31,719 --> 00:14:32,359
Shut it!

324
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,640
You're afraid to admit your mistake.

325
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,440
You refuse to apologize after lying.

326
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:40,440
Why are you like this?

327
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:43,440
I always thought Liu Xie was terrible

328
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,640
for bullying you.

329
00:14:45,119 --> 00:14:47,359
But now I think what he did was right.

330
00:14:47,479 --> 00:14:48,840
If he allowed you to go on like this,

331
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,359
you would turn into a useless ruler.

332
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,559
How dare you call me a useless ruler.

333
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,960
Why won't I? I'm just telling the truth.

334
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:01,479
Fine.

335
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,679
I'm a useless ruler.

336
00:15:04,479 --> 00:15:06,599
But your father isn't a saint either.

337
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:10,000
Do you know that he's been lying to you

338
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,760
and using you?

339
00:15:12,239 --> 00:15:12,880
What do you mean?

340
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,960
Nothing.

341
00:15:14,119 --> 00:15:14,919
Make it clear.

342
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:15,679
Don't make up stories.

343
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:16,280
Fine.

344
00:15:17,119 --> 00:15:18,400
I'll tell you.

345
00:15:19,359 --> 00:15:21,239
Those letters you exchanged with Xuan

346
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:23,760
were all fabricated by your father.

347
00:15:24,239 --> 00:15:26,280
I've never written to you.

348
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,359
Neither have I known you before our wedding.

349
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,400
You're lying again, aren't you?

350
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:32,440
You said it was because you were seriously ill.

351
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:32,960
So you...

352
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,239
I lied.

353
00:15:35,479 --> 00:15:38,400
I was afraid you'd cause trouble
after knowing the truth

354
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,599
and ruin my plan to get rid of Liu Xie.

355
00:15:44,479 --> 00:15:45,159
You lied?

356
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,119
Wait.

357
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,880
Why aren't you lying to me now?

358
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,239
For all I know, what you said just now

359
00:15:52,239 --> 00:15:53,039
was a lie.

360
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:55,640
The dagger is revealed and gone.

361
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,840
What's the point of making a vow?

362
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:01,400
What are you talking about?

363
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,960
It means

364
00:16:03,599 --> 00:16:05,880
I've already had a fallout with your father.

365
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:08,440
So there's no need to pretend anymore.

366
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,280
Are you making all these up

367
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,520
because you've fallen

368
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,239
for someone else?

369
00:16:17,359 --> 00:16:18,559
Sorry to disappoint you.

370
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,159
My heart has always remained the same.

371
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,520
I've always liked a gentle and graceful woman.

372
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,320
Not some barbarian like you.

373
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,740
If you don't believe me,

374
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:32,740
go see for yourself at your father's residence.

375
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:51,580
Your Majesty.

376
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,100
Where do you...

377
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:52,700
I'm leaving the palace.

378
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,140
Get me a horse.

379
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:54,740
Yes, Your Majesty.

380
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:57,500
Wait. Forget it.

381
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,860
I'm taking Liu Xie's carriage.

382
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,500
Why have those two

383
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,380
been gone for so long?

384
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,020
I'm guessing

385
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:20,620
they might have things to talk about.

386
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,980
What can they talk about in the washroom?

387
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:27,140
I'm guessing they're just talking
about their little secrets.

388
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:29,900
You're right.

389
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:32,180
Let them take their time then.

390
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:36,540
Zhang.

391
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,780
Why isn't Jinfeng with you?

392
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:40,700
Mother.

393
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,140
Jinfeng isn't feeling well.

394
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,300
So she went to rest.

395
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,020
She isn't feeling well?

396
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,540
Is she all right?

397
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:48,580
I'm afraid she caught a cold

398
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,500
while bathing in the hot spring.

399
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,380
She'll be all right after some rest.

400
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:52,980
In that case,

401
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,740
I won't keep Your Majesty the Empress Dowager,
Your Highness,

402
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,100
and Your Majesty the Emperor from resting.

403
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:02,100
I shall take my leave with my wife.

404
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,100
All right.

405
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,660
You must be tired.

406
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,660
Go on then.

407
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,780
-Thank you, Your Majesty.
-We'll be leaving then.

408
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:29,020
[Qiankun Gate]

409
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,020
Where is my carriage?

410
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,420
Grand Chancellor.

411
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:34,820
Her Majesty took it,

412
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,780
but I've sent someone to bring a new carriage.

413
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:37,700
It will arrive soon.

414
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,380
It's all right.

415
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:41,900
Zhang Qian.

416
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:43,460
Bring my horse.

417
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,260
Yes, sir.

418
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:52,460
Yongfu.

419
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:53,460
Let's go.

420
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,100
Who are you calling?

421
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,300
Don't address me this intimately.

422
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:58,540
Listen.

423
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:59,900
You took me here by force.

424
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,380
If you want to leave, leave on your own.

425
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,740
I won't be leaving with you.

426
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:04,580
Yongfu.

427
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,460
Are you casting me aside after using me?

428
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,780
You wanted to come

429
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,020
to the relative banquet.

430
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,940
We clicked.

431
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,860
How could you say
that I brought you here by force?

432
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:14,940
That sounds awful.

433
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,300
Wait a minute.

434
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:17,380
Scorpion Liu.

435
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,980
We had an agreement.

436
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,900
After attending the relative banquet,

437
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,940
you continue to be the Grand Chancellor, right?

438
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,740
And I'll return to Xianpa Village.

439
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:26,820
Therefore,

440
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:27,820
farewell.

441
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,140
Still, don't you have to wait till the sun is out?

442
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,460
It's not easy to walk in the dark.

443
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,140
It's late at night.

444
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:44,820
What are you trying to do?

445
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:48,820
To return to my residence.

446
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,180
I...

447
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,780
I have to get on the horse?

448
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:53,540
I...

449
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:55,300
It's too high. I'm scared.

450
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:56,540
No, please.

451
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:57,500
I'm really scared.

452
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,300
Don't make me ride the horse.

453
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,780
I'll walk on my own. I'm not getting on it.

454
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,620
Did I hurt you?

455
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:04,980
I didn't mean it.

456
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,260
Did I hurt you just now?

457
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,420
I barely used any strength.

458
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,020
You don't have to worry.

459
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,700
My wound opened up, that's all.

460
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:14,420
I won't die.

461
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,580
Worry, my foot.

462
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,500
You're pretty good

463
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,460
at acting.

464
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:28,700
Does it hurt now?

465
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,780
Don't just stand there.

466
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:45,540
How can I get on the horse

467
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:46,700
if you don't help me?

468
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,340
Ouch! Be gentle.

469
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:00,700
All right.

470
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,140
Can you stop whining?

471
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:03,140
It's so annoying.

472
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:06,740
I'm just trying to speak more while I still can.

473
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:07,740
Now that it's come to this,

474
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,700
Scorpion Liu isn't going to let us live.

475
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:11,100
You coward.

476
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:12,700
It's already been done. What are you afraid of?

477
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,260
Be gentle.

478
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,420
It's a pity.

479
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,380
I still haven't fallen in love.

480
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:24,500
Your Majesty.

481
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:26,540
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

482
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,460
There's no need to get up.

483
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:29,700
-Greetings, Your Majesty.
-Greetings, Your Majesty.

484
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:31,900
You may leave first.

485
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:32,660
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

486
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:38,380
I have heard what you all said just now.

487
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:40,060
I have let you down.

488
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:41,900
You're now injured

489
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:43,500
and scared because of me.

490
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:44,700
As an imperial bodyguard,

491
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,860
it is my duty to protect you.

492
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,740
How is it your fault?

493
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:50,420
Though I can't overcome my fear,

494
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:53,140
I am willing to charge forward for Your Majesty.

495
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,700
All right. I understand.

496
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,860
I am aware of and appreciate

497
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,260
your loyalty and friendship.

498
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:00,420
Your Majesty.

499
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,140
I went to check after that.

500
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,380
Those crossbowmen were all knocked out

501
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,300
like what Liu Xie said.

502
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:06,500
How did he know

503
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,460
about our ambush?

504
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,660
Did he come prepared?

505
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,820
I have been thinking about that too.

506
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,780
Was Liu Xie only aware of those crossbowmen

507
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:18,540
or does he know my entire plan?

508
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,540
Did your people leak it?

509
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:26,460
It can't be.

510
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:30,660
I only told him about the whole plan

511
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,620
right before Liu Xie came to Qingchi Palace.

512
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,380
How can they leak it when they don't even know

513
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:35,180
who the target is?

514
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,140
You heard that?

515
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,300
Look how smart His Majesty is.

516
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:39,580
All right. Stop arguing.

517
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:41,580
There's actually something else
I've been thinking about.

518
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:43,540
Grand Chancellor.

519
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:45,980
Here's a toast to you.

520
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,380
What exactly does that mean?

521
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:57,380
If Liu Xie knew I was going to kill him,

522
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,780
why would he still agree
to come to Qingchi Palace?

523
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:02,820
Shen Ao,

524
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:03,540
what do you think?

525
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:06,900
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

526
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,820
I have no clue either.

527
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:09,500
It's all right.

528
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,180
You are weak.

529
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,380
You must recuperate.

530
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,020
Are you two still alive?

531
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,540
I'm still alive.

532
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:18,500
Still breathing.

533
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,780
Then come with me.

534
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,060
Don't keep Shen Ao from resting.

535
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,180
Put your arm around me.

536
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:26,900
Come on.

537
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:32,540
Here, Yongfu.

538
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:35,060
We have arrived.

539
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:36,860
Scorpion Liu.

540
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,340
Where is this place?

541
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,180
Let's talk inside.

542
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,060
No, wait.

543
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,740
This isn't where I stayed a few days ago.

544
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:45,940
I'm not going inside.

545
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,100
Read that.

546
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:51,140
What?

547
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:51,940
[Grand Chancellor's Residence]

548
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,020
It's the Grand Chancellor's Residence.

549
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,140
The one you stayed in was a second residence.

550
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:57,580
From today onward,

551
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,220
you will stay here.

552
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:02,580
What do you mean by I'm staying here from now on?

553
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,180
Listen.

554
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,540
No place is better than my home.

555
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,180
I don't want to stay here.

556
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,300
I'm going back to Xianpa Village.

557
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,060
Master.

558
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,020
Yongfu.

559
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,740
You're finally back.

560
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:14,700
Why are you so flustered?

561
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:17,300
The Queen came to visit not long ago.

562
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,380
Her Majesty came in without saying a word

563
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:20,940
and barged into your study.

564
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,100
We were afraid to stop Her Majesty.

565
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:22,740
Not that we could either.

566
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:23,860
Heipang is here?

567
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,780
She is in my study?

568
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:26,300
Yes, Master.

569
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,700
Her Majesty has been in your study

570
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:28,340
turning...

571
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:29,180
Turning...

572
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:31,100
Turning what? Tell us.

573
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,100
There was quite a commotion.

574
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:34,060
It sounded like Her Majesty
was turning the study upside down.

575
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,020
I'll go have a look.

576
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:39,940
Wait.

577
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:43,300
Take Madam to the main residence.

578
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:44,940
Pardon?

579
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:45,460
You heard it right.

580
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,380
From here on,

581
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,300
she is the Madam
of the Grand Chancellor's Residence.

582
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:50,740
Pass on my orders.

583
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:51,740
Serve her well.

584
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:52,340
Yes, Master.

585
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,780
You don't decide everything.

586
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:54,820
I'm against it.

587
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,020
I said I'm against it!

588
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,100
Do you hear me?

589
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,340
[To Xuan]

590
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:18,420
What are you doing?

591
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:19,780
Why did you come here to make a fuss?

592
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,300
Listen.

593
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,020
Even if you're my daughter,

594
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,380
you mustn't act out of line.

595
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:26,340
Your daughter?

596
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:28,820
Do you even see me as your daughter?

597
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:30,900
Who treats their daughter like this?

598
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,140
What now? What did I do?

599
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:40,060
Do you mean how I brought your mother

600
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,660
to the relative banquet without telling you?

601
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:43,980
Why are you making a fuss about that?

602
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,060
Why do you have the letters

603
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:51,180
I wrote to Xuan?

604
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:54,260
(It must be Duan Yunzhang that brat who said it.)

605
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,660
(He failed to kill me.)

606
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:57,260
(So he's getting revenge by doing this.)

607
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:58,540
(Such a loser.)

608
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:02,460
What is this?

609
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:03,820
I've never seen it before.

610
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,340
I found this in your study.

611
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:06,340
How have you never seen it?

612
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,820
I have so many things here.

613
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:09,940
How could I have possibly seen everything?

614
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,020
I don't remember seeing it.

615
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:13,060
Fine. You don't?

616
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:15,020
Then I'm sure you don't remember this either.

617
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:16,060
Let me read it out for you.

618
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:17,460
"Xie.

619
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:18,420
It is a rainy day.

620
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:20,540
The jasmines by the roadside
have wilted due to the rain.

621
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,420
Only you

622
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:23,820
seem to always remain handsome.

623
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:24,500
Seeing..."

624
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,420
How did you find it?

625
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:28,420
Give it back.

626
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,180
So you remember it now since it's yours?

627
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,180
You even called her so endearingly.

628
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:34,860
You fooled my mother back then.

629
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,340
Now you're trying to deceive me, aren't you?

630
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,460
Listen.

631
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:39,940
If you don't answer my question,

632
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:41,460
you'll never get to see these letters

633
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:42,300
my mother wrote you.

634
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,340
Wait. Don't.

635
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:44,180
Calm down.

636
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:46,140
Put down the letters first.

637
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:47,140
Tell me.

638
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:48,420
Why do you

639
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:49,500
have the letters I wrote to Xuan?

640
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,660
The address you sent them to

641
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:56,420
was my second residence.

642
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:59,460
What about the letters Xuan wrote me?

643
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,220
I hired someone to write them.

644
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,500
Why?

645
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:12,940
Why did you do that?

646
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:13,980
What can you get

647
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,620
out of deceiving your own daughter?

648
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:17,660
Now that it has come to this,

649
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,180
if I say I truly felt

650
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:21,860
that you and His Majesty make a perfect couple,

651
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,100
you won't believe me.

652
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,980
Of course I won't.

653
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,300
Scorpion Liu.

654
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,660
Nothing you say is true.

655
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,580
But keep this in mind.

656
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:32,180
Your engagement with His Majesty is real.

657
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,660
I just used

658
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:34,860
some strategies

659
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,580
to make it happen.

660
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:38,420
Make it happen?

661
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,980
Make it happen yourself then.

662
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:42,300
I quit.

663
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:44,020
I'm going back to Xianpa Village.

664
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:45,460
Stop right there.

665
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,700
Do you not want to see your mother again?

666
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,300
What does that mean?

667
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,300
Don't forget

668
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,980
that I have your mother now.

669
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,500
If you don't go back

670
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,500
and be the Queen,

671
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:57,460
I will move

672
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:58,780
your mother around and hide her

673
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:00,300
in my residences around the country.

674
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:01,660
You will never find her.

675
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:05,260
So you brought my mother

676
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,460
to the relative banquet on purpose.

677
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,100
Mother was right.

678
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:11,860
You're just pretending
to treat her nicely in front of others.

679
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,100
You want me to return to the palace?

680
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,100
Fine.

681
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,620
After returning,

682
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:16,580
I will make a scene

683
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:17,540
and embarrass you.

684
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:18,620
So what?

685
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:20,380
Even if you get kicked out of the palace,

686
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,500
you still won't get to see your mother.

687
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,540
How could you be so cruel?

688
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,380
Aren't you worried that you'd never

689
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,820
get to see me again if we fall out?

690
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:31,620
I can't be bothered
seeing a daughter who runs away

691
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:32,700
when things go wrong.

692
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:33,420
Run away?

693
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:34,740
When did I run away?

694
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,380
Then what is this?

695
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,180
Listen.

696
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,780
Liu Xie. Don't you dare do anything to my mother.

697
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:41,620
I can return to the palace to be the Queen,

698
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,300
but you must promise me
that you'll treat my mother well.

699
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:45,940
If anything happens to her,
I'll make you pay for it.

700
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,340
Just you wait.

701
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:49,700
The letters.

702
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,540
Why doesn't she

703
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:08,420
keep her word?

704
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:26,740
Yongfu.

705
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:30,580
You're done talking to her so soon?

706
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:31,980
I was eager to see you.

707
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:33,980
So I made it quick.

708
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:41,820
Let's have some tea.

709
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:42,540
Come on.

710
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:43,580
Have some tea.

711
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,100
Have some tea.

712
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:52,980
Yongfu.

713
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:54,140
You knew

714
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:55,900
I was with Heipang in my study.

715
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:57,860
Why didn't you insist

716
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:59,220
on coming with me to see her?

717
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,700
Didn't you hear what your housekeeper said?

718
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:03,620
Our daughter turned your study upside down.

719
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,380
So I thought

720
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:08,780
you must have done something wicked.

721
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:10,380
I couldn't be bothered scolding you.

722
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:11,780
But I believe

723
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:14,180
that you would never harm your daughter.

724
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,180
You believe that?

725
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:20,380
It's been so long.

726
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:22,820
Aren't you worried that I've changed?

727
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,060
How dare you?

728
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,340
No.

729
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,540
I wouldn't dare.

730
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:30,540
Here.

731
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:40,860
Happy now?

732
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,460
I've drunk your tea.

733
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:43,540
So I'm good now.

734
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,420
I have to go back to Xianpa Village.

735
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:46,420
You can't, Yongfu.

736
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:48,980
You're now being grounded.

737
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,060
Being grounded?

738
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,220
What does that mean?

739
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:55,660
You get to live comfortably in a big house

740
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:56,420
and rarely go out.

741
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,900
I've told you. I don't want this luxury.

742
00:30:58,900 --> 00:30:59,620
I must go back...

743
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:01,540
Ouch.

744
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:02,940
That hurt so much.

745
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:05,300
Knock me out then.

746
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,140
Have you lost your mind?

747
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:08,740
Why would I hit you?

748
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:13,300
I won't let you leave no matter what.

749
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,180
If you really want to leave,

750
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:16,180
then knock me out.

751
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,460
I can't win against you anyway

752
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:18,580
since I'm seriously wounded now.

753
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:22,540
What do you take me for?

754
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:25,140
Do you think I'm someone

755
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:26,380
who'd take advantage of people?

756
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:29,020
So you're not leaving?

757
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:30,780
Who said so?

758
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,500
I'll leave once you've healed.

759
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,900
But my wounds will take a while

760
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,220
to heal.

761
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:45,740
Then quickly go and rest.

762
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,860
What are you doing here?

763
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:48,780
Go on.

764
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,340
You're really not leaving?

765
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:52,540
Are you going or not?

766
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:53,260
Fine, I'll go.

767
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,300
I'll go.

768
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:01,020
What a scum.

769
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:02,780
He's rotten to the core.

770
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,260
Go take a look with me.

771
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:06,860
Mother.

772
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:08,860
Don't go. We'll get into trouble.

773
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,380
I don't want to cause trouble.

774
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:11,500
But there's suddenly

775
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,060
another madam in this residence.

776
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,660
I'm just worried that we'll have a hard time

777
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:15,860
from now on.

778
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:16,380
If...

779
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:18,220
If Father finds out, he will be mad.

780
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:20,100
Then don't let him find out.

781
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,340
I'll just take a peek.

782
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,180
Come on.

783
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:22,740
But...

784
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:25,460
Where is Yu Changya?

785
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,380
No need to worry, sir.

786
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:28,540
He has left the palace.

787
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,700
Tell him he did well today.

788
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:31,220
Yes, sir.

789
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:32,740
Sir.

790
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:33,620
There's one more thing.

791
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:36,180
Xie Jun showed his gratitude
for your protection

792
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,660
by sending over lots of gifts.

793
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,540
That disgusting snake.

794
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:42,980
If it weren't for him guarding Longxi,

795
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,580
which is useful for threatening Xiyue,

796
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:47,220
I would have killed him already.

797
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,620
You have great foresight, sir.

798
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:50,620
By the way,

799
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:52,940
seal those gifts and take them

800
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:54,500
to the warehouse as usual.

801
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:55,300
Yes, sir.

802
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:57,940
-We're already here.
-Mother.

803
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:58,780
-Hurry up.
-Second Madam.

804
00:32:58,820 --> 00:32:59,340
Father.

805
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,060
Father.

806
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,140
My Lord.

807
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,100
What brings you two here?

808
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:08,260
I heard that a madam came to our residence.

809
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,420
So I wanted to meet her.

810
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:12,340
Don't bother.

811
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:13,940
She doesn't like being disturbed.

812
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:16,500
Stay away from here in the future.

813
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:17,820
Will do.

814
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:18,540
Baiyu.

815
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:19,700
Come with me.

816
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:22,620
Go.

817
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:30,780
Father.

818
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:32,100
Father, did...

819
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:34,060
Did a burglar sneak in?

820
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:34,620
What happened?

821
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:35,740
How did it become like this?

822
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:39,220
It wasn't.

823
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,540
This was the Queen's doing.

824
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:44,420
The Queen?

825
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:46,860
How can she do this?

826
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,020
This is out of line.

827
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:49,460
How could she do this to you?

828
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,060
It's all right.

829
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:51,540
It wasn't entirely her fault.

830
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:55,060
Baiyu.

831
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,980
I asked you to come here to tell you this.

832
00:33:58,700 --> 00:33:59,940
Go and get ready.

833
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:02,860
You can enter the palace
to stay for long starting tomorrow.

834
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,100
You're finally agreeing to it?

835
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,620
Yes, as long as you're happy.

836
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,780
The main reason is actually...

837
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,900
There is a small misunderstanding

838
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,340
between the Queen and His Majesty.

839
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:15,860
I'm worried

840
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:17,380
that Her Majesty will cause trouble.

841
