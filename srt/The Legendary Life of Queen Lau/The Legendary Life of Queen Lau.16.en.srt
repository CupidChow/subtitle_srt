00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,280
The coast is clear.

171
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:35,719
Jinfeng!

172
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,159
Come down! Where is she?

173
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:40,239
Jinfeng!

174
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,159
What are you looking at?

175
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,280
Where did you come from?

176
00:10:44,599 --> 00:10:45,559
The gate is not locked.

177
00:10:47,359 --> 00:10:48,359
Of course, I knew that.

178
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,960
I just want

179
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:51,039
to see if I'm agile enough

180
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:52,159
as an Emperor.

181
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:52,799
Let's go.

182
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:57,119
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!

183
00:10:57,119 --> 00:10:57,640
Your Majesty!

184
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,159
This way.

185
00:10:58,159 --> 00:10:59,119
Are you all right, Your Majesty?

186
00:10:59,119 --> 00:11:00,479
Are you all right?

187
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:06,719
I'm dead this time.

188
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,840
What now?

189
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,799
Is this how you behave as the Emperor?

190
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:13,760
Your Majesty...

191
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:17,760
Mother,

192
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,479
it was my idea to go outside the palace today.

193
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:22,039
The Queen has nothing to do with this.

194
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:23,840
What did you say?

195
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,039
Mother,

196
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:29,559
I didn't go outside the palace

197
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:31,039
just to have fun.

198
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:32,479
I did learn many things

199
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:34,159
that I couldn't learn in the palace.

200
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:36,679
Mother, do you know

201
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,400
one could walk faster

202
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:40,280
even when we walk on the stilt slowly?

203
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,919
More cotton doesn't make one warmer.

204
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:45,760
Zhang,

205
00:11:46,359 --> 00:11:47,640
what are you trying to say?

206
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:48,880
Zhang,

207
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,359
are you possessed?

208
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,640
In any case, it was my idea to go outside today.

209
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,159
If you want to punish someone,
you can punish me alone.

210
00:12:02,599 --> 00:12:04,159
Do you know how irresponsible you are

211
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:06,159
to yourself and Donghao Empire?

212
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,719
Have you ever thought of the consequences?

213
00:12:07,719 --> 00:12:08,359
Mother,

214
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:11,280
you may not be my birth mother.

215
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,039
But I'm grateful to you

216
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:14,880
for raising me all these years.

217
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,280
I also treat you as my birth mother.

218
00:12:20,479 --> 00:12:21,760
Calm down. Don't say anything reckless.

219
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,960
Impulsiveness is evil.

220
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,799
But you don't think of it that way.

221
00:12:26,359 --> 00:12:27,599
In your eyes,

222
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:30,359
I'm incapable

223
00:12:31,239 --> 00:12:32,400
of winning and ruling the country

224
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:34,119
the moment I relax.

225
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:37,119
I could only be Liu Xie's puppet
for the rest of my life.

226
00:12:38,239 --> 00:12:38,880
Your Majesty...

227
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:39,799
Shut up.

228
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:42,400
Zhang,

229
00:12:42,599 --> 00:12:44,359
do you know what you're wearing?

230
00:12:46,479 --> 00:12:47,479
The common people's clothes.

231
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,599
Guards!

232
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,640
Take off the Emperor's clothes!

233
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,520
No, don't.

234
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,479
His Majesty needs some face.

235
00:12:57,479 --> 00:12:58,239
Take it off.

236
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,119
If you don't,

237
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,840
Empress Dowager will skin you.

238
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,039
Your Majesty,

239
00:13:05,479 --> 00:13:06,159
my apologies.

240
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,239
Zhang,

241
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,159
how can you wear cotton clothes?

242
00:13:28,359 --> 00:13:29,919
I've told you many times

243
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:31,320
that you're allergic to cotton.

244
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,320
You can only wear silk.

245
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:35,960
Mother,

246
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,960
aren't you angry at me anymore?

247
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,320
Of course, I'm angry.

248
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,840
Look at your neck

249
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,359
and your hand.

250
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,039
There are rashes all over.

251
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,080
What if it affects your examination?

252
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,919
What about us going outside the palace?

253
00:13:53,479 --> 00:13:54,599
It's not that serious.

254
00:13:54,719 --> 00:13:55,799
I understand

255
00:13:56,119 --> 00:13:57,799
you want to have some fun
when you're tired from studying.

256
00:13:57,799 --> 00:13:59,039
It's understandable.

257
00:14:00,479 --> 00:14:02,000
Your Majesty is really understanding.

258
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,919
Don't be happy too soon.

259
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,679
I haven't punished you yet.

260
00:14:05,479 --> 00:14:05,960
But...

261
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,719
What does he leaving the palace
to have anything to do with me?

262
00:14:07,719 --> 00:14:08,760
As the Queen,

263
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:10,840
you failed to protect the Emperor's skin.

264
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,559
So I must punish you.

265
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:15,080
I...

266
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,320
I'll punish you to sweep the temple for two days.

267
00:14:21,239 --> 00:14:22,280
I'm going to punish you too.

268
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,919
I'll punish you to stay indoors
and apply your medicinal ointment.

269
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,679
Remember to watch what you eat.

270
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:31,440
Don't eat anything spicy.

271
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,119
And the most important thing,

272
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,799
don't let it affect your examination.

273
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,679
That's all?

274
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,719
That's all. All of you can leave now.

275
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,599
-I shall take my leave.
-I shall take my leave.

276
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:43,320
Let's go.

277
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:47,320
Are...

278
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:52,119
Are you letting it go so easily?

You...

283
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,359
Your Majesty,

284
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,239
what did I do wrong?

285
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,559
You didn't do anything wrong.

286
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,320
I'm just upset

287
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,359
that I had nowhere to vent.

288
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:25,919
Your Majesty,

289
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,840
didn't you say you were not upset

290
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:30,440
about them going outside the palace?

291
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,919
How can I say that I'm upset?

292
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:33,840
You heard what he said.

293
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,840
He brought up the fact

294
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,919
that I'm not his birth mother.

295
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,000
Yes, he did.

296
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,479
Zhang never talked back to you before.

297
00:15:40,479 --> 00:15:41,479
It must be Hei...

I mean, Jinfeng.

299

She's driving a wedge between you two.

300
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,280
They're working in unison now.

304
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:53,960
I don't dare to punish them.

305
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,200
I dare not.

306
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,359
I'm so upset.

307
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,960
I'll bear with it until the examination is over.

308
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,640
I shall see

309
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,679
what else the Liu family has up their sleeves.

310
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:04,960
Of course.

311
00:16:05,479 --> 00:16:06,840
We should bear with it for now.

312
00:16:07,559 --> 00:16:08,359
Bear with it.

313
00:16:13,479 --> 00:16:14,599
Did you capture the assassins?

314
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,840
Forgive me for my incompetence.

They've escaped.

You failing to catch them

317
00:16:19,119 --> 00:16:21,599
means they're moving freely.

The Queen and I were outside
the palace for so long.

319

Yet, they didn't make any move.

320
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,479

326

there were assassins in the palace today.

They're from Xiyue Empire.

It seems they were searching for...

329

They came in a timely manner.

and peanuts for a month.

354

We must change the candles every day.

Oh, nothing.

Her Majesty needs me to do something.

364
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,460
So I'll get going now.

365

a secret from all of you.

Why is His Majesty's secret only known to you?

372

he'd never lie to us.

373
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,700

His Majesty has changed.

375
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,180
He really has changed.

376
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,700
No, I can't accept this.

377
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,220
He wasn't like this before.

378
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,180
I can't accept it either.

379
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,460
He said he'd never lie to us.

380
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,460
He used to tell us everything.

381

-Yes. But now...
-Stop it.

-Then tell us the point.
-Tell us the point.

385
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:31,060
Of course, it's about the secret

386
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,700
of Yunzhang's failure in the exam.

[Chonghua Hall]

Yunzhang suffers
from Phobia of Examination, doesn't he?

389
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,460
He gets dizzy and faint when it's the examination.

390
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:45,260
That's why he's bound to fail
at every examination.

391
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,260
What do you mean by this?

392
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,340
Can't you get to the point?

393
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,060
What's the use of knowing about this?

394
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,340
Would he stop feeling dizzy

395
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,300
or fainting if we knew?

396
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,180
He's right.

397
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,500
The examination is getting nearer.

398
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,020
What we need to discuss is the way

399
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:00,740
to help His Majesty to rank at the top.

400
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:01,340
He's right.

401

Do you think I'm a fool like you guys?

403
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,460
Of course, I've thought about this.

Then tell us.

405

The phobia

406

may be caused by Liu Xie.

407
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,220
But his phobia is still about the examination.

408
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,420
So as long as he's certain

409
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,620
and confident that he'll pass

410

the examination,

411
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:19,820
would he still be scared?

412
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:22,300
That's why I've come up

What's the use if you steal it?

420

Do any of you know how to answer the questions?

421

It'll be useless nevertheless.

It's stealing the answers.

00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:30,140
I'll tear every piece you pass to him.

511
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,380
-Why you!
-What are you doing?

512
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,420
Don't make any noise during the examination.

513
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:41,660
I'll remember this.

514
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:03,620
It's mealtime.

515
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,340
Candidates can stop writing now.

516
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,740
Rest for an hour.

517
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,700
But no whispering.

518
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:11,300
Otherwise, I'll consider it cheating

519
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:13,100
and I'll disqualify you
from sitting the examination.

520
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:21,420
(Don't worry. I have it prepared.)

521
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,060
Sir,

522
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,900
I've prepared lunch

523
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:31,980
for Their Majesties.

524
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:33,260
I wonder if I can...

525
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:34,380
Go on.

526
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,700
I prepared this dish, especially for you.

527
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,300
Eat it.

528
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:48,700
Your Majesty,

529
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:49,820
this is yours.

530
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,140
Your Majesty,

531
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:56,580
eat it quickly.

532
00:27:58,940 --> 00:27:59,780
It's something good.

533
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:00,780
It's "nutritious".

534
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:01,980
Come on.

535
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:03,060
Eat it.

536
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:06,020
Yunzhang, eat it.

537
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:10,460
Eat it now.

538
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:15,940
I'm afraid this meat dish will affect
His Majesty's thinking.

539
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:17,140
I'll eat this.

540
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,100
His Majesty can eat this vegetarian dish.

541
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:24,580
It's delicious.

542
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:26,500
Not bad.

543
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:31,380
What is this? I can't chew it at all.

544
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:32,500
Just spit it out.

545
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:33,620
Spit it out!

546
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,300
I swallowed it already.

547
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:42,380
It's really delicious.

548
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,700
We'll have to count on Tang now.

549
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:54,180
-Commander Su.
-Commander Su.

550
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:55,100
Have you made the arrangement?

551
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,060
Yes.

552
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,420
Today, I especially arranged for Liu Er

553
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,620
to patrol the Inner Court of the Imperial Palace.

554
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,260
He should be at the Yufang Garden now.

555
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:02,700
Let's move.

556
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,340
Stop right there!

557
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:12,060
What are you doing?

558
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:14,460
Charge!

559
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:21,340
Attack!

560
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,740
Commander,

561
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:37,580
are you all right?

562
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:42,220
You...

563
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:43,220
Why are you...

564
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,700
Mr. Liu Er beat someone!

565
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:48,460
He beat someone!

566
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:49,940
Mr. Liu Er beat Commander Su!

567
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:50,820
Don't just stand there!

568
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:51,940
Inform the Grand Chancellor!

569
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:52,500
It's him!

570
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:52,940
Why you!

571
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:53,860
You crossed the line!

572
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,020
Mr. Liu Er beat someone!

573
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:55,940
Commander Su, are you all right?

574
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,180
Something bad had happened.

575
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,580
Grand Chancellor,

576
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:05,260
Mr. Liu Er beat Commander Su.

577
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:11,900
Grand Tutor Wei,

578
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:14,420
I'll leave this to you.

579
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:15,780
I'll go and take care of the fight.

580
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:16,700
All right.

581
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:20,100
Let's go.

582
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:20,740
Yes, sir.

583
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,780
Why do I suddenly have a headache?

584
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,620
I need to take some fresh air.

585
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:34,620
Grand Tutor Wei,

586
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:36,060
I can't hold it anymore. I must go to the loo now.

587
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,500
Grand Tutor Wei, I'll leave this to you.

588
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,580
I think I ate spoiled food this morning.

589
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:50,100
I can't hold it anymore.

590
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:52,180
Make sure you follow
the rules of the examination.

591
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:53,380
[Diligent and Committed]
Pay attention to classroom discipline.

592
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:54,780
I'll be right back shortly.

593
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,060
Come here.

594
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:03,500
So is there any problem?

595
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,340
No problem at all.

596
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:05,580
Grand Tutor Wei, rest assured.

597
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:07,620
We made it pretty obvious when we left.

598
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:08,900
I'm sure there won't be any problem.

599
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:11,500
Good.

600
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:12,780
Let's go then.

601
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:13,780
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

602
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:20,900
Yunzhang.

603
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,140
Hurry.

604
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:24,300
Hurry, Your Majesty.

605
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,140
The answer is here.

606
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:27,540
-It's right here.
-Hurry.

607
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:29,180
Your Majesty.

608
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,540
Give it to me.

609
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:31,620
Sister-in-law, what are you doing?

610
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:32,260
Move out of my way.

611
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:33,220
-Are you stopping me?
-You can't go over there.

612
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:33,820
-Sister-in-law.
-You're cheating.

613
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:34,620
I'll apologize to you after this.

614
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:35,900
I can't just do nothing when you're cheating.

615
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:37,060
What did Grand Tutor Wei just say?

616
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:38,340
He said we must respect
the rules of the examination.

617
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,100
-Your Majesty,
-I'll not let you get past me.

618
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:40,220
-look at this.
-Step aside.

619
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:41,260
-Your Majesty.
-You can't go near him.

620
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:42,380
Get out of my way.

621
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:43,100
-Just look at it for a while.
-Move it.

622
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,740
-Grand Chancellor will be back soon.
-You can't go near him.

623
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:45,700
-Hurry, Your Majesty.
-Have you no shame?

624
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,940
You don't want to rank last, right?

625
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:47,500
You haven't completed your answer sheet.

626
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,340
I don't care if I haven't completed it.

627
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:49,620
[Diligent and Committed]
I'll take your answer sheet.

628
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:50,700
Why are you taking my answer sheet?

629
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,740
Then I'll tear your answer sheet.

630
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:52,380
Your Majesty.

631
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:53,420
You can't tear my answer sheet.

632
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:53,940
I...

633
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:54,420
Then return my answer sheet.

634
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:55,780
I can't believe
you have such a trick up your sleeve.

635
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:56,180
Listen.

636
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,380
I had no idea you were this kind of person.

637
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:58,420
I treated you well before this.

638
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:59,220
You better step aside!

639
00:31:59,220 --> 00:31:59,740
No, I won't!

640
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,060
What's all this ruckus?

641
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:11,900
This is the examination hall.

642
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:13,780
What are you doing?

643
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:17,180
How annoying.

644
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:21,100
As the Emperor,

645
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,980
you actually cheated with them.

646
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:26,460
I didn't cheat.

647
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:30,860
Not only did you cheat, but you also denied it.

648
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:33,340
I didn't cheat.

649
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:35,180
Did you see me cheat?

650
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:37,860
What's this?

651
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:45,820
This?

652
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:48,300
What's this?

653
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:50,660
When is this here?

654
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:52,140
I don't know what this is.

655
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:05,860
Isn't this your handwriting?

656
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:09,140
It must be you.

657
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:10,260
Grand Tutor Wei,

658
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,220
you're mistaken.

659
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,220
It's not my handwriting.

660
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:14,100
Me? Mistaken?

661
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:16,460
Look at these yourself.

662
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:17,940
The characters are written

663
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,780
[Fight Enemy with Enemy]
in such a disorderly way

664
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,340
and all over the place!

665
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,900
Horizontally, it looks like
a chicken painting with its claw.

666
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:27,540
Vertically, it looks like
a school of tadpoles dancing.

667
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:30,020
It's so ugly.

668
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:33,180
I can't find another person

669
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:36,580
in the Imperial City who writes as ugly as you.

670
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,220
That's definitely not my handwriting.

671
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:40,260
It's not mine.

672
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,300
So Your Majesty,

673
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,260
please explain this.

674
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:51,580
If you want to pin a crime on me,

675
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:53,140
you can plant any evidence to do it.

676
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,460
Are you saying

677
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,700
I purposely made up this note

678
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:00,940
to set you up?

679
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:02,420
Over the years,

680
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:04,220
I'm sure you're aware of the times

681
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:05,100
you deceived everyone

682
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,020
and distorted the truths?

683
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:10,260
Be it my studies, political studies,

684
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:12,420
taking a wife, and appointing the Queen,

685
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:15,220
which of these wasn't arranged
according to your wishes?

686
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,340
It's still not enough

687
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:18,540
when I've yielded twice.

688
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:19,700
When it's time for me to reign,

689
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,860
you still had to use such dirty tricks

690
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:22,980
to make things difficult for me.

691
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:24,700
Grand Chancellor,

692
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,700
how far should I yield so you'd be satisfied?

693
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:30,500
Today's incident

694
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,380
isn't about cheating in the examinations.

695
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:36,980
It's also about the grudge
between the Grand Chancellor and me.

696
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:39,820
We must bring it to an end today.

697
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:43,860
You're right.

698
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:47,660
It's indeed a grudge between us.

699
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,420
So are you admitting

700
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,020
that you used this dirty trick

701
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,300
to set me up?

702
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:53,780
It's not just that.

703
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:57,900
I can harm you in many ways.

704
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:58,860
I know.

705
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:01,700
I ordered someone to add the youth-and-age herb

706
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,380
to the tonic you consume every day.

707
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:06,900
If you don't take the antidote within 100 days,

708
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:09,100
you'll definitely die from poison.

709
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:14,820
Sorry to disappoint you.

710
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:16,300
I never consumed

711
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,860
any of the tonics you sent.

712
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:18,820
Yunchong.

713
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:20,140
What's the matter, Sister-in-law?

714
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:21,660
I drank it.

715
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,180
I'm sure you didn't expect

716
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:25,780
the papers I sent after sending the tonic

717
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:28,820
were also poisoned.

718
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,260
If you touch it,

719
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:33,340
your fingers will swell up in seven days,

720
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:36,260
and you'll die in ten days.

721
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,900
You must have no idea

722
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,060
that I never touched

723
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,340
the paper you sent.

724
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,980
I touched them.

725
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:44,180
I touched them.

726
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,380
I touched them. I touched them.

727
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:46,620
Don't touch me. Stop, don't touch me.

728
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,460
I'm sure you had no idea

729
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:50,580
that I had ordered someone

730
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:51,780
to paint a layer of highly toxic substance

731
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,900
on the railing near the examination room

732
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:55,820
before the examination started.

733
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,460
If you touch it,

734
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:00,580
you'll die in an instant.

735
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:08,940
Too bad, Liu Xie.

736
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:11,660
You've made countless plans,
but you failed to foresee

737
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:13,380
that I was prepared for them.

738
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:18,020
Liu Xie,

739
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:20,420
the nerve of you!

740
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:23,220
How dare you poison the Queen
and the students here?

741
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:25,660
You've committed a capital crime.

742
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:27,540
It's in my heart now.

743
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:28,540
What should we do now, Your Majesty?

744
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:33,380
There's one more thing you didn't expect either.

745
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,500
All the things

746
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,380
I just said were untrue.

747
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:41,940
Don't touch me.

748
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:43,220
You're annoying me. Get off me.

749
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:46,460
You didn't take the tonic I sent you,

750
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,740
use the paper I gave you,

751
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:51,500
and you even put your guard up

752
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,540
against me before the examination.

753
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,700
So what's the difference

754
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,380
between you

755
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:59,740
and that cunning Liu Xie you mentioned

756
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,740
when you both had the same ideas in your mind?

757
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,660
You're just worried

758
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:07,340
that I'll usurp power.

759
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:08,580
I've already admitted this

760
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,380
from the very beginning.

761
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,580
I'm not afraid of repeating it here.

762
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:15,100
I'm plotting

763
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,100
against the Duan family's reign

764
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:21,220
and I will seize Donghao Empire.

765
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,140
What can you do about that?

766
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:28,220
Outrageous!

767
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:30,660
The Empress Dowager has arrived!

768
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:39,740
Apologize now.

769
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:41,420
She's right, Father.

770
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:42,340
You could say that

771
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:43,700
in private.

772
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:44,940
You've hurt their pride for saying that

773
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:46,140
in front of so many people.

774
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,140
Apologize to them,

775
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,220
and that will be the end of it.

776
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:49,700
Zhang,

777
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,340
apologize to the Grand Chancellor now.

778
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,060
The Grand Chancellor was right.

779
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:57,540
Just what is it

780
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,100
that you're thinking all day?

781
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:08,940
It seems like you won't let it go

782
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:10,500
if I don't yield.

783
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:14,660
It's just ten laps.

784
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:15,940
I'll run.

785
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:18,220
But I'm not running these ten laps

786
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:21,220
because I admitted that I cheated.

787
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:22,740
It's because

788
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:24,140
I was enlightened

789
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:25,580
by the Grand Chancellor's wisdom.

790
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:27,340
You're right.

791
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,740
I won't be afraid of you anymore.

792
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:37,460
Read this.

793
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:39,700
"Fight enemy with enemy."

794
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:41,620
Fighting the enemy with the enemy

795
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:44,660
is the answer to keeping the balance

796
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,980
[Fight Enemy with Enemy]
among Donghao, Xiyue, and Cangwu empires.

797
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:55,260
[We can only defeat the enemy with the enemy.
It's of the utmost importance.]

798
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:59,580
That handwriting is different from mine.

799
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:02,180
See?

800
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,740
[Fight Enemy with Enemy]
How could you misspell "enemy"?

801
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,540
Can this prove that Zhang

802
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,100
didn't cheat?

803
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,860
So he doesn't have to be punished?

804
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:16,420
Not necessarily.

805
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:18,380
This can only prove

806
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:19,740
that Yunchong didn't write this note.

807
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:21,940
But it can't prove
that the Emperor didn't read it.

808
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:28,420
But I'm willing

809
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:29,220
to be His Majesty's witness.

810
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:33,540
His Majesty indeed didn't read this note.

811
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:35,060
What did you say?

812
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:38,140
I've been watching from outside.

813
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:41,060
I never left the hall at all.

814
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:42,740
He didn't leave at all.

815
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,420
Your father is too clever.

816
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:46,180
We failed to escape from his grasp

817
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:47,980
after making so much effort.

818
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:48,740
You don't say.

819
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:52,980
Grand Chancellor is indeed insightful.

820
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:55,020
The Donghao Empire can't live a day

821
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:57,220
without the Grand Chancellor.

822
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:58,740
Zhang,

823
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,900
thank the Grand Chancellor.

824
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:03,580
Are you sure you want to be my witness?

825
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:06,020
Is this still important?

826
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:08,100
Today's examination
concerns me taking over the reins.

827
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,500
You don't think that's important?

828
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:12,380
You were flustered

829
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,220
over a few words of mine.

830
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:16,580
Even when Yunchong didn't write the note,

831
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:18,220
you failed to notice

832
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:19,660
such an obvious flaw.

833
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:23,220
How can you comprehend the world in the future?

834
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:26,180
Even if we simply let you rank first place

835
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:27,340
and take the reins,

836
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:30,380
what will make you

837
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:32,580
worthy of this throne?

838
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:34,460
Father,

839
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:35,460
it's just an examination.

840
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:36,740
Why bring the country into this?

841
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:39,100
It's an examination for other candidates.

842
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:40,500
But to His Majesty,

843
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:42,020
it's about the country.

844
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,740
You're just making an overstatement
with cheap logic.

845
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:45,660
Enough.

846
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:49,220
How can I govern a country
