00:07:52,359 --> 00:07:54,160
But it ended up with Liu Baiyu
copying The Analects of Confucius.

165
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,040
Your Majesty is wise indeed.

166
00:07:57,399 --> 00:07:58,600
I can truly have peace of mind now.

167
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,679
Yunzhang always showed great foresight.

168
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,119
He was always impressive to me.

169
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,679
However,

170
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,359
I'm a little worried about tomorrow.

171
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,519
What's wrong with tomorrow?

172
00:08:07,799 --> 00:08:08,880
Didn't Grand Tutor Wei

173
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:10,320
say this when our class was over?

174
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,119
Currently, this is the best time
for people to go on an outing.

175
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:15,239
To enjoy the breeze on the hill
and to sing on the way home.

176
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,279
Even Confucius is in favor of this idea.

177
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,920
Members of the imperial family like us

178
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,519
should follow the ancient customs

179
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:22,000
and abide by the law of nature.

180
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,519
That's why we should make a secret trip
and enjoy the occasion together with the people.

181
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,720
It's just a trip.

182
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,040
What's there to be nervous about?

183
00:08:28,239 --> 00:08:29,279
Yunzhang, think about it.

184
00:08:29,559 --> 00:08:31,040
Liu Baiyu is already on bad terms
with Her Majesty

185
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,640
in the palace.

186
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,880
Without restraints,
I'm sure all hell will break loose

187
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,159
when we leave the palace.

188
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,239
If they do fight each other,

189
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,719
they'll turn into laughing stocks
for the people to see.

190
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,039
You're right.

191
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,159
I was careless.

192
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,679
Maybe both of them are trying to come up with ways

193
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,000
to attract my attention tomorrow.

194
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,520
Your Majesty,

195
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,640

and protect you tomorrow.

197
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,359
No need for that.

198
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,719
You guys can stay out of this.

199
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,280
But Yunchong,

200

from tomorrow onward,

201
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,880
you need to monitor Baiyu closely.

202
00:09:03,599 --> 00:09:04,359
And I

203
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,679
will monitor Jinfeng closely.

204
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,239
Yes, Your Majesty.

stop sighing.

207
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,400
Liu Baiyu was angry at you

208
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,000
for no reason.

209
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,679
You did everything for her sake.

210
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:31,080
However, I did fail to act

211
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,559
like a jealous and evil queen.

212
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,599
Say, why can't Duan Yunzhang

213
00:09:33,599 --> 00:09:35,039
just play by the rules?

214

Your Majesty,

215
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:38,599
why don't we look at it from another perspective?

216
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,960
We should ask Liu Baiyu
to put in more effort herself.

217
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,960
What is that?

written by Lovely Breeze and Bright Moonlight.

221

It's known as the new bible of love.

222
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:54,400
It's widely popular among
the maidservants nowadays.

223
00:09:55,479 --> 00:09:57,239
Not bad at all, Sufang.

224
00:09:57,239 --> 00:09:59,080
Why didn't you show it to me earlier?

225
00:09:59,719 --> 00:10:02,280
Your Majesty, it's because I can only read it

226
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,840
after your class is over.

227

When there's a will, there's a way.

228
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,119
Coincidentally, Grand Tutor Wei
will bring us out of the palace tomorrow.

229
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,400
I guess we can use this.

Baiyu, are you not done yet?

231

I'm sure you're almost done, right?

That's right.

I'm glad to hear that.

that Jinfeng was the one who left the note behind?

328
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:05,679
Yunzhang,

329
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,359
Sister-in-law's handwriting
is easily recognizable.

330
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,440
I understand. You should go now.

331
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,599
You can stay out of this.

332
00:14:14,599 --> 00:14:15,719
If so, I shall take my leave.

333
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,280
Mother,

334
00:14:27,119 --> 00:14:29,200
I know you want me to become successful.

335
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,599
Now, I'm successful.

336
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:33,599
But what's so good about being successful?

337
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,719
My husband is fake.

338
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:37,280
The hills are fake.

339
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:39,039
The flowers are fake.

340
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:42,559
Taiyuan Pond is just a small puddle.

341
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,039
The pets inside the garden

342
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:46,919
were all captured and released into the garden.

343
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:51,840
Mother, don't worry.

344
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:53,840
I will return

345
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:55,559
to Xianpa Village soon.

346
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,880
Jinfeng,

347
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,479
why did you call me here again?

348
00:15:02,479 --> 00:15:03,960
Come, have a seat.

349
00:15:04,359 --> 00:15:05,280
I'm calling you here

350
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,440
mainly to discuss

351
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,799
our next plan.

352
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:08,799
I've already come up with the plan.

353
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,640
Tomorrow, we shall...

354
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,880
Will your plan really work this time?

355
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:12,760
Why do I feel like

356
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,039
your plans have never succeeded?

357
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,479
It's just the beginning.

358
00:15:17,479 --> 00:15:18,719
You should be patient.

359
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,640
I admit that I was confused

360
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,080
about Duan Yunzhang's mindset previously.

361
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,359
But I'm sure

362
00:15:23,359 --> 00:15:24,919
that he definitely doesn't like me.

363
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,640
But His Majesty treats you so well.

364
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,599
He even allowed you to punish me however you like.

365
00:15:30,599 --> 00:15:32,320
It's all a part of his plan.

366
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:32,880
Think about it.

367
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,599
He wanted to chase me out of the palace
just a few days ago.

368
00:15:34,599 --> 00:15:36,400
You mustn't be deceived by the false front,

369
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:36,960
Baiyu.

370
00:15:37,599 --> 00:15:38,440
What about you then?

371
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,359
His Majesty is so nice to you.

372
00:15:40,359 --> 00:15:42,039
Don't you have any feelings for him?

373
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,400
My good sister,

374
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,039
how many times have I told you?

375
00:15:47,119 --> 00:15:49,640
He's not my cup of tea at all.

376
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,080
Look at his face.

377
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:52,520
He doesn't look masculine at all.

378
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:56,119
His body looks like a bamboo pole.

379
00:15:57,119 --> 00:15:58,280
And his hair,

380
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,719
he has two patches of hair covering his head.

381
00:15:59,719 --> 00:16:00,880
He doesn't look bright at all.

382
00:16:02,599 --> 00:16:03,679
Speaking of his temper,

383
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:04,520
I don't think I'll talk about them.

384
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,599
We can sit here all night long

385
00:16:05,599 --> 00:16:06,679
if I were to tell you about them.

386
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:09,119
Sometimes, I don't understand.

387
00:16:09,119 --> 00:16:10,280
Where did he

388
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,479
get the confidence to think

389
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,440
that he's the most handsome man in the world?

390
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:23,679
The things I've said just now

391
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:25,760
might be a little exaggerated in nature.

392
00:16:26,359 --> 00:16:28,359
Mainly, he's been acting strange lately.

393
00:16:28,359 --> 00:16:30,000
That's why I don't like him.

394
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,679
However, he's a nice guy when he's normal.

395
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:32,359
He's not bad.

396
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:32,840
Baiyu,

397
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,320
you mustn't be influenced by my words.

398
00:16:34,599 --> 00:16:35,400
I won't.

399
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,919
His Majesty

400
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:38,520
is utterly my cup of tea.

401
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:39,599
That's great.

402
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:41,119
Let's discuss the plan then.

403
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,440
Am I that inferior?

404
00:16:59,239 --> 00:16:59,880
Your Majesty,

405
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,159
I've already prepared everything

406
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:02,400
you told me to prepare.

407
00:17:02,599 --> 00:17:04,119
This basket is great for outings.

408
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:04,800
Throw them away.

409
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,280
But these are meant for Her Majesty.

410
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,800
I told you to throw them away!

411
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,040
Wait.

412
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,479
Liu Jinfeng, you're truly something else.

413
00:17:18,479 --> 00:17:19,439
Let me see

414
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,239
what you're up to tomorrow.

415
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,239
According to Classic of History,

416
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:26,479
the dawn

417
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,800
of spring

418
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:29,959
is the dawn of all beings.

419
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,119
Today, we shall make a secret trip to the capital

420
00:17:33,479 --> 00:17:34,680
without any bodyguards or servants.

421
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Not only should we experience
the bustling atmosphere,

422
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,839
but we should also
try to understand the lives of the people

423
00:17:40,119 --> 00:17:42,400
and observe their culture and customs.

424
00:17:43,199 --> 00:17:45,439
Later, two people will form one group.

425
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:46,319
We'll split up and move.

426
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,040
However, each group

427
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,800
should at least do one thing for the people.

428
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:52,959
I want everyone

429
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:56,040
to gather up here

430
00:17:56,359 --> 00:18:00,040
before 5 PM,

431
00:18:01,239 --> 00:18:02,520
understood?

432
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,839
-Yes.
-Yes.

433
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:05,079
Very good.

434
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,959
You may go now.

435
00:18:09,079 --> 00:18:10,160
Where do you guys plan to go?

436
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,760
We will form one group.
You two will form one group.

437
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,640
But why?

438
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,640
Don't ask questions.

439
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,439
Just follow my instructions.

440
00:18:15,439 --> 00:18:16,079
No!

441
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,199
I was born to serve His Majesty.

442
00:18:17,199 --> 00:18:18,040
I will serve him even in death.

443
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:18,520
You!

444
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,239
Let's go!

445
00:18:19,239 --> 00:18:20,680
Don't touch me! I won't go!

446
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,079
-Come on!
-I need to protect His Majesty!

447
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,640
Did you forget what His Majesty said last night?

448
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,439
He told us to stay out of this.

449
00:18:24,439 --> 00:18:24,839
No way!

450
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:25,520
This is between him and his wife.

451
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,839
We shouldn't meddle with their affair.

452
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:28,040
-Come on.
-Really?

453
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,280
Just listen to me. Let's go.

454
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:29,920
Yunchong,

455
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,760
stop asking questions.

456
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,160
Sister-in-law,

457
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,000
I didn't agree to it.

458
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,040
-I'm going to look for Liu Baiyu.
-What's the matter?

459
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,000
Why are you looking for her?

460
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,680
Liu Baiyu!

461
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:35,560
Come back!

462
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,079
We should form a group!

463
00:18:42,199 --> 00:18:43,680
Your Majesty, let's go.

464
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,160
Your Majesty,

465
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,599
where do you wish to go?

466
00:18:55,479 --> 00:18:56,079
Anywhere is fine.

467
00:18:56,239 --> 00:18:56,680
Your Majesty?

468
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,599
Wait, Liu Baiyu

469
00:18:57,599 --> 00:18:58,599
didn't heed my warning!

470
00:18:58,599 --> 00:18:59,959
Where are you going?

471
00:18:59,959 --> 00:19:00,959
Calm down.

472
00:19:00,959 --> 00:19:01,599
Why did you think

473
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:02,599
I wanted them to form a group?

474
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:03,520
Tell me why then.

475
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,319
Sister-in-law,

476
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,959
you're sending Yunzhang into the tiger's mouth!

477
00:19:05,959 --> 00:19:07,400
You're too naive.

478
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:09,599
Liu Baiyu wants to approach His Majesty, right?

479
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:10,920
We should create opportunities for her

480
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,199
and see what kind of trick she has up her sleeves.

481
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,680
Only then, I can form

482
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,520
a countermeasure

483
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,560
and deal with her accordingly.

484
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:17,560
Sister-in-law,

485
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,160
you're wise indeed.

486
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,160
(Luckily, I'm intelligent.)

487
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:23,199
(If not, Yunchong would have ruined my plan.)

488
00:19:23,199 --> 00:19:23,959
(That was close.)

489
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,479
Let's go.

490
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,520
This is adorable.

491
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:31,560
Your Majesty...

492
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:35,239
Your Majesty?

493
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,479
Miss!

494
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:41,280
Please buy some flowers!

495
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,079
No, we won't.

496
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:42,719
Wait.

497
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,479
Look over there.

498
00:19:44,479 --> 00:19:45,760
Did you see that lady over there?

499
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,599
Yes, I did.

500
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,000
You can sell all of your flowers

501
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,040
if you approach that lady.

502
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:50,680
That lady?

503
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,400
I thought the mister should be the one
buying my flowers?

504
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,839
Just sell your flowers to that lady,

505
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:55,400
and let her give them to the mister.

506
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,560
But why?

507
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,560
Who said only men could buy flowers?

508
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,199
The lady has feelings
that she wants to express too.

509
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,280
She needs the flowers to express them.

510
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,079
Do you understand?

511
00:20:02,239 --> 00:20:02,839
Yes.

512
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:03,959
You should go then.

please buy some flowers for the mister.

520
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:19,920
I'm sure he will like them.

521
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,439
You want me to buy them for him?

522
00:20:22,959 --> 00:20:25,160
Little girl, I think you said the opposite thing.

523
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:30,199
You can do it!

524
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,479
I'll buy them.

525

Sister-in-law,

526
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:52,959
this move is exceptional indeed.

527
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,400
Exceptional?

528
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,920
Stop being modest.

529
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,800
You're forcing her to buy flowers

530
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,199
for Yunzhang in public.

531
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:01,199
She's stuck in a dilemma.

532
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:02,560
If she doesn't buy them,

533
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,959
that means she's not respecting Yunzhang.

534
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:05,319
If she does buy them,

535
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:06,319
it'll be strange

536
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:08,599
because it's uncommon for women
to give flowers to men.

537
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:10,520
She has to be shameless to do so.

538
00:21:11,239 --> 00:21:11,920
Nice.

539
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,479
And, the thing is, she has no money!

540
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:19,479
I!

541
00:21:19,479 --> 00:21:20,560
Let me buy them.

542
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,959
I think this is enough for all of them.

543
00:21:25,959 --> 00:21:27,079
It's more than enough. Thank you.

544
00:21:27,959 --> 00:21:29,199
Give them to this beautiful lady.

545
00:21:29,199 --> 00:21:30,760
-These are flowers fit for the beauty.
-Miss, here you go.

546
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:32,319
Thank you, Your Majesty.

547
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,079
How could Yunzhang do that?

548
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,160
This Liu Baiyu...

549
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:38,040
Sister-in-law, why are you still here?

550
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,239
We should go after them!

551
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,160
Does that count as a success?

552
00:21:44,479 --> 00:21:45,560
I guess it's half a success.

However, it doesn't look that special to me.

559

What did you say, Your Majesty?

560

Not only are the dishes here delectable,

00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:31,940
Your Majesty,

660
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:34,180
I was just kidding.

661
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,500
If possible, I would head to the streets

662
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,140
and tell everyone that you're my husband.

663
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:38,900
However, as this is a secret trip,

664
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,580
we should keep a low profile.

665
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,220
That's why I'm holding it in.

666
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:44,860
So, you were holding it in?

667
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,820
Yes, it's not easy, you know?

668
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,300
(You're still pretending?)

669
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:51,580
(Let's see how long you can keep this up.)

670
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,420
Say, judging by the condition,

671
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,620
don't you think His Majesty
has fallen for Her Majesty?

672
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:01,980
I don't know about that.

673
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,620
However, judging by
Her Majesty's recent performance,

674
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:06,860
I think she has fallen for His Majesty once again.

675
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,700
Not necessarily.

676
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:10,780
Hey, you don't even know

677
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:11,860
what's going on yourself,

678
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:12,780
but you want me to stay out of their affair?

679
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:13,780
What do you mean by this?

680
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:14,780
I just think

681
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:16,180
that His Majesty's relationship
with Her Majesty

682
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,140
is quite confusing.

683
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:19,620
It's not as simple as it seems.

684
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:22,380
I think we should stay out of their affair.

685
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,620
If not, we'll be dragged into it.

686
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,580
Is it that serious?

687
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,820
How could I not detect that at all?

688
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,180
Enough, stop thinking about it.

689
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,180
We shouldn't try to meddle with their love affair

690
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,980
when we have not gotten
into a relationship before.

691
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,500
If you have that much free time,

692
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,140
you should think about

693
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,420
the things we can do for the people.

694
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:38,940
Wang,

695
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,660
I heard there's a free tea stall
set up by the local authorities up ahead.

696
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:41,700
Let's get some free drinks.

697
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,380
All right. Let's go.

698
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,060
Local authorities?

699
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:44,540
Tea stall?

700
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:45,620
Let's go.

701
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:46,780
Let's go.

702
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,100
Don't be impatient. Calm down.

703
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:50,100
Don't fight.

704
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,140
-Thank you.
-One by one, please.

705
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:51,580
Hold this.

706
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:52,300
Be careful.

707
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:52,940
Thank you.

708
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,860
Don't be impatient. Take your turns.

709
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:55,820
-Take your turns.
-Everyone has a share.

710
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:57,780
-Here.
-Sirs,

711
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,620
thank you for your help today.

712
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,260
If not,

713
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,260
we would have been overwhelmed

714
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,700
by the crowd who join the festival.

715
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:04,740
You're welcome.

716
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:06,620
It's our duty to serve the people.

717
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,300
Thank you, sirs.

718
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:09,900
Don't mention it.

719
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:10,740
Be careful with it, okay?

720
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:11,500
Thank you.

721
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,300
-Here.
-Take it.

722
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:15,420
Take your turns.

723
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:18,580
You can take over.

724
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:19,580
I'll help them out.

725
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:20,340
Go ahead.

726
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:26,860
Go now.

727
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:41,780
Your Majesty,

728
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,580
although you don't know much about me,

729
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,620
I've heard about your story since I was little.

730
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,780
Since you were little, Your Majesty
had shown impressive intellect.

731
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:53,020
Not only were you elegant, educated,
and ambitious,

732
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:55,420
but you were also a virtuous ruler.

733
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,620
It's a shame

734
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:58,340
that there was no one

735
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:00,420
to keep you company

736
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:01,900
and share your burdens with you.

737
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,100
Your Majesty,

738
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,140
I'm sure you were lonely.

739
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:06,620
(Great job.)

740
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,580
(Third step in courting your love,)

(To show your support as a gentle lady.)

743
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,060
Is that so?

744
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,340
So, are you saying

745
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:18,140
that not even my mother

746
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,220
or any one of my trusted aides

747
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:22,060
can understand what I'm thinking?

748
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:22,740
Are you saying

749
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:25,580
that I've been living in misery all these years?

750
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,220
No!

751
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:30,620
That's not what I mean!

752
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:31,420
That's not it.

753
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,380
That's it.

754
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:34,300
That's not what I mean.

755
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:39,420
Let's dig in for now.

756
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,060
I...

757
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,660
It's so spicy.

758
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:06,540

763
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:21,300
So delicious.

764
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:22,700
(So, it's not enough.)

765

(Seems like I need to do something extra.)

766

Your Majesty.

767
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:27,180
What are you doing?

768
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:28,340
You should forget about the formalities

769
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,900
now that you're out of the palace.

770
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:30,700
Throw away your chopsticks!

771
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,700
Use your hands!

772
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,180
I like to use chopsticks.
What can you do about it?

773
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:34,660
Your Majesty,

774
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:35,700
I know you the best.

775
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:36,580
Stop pretending to be stubborn.

776
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:37,620
Your inner beast

777
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:39,340
was always chained down
by those obnoxious palace rules.

778
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:40,900
Here, let me unshackle you.

779
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,060
(Seems like she's trying to trick me again.)

780
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,460
(Could this be one of their plots too?)

781
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,180
Your Majesty, what are you doing?

782
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,740
I suddenly think that Jinfeng has a point.

783
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,020
Miss Baiyu, you should join us too.

784
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,020
Throw away your chopsticks.

785
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:55,860
No, Your Majesty.

786
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,780
I don't think this is appropriate.

787
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:00,300
Your Majesty, you should lead by example.

788
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:02,300
Miss Baiyu knows the people better than me.

789
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,060
Baiyu shall do it first.

790
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:05,020
I have no choice but to defy you, Your Majesty!

791
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:06,220
Just kill me already!

792
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,700
Your Majesty, go ahead!

793
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,180
It's either we both throw away our chopsticks

794
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:11,260
or you let go of me right now.

795
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:13,500
Your Majesty!

796
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,340
What are you guys doing?

797
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:20,700
It's lucky that I came up

798
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:21,700
with that excellent move.

799
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:22,500
If not,

800
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,860
Liu Baiyu would laugh at me

801
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:24,940
if she knew that I was tailing her.

802
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,020
Now,

803
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,140
I'll pretend that it was a coincidence.

804
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:28,580
A coincidence.

805
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,140
Get out of the way!

806
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:31,020
What are you guys doing?

807
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:33,180
Who are you guys?

808
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,540
I carved Miss Baiyu's name

809
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,460
on my arm

810
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,500
and I kiss it every day.

811
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:37,780
You should kiss the real deal.

812
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:38,740
I would die for it.

813
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:39,700
Such wishful thinking!

814
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,780
You have to bring her to a quiet place

815
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:43,260
before you do anything to her.

816
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:44,820
Listen,

817
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:45,700
I just want

818
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,580
a handkerchief with her sweat on it.

819
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:47,980
So, they're Liu Baiyu's admirers.

820
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:49,300
No wonder they're so rude.

821
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:53,380
Kiss her? Her handkerchief?

822
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:54,820
Do anything to her?

823
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,140
They disgust me.

824
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:01,580
So, you guys are here?

825
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:07,140
-Your Majesty!
-What are you guys doing?

826
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,060
Is this a three-way tug-of-war?

827
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:16,500
Just put it down.

828
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,260
There are other people here.

829
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:18,540
-She should let go!
-He should let go!

830
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:21,420
All of you are members of the imperial palace.

831
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:23,100
Do you guys need to resort to this

832
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:23,900
for a pair of chopsticks?

833
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:25,660
Let go of me.

834
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,060
-No way!
-Let go of me!

835
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:29,700
These should be enough for you.

836
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:32,140
Come.

837
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:33,900
It's been a while.

838
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:35,540
Everyone,

839
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:36,740
following the usual,

840
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:38,660
each of us shall recite one verse

841
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:41,300
to praise our goddess, Miss Baiyu.

842
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,220
What do you guys think?

843
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,340
Great!

844
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:44,780
Baiyu,

845
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:47,060
did someone mention your name just now?

846
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:49,380
Who are they? They're so noisy.

847
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:53,020
It's nothing. They are just my admirers.

848
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:55,980
Your admirers?

849
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:58,340
I'm not deaf. I can hear what she said.

850
00:31:58,340 --> 00:31:59,140
I shall go ahead then.

851
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:02,460
Born with beauty, her eyebrows glow.

852
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:04,860
What a great verse!

853
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,740
What? You?

854
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:08,300
Born with beauty?

855
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:09,860
That's not true.

856
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:11,060
I'll start the topic then.

857
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,100
Go ahead.

858
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:13,140
I have one for her too.

859
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,380
Full of talents, her value grows.

860
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:16,060
Full of talents?

861
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,700
What a great verse.

862
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:19,260
No one would believe that.

863
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,700
Let me think.

864
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:22,380
Don't restrain yourself.

865
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:24,140
My heart is aching

866
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,540
as I long for her!

867
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,700
My goodness, his heart is aching.

868
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,540
He's an idiot.

869
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:33,980
I!

870
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,220
Here, Sister-in-law.

871
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,700
You're welcome. We're on the same side.

872
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:37,740
It's my duty to help you out.

873
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:41,060
Look. Isn't that Miss Baiyu?

874
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:41,980
That's right.

875
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,820
Baiyu, they saw you.

876
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:45,700
That's right. Look.

877
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:46,620
She's right opposite us.

878
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:47,700
It is Miss Baiyu.

879
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:48,300
Baiyu,

880
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:49,620
follow me to their side.

881
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:50,140
But why?

882
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:51,820
Time to show them your charm.

883
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:53,420
Let's go.

884
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,820
Miss Baiyu!

885
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:57,260
Miss Baiyu!

886
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,940
Miss Baiyu, I was lucky enough
to encounter you once before this.

887
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,700
She does look like the person in the portrait.

888
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:01,420
That's right!

889
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:02,700
Miss Baiyu!

890
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:03,460
I know that!

891
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:04,340
I have admired you for a long time!

892
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:05,740
I've read every poem you've written!

893
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:06,660
-Me too!
-Me too!

894
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:07,340
Miss Baiyu!

895
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:07,580
Thank you.

896
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:08,620
I have a go manual
that was passed down from my family.

897
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:09,700
I always wanted to study it

898
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:10,700
together with you.

899
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:11,620
Me too!

900
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:13,980
Miss Baiyu!

901
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:14,860
Your Majesty!

902
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,060
It's fine.

903
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,660
They're your admirers.

904
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:18,540
I don't think they'll do anything to you.

905
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:19,740
That's right.

906
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:20,540
Miss Baiyu!

907
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,540
Please sign here for me!

908
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:22,820
-Me too!
-Me too!

909
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:24,420
-Don't touch her.
-Don't do this!

910
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,340
Don't touch her!

911
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,220
Wait!

912
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:28,660
-Miss Baiyu!
-Stop dragging her!

913
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,340
Stop dragging her!

914
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:31,940
-Stop!
-Who are you guys?

915
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:32,500
Let's go!

916
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,340
-Who are you?
-We'll make a move first!

917
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:34,300
Come on!

918
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,700
-Miss Baiyu!
-Miss Baiyu!

919
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:36,060
Your Majesty!

920
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,500
-Miss Baiyu!
-Miss Baiyu!

921
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,300
Wait for me!

922
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:50,860
That's all the money you brought?

923
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,420
We're not here to indulge ourselves.

924
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:53,900
Why should I bring that much money with me?

925
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,340
What about you? I'm sure you brought a lot.

926
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,020
I only brought a sack of gold taels.

927
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:58,340
I already gave it to the flower seller.

928
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:01,060
Sir and Madam,

929
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:02,820
this isn't enough

930
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:05,460
to pay the bills for all three tables.

931
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:06,940
What about this?

932
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:09,380
One of you can stay here

933
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,020
while the other can head back
and retrieve the money.

934
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:12,500
Wait, sir.

935
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,500
I don't understand.

936
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,620
Why must we pay

937
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:15,820
for the other two tables as well?

938
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,340
They went after your friend.

939
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:20,300
Of course, you have to pay for them.

940
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,020
I didn't touch their food at all!

941
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:24,100
Enough. Don't be so calculative.

942
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,100
It's just two tables.

943
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:27,020
So, is the discount you mentioned still valid?

944
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:27,860
Discount?

945
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:31,180
So, you two are a couple?

946
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:33,700
Wait.

947
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:35,420
They said they weren't a couple.

948
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,540
That's right. We're not a couple.

949
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:37,700
Sir,

950
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,460
can we work here

951
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:39,380
to pay for the bills?

952
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:40,580
I can do the dishes for you.

953
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:42,420
(This way, I don't need to return to the palace.)

954
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:43,460
(I can even look for Mother.)

955
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:44,740
(This is a blessing in disguise.)

956
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:45,980
What do you mean by that?

957
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:47,420
You don't want to head back?

958
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:49,140
That's not it. You misunderstood me.

959
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,100
I was just thinking

960
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,340
that we shouldn't owe people any money.

961
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,300
Sir, where's the kitchen?

962
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,140
I'll do the dishes right now.

963
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:56,180
It's just the dishes, isn't it?

964
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:57,380
I can do them too.

965
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:58,020
No, you can't.

966
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:59,900
You're not used to doing chores.
You won't be able to do them.

967
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,580
It's not like my hands will be ruined
if I do them.

968
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:02,500
I can learn.

969
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:04,460
I'm just afraid that we have
to pay more if you smash the dishes.

970
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:06,380
If so, we can do the dishes
until we make enough to pay off the bill.

971
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:07,500
What are you talking about?

972
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,540
Sir and Madam, please stop arguing.

973
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,740
Qingyun Restaurant

974
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:11,980
doesn't accept labor work

975
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,740
in exchange for the meal.

976
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:16,420
However, we do have another way

977
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:17,580
for you to make some money.

978
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,380
Ladies and gentlemen,

979
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:26,700
welcome to our annual

980
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:29,100
flower-identifying contest!

981
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:30,700
This contest

982
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:32,780
is open to anyone and everyone.

983
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:35,860
Age and gender don't matter.

984
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:37,780
We welcome you to join the contest

985
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:39,020
no matter where you come from

986
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:40,780
as long as you're willing.

987
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,980
-Great!
-Great!

988
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,940
So, this is the way you mentioned earlier?

989
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:47,340
You guys were lucky to be here today.

990
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:48,220
This contest

991
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:49,660
is only held during this season.

992
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:50,820
The prize money

993
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,860
is enough for you to pay up
to 10 times your current bill.

994
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,300
Sir and Madam, what do you think?

995
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:56,060
Don't just stand here. Just join it.

996
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,060
Since you two are a couple,

997
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:59,460
I'm sure you two can outdo yourselves.

998
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:00,980
Who said we're a couple?

999
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,180
I'm not blind.

1000
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:05,660
One of you just had to go back
and retrieve the money.

1001
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,060
But you two insist on

1002
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:09,180
arguing with each other because of that.

1003
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,580
It's obvious that you two are a couple.

1004
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:12,180
It was a false front.

1005
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:15,500
I know the argument was a false front.

1006
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:18,860
But that's the newest way
of showing off one's relationship.

1007
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:20,540
It's the latest trend. I know that.

1008
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:21,620
I know all about that.

1009
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:23,020
-We want to join the contest!
-We want to join the contest!

1010

Go now!

1011
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,020
The contest will run out of slots soon!

1012
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,380
We have two contestants over here!

1013
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:28,140
Don't do that!

1014
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,100
Hurry!

1015
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,180
Go now!

1016
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,340
Just go already!

1017
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:35,500
Hurry!

1018
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:40,460
Miss Baiyu!

1019
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:41,420
Look at me!

1020
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:42,380
Miss Baiyu!

1021
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:44,300
-Miss Baiyu, give me your signature!
-Hurry!

1022
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:45,580
Miss Baiyu!

1023
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:47,700
Miss Baiyu! Don't run!

1024
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:49,620
Miss Baiyu!

1025
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,500
Why is Miss Baiyu

1026
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:53,620
together with Prince Yunchong right now?

1027
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:54,660
(Miss Baiyu!)

1028
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:56,900
The affairs of the imperial family
are confusing indeed.

1029
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,660
Now, I will announce the rules.

1030
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,000
Our rules are simple.

1031
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,399
The contestants shall take turns

1032
00:37:03,479 --> 00:37:06,080
to smell the scent of the flowers inside the box.

1033
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:06,919
After that,

1034
00:37:06,919 --> 00:37:09,879
the contestants need to identify
and tell us the types of flowers inside the box.

1035
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,159
One type of flower for each round.

1036
00:37:11,639 --> 00:37:13,000
Those who answered incorrectly
will be eliminated.

1037
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,239
The last man standing will be our winner.

1038
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:17,159
Baiyu! Yunchong!

1039
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,159
Over there!

1040
00:37:19,159 --> 00:37:19,719
Hurry!

1041
00:37:21,959 --> 00:37:22,879
Please make way for us.

1042
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,040
Hurry!

1043
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,320
-Miss Baiyu!
-Miss Baiyu!

1044
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,080
Wait for me, Miss Baiyu!

1045
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,639
-Miss Baiyu!
-Miss Baiyu!

1046
00:37:27,919 --> 00:37:29,159
Look at me, Miss Baiyu!

1047
00:37:29,159 --> 00:37:31,800
-Miss Baiyu!
-Miss Baiyu!

1048
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,679
Where did Miss Baiyu go?

1049
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:33,679
Sir,

1050
00:37:33,679 --> 00:37:35,159
they are the ones who didn't pay for their food.

1051
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:35,919
Where are they?

1052
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,879
It's been a long time
since I resorted to violence!

1053
00:37:37,959 --> 00:37:38,600
Don't run!

1054
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:44,959
They're gone!

1055
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,280
The affairs outside of the palace
are too complicated.

1056
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:51,919
Luckily, we didn't dine and dash.

1057
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,679
My mother was right.

1058
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:55,679
We can only live with peace of mind
if we retain our conscience.

1059
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,360
So, since we don't need to pay the bill,

1060
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,639
that means we don't need
to join this boring contest.

1061
00:37:58,639 --> 00:37:59,719
But why?

1062
00:37:59,879 --> 00:38:01,879
We can do plenty of things with the prize money.

1063
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:02,679
Besides,

1064
00:38:02,679 --> 00:38:03,280
have you ever made a single cent

1065
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,639
by yourself?

1066
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:05,800
I don't need to do that.

1067
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,159
I will withdraw from the contest.

1068
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:10,919
I thought you said you were going
to join the contest?

1069
00:38:10,919 --> 00:38:11,679
I said you would join the contest.

1070
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:12,879
I didn't say I was going to join it.

1071
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:13,800
And, after I gave it a thought,

1072
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,159
I don't think I can win the contest for sure.

1073
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:16,159
I'll provide you with dual insurance.

1074
00:38:16,159 --> 00:38:16,959
What do you mean?

1075
00:38:17,719 --> 00:38:18,639
What does that mean?
