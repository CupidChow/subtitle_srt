00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,760
If we don't resolve it now,

168
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:26,600
not only will all the men die off,

169
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,920
but the women here will also go crazy.

170
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,720
Don't you think so?

171
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,359
Precisely.

172
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,079
We mustn't let her leave.

173
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:33,720
I do know about that.

174
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,000
-However...
-Sorceress Zhao said

175
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,399
that your daughter has a strong spirit.

176
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:37,839
She's the village belle too.

177
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,799
If she can get married

178
00:07:39,799 --> 00:07:41,480
to a suitable man,

179
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:44,600
we'll be able to avoid the curse.

180
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:46,839
A suitable man?

181
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:47,920
Who?

182
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,320
Of course,

183
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:53,480
it's our handsome prince, Yu Changya.

184
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:55,040
What?

185
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:00,359
Look, they are a perfect match!

186
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,480
Not at all!

187
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,440
We're not a match at all!

188
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,720
We're not a good match for each other!

189
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:04,440
Village Head,

190
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,640
stop spouting nonsense.

191
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,720
The saying of cursed wives

192
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,559
is just a myth.

193
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,359
And I was already engaged to another man.

194
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:11,320
You were already engaged?

195
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:12,720
Who is your husband-to-be?

196
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,320
His name is Xuan.

197
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,720
Xuan?

198
00:08:16,359 --> 00:08:17,000
Is there someone with the surname "Xuan"
in our village?

199
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,040
No.

200
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,079
No. She's lying.

201
00:08:20,559 --> 00:08:22,519
I think you made it up.

202
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,640
I didn't.

203
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,559
What are you saying?

204
00:08:24,559 --> 00:08:25,119
Listen up.

205
00:08:25,119 --> 00:08:26,679
This is completely true.

206
00:08:26,679 --> 00:08:29,440
Her father arranged
the engagement for her in the past.

207
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,160
Mother,

208
00:08:30,359 --> 00:08:31,600
we have proof, right?

209
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,200
Show them the paintings and letters.

210
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,200
I'll bring the proof here.

211
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,039
Look.

212
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:45,599
Did you see it?

213
00:08:45,599 --> 00:08:47,159
This is my Xuan.

214
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:49,039
We've been writing letters
to each other for a long time.

215
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:51,919
If so, this engagement

216
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,679
will save our village.

217
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,000
If I must say,

218
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,919
we should hold this wedding.

219
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,679
You should hold your wedding

220
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,239
as soon as possible.

221
00:09:04,479 --> 00:09:05,119
All right.

222
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:28,239
Sun Baihui from Prince of Pingnan's Residence,

223
00:09:29,119 --> 00:09:33,359
Shen Aoxue from General Zhenyuan's Residence,

224
00:09:34,479 --> 00:09:38,479
Zhao Lanzhi from Minister of War's Residence.

225
00:09:40,119 --> 00:09:41,679
Look at all these beautiful ladies.

226
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:43,880
Each has her own charms.

227
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,919
[Empress Dowager]
I'm getting dizzy.

228
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,039
Isn't that so?

229
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:51,599
[Imperial Concubine]
Your Majesty can finally rest at ease

230
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,520
after His Majesty has selected his queen today.

231
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,440
I cannot rest at ease yet.

232
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,719
Zhang has to appoint his queen

233
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,239
before undertaking the coronation ceremony.

234
00:10:01,239 --> 00:10:02,919
After that, he can rule the nation.

235
00:10:03,479 --> 00:10:04,719
Only then,

236
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,760
I can truly rest at ease.

237
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,640
The Grand Chancellor has arrived!

238
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,320
The Grand Chancellor
is controlling the government

239
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,479
because he has authority over the military.

240
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:18,840
He doesn't show
the imperial family any respect at all.

241
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:22,000
He enters and exits
the Imperial Palace and the Inner Court at will.

242
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:22,840
Silence.

243
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,520
[Grand Chancellor, Liu Xie]
Greetings, Your Majesty, Your Highness.

244
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:36,520
Hurry.

245
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:38,280
Prepare a seat for the Grand Chancellor.

246
00:10:38,599 --> 00:10:39,320
No need for that.

247
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,119
Your Majesty,

248
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,559
all those beauties

249
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:51,919
were specially selected by me for His Majesty.

250
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:54,880
I wonder if you're happy with them.

251
00:10:56,479 --> 00:10:57,479
Of course I am.

252
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,679
Grand Chancellor, I'm sure
you only choose the best candidates.

253
00:11:02,359 --> 00:11:05,080
What about His Majesty's opinion?

254
00:11:06,719 --> 00:11:07,440
His Majesty?

255
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,679
I'm sure His Majesty

256
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,559
has the same opinion.

257
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,280
I beg to differ.

258
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:15,760
If not, he would've been here

259
00:11:16,119 --> 00:11:17,719
[Yufang Garden]
before me.

260
00:11:18,359 --> 00:11:19,760
Grand Chancellor, don't be angry.

261
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,320
Let's wait for a moment.

262
00:11:21,719 --> 00:11:24,520
Maybe His Majesty is delayed by something.

263
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,239
The queen selection is an important ceremony,

264
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:30,520
yet His Majesty is taking this lightly.

265
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:33,520
If so, how could I hand over the national affairs

266
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,799
to His Majesty in the future?

267
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,080
Someone,

268
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:39,239
invite His Majesty here immediately.

269
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,239
His Majesty has arrived!

270
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,880
I was late because I had something to attend to.

271
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:54,159
Mother, Consort Dowager,

272
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,000
Grand Chancellor,

273
00:11:56,599 --> 00:11:57,359
please forgive me.

274
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:05,960
She breached etiquette in front of His Majesty.

275
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,919
What a disgrace.

276
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,000
Drag her out

277
00:12:08,239 --> 00:12:09,159
and flog her 50 times.

278
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,119
Wait.

279
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,559
Grand Chancellor,

280
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,919
she's a woman.

281
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:19,119
She has a frail body.

282
00:12:19,479 --> 00:12:20,520
If you flog her 50 times,

283
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,080
she might die from it.

284
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:24,520
Don't you think the punishment is too heavy?

285
00:12:25,719 --> 00:12:26,400
Your Majesty,

286
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,640
I don't think it's heavy at all.

287
00:12:29,239 --> 00:12:31,239
Although Your Majesty was late,

288
00:12:31,239 --> 00:12:32,679
and everyone was exhausted from the wait,

289
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,320
the Empress Dowager,

290
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,479
the Consort Dowager,

291
00:12:35,479 --> 00:12:36,320
I,

292
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,719
and the rest were waiting for your arrival.

293
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,080
However, she's the only one who fainted.

294
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,400
Don't you think she should be punished?

295
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:45,760
Fine, Grand Chancellor.

296
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:48,799
I didn't try to be late on purpose.

297
00:12:49,599 --> 00:12:51,239
It's because I forgot about the time

298
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:53,840
when I was too absorbed
in coming up with exam questions.

299
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,080
If you insist on punishing someone,

300
00:12:56,599 --> 00:12:58,919
why don't you punish me instead?

301
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,080
I was used

302
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,679
to your beating when I was young anyway.

303
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:02,799
This punishment is nothing to me.

304
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,520
Your Majesty, you must be joking with me.

305
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,960
Your Majesty has grown up.

306
00:13:10,119 --> 00:13:11,599
You've reached the age

307
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,359
when you can rule the nation
in the blink of an eye.

308
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:17,599
However, Your Majesty, it seems
as if you're showing me no respect

309
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:20,520
even before you take over the nation.

310
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:21,919
I think

311
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,719
I need to reconsider whether Your Majesty

312
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:25,039
can rule the nation in your current state.

313
00:13:28,359 --> 00:13:29,599
Are you not sober yet?

314
00:13:29,599 --> 00:13:30,640
What's with all the nonsense?

315
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:33,320
Our priority today is the queen selection.

316
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:35,159
Hurry and take a look at them.

317
00:13:35,719 --> 00:13:36,840
The Grand Chancellor

318
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,359
selected them especially for you.

319
00:13:40,239 --> 00:13:41,159
Commander Su,

320
00:13:41,719 --> 00:13:42,719
[Imperial Commander, Su Jingtang]
Imperial Chef Chai,

321
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,919
[Imperial Physician, Shen Ao; Imperial Chef, Chai Tiezhou]
Imperial Physician Shen,

322
00:13:44,599 --> 00:13:46,719
please take a look at them

323
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,799
and find the best candidate among them.

324
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,039
Yes, Your Majesty.

325
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:56,880
If I have to pick, I'll pick the girl
who has a good physique in the middle.

326
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,520
She looks like she'll be a good caretaker.

327
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,239
Let's pick her.

328
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,719
Why don't you pick yourself, then?

329
00:14:01,119 --> 00:14:01,799
Let's pick you instead.

330
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:02,679
Pick me then.

331
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:04,119
Both of you are wrong.

Don't you think it's a bit stuffy in here?

790

Don't try to shift the topic.

791
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,900
Did Liu Xie send you here?

792

Go now.

795
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:33,580
Get me a pail of cold water

What the heck was that?

803
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:47,740
I need water.

805
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,420
His Majesty is doing right now?

806
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:55,420
Isn't it obvious?

807
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,580
An hour on a romantic night
is worth 1,000 pieces of gold.

00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:00,340
His Majesty is enjoying
her gentle cuddle right now.

809

I'm sure...

810
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:05,380
I'm sure he forgot about us!

811
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:07,580
Why are you behaving like a girl?

812
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:09,860
His Majesty has gotten himself a queen.

813
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:12,180
We should be happy for him.

814
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:15,020
And, even I,

815
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:18,100
who have served His Majesty since young,

816
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:18,900
didn't cry.

817
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,580
Why are you crying?

818
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,220
Don't worry.

819
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:25,220
His Majesty can never part with us

820
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,740
as long as he needs to practice martial arts,

821

eat, and will fall sick.

822

That's right.

823
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:30,260
No one

824
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:31,940
will cook for His Majesty if I'm not around.

825
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:33,860
If that's the case,

826
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:36,660
originally, I was number one
in His Majesty's heart.

827
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,420
Now that he has gotten himself a queen,

828
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:41,660
I guess I have no choice
but to be number two then.

829
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,740
I knew you were drunk.

830
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:44,380
What are you...

831
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:45,940
I'm the number one in His Majesty's heart.

832
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:49,060
Tie,

833
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:50,780
am I

834
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:52,220
seeing illusions?

835
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,260
Isn't that His Majesty?

836
00:36:58,580 --> 00:36:59,740
It is His Majesty!

837
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:00,820
Your Majesty!

838
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:02,660
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

839
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:04,140
What's wrong with you?

840
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:04,820
It's hot,

841
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,300
and my head hurts.

842
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:11,380
Shen Ao,

843
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,500
I didn't realize this before,

844
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,740
but you do look pretty handsome.

845
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:15,460
-Your Majesty?
-Your Majesty?

846
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:16,740
What's wrong with you?

847
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:20,180
Your Majesty,

848
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:21,340
you had some medicinal liquor.

849
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:22,340
That's why you're delirious.

850
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,820
Medicinal liquor?

851
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:24,700
Medicinal...

852
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:26,860
What should I do then?

853
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:27,780
Your Majesty,

854
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:28,660
pardon me for the offense.

855
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:29,940
Here, Your Majesty.

856
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:30,660
Is His Majesty going to be all right?

857
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:31,700
Come on, take a step back.

858
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:32,540
Your Majesty.

859
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:33,340
Your Majesty!

860
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:35,300
Your Majesty!

861
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:36,740
Is this pond deep?

862
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:37,980
Will His Majesty be all right?

863
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,220
Your Majesty!

864
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:41,060
Your Majesty!

865
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,300
Summon the Grand Chancellor.

866
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,340
I have questions for him.

867
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:47,980
Leave now.

868
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:49,380
Your Majesty,

869
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:51,260
what about I help you get changed first?

870
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:53,100
I will see him in this state.

871
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:54,420
Go now.

872
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:58,340
Your Majesty, there's no need
to trouble anyone else.

873
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,460
You summoned me in the middle of the night.

874
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:04,100
I wonder why.

875
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:06,460
Grand Chancellor, since you knew

876
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:08,300
I was summoning you,

877
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:10,060
I'm sure you know

878
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:11,260
what I'm going to ask you.

879
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:14,180
Such audacity!

880
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:15,220
Who's daring enough

881
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:16,620
to make His Majesty wet?

882
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:19,820
It's you, Grand Chancellor.

883
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:22,700
How could it be me?

884
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:26,220
Who else in the world
could address me by the name Xuan?

885
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,100
Who else do you think

886
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:30,860
can give my items to others
without my permission?

887
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:33,340
Who else do you think is daring enough

888
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:36,100
to impersonate your daughter

889
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,820
and replace the Queen?

890
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,340
No matter what I think,

891
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:42,540
I could only think of one name.

892
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:45,300
That is you, Grand Chancellor.

893
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,900
Your Majesty is wise indeed.

894
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,660
You faked an engagement for me

895
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:52,180
and found someone else to replace the Queen.

896
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:53,540
We have solid evidence of your crime.

897
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:55,060
What else do you have to say for yourself?

898
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:55,820
Your Majesty,

899
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:58,180
please do not malign me.

900
00:38:58,740 --> 00:38:59,820
The engagement is real.

901
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:01,140
She's my daughter too.

902
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:03,660
I was only following the posthumous edict

903
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,980
of the Late Emperor from the start.

904
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:07,980
Grand Chancellor, you're truly bold.

905
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,220
I've never heard that the Late Emperor

906
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:12,140
had left behind another posthumous edict.

907
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:16,780
Your Majesty, there are plenty of things
that you have no idea about.

908
00:39:28,464 --> 00:39:30,500
[Posthumous Edict of the Late Emperor]

909
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:34,300
(This is actually an authentic edict from Father?)

910
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:37,020
(There's even his personal seal.)

911
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:40,500
Even if the engagement was real,

912
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,580
Grand Chancellor, how could you prove to me

913
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:44,140
that she is your daughter?

914
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:45,860
According to my acknowledgment,

915
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:48,260
you only have one daughter,

916
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,980
and her name is Liu Baiyu.

917
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:54,460
Your Majesty, you're too naive.

918
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:58,500
Let's forget about the fact
that she's my biological daughter.

919
00:39:58,820 --> 00:39:59,940
Even if Heipang...

920
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:01,340
No.

921
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,740
Her name is Liu Jinfeng now.

922
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:07,300
Even if Jinfeng isn't my biological daughter,

923
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:08,300
who do you think

924
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:11,220
is daring enough to refute me?

925
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:16,260
Even so,

926
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:18,460
you can't just get me a country bumpkin as my wife.

927
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:20,420
I don't accept this.

928
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:22,300
However, I do think

929
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,980
Your Majesty is a perfect match for my daughter.

930
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:27,060
How dare you say that?

931
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:29,500
I'm speaking the truth.

932
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:32,420
All right. It's getting late now.

933
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:35,500
Your Majesty, today's your wedding day.

934
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:37,860
I shouldn't interrupt you.

935
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:40,980
I shall take my leave.

936
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:51,740
Just you wait.

937
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:05,460
So, this is Liu Baiyu?

938
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:07,220
This is the legendary

939
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:09,100
unsurpassed beauty, Liu Baiyu?

940
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:11,620
This can't be.

941
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:13,500
The maidservant in the Imperial Kitchen

942
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,620
is more elegant than her.

943
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:19,180
Not only did the rumors harm His Majesty,

944
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:20,820
but they also jeopardized the nation.

945
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:22,340
Cut it out.

946
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:23,820
Look at her.

947
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:25,260
Is she good enough for me?

948
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:25,980
My foot!

949
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:26,980
Who said she's a perfect match for you?

950
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:27,860
I'll deal with him.

951
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,460
It's like comparing Heaven and Earth.

952
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:30,740
Your Majesty,

953
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:33,380
you're a top-quality pork shoulder butt,

954
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,740
while she's a pork neck meat.

955
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:38,260
You two shouldn't show up at the same table.

956
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,260
Chai Tiezhou,

957
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,220
how dare you compare His Majesty to a swine?

958
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:42,580
That's not what I mean.

959
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:44,020
I was just saying that His Majesty and her

960
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,700
are totally different.

961
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:46,900
That's it.

962
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,020
Shen Ao,

963
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:48,900
deal with her.

964
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:55,060
Your Majesty,

965
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:56,460
I still think

966
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:59,180
that it's inappropriate for me
to pour water on Her Majesty

967
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:00,300
while she's sleeping.

968
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:01,660
Did you think it was appropriate
when you did it to me?

969
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:04,180
That's my goal all along.

970
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:04,700
Do it!

971
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:06,940
You're wasting our time here.

972
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:07,980
Imperial physicians are feeble indeed.

973
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:08,500
Let me do it!

974
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:10,060
What are the three of you doing?

975
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:11,900
I suddenly remember

976
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:13,900
that I have to remind you of something,
Your Majesty.

977
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:15,900
Your Majesty, please treat Her Majesty well.

978
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:17,620
Otherwise, I don't know what I will do

979
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:20,700
if you ever hurt my beloved daughter.

980
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:25,900
That darned scorpion,

981
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:27,140
why is he still here?

982
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:31,460
Is there someone out there?

983
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:33,380
No.

984
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,460
Darned scorpion,

985
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:40,420
you're everywhere.

986
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:42,380
Why don't you turn into a ghost?

987
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:56,140
Your Majesty,

988
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:59,900
Liu Xie replaced Liu Baiyu with Liu Jinfeng.

989
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:01,820
He has deceived the Emperor!

990
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:02,620
That's right.

991
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:03,940
His sin is unpardonable.

992
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:05,220
I suggest

993
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:07,980
we act immediately.

994
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:09,740
How can we tolerate this ridiculous act?

995
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:10,340
Am I right?

996
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:11,100
He's right.

997
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:12,180
Your Majesty,

998
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:14,900
that darned Liu Xie has gone too far.

999
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:16,420
He's too arrogant!

1000
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:17,740
Even I can no longer tolerate his demeanor!

1001
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:19,940
Let's do it!

1002
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:20,700
Let's do it!

1003
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,420
Let's launch a surprise attack on Liu Xie!

1004
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:28,060
Your Majesty,

1005
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:29,380
don't listen to their nonsense.

1006
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:31,580
They're just drunk.

1007
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:32,580
They'll forget everything

1008
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:33,780
when they wake up tomorrow.

1009
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:35,300
Your Majesty.

1010
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:39,340
I guess you're the only one who understands me.

1011
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:41,100
I'll skip the drink.

1012
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:43,140
I need to be sober

1013
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:44,540
under such circumstances.

1014
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:46,380
However, from tomorrow onward,

1015
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:49,380
I shall change my strategy.

1016
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:51,660
Your Majesty, what do you plan to do?

1017
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:53,300
Think about it.

1018
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:55,500
Liu Xie had done so much

1019
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:56,700
to plant Liu Jinfeng by my side.

1020
00:43:57,580 --> 00:43:59,500
I'm sure he's not just doing it to humiliate me.

1021
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:02,380
I will test this Liu Jinfeng

1022
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:03,940
and see what ulterior motives she has.

1023
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:06,140
I will see what she's up to.
