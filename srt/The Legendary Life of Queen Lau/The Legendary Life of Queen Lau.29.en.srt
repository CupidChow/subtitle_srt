However, I think

the female lead shouldn't forgive him easily.

Master, be careful.

72
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,079
This is a sacred item. You shouldn't drop it.

73

Just get straight to the point.

85
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,040
If not, I'll go to sleep.

You see...

87
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:57,239
You can return to Xuanchen Hall

88
00:04:57,239 --> 00:04:58,480
if you keep dilly-dallying.

89
00:05:00,679 --> 00:05:01,959
Is an apology that important to you?

90
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,480
You should apologize when you've made a mistake.

91
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:07,040
If so, will you apologize to me

92
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,239
if you make a mistake?

93
00:05:08,359 --> 00:05:09,160
Of course.

94
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:10,480
A fault confessed is half redressed.

95
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,480
I will never go back on my word.

96
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,279
Fine.

97
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,600
So, you and Yu Changya knew each other long ago.

98
00:05:14,799 --> 00:05:16,160
But you didn't tell me the truth.

99
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,320
Was it your fault?

100
00:05:17,559 --> 00:05:18,160
Yes, it was.

101
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,119
I'm sorry, it was my fault.

102
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,440
Is it that easy

103
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,440
to say them?

104
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,760
Is it that hard

105
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,959
to say them?

106
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,279
I'm the Emperor.

107
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,279
An emperor shouldn't apologize
to others this easily.

108
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,040
Who said so?

109
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:38,679
An emperor is the son of the heavens.

110
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:41,079
Have you ever seen an emperor
apologizing to other people?

111
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:43,559
Grand Tutor Wei often said

112
00:05:43,559 --> 00:05:44,600
that the people are the heavens.

113
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,399
The people are the heavens, and you're their son.

114
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:47,640
Why can't you apologize to others then?

115
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,359
Don't try to trick me.

116
00:05:56,359 --> 00:05:57,519
You have to apologize to me no matter what.

117
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:59,000
I won't accept an apology like this!

118
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,239
Jinfeng,

119
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:06,079
I'm sorry.

120
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:09,279
I guess it isn't that hard to apologize.

121
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,600
I feel at ease now.

122
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:17,160
By the way, Jinfeng,

123
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,839
follow me somewhere tomorrow.

124
00:06:22,679 --> 00:06:23,239
Okay.

125
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:25,600
Anything is fine.

126
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:30,040
Say,

127
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,679
don't tell me they're tricking us again

128
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,600
by putting up this notice?

129
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,519
The local authorities said
they would compensate us.

130
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:36,279
But the officials shield one another.

131
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,399

132

-Exactly.

00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:40,760
We won't get much from them.

135

136
00:06:57,119 --> 00:06:59,359
Everyone, please rise.

137
00:07:02,359 --> 00:07:03,399
I'm here today

138
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:05,720
to resolve the issue
with the emissaries of the Xiyue Empire.

139
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:14,720
Tell them.

140
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,720
I need to think before I speak.

141
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:21,959
The emissaries of the Xiyue Empire
have been wreaking havoc in the capital

142
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:24,640
and affecting the lives of everyone here.

143
00:07:25,119 --> 00:07:26,799
They are heinous sinners.

144
00:07:27,119 --> 00:07:28,640
-That's right.
-Indeed.

145
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,760
Precisely.

146
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,679
Are you going to tell them?

147
00:07:33,679 --> 00:07:34,959
-If not, I'm going to leave.
-Stop rushing me.

148
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,920
I'm so nervous.

149
00:07:37,799 --> 00:07:41,720
Actually, it's my fault
that the emissaries were able to wreak havoc.

150
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,679
I was too kind to them

151
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,720
and let down my guard.

152
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,079
That's why I couldn't give you guys

153
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,920
a reasonable response

154
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,040
when they hurt you all.

155
00:07:52,359 --> 00:07:52,959
I...

156
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,000
I would like to apologize to everyone here.

157
00:08:01,559 --> 00:08:02,359
I'm sorry.

158
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:06,519
His Majesty apologized to us?

159
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,359
We don't deserve that!

160
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:09,559
Your Majesty!

161
00:08:10,119 --> 00:08:11,320
Your Majesty, you actually apologized to us?

162
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:11,920
I...

163
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:14,880
I'm too touched to say anything!

164
00:08:17,559 --> 00:08:19,300
-Your Majesty is wise!
-Your Majesty is wise!

165
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,300
-Your Majesty is a wise ruler!
-Everyone, please don't worry.

166
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,500
As long as you guys report your losses

167
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,860
to the Ministry of Rites,

168
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:26,220
I'll make sure you are fully compensated.

169
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:27,460
Your Majesty,

170
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,740
what are you saying?

171
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,380
The little wealth we've lost

172
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,020
cannot compare to your generosity!

173
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,460
-Yes!
-That's right!

174
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:38,500
-Long live Your Majesty!
-Long live Your Majesty!

175
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,580
What did I say again?

176
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,100
It's resolved, isn't it?

177
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:43,260
Zhang Qian,

178
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:44,460
let's head back.

179
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,260
Yes, sir.

180
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:01,700
How was it?

181
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,860
I feel especially carefree right now.

182
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,140
I told you so.

183
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:09,020
Not only will an apology not embarrass you,

184
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,540
but it will also give you peace of mind.

185
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:11,580
Jinfeng, you were right.

186
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:13,620
Wait.

187
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,260
Jing.

188
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,700
Have you finished drafting up the name list

189
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:19,540
of the imperial bodyguards?

190
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:20,500
I have.

191
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,580
When will you send it to me?

192
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,180
Immediately.

193
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,300
Should I apologize to him?

194
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:30,460
Wait for me.

195
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:33,300
Jing.

196
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:34,740
What's wrong again?

197
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,940
I have to apologize to you too.

198
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:39,860
You had defended me

199
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,300
all this while.

200
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,420
You had to endure

201
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:44,980
all kinds of grievances for my sake.

202
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:46,860
But don't worry.

203
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,740
Next time, I'll face them personally.

204
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,060
Sorry about that.

205
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:56,340
Shuan.

206
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:57,220
Me?

207
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,580
Your Majesty, are you
going to apologize to me too?

208
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,820
You're overthinking it.

209
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,260
Now that I think about it,

210
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,980
I haven't done anything to let you down.

211
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,820
I'll apologize to you next time.

212
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,420
Did I hear wrongly?

213
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,260
Did I hear wrongly?

214
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,140
His Majesty said he would apologize
to me next time.

215
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,580
What do you think about my performance?

216
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,580
You were amazing, Your Majesty.

217
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,540
I thought so too.

218
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,180
Do I need to apologize to the others?

219
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:25,180
Of course.

220
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:25,620
Who shall I apologize to?

221
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,500
You have to apologize to Grand Tutor Wei.

222
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:26,820
You're right.

223
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:27,700
Empress Dowager too.

224
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,660
-Yes.
-And Consort Dowager Xu.

225
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:29,100
You're right.

226
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,820
I think you should apologize to Chai Tiezhou too.

227
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,700
This feels great.

228
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,020
Sufang, prepare our meals.

229
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:34,700
That can wait.

230
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,260
There's something more important
than having our meals.

231
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,060
What is it?

232
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:37,580
The letter.

233
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,900
Are you still dwelling on it?

234
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:41,460
Come here.

235
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:49,660
What is this?

236
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:50,420
Take a look.

237
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,100
[To Jinfeng]

238
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,140
It's just some letters.

239
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,140
It's a piece of cake for me.

240
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,700
I've written them again.

241
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,580
I copied them

242
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:58,380
word for word.

243
00:10:58,900 --> 00:10:59,820
Listen up.

244
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:00,940
From now on,

245
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,820
you can only remember the content
of these letters.

246
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,100
Forget about the past letters.

247
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:07,660
No matter if it's the past, the present,

248
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,300
or the future,

249
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,500
I'm the only person you can have a crush on.

250
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:31,940
-Stop right there!
-Stop!

251
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:36,500
Stop running!

252
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,500
You have no way to escape now.

253
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,140
Sir!

254
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:43,740
Sir,

255
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,220
I have some gold with me.

256
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,580
You can have it all.

257
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:50,340
It's solid gold indeed.

258
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,340
Please spare my life!

259
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,260
You can have it all!

260
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,860
The gold is ours.

261
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,140
Your life

262
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:56,740
is ours too!

263
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,100
It's been so many years.

264
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:24,260
What will come will come eventually.

265
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,300
Another year had passed.

266
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,580
Time does fly.

267
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,620
Back then...

268
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:43,900
Forget it.

269
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,300
It's not worth mentioning.

270
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:57,940
What's your name?

271
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:00,780
Your Highness, I'm Ling Yu'er.

272
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:01,900
His Majesty assigned me

273
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,420
to assist Your Highness in your task.

274
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,020
How old are you?

275
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,380
I'm 16 this year.

276
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:08,860
Sixteen?

277
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:15,620
Back then, I was 16 too

278
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,100
when I first joined the palace.

279
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,580
He said he would bring me home soon.

280
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:25,420
But 20 years had passed in the blink of an eye.

281
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,220
Your Highness, don't worry.

282
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:29,540
We will do our best

283
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,060
to find the name list.

284
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:33,980
The Qianhuafu Formula.

285
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,300
Consort Li had such a well-thought-out plan.

286
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,340
In the end, all of us were mistaken.

287
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,980
The name list isn't as simple as it seems.

288
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:45,340
Your Highness,

289
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,100
His Majesty said...

290
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:46,740
That's enough.

291
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,540
He always says the same thing.

292
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,260
I'm getting tired of them.

293
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,300
Your Highness,

294
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,340
you must trust His Majesty.

295
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:56,380
Of course.

296
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,500
I do trust him.

297
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:08,220
Mother!

298
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,300
My goodness!

299
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:09,620
Mother!

300
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:10,500
Get up!

301
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:11,540
What are you doing here?

302
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:12,420
This place...

303
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,460
This place is such a pain to locate.

304
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,220
It was terrible.

305
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,500
Why did you sleep here?

306
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,540
Last night...

307
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,100
Did Liu Xie bully you?

308
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,100
It's fine. Just tell me what happened.

309
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,100
-I'll uphold justice for you.
-You see...

310
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,420
To be honest...

311
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:28,980
Hurry!

312
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,140
Your father is...

313
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:31,780
Your Majesty!

314
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:32,940
The Grand Chancellor has arrived!

315
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,540
How dare he show himself?

316
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:39,580
[Xiangluo Hall]

317
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:40,260

Father.

319
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:42,820
Where's your mother?

320
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:43,660
Mother?

321
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:44,700
Shouldn't she be with you?

322
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,860
Why would she be here?

323
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,020
Stop messing around.

324
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:47,900
Tell your mother to come out.

325
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:48,660
I'm not messing around.

326
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,860
Mother isn't here.

327
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,620
How can you prove that she's here?

328
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,100
[Xiangluo Hall]
She gave me this herself.

329
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,100
Why did she tell you where she went

330
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,660
when she was running away from home?

331

since you've already found her,

I won't hide her from you.

335
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,460
You knew full well

336
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:14,460
what you had done to Mother.

337
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:15,980
Mother will stay here for the time being.

338
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,220
We can talk when you realize your mistake.

339
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:18,340
Nonsense!

340
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:19,900
Every nation has its own laws
and every family has its own rules.

341
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:20,940
This is the Imperial Harem.

342
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,220
How could your mother stay here?

343
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,300
I'm the Queen.

344
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,540
I govern the Imperial Harem.

345
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,580
It's fine when I say it's fine.

346
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:26,540
No.

347
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,620
Your mother has to leave with me today.

348
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,180
Father,

349
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,660
are you trying to steal Mother from me?

350
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:39,820
Grand Chancellor.

351
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,540
Are you sure you don't want
to let your mother leave?

352
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:46,420
It has already come to this.

353
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,820
How could I let her return to your place?

354
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,180
I don't want you to bully her.

355
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,060
Do you think I have no way to deal with her

356
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,060
if she stays here?

357
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:53,340
What?

358
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,540
Are you trying to steal her from me
in front of His Majesty?

359
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:56,340
Nonsense.

360
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,820
I, Liu Xie, do not need to steal a woman.

361
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,540
What do you wish to do then?

362
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:03,380
I wish

363
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,180
to leave.

364
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:12,820
How could you

365
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:14,060
give up so easily?

366
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,580
I'm not a man if I steal her from you.

367
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,100
I'll coax her and beg her to return.

368
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:32,700
Please have some tea.

369
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:34,780
Mother,

370
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,540
why do I feel like you've gotten thinner?

371
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:39,900
Yes.

372
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:41,540
You have gotten thinner indeed.

373
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:42,940
Mother,

374
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,740
why do I feel like you've gotten more tanned?

375
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:45,340
More tanned?

376
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:46,780
Yes.

377
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:47,980
You have gotten more tanned indeed.

378
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:49,900
Mother,

379
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,020
why do I feel like
there are more wrinkles on your face?

380
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:53,980
Really?

381
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,420
Jinfeng was telling the truth.

382
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:04,140
Mother,

383
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,620
did Liu Xie treat you badly?

384
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:06,500
That's not it.

385
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,660
Is it that serious?

386
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,300
When I last returned to the village,

387
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:16,900
Butcher Zhang said I've gotten fairer

388
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,140
and younger!

389
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:19,900
That's right.

390
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:21,700
Butcher Zhang has great taste indeed.

391
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:23,820
Mother,

392
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:26,100
how was his daughter, Ruhua?

393
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,100
Did he marry her off?

394
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,420
What about our neighbor, Juan?

395
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,020
And Furong,

396
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,260
the girl who was rejected 20 times,

397
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:31,300
how are they doing?

398
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,220
Xianpa Village changed

399
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,340
ever since

400
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,500
you left the village.

401
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,620
Mother, what happened?

402
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,380
You see,

403
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,740
this is a long story.

404
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,180
Her legs have grown thicker.

405
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:56,980
Her arms have grown thicker too.

406
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:01,660
Her waist is really thick!

407
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:02,660
Madam Yuan,

408
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,300
are you done taking her measurements?

409
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,100
Yes. I'm done.

410
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,580
Mother, I'm exhausted.

411
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:07,180
You're exhausted?

412
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,740
-Come.
-Sit down.

413
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,140
Have a seat.

414
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,180
-Sit down.
-So, do you think...

415
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:14,500
you can find a husband for her?

416
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,580
If you can't,

417
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,900
I'll find the other matchmakers

418
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,180
who are in line to serve us.

419
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,660
Of course.

420
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:20,780
Don't worry.

421
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,660
All those men are lining up

422
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:24,300
to marry your precious Ruhua here.

423
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:25,980
-Stop pushing me!
-Look!

424
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,660
I'll surely find her

425
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,180
the best husband.

426
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,860
That was so satisfying.

427
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,180
So, who did Ruhua choose in the end?

428
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,420
Just tell me who she likes.

429
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:37,660
I'll grant her a marriage.

430
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,620
I don't know about that.

431
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:41,580
Anyway,

432
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,020
she found herself a good husband.

433
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:44,660
Mother,

434
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:45,900
now that Xianpa Village
has changed for the better,

435
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,460
you don't need to fear Liu Xie anymore.

436
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,420
You can stay here without any worries.

437
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,100
I'll see if he dares to bully you again.

438
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:50,860
Precisely.

439
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,420
You may stay here without any worries.

440
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,100
He doesn't dare

441
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,180
to bully you when I'm around.

442
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:55,380
He...

443
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,140
Your father didn't bully me for real.

444
00:19:59,260 --> 00:19:59,660
He just...

445
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:00,260
Mother,

446
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:02,180
why are you still speaking up for him?

447
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:02,980
That's not it.

448
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,900
I'm not speaking up for him.

449
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,180
I'm telling the truth.

450
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:08,900
It's...

451
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:14,180
Fine, I'll tell you guys.

452
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,100
Your father just wanted to do something

453
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,900
I didn't want to do.

454
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:20,540
What did he plan to do?

455
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,620
He wanted to marry me!

456
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:36,620
Fu.

457
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,260
They're beautiful.

458
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:44,420
Where did you get them?

459
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:44,980
Fu.

460
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:45,740
Young Master!

461
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,540
Young Master, a joyous occasion!

462
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,420
We have a joyous occasion!

463
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,900
What do you mean? I haven't finished my words yet.

464
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,020
How did you know it was a joyous occasion?

465
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:52,860
That's not it, Young Master.

466
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:53,820
It's the imperial edict.

467
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,180
What imperial edict?

468
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,420
His Majesty is planning

469
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,060
to appoint you as a generalissimo.

470
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,100
Generalissimo?

471
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:01,980
Fu,

472
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,260
will you marry me?

473
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,540
You'll be the wife of a generalissimo

474
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,140
if you marry me!

475
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:24,500
So, you were the one
who dumped Liu Xie in the first place?

476
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,660
Isn't it obvious?

477
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,420
Of course, my mother was the one
who dumped Liu Xie.

478
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,660
But that isn't the main point.

479
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,300
Precisely.

480
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,180
The main point is,

481
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,100
Mother,

482
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,420
why did you reject him?

483
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:36,980
Yes.

484
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:37,660
Feng,

485
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,580
do you still remember

486
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,660
what your great-grandmother used to say?

487
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,980
I was only one year old when she passed away.

488
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:45,900
How could I remember?

489
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:46,780
You do have a point.

490
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,540
But I remember her words.

491
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,020
Ever since I started to learn,

492
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:51,740
your great-grandmother kept telling me

493
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,180
that men

494
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:55,540
would be led astray

495
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,180
after they obtained wealth and power.

496
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:58,420
That's why

497
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:00,900
we mustn't get married to a wealthy, powerful,

498
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,540
and self-motivated man.

499
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:03,540
Do you understand?

500
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,260
That's why...

501
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:06,180
That's why

502
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:09,420
I beat your father to it

503
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,860
and dumped him

504
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,620
right when he was about to rise through the ranks.

505
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,420
You want to marry me?

506
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:30,780
Just you wish!

507
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,660
Do you think I'll fall for your trick?

508
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,180
What's going on?

509
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:38,140
Why do I feel like sympathizing
with my father right now?

510
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:39,380
Me too.

511
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,780
Actually, my great-grandmother does have a point.

512
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:45,740
What do you mean?

513
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,660
Men will be led astray
after they obtain wealth and power.

514
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,900
Luckily, you were born at the top of the world.

515
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,260
There's no way
you can improve your current status.

516
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:57,580
You're right.

517
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,580
Consort Dowager Xu,

518
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,180
it seems like you came later than expected.

519
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:21,820
Imperial Physician Yu,

520
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:24,340
you were smarter than I imagined.

521
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:26,620
Your Highness.

522
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,140
Drop the formalities.

523
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,700
I have no time to waste on you.

524
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,580
Are we on the same side?

525
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,460
Consort Dowager Xu,
you're straightforward indeed.

526
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,540
All right, I won't beat around the bush then.

527
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,140
Our goal

528
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,820
is to obtain the Qianhuafu Formula.

529
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,820
Whether we're on the same side

530
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:45,220
will depend on your choice, Your Highness.

531
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:47,900
Are you trying to threaten me here?

532
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:51,700
You're actually from the Xiyue Empire.

533
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:53,500
Now that I know the truth,

534
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,460
isn't it a waste

535
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:55,700
not to threaten you?

536
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:59,620
You're pretty cunning, aren't you?

537
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,540
I do hail from the Xiyue Empire.

538
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,380
The Late Emperor knew about it.
The Empress Dowager knew about it.

539
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:07,940
His Majesty also knew about it.

540
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:11,020
It's just that the Late Emperor
wasn't willing to dwell on it.

541
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:13,900
Is that so?

542
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:19,020
Not only do you hail from the Xiyue Empire,

543
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:21,700
but you are also their spy.

544
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,500
You've stolen countless
secrets and intel from Donghao Empire

545
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,260
about its border layouts and marching routes

546
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,220
for over 20 years.

547
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:28,900
Do they know about that?

548
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:30,380
By the way,

549
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:32,660
do they know about the number

550
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:33,700
of Xiyue people in the palace?

551
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:37,220
And,

552
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:40,900
you've tried to test my identity
many times in the Imperial Palace.

553
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,300
You even wanted to kill with a borrowed knife.

554
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,100
You wanted to borrow my power

555
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:47,380
and kidnap the Queen's mother.

556
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,980
After that, you wanted to push the blame on me.

557
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:51,700
Consort Dowager Xu,

558
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,820
are you sure you want
to let them know about all those things?

559
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:55,140
You!

560
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,660
Men will be men.

561
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:03,940
Why must you guys make things difficult
for women like us?

562
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:07,580
Did you think I wanted to be a spy
ever since I was born?

563
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,820
Did you think I have a choice?

564
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:11,700
I didn't!

565
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:12,900
You think...

566
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:15,100
Why are you being so fierce?

567
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:17,620
Do you think you're reasonable
just because you're fierce to me?

568
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,820
Who will uphold justice for me then?

569
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:24,980
Go away!

570
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,060
Stop pretending to be a good guy!

571
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:30,820
You even blamed me for testing your identity!

572
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,900
Did you think I needed to test you

573
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:35,340
if you didn't have
such an identity in the first place?

574
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,700
You men...

575
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:39,780
Will men only be decent beings

576
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,420
when they're crown princes

577
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,860
and emperors?

578
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:46,460
You guys only know how to create trouble.

579
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,260
And you guys even want

580
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:50,460
to implicate us after that!

581
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:51,700
Consort Dowager Xu,

582
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,060
what exactly are you trying to do?

583
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,540
I want to go home.

584
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:58,460
They said they will let me return home

585
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,980
after I find the name list.

586
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:04,940
It's all Consort Li's fault!

587
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:07,140
Why did she hide the name list?

588
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:10,380
I can't find it! It's too difficult!

589
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:16,140
Why don't you locate it for me?

590
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:19,780
That way, everybody will be happy.

591
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:45,380
Scorpion Liu.

592
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,500
What are you doing?

593
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:50,980
It's none of your business.

594
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,180
Cut to the chase.

595
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:53,340
I'm busy tonight.

596
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:57,500
Someone in the palace gave herself away.

597
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,020
It was Consort Dowager Xu.

598
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,820
Seems like that traitor

599
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:05,100
had been looking for the formula too
all these years.

600
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,620
And, he had been sending spies

601
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:08,740
into the palace for over 20 years
just to get his hands on the formula.

602
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,460
He had given much thought to the matter.

603
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:20,460
Did you even

604
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,740
listen to me?

605
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:22,940
I did.

606
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,140
Consort Dowager Xu is a spy

607
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:25,100
and she's looking for the formula too.

608
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,180
Your identity was exposed to her.
You're in danger.

609
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,020
Isn't that what you mean?

610
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:30,420
You're being nonchalant about it

611
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:32,020
even though it's such a huge matter.

612
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,660
Did you know about it all along?

613
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,180
Your Highness,

614
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:38,620
Consort Dowager Xu
was originally from the Xiyue Empire.

615
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:40,100
Everyone knew

616
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,260
that she was a spy ever since she

617
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:41,940
joined the palace.

618
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:42,900
What's so strange about that?

619
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,340
Why are you making a huge deal about it?

620
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:46,580
Although your identity has been exposed,

621
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:47,780
you don't need to worry.

622
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,020
Do you think you'll be able

623
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,220
to sit here and talk to me

624
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,820
if she intends to make things difficult for you?

625
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:54,660
So, you're saying

626
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:55,980
that there's no need
to worry about Consort Dowager Xu?

627
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,220
Let's ignore her for now.

628
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,660
We'll have the initiative

629
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:03,020
as long as Jinfeng finds the formula.

630
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:05,540
Liu Xie,

631
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,380
I don't understand something.

632
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:08,620
Why must you make Jinfeng

633
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:09,980
take such a huge risk?

634
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:12,740
You may think that it's a risk,

635
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:13,740
but to me,

636
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:15,620
Jinfeng will only

637
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,020
form true chemistry

638
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,700
with the young Emperor
after completing the task.

639
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:20,820
Only then, she'll become a true queen.

640
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:29,020
Seems like you don't understand women at all.

641
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,140
What do you mean by that?

642
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:35,580
Consort Li came from the Xiyue Empire too.

643
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:37,340
Why would she leave the name list of the spies

644
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,220
behind

645
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:40,300
and sell her compatriots

646
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,620
and nation out?

647
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:48,980
What do you think about my drawing?

648
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:50,980
Isn't it nice?

649
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:54,900
Who are you drawing?

650
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:56,580
It's Yongfu.

651
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,740
So, it's Madam Yongfu?

652
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:03,860
You don't understand women at all.

653
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,220
This is no fun.

654
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,900
You, you, you,

655
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,060
and you.

656
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,380
The four of you, follow me.

657
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:19,500
-Okay.
-Okay.

658
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:26,660
Bring them in.

659
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:27,540
Okay.

660
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,260
What are these?

661
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:32,900
Your Majesty,

662
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,460
the Grand Chancellor had sent us some gifts.

663
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,180
Liu Xie is sending me gifts?

664
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:37,220
That's literally impossible.

665
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:38,460
Your Majesty, you should be more confident.

666
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:40,020
Remove the word "literally" from your sentence.

667
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,420
That's impossible.

668
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,500
I knew it.

669
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:46,580
All of these are meant for Madam Yongfu.

670
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,260
Seems like Liu Xie is using
his ultimate technique.

671
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:54,540
Mother,

672
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:56,580
Father even bought your favorite
preserved sausages for you.

673
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:59,180
Your Majesty, don't you think
there are too many gifts here?

674
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:00,620
There's even a drawing.

675
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:01,660
Let's take a look.

676
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:06,980
What does he mean by this?

677
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:11,180
Your father is confessing to me.

678
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,500
Let's check out the other drawings.

679
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,140
Okay.

680
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:22,220
This is?

681
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,140
What about this?

682
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:26,620
He's saying that he'll kneel

683
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:27,740
if I don't marry him.

684
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,220
I know what this means.

685
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,220
Father is saying that you have to be his servant

686
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:38,620
if you don't marry him.

687
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:39,380
You have to wash his legs for him.

688
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,500
You've got it all wrong.

689
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:42,540
He's saying
that he'll wash my legs for me every day

690
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,860
if I marry him.

691
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:56,060
I know what this means.

692
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,660
Father is saying

693
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:58,620
that he's decorated your room with fresh flowers

694
00:30:58,620 --> 00:30:59,780
and he's waiting for your return.

695
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:00,980
You're wrong.

696
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:04,220
He's saying that he has harvested
some excellent honey

697
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:06,380
and he's waiting for me to try it.

698
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,180
But where's the honey?

699
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,380
Isn't it obvious?

700
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:14,660
Look.

701
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:18,820
Spring is here.

702
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:20,100
The flowers are blooming.

703
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:22,220
The bees are harvesting honey right now.

704
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,780
Naturally, there would be honey.

705
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:26,500
Mother,

706
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,660
you and Father are so romantic.

707
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:30,900
Romantic?

708
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,860
The Grand Chancellor
is really thoughtful indeed.

709
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:44,580
Look at you.

710
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:45,900
You're not even as romantic as Liu Xie.

711
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,020
What do you mean by that?

712
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,340
Forget it.

713
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:52,340
It's not a huge deal.

714
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,060
Fine.

715
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,060
Just you wait.

716
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,300
I'll show you what it means

717
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,860
to be romantic.

718
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:05,700
Yunzhang!

719
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:06,540
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

720
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:07,500
You summoned us in such a hurry.

721
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,780
Do you have something huge to announce?

722
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:09,340
That's right.

723
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,780
This concerns the fate of the nation.

724
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,060
Is Scorpion Liu going to stage a rebellion?

725
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:15,780
This does concern him.

726
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:16,620
Your Majesty, don't worry.

727
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:17,900
I will surely defend you with my life.

728
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:19,500
Scorpion Liu has to get through me first

729
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,460
if he wants to take over the nation!

730
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:22,940
You don't need to go that far.

731
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:24,100
Keep your sword away.

732
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:26,980
This is the case.

733
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:29,420
Jinfeng's mother has moved into Xiangluo Hall.

734
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,980
Now, Scorpion Liu is sending gifts
to Xiangluo Hall every day

735
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,060
in order to make Madam Yongfu happy.

736
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:36,540
Jinfeng feels that I'm inferior
compared to her father.

737
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:37,820
She said that I wasn't as romantic as her father.

738
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,540
What do you guys think I should do?

739
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,340
This...

740
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:42,500
Your Majesty,

741
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:44,340
was this what you meant

742
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,780
by concerning the nation's fate?

743
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:47,580
Isn't that the truth?

744
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,140
The root of the kingdom is in the state,

745
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,020
the root of the state is in the family.

746
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:53,060
Now, I can't even

747
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:54,140
satisfy my own wife.

748
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:56,580
If so, how can I govern
the nation and rule the world?

749
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:58,980
The root of the state is in the family?

750
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,060
To satisfy his wife first?

751
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,100
His Majesty does have a point.

752
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,060
Of course.

753
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:07,540
Think of something for me.

754
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,460
Romantic?

755
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:15,100
Yes, it must be romantic.

756
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:22,220
[East]

757
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:22,860
Your Highness.

758
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:25,180
Stop right there.

759
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:28,820
What are those?

760
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:29,740
These are monoculars

761
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:31,580
given to us as tributes by our neighboring nation.

762
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:34,300
What's the name again?

763
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:35,700
Monoculars.

764
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,260
Monoculars.

765
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:38,540
What is it used for?

766
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:40,580
You can use it to view distant objects.

767
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:42,780
How far can I see?

768
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,060
You can see the vast universe

769
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,100
and the galaxy with it.

770
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:45,900
This item

771
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,340
is magical.

772
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:49,100
His Majesty praised it highly!

773
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:49,700
His Majesty told us

774
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,540
to install it on the turrets.

775
00:33:58,540 --> 00:33:59,620
Mother, try this.

776
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:01,180
You should have some too.

777
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:01,940
Your Majesty!

778
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,020
-I eat them all the time.
-Your Majesty! Madam!

779
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:04,100
Guess what gifts

780
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:06,020
the Grand Chancellor sent us today?

781
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:07,300
Is Liu Xie that creative?

782
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,460
He sends different gifts every day.

783
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:10,020
I'm out of ideas.

784
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:11,540
Sufang, hurry up.

785
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:12,580
Show them to us.

786
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,020
That's it?

787
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:26,060
Why do I feel like Liu Xie
has stopped being creative?

788
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:27,700
It's so fragrant.

789
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,860
Flowers by the path are now in full bloom,
and I'm expecting you to come back soon.

790
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:32,060
Mother-in-law,

791
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:34,860
seems like the Grand Chancellor
is rushing you to return to him.

792
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:36,620
What does he mean by the soup then?

793
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:42,020
It's a soup made with Silkie chicken.

794
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,980
I think there are some herbs too.

795
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:45,340
Herbs?

796
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:48,580
What herbs were they again?

797
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:51,380
Dong quai.

798
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,660
That's right. Dong quai.

799
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:53,980
Mother-in-law,

800
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:56,300
seems like the Grand Chancellor
is expressing the same thought.

801
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:58,900
Mother,

802
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,660
Liu Xie is so romantic.

803
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:02,460
Xuan,

804
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:04,780
didn't you say you would show me
what it meant to be truly romantic?

805
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:08,620
I'm preparing for it.

806
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:09,580
Really?

807
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,020
A promise is a promise.

808
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,580
It's so dark here.

809
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:24,820
Why did you bring me here instead of sleeping?

810
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:25,540
Don't be impatient.

811
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,580
You'll know it later.

812
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:28,460
Look.

813
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:30,900
Look over there.

814
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:33,300
Yunchong?

815
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:35,460
Shift it closer to me.

816
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,500
Wasn't that my trick?

817
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:40,540
You heard nothing.

818
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,060
I still see nothing.

819
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:43,500
I see nothing with both of my eyes.

820
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:46,100
Legend has it that a rose cloud
exists under the stars.

821
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:48,180
You'll be blessed if you confess

822
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,460
under the rose cloud.

823
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:50,100
Really?

824
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:52,300
But I still see nothing.

825
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:56,020
He's even stealing my dialogue!

826
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:57,460
What?

827
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:58,620
Did someone say something?

828
00:35:58,620 --> 00:35:59,860
No shouting is allowed in the Imperial Palace!

829
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:01,700
Move to the right.

830
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:04,700
I still see nothing.

831
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:05,260
Move to the right.

832
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:06,220
To the right.

833
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,180
