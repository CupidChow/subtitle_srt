00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:03,550
by your heirloom seal, Your Majesty.

169
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:07,350
However, if you seal it

170
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:09,590
with your heirloom seal now, Your Majesty,

171
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,230
then it'll be a genuine one.

172
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,520
The Ling family has been
very loyal to the nation.

173
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:24,400
What crime did Elder General commit?

174
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,760
Why did you arrest him
in the middle of the night?

175
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,470
Your Majesty.

176
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,960
This is exactly
what I'm going to report to you now.

177
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,520
Come forward.

178
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,480
[Yours sincerely, General Ling]

179
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,340
Leave now.

180
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,540
I have something to tell Imperial Physician Yu.

181
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:08,700
I haven't found anything yet.

182
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,260
Then, what are you talking about?

183
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:11,540
It's not easy

184
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:12,540
to investigate the Xuanchen Hall.

185
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,100
(It's not right to send him
to the Xuanchen Hall, right?)

186
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:17,020
Is the investigation really necessary?

187
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,420
It's just a formula.

188
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,980
It shouldn't be an issue
even if my father can't get it, right?

189
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,260
Although we made an agreement,

190
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,580
he always breaks his promise.

191
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,420
I shouldn't take this too seriously, should I?

192
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:26,700
You can't do that.

193
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,580
You have to get that.

194
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,020
Why are you being so serious?

195
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:34,340
No.

196
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,340
I mean...

197
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:38,060
We have to get the formula.

198
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,180
Otherwise...

199
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,060
Let me be honest with you.

200
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,340
Liu Xie is not as easy as you think.

201
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,340
What is that supposed to mean?

202
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,140
Ten years ago,

203
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:07,780
Elder General Ling was still
Chief Minister of Court of Judicial Review.

204
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,740
That winter, the son of Lord Lu

205
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,900
allegedly killed three innocent people

206
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,940
at the market in the capital.

207
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,940
There were witnesses and evidence.

208
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,420
A few days before the trial,

209
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,420
Lord Lu ordered someone

210
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,740
to send ten thousand gold taels
to Ling's Residence in secret.

211
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,980
It was used to bribe Elder General Ling.

212
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:29,500
What do you think happened later?

213
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:33,060
All the evidence was gone the next day.

214
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,940
The witnesses went missing as well.

215
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,700
The son of Lord Lu

216
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:39,380
was acquitted on all counts.

217
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:43,860
Five years ago,

218
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,220
when Elder General Ling was appointed
as Senior General of the Southern Expedition,

219
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:50,580
he brought a huge troop to the southern border
to back up those who were fighting the enemy.

220
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,180
However, he didn't carry out his duty
at the southern border.

221
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,540
He was corresponding
with the enemy using letters

222
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,700
and was providing them
with our military defense map.

223
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,820
He profiteered from that.

224
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:02,340
What he did put Donghao Empire
at an absolute disadvantage

225
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:03,540
and the country was placed in a dire situation.

226
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:16,700
This was gifted by the Late Emperor
to the Ling family.

227
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,340
The Late Emperor said

228
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:21,140
that this is a sword
that can kill the fatuous emperor,

229
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,220
and punish the traitors.

230
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,020
No one foresaw

231
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:27,700
that when the Late Emperor was critically sick,

232
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,580
Elder General Ling sneaked into his bedchamber
with the sword,

233
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,340
intending to kill the Late Emperor
and usurp the throne.

234
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:32,980
How brazen.

235
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:38,420
Shut up!

236
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,500
The three incidents you mentioned.

237
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,780
Were they all Elder General Ling's doings?

238
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:52,420
Tell me!

239
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:53,780
Your Majesty.

240
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,780
Among the three incidents I mentioned,

241
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:03,140
which is the most detestable,

242
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,260
the most abominable,

243
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:05,860
and the most realistic?

244
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:08,620
What do you mean?

245
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,940
Which one of them

246
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,580
sounds realistic to Your Majesty?

247
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,900
Then, write it in the decree.

248
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,220
[Imperial Decree]

249
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,940
Then, we will have a proper reason

250
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,020
to arrest Elder General Ling.

251
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:30,180
Are you asking me to collude with you
to slander the Elder General?

252
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,060
Is this a slander?

253
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:35,260
That depends on how we look at the matter too.

254
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,340
The truth can be a lie,
but the lie can also be the truth.

255
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,060
Your Majesty doesn't have
to take this so seriously.

256
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:41,460
Liu Xie.

257
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,700
What actually are you?

258
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,380
In fact, you don't know your father at all.

259
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,820
Everything your father does

260
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:57,940
has a reason.

261
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,460
There's a reason
why he sent you into the palace.

262
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,420
There's a reason
why he made you stay in the palace.

263
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,900
There's also a reason why he wants you

264
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,020
to win the Emperor's favor.

265
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:09,980
I'm trying to tell you

266
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:12,100
to leave this place as soon as possible

267
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,220
before he achieves what he wants by using you.

268
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:16,060
Otherwise, judging from how cruel he is,

269
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,540
I'm sure he will eliminate you.

270
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,220
Don't you get it yet?

271
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,020
Every danger you and His Majesty faced

272
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,300
stems from his doings.

273
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:31,940
Alright. Tell me.

274
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:32,820
What's on your mind?

275
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,580
I'm thinking about the "but".

276
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:36,420
What?

277
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,340
Usually, after you're done speaking ill
of someone,

278
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,740
you'll continue it with a "but".

279
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,700
Take this for an example.

280
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:44,180
"Your father made you go through
all the difficulties,

281
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:46,180
but he loves you a lot."

282
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,580
But there's no "but".

283
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,380
How is that possible?

284
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,500
Fine. If you want a "but",

285
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,460
I'll give you a "but".

286
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,460
A vicious tiger will not eat its cubs,

287
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,420
but your father

288
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,660
is not a tiger at all.

289
00:15:58,660 --> 00:15:59,420
He is a scorpion.

290
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,180
The most vicious scorpion you'll ever see.

291
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:16,900
I'll never let you

292
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:19,020
marry the useless Prince Yunchong.

293
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:21,660
I think

294
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,260
it must be the woman from the backyard.

295
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,700
She must have influenced Liu Xie

296
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,220
and ruined

297
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,500
our lives.

298
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:30,180
How can Liu Xie

299
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,460
get bewitched by the woman?

300
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,060
He's always trying to please her.

301
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:35,620
No.

302
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:37,980
We can't just sit and await our fate.

303
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:41,980
Baiyu.

304
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:45,060
Did you hear what I'm saying?

305
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,340
I heard it.

306
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,220
Second Madam.

307
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:54,620
Really?

308
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:58,940
Baiyu.

309
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,140
Here comes the solution.

310
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:02,340
Now, it's only about
whether you want to do it with me.

311
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,340
How did the investigation

312
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:09,420
I ordered go?

313
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:10,220
Yunzhang, let me go first.

314
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,540
I found out

315
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:13,580
Elder General Ling has five wives.

316
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,820
According to a reliable source,

317
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,940
he will get a new wife

318
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,060
whenever he is about to attend a major event.

319
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:20,460
I'm so envious of him.

320
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:20,980
Wait.

321
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,300
Where did you get the news from?

322
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:22,980
Your Majesty.

323
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:23,980
From what I know,

324
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:26,740
Elder General Ling has three wives.

325
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:27,620
Your Majesty.

326
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:28,980
They made a mistake.

327
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:31,500
I learned from my informant in the market

328
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,060
that Elder General Ling only has a wife.

329
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,100
It's just that his wife always
wears different make-up.

330
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,580
That's what brought about all the rumors.

331
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:41,780
Wait a minute.

332
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,140
I have a question.

333
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,020
I told you to investigate Elder General Ling.

334
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,100
Why do you keep talking about his wives?

335
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,140
Because they are beautiful.

336
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:51,900
You haven't heard about this, Yunzhang.

337
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,420
All wives of Elder General Ling

338
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,380
are so gorgeous.

339
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,580
They can charm the birds off trees.

340
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,780
Their comeliness is unparalleled.

341
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,580
They are absolutely easy on the eye.

342
00:17:58,740 --> 00:17:59,300
I...

343
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,260
Yunzhang, we did try to investigate him.

344
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,580
However, Senior General Ling...

345
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,700
Did nothing wrong?

346
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:04,740
There are too many issues with him

347
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:05,860
to the extent that we got dazzled.

348
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,420
According to my informant,

349
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,860
Elder General Ling always bullies people.

350
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:10,820
He's greedy, perverted,

351
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:11,780
and arrogant.

352
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:14,780
There are too many skeletons in his closet.

353
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:16,780
Even the elder female vegetable vendor
knows about this.

354
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,940
The old man Ling

355
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,660
has committed a great number of sins.

356
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:23,060
Are all the stories true?

357
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:23,940
Of course, they are.

358
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,180
We heard it ourselves.

359
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:25,740
Yes.

360
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,820
Why didn't Liu Xie tell me directly?

361
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,780
Why did he have to beat around the bush?

362
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:32,620
Yunzhang.

363
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,260
Don't you get it yet?

364
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,620
Isn't it obvious?

365
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:36,940
What?

366
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,260
Liu Xie always likes to put up an act.

367
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,420
The lesser you know, the happier he is.

368
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:43,860
Your Majesty.

369
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:47,100
What should we do
with Elder General Ling's case?

370
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,860
Send all the evidence you obtained
to Ministry of Justice.

371
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:51,900
The Court of Judicial Review and the Ministry
of Justice should hold a joint trial.

372
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,820
We're all equal before the law.

373
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,940
If all the allegations are true,

374
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,060
I'll definitely make him pay for it.

375
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:04,660
What's on your mind?

376
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,180
It's nothing.

377
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,020
Why are you here?

378
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:08,940
I was looking for you.

379
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:09,820
Why?

380
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:10,900
Come with me.

381
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,100
Hurry up.

382
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,180
Hurry up.

383
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:25,340
I want to show you something.

384
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,300
What are you trying to show me?

385
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:29,860
Look.

386
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,020
Look at this.

387
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,900
This three-day-old foal is really cute.

388
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:39,660
It's really quite cute.

389
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:40,940
It's yours if you like it.

390
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,180
I'll hire a professional horseman for you.

391
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,900
He'll stay in the Xiangluo Hall
and take care of the horse.

392
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,780
I don't really need to keep it.

393
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,340
Then, what do you want?

394
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,180
I only want to tell you three stories.

395
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:54,420
Sure.

396
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:56,780
The first story.

397
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:57,820
Once upon a time,

398
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,860
a guy told you that he loved the horse a lot.

399
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,540
But in fact, he didn't genuinely like the horse.

400
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,860
He only wanted

401
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,620
the jeweled saddle.

402
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:07,660
Is that all?

403
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,300
No.

404
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,100
There's the second story.

405
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,300
The second story.

406
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,380
There was a man

407
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,620
who was forced to come to the stable.

408
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,820
Then, he fell for the horse.

409
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:16,660
However, he thought

410
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,100
the jeweled saddle

411
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:18,860
was more valuable than the horse itself,

412
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,620
so he decided to keep the saddle.

413
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:22,940
Then, there was the third man.

414
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,500
The guy hated horses.

415
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,540
He was forced to come to the stable.

416
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,100
However, the horses liked him a lot.

417
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:32,420
And he fell for the horse as well.

418
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,740
Unfortunately, he was deceived by the bad guy.

419
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:34,660
He stole

420
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,580
the jeweled saddle

421
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,660
and sold it to the bad guy,

422
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,820
but he never intended to hurt the horse.

423
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,060
Therefore, he made a new saddle

424
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:42,300
for the horse.

425
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:45,180
Is that all?

426
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,500
Which one of these three people

427
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,660
do you think

428
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:49,820
is the most detestable and abominable?

429
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,940
(Among the three incidents I mentioned,)

430
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:56,940
(which one is the most detestable,)

431
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:57,940
(most abominable?)

432
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,660
Are you going

433
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:00,780
to make me pick

434
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,380
my favorite story

435
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,500
among these three?

436
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:04,860
Yes.

437
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,620
You sound exactly like your father.

438
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:08,940
What?

439
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:10,660
Your Majesty.

440
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,060
I can tell you why.

441
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:14,180
Because she is Liu Xie's daughter.

442
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,060
Your Majesty.

443
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:20,140
Why are you here, Second Madam Liu?

444
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:23,780
I've heard some rumors on the streets recently.

445
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,860
I'm always a straightforward person,

446
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:28,260
so I always need to say what I hear.

447
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:29,820
Your Majesty, please don't get upset

448
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:32,020
if I accidentally say anything I shouldn't.

449
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:33,820
It's up to you what you want to say,

450
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,420
but it's up to me whether I will get upset.

451
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,380
People out there are saying

452
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,020
that Her Majesty's mother,

453
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:42,380
also the Madam

454
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,900
who's living in our residence right now,

455
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,740
is a witch.

456
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,540
How dare you say things like that
about my mother?

457
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:51,340
Do you really believe what she said?

458
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:52,260
Let her talk.

459
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,740
She used her witchcraft

460
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,660
to enchant Liu Xie.

461
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,580
Liu Xie

462
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,580
fell head over heels for her.

463
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,020
That's not the worst part.

464
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,340
The worst part is

465
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,420
that she passed down her witchcraft
to her daughter.

466
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,020
Rubbish.

467
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:08,820
My mother has only a daughter.

468
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:09,820
Who did she pass it down to?

469
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:10,940
Your Majesty.

470
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,620
She was talking about you.

471
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:13,500
Me?

472
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,780
I've never learned any witchcraft.

473
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,660
This is what the people said.

474
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:18,660
The people said

475
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:21,620
that the Queen is not a pretty woman,

476
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,100
but she used her witchcraft

477
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,580
to enchant Your Majesty.

478
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:26,060
Not only that,

479
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:28,660
she performed witchcraft
in every corner of the Imperial Harem.

480
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,100
That's why all the men in the Imperial Harem

481
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,340
are always following her around.

482
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:34,900
Especially... Especially the imperial physician.

483
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,340
-Mother...
-Let me finish this.

484
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:42,020
Her Majesty also performed witchcraft

485
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,740
to bewitch Liu Xie.

486
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,260
Initially, Liu Xie was planning

487
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:47,180
to send Baiyu into the palace.

488
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,900
She used her witchcraft

489
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,420
and changed his mind.

490
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:52,340
That jeopardized Baiyu's future.

491
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,900
That makes no sense.

492
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,420
I never asked them to follow me around.

493
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,140
They do that out of their own free will.

494
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:57,740
I want to know

495
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:58,940
what I did wrong to treat me like that.

496
00:22:59,180 --> 00:22:59,900
Look.

497
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,820
You admit it yourself.

498
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:03,620
Your Majesty.

499
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,940
You have to uphold justice for Baiyu.

500
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:09,460
Are you done yet, Madam?

501
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,500
Almost.

502
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,260
I won't bring up the rest.

503
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:14,380
Sure.

504
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:15,620
You.

505
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:16,500
Yes, Your Majesty.

506
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,220
Slap her.

507
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,860
Do you really believe what she said?

508
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,660
Slap her.

509
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:22,740
No...

510
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,540
Your Majesty,
I swear I haven't done any of that.

511
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,460
What are you waiting for?

512
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:36,900
I want you to slap that vixen.

513
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,340
You should have watched your mouth.

514
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:42,540
How dare you badmouth Her Majesty?

515
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:43,460
Mother.

516
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:44,780
Your Majesty.

517
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,660
My mother said the wrong thing

518
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:48,220
and offended Your Majesties.

519
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,180
We beg for your forgiveness.

520
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:50,460
However,

521
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:52,940
some of the things she said are true.

522
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:54,980
Which?

523
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,380
Her Majesty's mother

524
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:57,980
is indeed Liu Xie's wife.

525
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,020
Her Majesty

526
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,620
is indeed Liu Xie's daughter.

527
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,820
Didn't Your Majesty say

528
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,500
that you will never fall for Liu Xie's daughter?

529
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,220
But she's Liu Xie's daughter.

530
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,020
Your Majesty.

531
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,340
Do you really trust her?

532
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,740
Do you really know her?

533
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,100
That's none of your business.

534
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,140
Let's go.

535
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,340
Yunzhang. Sister-in-law.

536
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:26,780
Mother.

537
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:28,780
Let's go.

538
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:29,460
Liu Baiyu.

539
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:32,900
I know what you're going to say.

540
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:35,020
I brought this upon myself

541
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,700
and I deserve this, right?

542
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,380
You called me presumptuous.

543
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,980
I think you're the presumptuous one.

544
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:43,740
That's not what I was going to say.

545
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,460
I have a question for you.

546
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:46,980
Everything you and your mother do

547
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:48,340
is to make yourselves look good.

548
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,580
Do you want to be the Queen

549
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:51,540
because you like Yunzhang?

550
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,260
Or do you want to be the Queen
so that you can look good?

551
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:56,700
I...

552
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,500
In fact,

553
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,780
you don't like Yunzhang that much, do you?

554
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,380
And I'm not that much inferior
to Yunzhang either.

555
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,020
Right?

556
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:04,220
You...

557
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:16,820
Imperial Physician Yu.

558
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,420
What is so special

559
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:19,660
about this green mask?

560
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,660
The green mask is made of seaweeds.

561
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:23,780
Wearing it

562
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:25,700
can extract all the dirty substances
from your face.

563
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:26,700
Your skin

564
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,340
will be as smooth and fair as Miss Baiyu's.

565
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,820
Don't smile.

566
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:33,620
Don't.

567
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:34,700
Smiling

568
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,100
will create more wrinkles on your face.

569
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:38,140
Then, you'll look just like Consort Dowager Xu.

570
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:47,420
Ladies.

571
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,140
Which hall are you from?

572
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,660
Why haven't I seen you before?

573
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,020
I'm from the Qianluo Hall.

574
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:53,340
I'm from the Imperial Household Department.

575
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:54,500
Me too.

576
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:55,780
I'm from the Imperial Kitchen.

577
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,260
I'm from the Xuanchen Hall.

578
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:03,420
You work for His Majesty.

579
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:06,700
Working for His Majesty
doesn't make me any special.

580
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,140
The only difference

581
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:09,980
is that I know His Majesty slightly better
than the rest of you.

582
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:10,980
You're right.

583
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:13,860
In my opinion,

584
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,540
among all the places in the palace,

585
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:18,260
Xuanchen Hall is the best.

586
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,940
It's a big and comfortable place
to live in, isn't it?

587
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:25,340
I heard there is a little secret
about Xuanchen Hall.

588
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:26,820
I wonder if you've heard of it before.

589
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,300
What secret is it?

590
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:31,540
It's said that
when they were building Xuanchen Hall,

591
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:32,620
it was quite mysterious.

592
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,180
There was...

593
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:36,940
Something.

594
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:38,500
A ghost?

595
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:39,820
No.

596
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:41,980
Treasure?

597
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:43,340
Not that either.

598
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:45,220
Then, what is it?

599
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:47,980
I thought you knew the place better than us.

600
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,860
It seems like you know nothing either.

601
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,100
There's a secret room.

602
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:58,620
That's all?

603
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,420
Is that the secret you're talking about?

604
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:01,780
You...

605
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:05,740
You know about that?

606
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:06,860
Of course.

607
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,100
I know about that too.

608
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,340
We all know about that.

609
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,380
All of you?

610
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,140
Imperial Physician Yu.

611
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,460
That is barely news.

612
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:15,780
What a lousy secret.

613
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,260
Everyone in the imperial capital knows

614
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:19,260
that there's a secret room in the Xuanchen Hall.

615
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:23,180
Everyone?

616
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,020
Look at this.

617
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,340
Steamed corn-bread.

618
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:37,780
How is it?

619
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:38,980
Do you like it?

620
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,100
It tastes great.

621
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:40,740
Really?

622
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,540
Then, I'll make more for you tomorrow.

623
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:44,340
Sure.

624
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,900
I made it for Huang Erniu, our neighbor.

625
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:50,060
He said it tasted like cow dung.

626
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,780
Do you think it tastes like cow dung?

627
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:52,980
Of course not.

628
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,260
Who is Huang Erniu?

629
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,380
I said it just now.

630
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,020
He's our neighbor.

631
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,020
Scorpion Liu.

632
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,540
I'm missing Jinfeng.

633
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,860
It's Jinfeng's birthday next month.

634
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,700
Let's celebrate her birthday together.

635
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:17,540
Celebrate?

636
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,460
Is Jinfeng's birthday in July?

637
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,700
Do you not know

638
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:25,860
when Jinfeng's birthday is?

639
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,220
I know.

640
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,860
I do know.

641
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:32,100
Let's celebrate her birthday together.

642
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:33,900
Sure.

643
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,340
I knew you would agree.

644
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:37,260
Of course, I would.

645
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:39,860
Others

646
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,860
might not know what you're like,

647
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,380
but I know you very well.

648
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:44,060
Why?

649
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:46,460
Jinfeng is a nostalgic person.

650
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,180
She has a conscience,

651
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,180
just like you.

652
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,420
You're the only person in this world

653
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,780
who thinks I have a conscience.

654
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,460
Why?

655
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:14,220
Because you gave me my conscience.

656
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:15,620
Me?

657
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:20,220
Sir.

658
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:23,940
I've got to go.

659
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:26,220
This is delicious.

660
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:27,780
Make it again tomorrow.

661
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:30,420
Coming.

662
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:38,380
I gave him his conscience?

663
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:44,500
What's wrong?

664
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:46,780
We've got news from Yu Changya.

665
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,300
He said that he hasn't found the formula yet.

666
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:52,300
What do you think?

667
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:53,460

It's been quite a while.

Supposedly, we should've heard from him by now.

Unless the formula is not hidden in the palace.

There are two horses in the market.

673
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:06,940
A white one

and a brown one.

675
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,860
However, according to the horse breeder,

676
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:11,380
both horses are white.

Why?

678
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,460
The horse breeder lied.

679
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,740
Sometimes, the more obvious it is,

680
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:23,740
the easier we overlook it.

681

Are you saying that Yu Changya is lying?

682

Does it taste good?

Sometimes, you cannot judge a book by its cover.

I choose the third story.

705

The first guy is a liar.

706
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:42,140
The second guy is too greedy.

707
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,420
Then, I'm only left with the third one.

708
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,700
He's the only normal guy among the three.

709
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:49,660
At least, he's kind and genuine, isn't he?

He's kind and genuine.

Second Madam Liu

717

what Baiyu said.

What did she say?

725

She said I didn't know you well enough.
