00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,040
Get up now!

171
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:56,920
Where's Jinfeng?

172
00:06:58,519 --> 00:06:59,519
Duan Yunzhang.

173
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,880
-Let me go.
-You first.

174
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,720
-Let me go now.
-Go away!

175
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,920
-Let go now!
-You first.

176
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,600
It hurts.

177
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,399
Don't touch me.

178
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,119
No way.

179
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,239
Isn't that Yunzhang?

180
00:07:08,559 --> 00:07:09,600
Your Majesty.

181
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:10,399
Why...

182
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,600
Help!

183
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:13,839
I'm coming, Your Majesty.

184
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:14,679
I dare you to take another step forward.

185
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,959
Take another step forward
and you'll end up just like Shuan.

186
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,239
I can't do this any longer.

187
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:25,279
-How useless. Let me do it.
-Help His Majesty.

188
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:28,239
You should do it.

189
00:07:28,799 --> 00:07:29,799
What a useless bunch.

190
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,640
Yunzhang, I'm coming.

191
00:07:33,679 --> 00:07:34,279
Yunzhang...

192
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,839
I... I can't hold it any longer.

193
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,079
You need to help yourself.

194
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,200
How useless...

195
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,480
They really are your good friends, huh?

196
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,600
What about this?

197
00:07:42,119 --> 00:07:43,040
Let's each take a step back.

198
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,040
Or we'll both end up bald.

199
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:45,440
You'll get bald first.

200
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:46,480
Sure.

201
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,160
I'll count to three.

202
00:07:48,359 --> 00:07:49,200
No, I'll count first.

203
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,160
You do it, then.

204
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,640
Three. Two. One.

205
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You're so cunning!

206
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,920
You're so scheming.

207
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,200
You're despicable.

208
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:58,880
Look who's talking.

209
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,239
Did you learn this from your mother?

210
00:08:00,239 --> 00:08:01,679
I learned it from your mother.

211
00:08:01,679 --> 00:08:03,160
You're just as terrible as your father.

212
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,679
It's easy for one

213
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,160
to get addicted to skincare.

214
00:08:08,559 --> 00:08:09,679
It feels weird

215
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:12,000
not using the facial mask for a day.

216
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,880
I know.

217
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,880
Those are really good stuff
from Imperial Physician Shen.

218
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,079
I immediately recommended it to Your Majesty

219
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,440
once I realized how effective this is.

220
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,359
That's right.

221
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:21,720
You're just as mean as your father.

222
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,600
I dare you to say that again.

223
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:23,480
Your father is mean, and you're meaner.

224
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,480
Both your father and you are mean.

225
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,399
How dare you! I won't allow you
to badmouth my father like that.

226
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:26,040
I said...

227
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,399
Jinfeng, Yunzhang.

228
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,720
What are you doing?

229
00:08:29,359 --> 00:08:30,320
You're embarrassing yourselves.

230
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,679
Let go of each other now.

231
00:08:32,359 --> 00:08:33,160
Let go.

232
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,440
Jinfeng.

233
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:41,839
Do you mind explaining to me

234
00:08:42,119 --> 00:08:43,320
what exactly happened?

235
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,440
If you can't explain yourself,

236
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,959
I'll punish you for harming the Emperor.

237
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,239
Let Duan...

238
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,280
I think His Majesty owes me an explanation too.

239
00:08:55,599 --> 00:08:57,479
Why was I drugged and brought to Lingshu Academy?

240
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:59,159
Why was Shen Ao trying to give me plastic surgery?

241
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,400
Really?

242
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,719
That's absurd.

243
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,119
Ridiculous!

244
00:09:06,119 --> 00:09:06,799
Shen Ao.

245
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,719
How dare you!

246
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,239
Your Majesty.

247
00:09:10,719 --> 00:09:11,880
It was my own idea.

248
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,960
I wanted to make Her Majesty prettier.

249
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,479
Really?

250
00:09:15,719 --> 00:09:17,200
You're just the head of Lingshu Academy.

251
00:09:17,359 --> 00:09:18,520
How dare you do that?

252
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,320
Shen Ao.

253
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,359
That wasn't what you said just now.

254
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,239
You said this was His Majesty's order.

255
00:09:23,599 --> 00:09:24,280
That's right.

256
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,239
It was my order.

257
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:28,440
Since you refuse to leave the palace

258
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,799
and I'm going to keep seeing you in the future,

259
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:33,239
naturally, I'd like to see you
with a prettier face.

260
00:09:35,119 --> 00:09:36,119
Your Majesty

261
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,840
has gone quite far.

262
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,239
But...

263
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:43,599
I understand where you're coming from.

264
00:09:44,119 --> 00:09:44,960
That's mean.

265
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,760
You're too mean.

266
00:09:48,359 --> 00:09:49,440
I thought

267
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,080
we could each mind our own businesses.

268
00:09:51,599 --> 00:09:52,640
Now, it seems like

269
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,039
not only do I hate you,

270
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:55,799
but you also loathe me.

271
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,880
We should probably just go separate ways.

272
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,679
Jinfeng.

273
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:02,159
Don't get mad.

274
00:10:02,599 --> 00:10:03,280
Look.

275
00:10:03,599 --> 00:10:05,840
Zhang is feeling guilty about what he did.

276
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,960
What about this? Leave this matter to me.

277
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,760
Both of you

278
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,719
have had enough of fighting.

279
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:13,880
I'll take revenge on your behalf.

280
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:17,440
I'll remove Shen Ao from his position
as the head of Lingshu Academy.

281
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,320
What about that?

282
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:19,320
There's no need for that.

283
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,400
Duan Yunzhang, I'm telling you.

284
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,159
If someone doesn't like me,

285
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:24,880
be he a deity or an emperor,

286
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,479
I won't beg for his attention.

287
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,880
You don't have to put in so much effort,

288
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,599
ordering your stupid officials
to chase me out of the palace.

289
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,719
I'll go back and pack things up now.

290
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,919
It's not somewhere I want to stay either.

291
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:37,320
Zhang.

292
00:10:37,359 --> 00:10:38,400
Say something.

293
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,760
Go after her.

294
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:45,825
[Divorce Agreement]

295
00:10:49,479 --> 00:10:50,159
Your Majesty.

296
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,520
Are you really leaving?

297
00:10:54,119 --> 00:10:54,559
Yes.

298
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:55,479
I must leave.

299
00:10:55,479 --> 00:10:56,359
It's just a palace.

300
00:10:56,359 --> 00:10:57,440
Who cares about staying here?

301
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,719
My beloved consort, help me draft the agreement.

302
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,320
I must divorce the Emperor today.

303
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,960
I'm going back to Xianpa Village
to live a happy and carefree life.

304
00:11:03,479 --> 00:11:05,440
It still feels wrong to me.

305
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,359
There has never been a divorce
between the Emperor and the Queen.

306
00:11:07,479 --> 00:11:09,080
Besides, Father keeps you in the palace,

307
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,000
so I'm sure he expects you to do our family proud.

308
00:11:11,599 --> 00:11:12,599
Father doesn't care about my well-being,

309
00:11:12,599 --> 00:11:13,640
so why should I care about anything else?

310
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,640
You can be the Queen.

311
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,599
You can make our family proud.

312
00:11:17,239 --> 00:11:19,080
Are you kidding me?

313
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,000
Not everyone can be the Queen.

314
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,400
It's not completely impossible.

315
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,239
You're Liu Xie's daughter too.

316
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,479
If you become the Queen,

317
00:11:30,479 --> 00:11:32,320
Liu Xie will be pleased as well.

318
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,599
It's getting more and more absurd.

319
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:36,919
Forget it.

320
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:37,599
Baiyu.

321
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,719
This is a serious question.

322
00:11:38,719 --> 00:11:40,320
Do you know where Liu Xie is keeping my mother?

323
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,159
I need to save her.

324
00:11:44,719 --> 00:11:45,440
I have no idea.

325
00:11:45,599 --> 00:11:46,599
I should've guessed.

326
00:11:46,599 --> 00:11:47,840
I will ask Liu Xie myself.

327
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,440
Your Majesty.

328
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,479
This is bad.

329
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,400
Your Big Baby is missing.

330
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:54,039
Big Baby?

331
00:11:54,479 --> 00:11:56,039
It's a giant spider.

332
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,320
A giant spider?

333
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:57,919
Miss.

334
00:11:58,719 --> 00:11:59,159
It's fine.

335
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:00,320
My beloved consort, it doesn't bite.

336

I think it's Big Baby.

00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,760
I'll get someone to bury it.

Take it once a day.

342

One drop at a time.

343
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:30,599
Overdosing on this will affect your health.

344
00:12:30,599 --> 00:12:32,760
Whoever finishes the entire bottle in one go

345
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,039
will lose his or her life.

346
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:37,679
Are you sure it's fine to take a drop of this?

347
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:38,799
It's absolutely fine.

348
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:39,840
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

His Majesty is not around.

When will His Majesty be back?

I have no idea.

366

I'll wait for him inside.

Are you feeling better now?

370
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:24,559
Thanks for Your Majesty's concern.

371

We have gotten much better

372
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:26,880
after taking the medicine we got from Shen Ao.

373
00:13:27,359 --> 00:13:28,919
I heard that Her Majesty

374
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:30,039
is leaving the palace tonight.

375
00:13:30,119 --> 00:13:31,200
I was so excited when I heard that.

376
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,280
Why are you excited
about the Queen leaving the palace?

377
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,799
I'm happy for Your Majesty.

How nice is that.

381
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:40,799
Not to mention,

382
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,239
I was the one who came up with the idea

383
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,359
about how to make Her Majesty
leave the palace willingly.

384
00:13:48,479 --> 00:13:50,000
You were the one
who suggested doing plastic surgery?

385
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,159
When I went to Xianpa Village,

386
00:13:52,239 --> 00:13:53,119
I was told

387
00:13:53,119 --> 00:13:55,080
that Her Majesty hated plastic surgery the most.

388
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,039
I simply made use of the information I got.

389
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,320
I told you to find a way
to make her leave the palace,

390
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,440
but I didn't tell you to bring up plastic surgery.

391
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
You look like you need plastic surgery too.

392
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,080
Why don't I do something to your face?

393
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:06,000
Please, don't.

394
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,919
I don't need any plastic surgery.

395
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:07,719
I beg for your forgiveness, Your Majesty.

396
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:09,799
Leave.

397
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,159
Yes.

398
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:16,919
How reckless.

399
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,400
It's getting late.

400
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,760
Why is he not back yet?

401
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,200
I'm in a hurry to leave.

402
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,479
Your Majesty.

403
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,280
Are you really leaving?

404
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,280
Of course!

405
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,080
He hates me so much

406
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,359
that he wanted to give me plastic surgery.

407
00:14:29,359 --> 00:14:30,400
Why should I stay here any longer?

408
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,880
Forget it. I'm leaving.

409
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,919
I'm going to leave him a note
and that's the best I can do.

To be honest with you,

422
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:36,440
it was His Majesty who sent you back.

423
00:15:36,719 --> 00:15:37,440
His Majesty?

424
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:39,960
No way.

425
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,119
How could it be him?

426
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,640
I've always wanted
to tell Your Majesty about this,

427
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:45,200
but Your Majesty said

428
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,640
that you wanted to turn over a new leaf,

429
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,159
and no longer wanted to have anything to do
with His Majesty.

430
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:49,880
So I...

431
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:52,080
What a weird guy.

432
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:52,679
He said one thing

433
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:53,799
but did another.

434
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:55,440
I'm so confused right now.

435
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,840
What does he actually want?

436
00:15:57,119 --> 00:15:58,359
I think

437
00:15:58,479 --> 00:16:01,039
His Majesty can be haughty sometimes,

438
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,119
but he's also soft-hearted.

439
00:16:02,119 --> 00:16:03,080
He's not a bad person.

440
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,280
Your Majesty.

441
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,679
Why don't you stay here for now?

442

I don't care if he's a good guy or a bad guy.

443
00:16:09,119 --> 00:16:10,000
I'm leaving regardless.

444

It's so quiet.

So calm.

I've always known that the imperial capital

is the most boring place in the world.

How did Liu Jinfeng manage to influence me?

There's an assassin.

Ask someone to catch him now.

469
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,060
He's a man in black.

470
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,420
I've been patrolling this area,

471
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,500
but I haven't seen any man in black.

472
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,500
There was definitely a man in black.

473
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,460
I came after him all the way here.

474
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,460
You have to search every corner.

475
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,380
Every single corner.

476
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:14,300
Your Majesty.

477
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,140
You said that you were leaving this afternoon.

478
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,460
And now you're talking about a man in black.

479
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:20,780
Are you trying

480
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,580
to make up an excuse so you can stay here longer?

481
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:23,340
You played a prank on me,

482
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,700
and I'm kind enough

483
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,060
to let the matter go.

484
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,660
How dare you question me now?

485
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,300
Fine.

486
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,700
This is none of my business.

487
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:30,940
If you don't want to search the place,
then it's up to you.

488
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:31,780
Your Majesty.

489
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,700
The four of you, find the man in black now.

490
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:36,260
Yes.

491

The rest of you, come with me.

Both of you

493

will bring some men to the Qingchi Palace
to protect His Majesty.

494
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:41,900
Yes.

495
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:42,980
His Majesty is at the Qingchi Palace?

496
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,540
He's at the Qingchi Palace.

497
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,780
I've been waiting for him the entire evening.

498
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:48,620
You...

499
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,060
[Qingchi Palace]
I have something to tell His Majesty.

500
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:51,540
His Majesty said

501
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,380
that he wouldn't meet anyone now.

502
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,460
It's going to be a short one.

503
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,940
I told you His Majesty isn't seeing anyone now.

504
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:55,780
Brat.

505
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:57,140
Haven't you heard of this old saying?

506
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:58,220
An old saying?

507
00:18:58,860 --> 00:18:59,540
No, I haven't.

508
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:01,380
Stay out of the couple's business.

509
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:02,620
Move.

510
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,060
Duan Yunzhang.

511
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:11,300
Duan Yunzhang.

512
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,020
Duan Yun...

513
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,380
Isn't he here?

514
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,020
What's with that smell?

515
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,220
Duan Yunzhang, come out now.

516
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,020
I have something to tell you.

517
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:20,820
I'll leave right after that.

518
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:39,740
Duan Yunzhang.

519
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:43,580
Get up.

520
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:45,300
Get up.

521
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,700
What's wrong, Duan Yunzhang?

522
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:50,220
Duan Yunzhang.

523
00:19:50,714 --> 00:19:52,600
[Xuanchen Hall]

524
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:08,820
Your Majesty.

525
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:10,940
What happened to Zhang?

526
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,020
Your Majesty.

527
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,740
Imperial Physician Shen
is treating His Majesty now.

528
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:14,900
He said that His Majesty

529
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:16,580
got poisoned.

530
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,580
-Poisoned?
-Poisoned?

531
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:18,980
This...

532
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,260
How did that happen?

533
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,060
Jinfeng.

534
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,140
Did you do anything to His Majesty?

535
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:24,420
I didn't.

536
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,620
This has nothing to do with me.

537
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:26,980
We all know

538
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:29,740
that His Majesty and you aren't on good terms.

539
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,580
You're almost like irreconcilable enemies.

540
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:33,460
Perhaps you were upset with what happened

541
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:34,660
and decided to hurt His Majesty.

542
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:35,860
Why would I do that?

543
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:36,540
I'm leaving.

544
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,540
Do I need to do that?

545
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:39,860
If you're leaving,

546
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,220
why were you at the Qingchi Palace?

547
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,180
She's right.

548
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,540
How do you explain that?

549
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:44,300
I went to the Qingchi Palace

550
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,500
because I wanted to warn him

551
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,260
that Shen Ao is trying to hurt him.

552
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,460
I want him to stay alert.

553
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,220
Shen Ao?

554
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,220
Shen Ao?

555
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,020
What is this?

556
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:52,380
Didn't Shen Ao

557
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:53,740
give me some special medicine?

558
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,500
According to him,
it was to cure His Majesty's asthma.

559
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:56,780
When I was packing today,

560
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:57,820
I accidentally knocked it over.

561
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:58,900
I realized that it was poison.

562
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:01,020
That was why I went to the Xuanchen Hall,
intending to tell him about this.

563
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,740
I kept waiting, but he never showed up.

564
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,060
Then, came a man in black.

565
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:04,980
I chased after the man in black

566
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:05,820
and came to the Qingchi Palace.

567
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,260
I've searched the entire place

568
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,460
and found no man she mentioned.

569
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:09,460
Commander Su.

570
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,580
You couldn't find him,
but it doesn't mean he's not here.

571
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:13,740
Your Majesty,

572
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,180
I can be the witness.

573
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,500
I did see a man in black

574
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,700
at the Xuanchen Hall.

575
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:20,580
I got it.

576
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,340
Shen Ao.

577
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:22,460
It was Shen Ao.

578
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:23,700
He was the man in black.

579
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,220
Shen Ao first poisoned His Majesty.

580
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:27,020
Then, he clad in black
and lured me to Qingchi Palace.

581
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:27,940
He wanted to frame me.

582
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,380
How can you justify that?

583
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,180
Shen Ao, you're here just in time.

584
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,580
Tell them what happened.

585
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,420
Your Majesty.

586
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,100
I fed His Majesty

587
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,300
with the antidote I developed.

588
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,220
His Majesty
will regain his consciousness very soon.

589
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,540
That's good to hear.

590
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,300
Regarding the man in black
Your Majesty was talking about,

591
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,140
forgive me for my lack of knowledge,

592
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:50,980
but I have no idea who that is.

593
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:51,780
Fine.

594
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,580
You don't have to admit
that you were the man in black.

595
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,500
What about the special medicine?

596
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,780
Your Majesty must have forgotten

597
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,540
about my advice.

598
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,540
Take the medicine one time a day.

599
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:02,420
One drop at a time.

600
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:03,620
Taking a low dosage won't do any harm,

601
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,140
but if you take the entire bottle in one go,

602
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,900
it will cost your life.

603
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,260
My spider barely touched the medicine,

604
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,020
and it died.

605
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:13,660
I can't explain that.

606
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,580
Perhaps Your Majesty can talk to His Majesty.

607
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:16,740
After all, he was the one

608
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,260
who told me to pass the medicine to Your Majesty.

609
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,220
What did you say?

610
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,420
His Majesty suspected

611
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:26,220
that Your Majesty came here with a hidden agenda,

612
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,220
intending to do harm to him.

613
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,420
Therefore, he tried different methods,

614
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,180
hoping that you would take the bait

615
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,300
so that he could catch you red-handed.

616
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,180
That medicine

617
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,380
is one of His Majesty's many baits.

618
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:53,300
Your Majesty had not taken any action.

619
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:56,900
You were leaving today,
and you finally couldn't hold it back any longer.

620
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,300
You were the one who hurt His Majesty.

621
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:01,140
I didn't poison His Majesty.

622
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,220
We can find out easily

623
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,660
whether you did it or not.

624
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:04,860
Your Majesty,

625
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,260
I have a suggestion.

626
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,860
Why not leave the Queen
to the Court of Judicial Review?

627
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:10,740
The Court of Judicial Review?

628
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,500
Are you putting me in jail?

629
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:13,820
Your Majesty,

630
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:15,860
I swear I didn't poison His Majesty.

631
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:18,020
I saved him when I reached the Qingchi Palace.

632
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,340
How could I possibly poison him?

633
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,140
I'm leaving soon.

634
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,420
I'm really innocent.

635
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:22,980
This...

636
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:24,620
Your Majesty.

637
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,420
His Majesty is awake.

638
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:27,900
He's awake?

639
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,220
That's great.

640
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,100
Thank Heaven.

641
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:33,580
Thanks for watching over us.

642
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:34,700
-Thanks for watching over us.
-Your Majesty.

643
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:35,780
Now that His Majesty is awake,

644
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:36,620
you can ask him personally.

645
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:37,700
Let him tell you if I was the one who saved him.

646
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:45,420
Zhang.

647
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,140
Are you all right?

648
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,260
Are you feeling discomfort?

649
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:51,980
I'm fine.

650
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:53,300
Sorry to have worried you, Mother.

651
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,020
I'm glad that you're all right.

652
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:54,620
Duan Yunzhang.

653
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:55,740
Tell them

654
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,220
that I was the one who saved you
at the Qingchi Palace just now.

655
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,220
I didn't do anything to hurt you.

656
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:59,940
Saved me? Hurt me?

657
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:00,780
What are you saying?

658
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,420
Shen Ao said that you passed out

659
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:03,380
because you were poisoned.

660
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,020
And he insisted that I was the one
who poisoned you.

661
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:08,900
You poisoned me?

662
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:10,060
That's impossible.

663
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,060
It's utter nonsense.

664
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:11,980
Tell them now.

665
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,100
I think we can skip that.

666
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,260
From my vague memory,

667
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:16,660
I remember that you gave me a pill

668
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,500
when I was in Qingchi Palace.

669
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:20,220
Perhaps that was the poison.

670
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:24,100
Poison? Really?

671
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,140
When did I ever give you any pills?

672
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:28,980
Duan Yunzhang, how could you lie?

673
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:31,420
Tang.

674
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:34,460
Yes, Your Majesty.

675
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,900
Bring the Queen to the Western Cold Palace.

676
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:38,700
Cold Palace?

677
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:39,900
Are you mad, Duan Yunzhang?

678
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:42,140
The Queen is suspected of poisoning me.

679
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,500
I'm going to put you in detention

680
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,900
before I find out the truth.

681
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:47,540
We'll talk again
after they search the Xiangluo Hall.

682
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:49,420
Please come with me, Your Majesty.

683
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,180
I'm not going.

684
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:50,940
Let me go.

685
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,340
Let's settle this once and for all.

686
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,020
-You can't tell right from wrong...
-Sorry, Your Majesty.

687
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:55,260
You accused the innocent.

688
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,620
Let me go now!

689
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,460
It's just the Cold Palace.

690
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:58,260
I can walk.

691
00:24:58,980 --> 00:24:59,620
Your Majesty.

692
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:07,660
(I'm sorry you have to put up with this, Jinfeng.)

693
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:11,340
Repaying kindness with evil.

694
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:12,340
A foolish emperor.

695
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,660
He should've just chased me out of the palace.

696
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,100
What is wrong with him?

697
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:18,660
Your Majesty.

698
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:19,940
We've arrived at the Western Cold Palace.

699
00:25:21,443 --> 00:25:23,000
[Cold Palace]

700
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,340
Keep a close eye on Her Majesty.

701
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:31,460
Don't let her out,

702
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:32,580
especially tonight.

703
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:33,220
Understand?

704
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,100
What a shabby place.

705
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,860
How can anyone live here?

706
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:57,140
Stop pulling a long face.

707
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,860
At least, we get a roof over our heads.

708
00:25:59,300 --> 00:25:59,980
Leave the stuff here.

709
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:01,300
Let's clean this place.

710
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:15,900
Search the place.

711
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,820
Leave no stone unturned.

712
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:18,820
Shen Ao.

713
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,140
Look everywhere.

714
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,980
Find out if she's keeping any illegal drugs.

715
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,340
I'll do all I can

716
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,340
to ensure Your Majesty's safety.

717
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:25,020
Yunchong.

718
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,140
Let's wait outside.

719
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:26,980
Yes, Yunzhang.

720
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:30,580
Come with me.

721
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:38,020
Search over there.

722
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,020
You guys come with me.

723
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:44,700
Go there.

724
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:55,580
Your Majesty,

725
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:57,180
I managed to carry out my task

726
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:58,180
and found the poison.

727
00:26:58,740 --> 00:26:59,380
Shuan.

728
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:05,820
Well done.

729
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:07,260
Where did you find it?

730
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:08,460
Your Majesty.

731
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,060
Her Majesty kept the poison

732
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:11,420
in between the drawers of the cabinet.

733
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,540
It took me a while to find it.

734
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,700
Are you sure it's not a mistake?

735
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:16,820
Of course not.

736
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,060
I checked it.

737
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,580
It contains aconitine.

738
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:22,980
Whoever consumes this will pass out

739
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:23,900
and experience difficulty in breathing

740
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:24,780
and numbness in their limbs.

741
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:27,020
That's exactly what happened to Your Majesty.

742
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:28,900
Indeed.

743
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:29,900
You have great attention to detail.

744
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,300
She hid it so well
and you could still discover it.

745
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:32,580
I didn't know my sister-in-law...

746
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,700
Liu Jinfeng is this vicious.

747
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,140
I'm glad that we found evidence.

748
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:39,100
Thanks, Shen Ao.

749
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:41,540
It's my duty

750
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:42,780
to share Your Majesty's burden.

751
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:43,580
I don't deserve a compliment.

752
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,820
I'm talking about the crime you committed.

753
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,740
You poisoned me

754
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:54,580
and did everything you could to forge evidence,

755
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:55,740
just so you could frame the Queen.

756
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:58,100
It must be tough for you.

757
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:00,500
This...

758
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:01,900
Wait, Yunzhang.

759
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:03,300
What's going on?

760
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:04,180
The Queen

761
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:05,940
never gave me anything.

762
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:07,340
About the pill,

763
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:09,180
it was a story I fabricated.

764
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:11,100
I'm so sorry

765
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:12,740
to have caused such a fuss.

766
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:14,020
Shen Ao.

767
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:16,300
I didn't believe it
when His Majesty told me what happened.

768
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:17,580
You have always been

769
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:18,860
His Majesty's favorite.

770
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,140
What is going on?

771
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:21,260
Your Majesty,

772
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:23,380
have you always suspected Shen Ao?

773
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:25,180
Your Majesty.

774
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,060
I did

775
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,620
find the poison

776
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:29,300
in Her Majesty's chamber.

777
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,700
Even if Her Majesty
didn't feed Your Majesty with the poison,

778
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,700
it could also be someone else

779
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:34,940
who poisoned Your Majesty,

780
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,780
then hid the poison in Her Majesty's chamber.

781
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,620
Why did Your Majesty insist
that I was the one who did it?

782
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,100
Shen Ao.

783
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,900
You still refuse to admit it.

784
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:46,900
Do you think

785
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,580
this is the only evidence I have?

786
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:53,100
This all happened because of a coincidence.

787
00:28:53,804 --> 00:29:02,775
[The Guide of Acupuncture]

788
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,740
I noticed that your fingers

789
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,420
carried a faint smell.

790
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:39,820
I wasn't too bothered by it.

791
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,180
I simply thought

792
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:43,700
that you were working on some new medicine.

793
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,860
It smelt exactly like the incense

794
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:48,060
I used when I was taking bath in Qingchi Palace.

795
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,900
Why did you want to kill me?

796
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:54,300
Or is someone else behind this?

797

I...

798
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,180
Let me go.

799

What are you doing?

800
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:03,540

You won't be able to get away.

803

Let her go now!

804
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,700
So Your Majesty has got everything prepared.

Your Majesty,

815
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:38,060
poisoning you was my own idea.

00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:39,540
That's enough.

818

Get the imperial physician here.

819
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:43,820
It's fine, Your Majesty.

820
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,260
Let me finish my words.

821
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:47,740
My father

822
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:51,100
was once an imperial physician
of the Lingshu Academy too.

823
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,940
Your Majesty's mother, Consort Li,

824
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:55,380
fell into the water.

825
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:59,580
She had already passed away
when they finally got her out.

826
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:01,900
My father was sentenced to death

827
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:04,900
because he failed to save her.

828
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:07,940
My mother later died of depression.

829
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:13,540
I got kicked around by my relatives.

830
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:15,540
I had to live under others' roofs

831
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,140
and I had experienced
all the good and bad of this world.

832
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:20,580
I became an imperial physician

833
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,580
because I was still holding grudges.

834
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:35,340
I had never intended
to tell Your Majesty any of this.

835
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:39,540
Now I'm saying this

836
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:42,260
because I want Your Majesty to know

837
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:44,020
how much my family had suffered.

838
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:45,980
I hope that Your Majesty would watch
what you do in the future.

839
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,460
This is my way

840
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,980
to avenge my parents.

841
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:56,660
There's one more thing.

842
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:17,060
Your Majesty trusted the wrong person,

843
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:21,260
hence giving me the chance to betray you.

844
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:23,900
Your Majesty is the ruler of the country.

845
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,700
You should take this as a lesson

846
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:26,820
and watch carefully who you trust.

847
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:30,980
Take care, Your Majesty.

848
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,060
Shen Ao!

849
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:37,300
Shen Ao!

850
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:12,900
Your Majesty,

851
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,500
I've searched the Lingshu Academy.

852
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:16,260
I didn't find any suspicious letters.

853
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:17,620
I think

854
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,580
even if Shen Ao was telling the truth,

855
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:21,460
it doesn't prove
that there was no one behind this.

856
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:23,260
I'm sure it was Liu Xie.

857
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:24,940
It wasn't him.

858
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:29,980
Do you remember how I wanted to kill Liu Xie

859
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:32,020
at Qingchi Palace the other day?

860
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,740
My original plan

861
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,420
was to finish the first glass of wine

862
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:39,580
and then drop the second glass.

863
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:41,220
That was the secret sign.

864
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:45,820
However, someone hit the glass with a stone.

865
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:48,140
Wasn't the person sent by Liu Xie?

866
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,660
Now,

867
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:52,260
I realized that the guy wasn't trying
to ruin my plan.

868
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,220
Instead, he was trying to save me.

869
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,300
How is that possible?

870
00:34:58,460 --> 00:34:59,380
It was Shen Ao.

871
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:02,220
Before Shen Ao took his own life,

872
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,780
he told me that when he found out
I was going to kill Liu Xie,

873
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:07,700
he approached Liu Xie.

874
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,020
He proposed to work with him.

875
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:12,020
He said that he would poison me.

876
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:15,140
When I finished the first glass of wine,

877
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:16,420
I would die on the spot.

878
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:19,180
Then,

879
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:21,780
not only could Liu Xie survive,

880
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,060
but he could also use Shen Ao to get rid of me.

881
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:29,020
Later, Liu Xie would pretend
to be investigating the cause of my death,

882
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:32,060
and that would save Shen Ao too.

883
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,100
Little did they know,

884
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:37,260
someone knocked over the poisoned wine.

885
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,940
Shen Ao said he never saw this coming

886
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:43,220
and Liu Xie was the only one

887
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:46,300
who would be capable of doing this.

888
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:48,020
Shen Ao's way more meticulous

889
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,700
than we thought.

890
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:53,220
Why did Liu Xie do this, then?

891
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,700
Since he had agreed to work with Shen Ao,

892
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,020
why did he try to save Your Majesty?

893
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:58,900
He doesn't look like a kind man.

894
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:01,820
I have no idea what Liu Xie is planning too.

895
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:05,100
Perhaps he wanted to keep me alive

896
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:07,140
for a while more.

897
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:11,580
I have got a lot on my mind now.

898
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,180
I would like to take a walk.

899
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,500
Don't follow me.

900
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,300
Shen Ao.

901
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:50,700
Do you know

902
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:54,660
that Taiyuan Pond used to be very deep?

903
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,780
After Mother fell into the pond,

904
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,220
they filled it to make it shallower.

905
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:07,660
You don't call this a pond.

906
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,940
Why don't they just fill it up completely?

907
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:15,460
Why didn't they

908
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:18,580
fill the pond sooner?

909
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:34,420
Now I know

910
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:38,580
why you were always staring at the pond.

911
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,140
So when

912
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:44,740
we were having drinks here,

913
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:49,060
you were only thinking about how to kill me.

914
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:56,300
If you really wanted to take my life,

915
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:58,660
why didn't you use

916
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:01,500
a more poisonous incense?

917
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:06,220
How could you say

918
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,220
that you know what you were doing?

919
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,300
I think

920
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:20,580
you were too careless.

921
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:24,780
You were really careless.

922
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,100
Later, I wondered

923
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:43,100
if I had really done something wrong.

924
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:48,580
Otherwise,

925
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:52,420
why didn't Father bless me with success?

926
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:00,860
I guess this is why.

927
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,060
That should be the reason.
