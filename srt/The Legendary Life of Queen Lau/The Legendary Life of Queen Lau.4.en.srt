We raid his home, exile him from here,

169
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,079
and he shall never return.

170
00:07:53,679 --> 00:07:54,279
Grand Chancellor,

171
00:07:55,239 --> 00:07:57,959
you have gone too far.

172
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,399
The decree of Zhang An's punishment

173
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:10,000
has been drafted and stamped.

174
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:12,720
Your Majesty, please approve it

175
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,200
and execute it now.

176
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,200
Your Majesty,

177
00:08:20,679 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm telling the truth.

178
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,359
Your Majesty,

179
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:26,440
please make a good judgment!

180
00:08:29,559 --> 00:08:31,839
Who else has any comments on this matter?

181
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:38,400
Talk to me!

182
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,840
-The Grand Chancellor's motion is brilliant.
-The Grand Chancellor's motion is brilliant.

183
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,559
-We second the motion.
-We second the motion.

184
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:45,640
-We second the motion.
-We second the motion.

185
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:47,840
Your Majesty,

186
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,799
I actually have so many ways

187
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,400
to stop this memorial.

188
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:57,880
The reason I allowed Zhang An to bring it up

189
00:08:58,719 --> 00:09:00,320
was just to see

190
00:09:00,719 --> 00:09:04,239
if Your Majesty would be deceived
by these treacherous officials.

191
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:08,039
Also, I would like to see for myself

192
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:10,679
who's being loyal and who's not.

193
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,719
Zhang An's crime is unforgivable,

194
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:14,760
please command your decree, Your Majesty.

195
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,039
-Zhang An's crime is unforgivable,
-Zhang An's crime is unforgivable,

196
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:19,599
-please command your decree, Your Majesty.
-please command your decree, Your Majesty.

197
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,200
Grand Chancellor.

198
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:26,239
How dare you force me?

199
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:27,880
Your Majesty,

200
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:35,679
I'm just helping you
to test your officials, Your Majesty.

201
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,599
Stop!

202
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,640
Your Majesty, you can't enter.

203
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,320
Step aside! I'm going in no matter what.

204
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,159
Why is the Queen here?

205
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:01,200
Liu Xie,

206
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,359
don't you ever bully Xuan.

207
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,960
Being loud doesn't mean you're strong,

208
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,520
it's the same even if you have an army behind you.

209
00:10:22,599 --> 00:10:23,559
Bring the pen over.

210
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,599
Don't.

211
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,159
Nonsense!

212
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:28,640
How dare you snatch the decree!

213
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,559
Why not?

214
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,400
You're bullying Xuan,

215
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,320
I won't allow that.

216
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,039
Insolence.

217
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,919
You are the insolent one here.

218
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:35,599
Xuan is the Emperor and I'm the Queen.

219
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,400
You...

220
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:38,400
You're just an old man who still looks fine.

221
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,559
Your Majesty,

222
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,080
if I were you,

223
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,200
when I saw the Queen misbehave

224
00:10:49,359 --> 00:10:51,119
and shame herself in front of the public,

225
00:10:51,119 --> 00:10:52,760
I wouldn't laugh at all.

226
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,080
Jinfeng

227
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,359
is your own daughter.

228
00:10:59,599 --> 00:11:00,840
So, you should be responsible

229
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:03,159
for her behavior, isn't it?

230
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,359
When she was still in my residence,

231
00:11:06,359 --> 00:11:09,080
she was so obedient and lovely.

232
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,679
In just a few days after entering the palace,

233
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:12,960
she has completely changed

234
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,960
and is so messed up.

235
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,840
That proves you didn't teach her well,
Your Majesty.

236
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,799
You'd better not say that.

237
00:11:19,119 --> 00:11:21,559
You can't even handle the Queen,

238
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,960
yet still want
to handle state affairs, Your Majesty?

239
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,400
I doubt you can manage that, Your Majesty.

240
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:25,960
How about this?

241
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,799
I'll decide on

242
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,840
Zhang An's punishment.

243
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:30,960
No way.

244
00:11:31,359 --> 00:11:31,960
Grand Chancellor.

245
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:32,760
Grand Chancellor!

246
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:44,799
Xuan,

247
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,159
this is for you.

248
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,520
Did I come at the right time?

249
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,440
Go and wash your face.

250
00:11:57,799 --> 00:11:59,320
Who put the make-up on your face?

251
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,679
For sure I learn to do it myself bit by bit.

252
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,479
How's it?

253
00:12:03,479 --> 00:12:04,479
It looks good, doesn't it?

254
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:05,599
Do I look like

255
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:07,039
a motherly model now?

256
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:07,719
Nonsense!

257
00:12:08,599 --> 00:12:10,359
Is my make-up too light?

258
00:12:10,359 --> 00:12:11,479
Or my legs aren't splay-footed enough?

259
00:12:11,479 --> 00:12:12,520
It's my first time,

260
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,679
that's why I didn't go too far.

261
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:14,840
But those people
from the Imperial Ceremonial Service said

262
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,119
that as long as I can let others know

263
00:12:16,119 --> 00:12:17,919
that I'm the Queen by making it obvious.

264
00:12:18,599 --> 00:12:21,320
Did you really think that it was appropriate?

265
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:23,159
Did I do something wrong?

266
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:25,840
Try thinking properly.

267
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,039
In this imperial capital,

268
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:29,599
the empress dowager, the consort dowager,

269
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:30,719
or even Sufang,

270
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,840
does anyone behave so ostentatiously like you?

271
00:12:33,599 --> 00:12:35,039
But those
from the Imperial Ceremonial Service said

272
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,239
the Queen should look majestic

273
00:12:37,359 --> 00:12:39,280
and this etiquette
shall not be imitated by others.

274
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:44,960
That means,

275
00:12:45,239 --> 00:12:46,960
the three people tricked me?

276
00:12:47,479 --> 00:12:48,760
They told me to nod my head
on the left, middle, and right,

277
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,760
walk splay-footed,

278
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:51,320
and even put on thick makeup.

279
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,200
I have been putting my efforts into it,

280
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,840
but the three of them made a fool of me?

281
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,080
I'm going to get even with them now.

282
00:12:59,599 --> 00:13:00,239
Jinfeng,

283
00:13:00,359 --> 00:13:01,479
what happened to your face?

284
00:13:01,719 --> 00:13:02,280
Mother,

285
00:13:02,359 --> 00:13:03,239
I'm going to get even with someone else.

286
00:13:03,239 --> 00:13:04,359
I'll explain to you later.

287
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,479
I think you're the one

288
00:13:07,479 --> 00:13:08,559
who's in trouble now.

289
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,719
What happened?

290
00:13:09,719 --> 00:13:11,359
You made a fool of yourself

291
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,000
in front of the imperial officials

292
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,799
and embarrassed His Majesty.

293
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:16,080
Don't you think you should be punished?

294
00:13:18,479 --> 00:13:19,000
Yes,

295
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:20,080
I've embarrassed myself.

296
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:21,479
Even if I were to be punished,

297
00:13:21,479 --> 00:13:22,520
only Xuan could do that to me.

298
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,320
What does it have to do with you?

299
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:23,719
You!

300
00:13:24,599 --> 00:13:25,359
Yunzhang,

301
00:13:25,479 --> 00:13:27,599
the Queen is being supercilious now.

302
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:29,080
You should really punish her.

303
00:13:31,599 --> 00:13:32,280
Zhang,

304
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,080
I believe Jinfeng

305
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,280
won't come up with such a ridiculous idea.

306
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,919
Is there something we don't know?

307
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:39,359
Mother,

308
00:13:39,359 --> 00:13:40,359
you're quite wise.

309
00:13:40,359 --> 00:13:41,359
I was being tricked.

310
00:13:41,359 --> 00:13:42,440
I'm a victim too.

311
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,719
The Queen is sadfishing again.

312
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,320
She hasn't been able to learn anything,

313
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,280
yet she's blaming others.

314
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,840
That's what they taught me.

315
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,359
What else I could do?

316
00:13:49,359 --> 00:13:49,840
I...

317
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,479
Shut up.

318
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,599
Shuan,

319
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,960
put those old maids
from the Imperial Ceremonial Service

320
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:55,840
into prison.

321
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,760
Find another day to behead them.

322
00:13:57,359 --> 00:13:58,200
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-What?

323
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,559
-Behead?
-Behead?

324
00:14:00,359 --> 00:14:01,760
Deceiving the Queen

325
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,239
is equal to deceiving me.

326
00:14:03,239 --> 00:14:04,719
Then this is a crime of deceiving the Emperor.

327
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,520
They wanted to see the Queen
being embarrassed in front of the public.

328
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,039
That's an evil intention

329
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,520
and rebellious.

330
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:14,960
Their intention
to deceive the Emperor and rebel

331
00:14:15,119 --> 00:14:16,880
can be worth a hundred deaths.

332
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,400
Is...

333
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,400
Is it really that serious?

334
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,119
But I'm suspecting

335
00:14:23,239 --> 00:14:25,159
that someone is behind all this.

336
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:27,080
Or else, no one would be that daring

337
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,400
to make fun of the Queen.

338
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:30,799
Shuan,

339
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,400
ask the Court of Judicial Review
to investigate it.

340
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,159
Yes, Your Majesty.

341
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:35,359
Hold on!

342
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:38,200
I...

343
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,280
I...

344
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,840
It was me.

345
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,080
I just want them

346
00:14:45,479 --> 00:14:47,599
to give the Queen a piece of my mind.

347
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,080
It was you?

348
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,760
Just because you don't like me?

349
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,559
You're so cruel.

350
00:14:54,359 --> 00:14:55,640
Yan,

351
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,080
how could you do that?

352
00:14:57,159 --> 00:14:58,960
I'm so disappointed with you.

353
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:02,760
I just wanted to make fun of her.

354
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,559
I definitely never thought
about deceiving the Emperor.

355
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:06,960
Yunzhang.

356
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,599
Please forgive me, Yunzhang.

357
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:11,960
I'll never do it again.

358
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:15,200
Since this is your first offense,

359
00:15:15,599 --> 00:15:18,559
I'll let you reflect on your mistake
in seclusion for half a month.

360
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:21,280
Besides greeting the empress dowager every day,

361
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,359
you're forbidden to go anywhere.

362
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,840
Thank you, Yunzhang.

363
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:26,200
I'll accept the punishment.

364
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,280
Those old maids...

365
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,760
Don't behead them.

366
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,799
Fifty flogs for each of them.

367
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:34,719
Don't flog them,

368
00:15:34,719 --> 00:15:35,760
that's too easy for them.

369
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,200
What do you have in mind?

370
00:15:38,359 --> 00:15:40,520
Let them repeat what they have taught me

371
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,960
and walk around in the palace for three days.

372
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:42,760
In that case,

373
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,880
I suppose they'll hang their heads in shame

374
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,799
within the next five years.

375
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:46,520
Did you just say I was cruel?

376
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,760
She's so much crueler than me.

377
00:15:50,239 --> 00:15:52,520
I think it's a good idea.

378
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,520
It shows your kind-heartedness, Jinfeng.

379
00:15:56,919 --> 00:15:58,880
How about we just let it be?

380
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:00,440
No, wait.

381
00:16:01,479 --> 00:16:02,640
What about my palace rules then?

382
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,679
You're worried about your palace rules?

383
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,559
It's all right,

384
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:08,640
I'll look for new old maids

385
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,919
and make sure they're reliable this time.

386
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:11,440
Forget it.

387
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,039
I still haven't gotten over it yet.

388
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:14,159
I feel afraid when I see an old maid now.

389
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:15,679
Why don't you let Xuan

390
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,400
teach me in person?

391
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,620
You want me to teach you?

392
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,980
No... No way.

393
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,060
She's right.

394
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,180
Zhang is busy with state affairs,

395
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,460
it's unsuitable.

396
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:30,260
Stop arguing.

397
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,780
We'll do just as Jinfeng said.

398
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,060
I'll teach her.

399
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:38,500
The relative banquet is around the corner.

400
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,140
Go and pack up,

401
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,860
you'll stay in Xuanchen Hall temporarily.

402
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:43,500
Yunzhang,

403
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,540
that's not fair.

404
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:48,300
The Queen sneaked out while she was grounded.

405
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,500
Not only did you not punish her,

406
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,140
but you also canceled her grounding.

407
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,020
Who said so?

408
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,580
From tomorrow onward,

409
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,540
Jinfeng will be grounded beside me.

410
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,420
She'll go wherever I go.

411
00:16:59,180 --> 00:16:59,980
Xuan,

412
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,900
do you really want to stay with me?

413
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,180
You treat me so well.

414
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,580
I'll go and pack now.

415
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:14,980
Come.

416
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:15,940
Excuse me. Here.

417
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,660
Hurry up and pack this up.

418
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:22,260
Sufang,

419
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:23,820
that's all you're bringing?

420
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:24,700
It's not enough.

421
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,020
Your Majesty,

422
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,500
you're just staying there for only a few days.

423
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:29,900
Do you really need to bring so many things over?

424
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,940
Sufang, you weren't there with us.

425
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,500
Xuan told me

426
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,780
that he'll ground me beside him.

427
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,700
That's what His Majesty said?

428
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,220
He's going to teach me rules.

429
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,420
He even played this exciting trick
to ground me beside him.

430
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:49,580
Frankly,

431
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,220
he just wanted me to accompany him.

432
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:52,860
Maybe

433
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,220
after the relative banquet,

434
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,300
he won't want me to leave anymore.

435
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:58,980
These shirts aren't enough,

436
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,140
go and look for a few more.

437
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,220
Hurry up.

438
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:01,820
All right.

439
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:17,540
Put it here.

440
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,020
Your Majesty.

441
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,460
Are you serious about inviting Her Majesty

442
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,500
into Xuanchen Hall

443
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,540
and teaching her the rules?

444
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,260
Why not?

445
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:28,900
Well...

446
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:29,460
Your Majesty,

447
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,740
don't tell me you have already fallen in love

448
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:33,820
with Her Majesty?

449
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,500
I forbid you to have this thought.

450
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,580
Not even a bit.

451
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,460
Then why?

452
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:41,100
What do you think, Shen Ao?

453
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,100
Her Majesty saved Your Majesty

454
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,340
during the state affairs discussion
this morning

455
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,380
and even started an argument with Liu Xie.

456
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,500
You are now unsure

457
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,620
about both of them now,

458
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,780
or Her Majesty's intention, Your Majesty.

459
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,380
That's right.

460
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:57,300
Grounding her here is our last resort.

461
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,020
Since I already know

462
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:01,260
she isn't in the same line as Liu Xie,

463
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:04,580
then it's worth it for us
to test if she can be our ally.

464
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:05,460
Your Majesty,

465
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:07,060
cats do hide their claws.

466
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:09,420
Her Majesty is Liu Xie's daughter after all.

467
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,740
If they really wish to harm you

468
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,340
and you keep her by your side,

469
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,860
that's setting a fox to keep the geese,
Your Majesty.

470
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,260
If we don't lure the fox in,

471
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,620
how will we know what's on her mind?

472
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:21,220
Right now, I have to make sure

473
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,420
her existence

474
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,460
won't affect my plan.

475
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:26,980
So, you have thought about it, Your Majesty?

476
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,180
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

477
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,500
I'll be more careful

478
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,420
and keep you safe, Your Majesty.

479
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:31,380
Your Majesty.

480
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,460
I feel like these bits and pieces

481
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:35,060
brought by Her Majesty

482
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,460
can't cause any harm.

483
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,020
Show them to me.

484
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,420
You're right.

485
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,460
I'll add in for her then.

486
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,380
Let's go and look for Yunchong.

487
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:58,140
Your Majesty,

488
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,660
I'll put these over there.

489
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:00,220
All right.

490
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:08,980
Greetings, Your Majesty.

491
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:12,900
Xuan!

492
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:15,940
Xuan!

493
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:20,820
What are these?

494
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,740
These are all Yunchong's new inventions.

495
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:24,740
Just pick one.

496
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,300
Is it a gift for me?

497
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:29,460
Since you have moved into Xuanchen Hall,

498
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:30,940
then it's time to face a real

499
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:32,060
and tough problem.

500
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,020
What is it?

501
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:34,420
This is where assassins come

502
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,780
most frequently within the imperial capital.

503
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:38,340
As the Queen,

504
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,460
you need to have a weapon for self-defense.

505
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:42,580
I'm not afraid.

506
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:43,940
You're here too. You'll save me, won't you?

507
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,300
I can't punch my way out of a paper bag.

508

No matter how much I wish to save you,

509

I'm afraid I just can't do much.

All right then.

511

What's this?

512
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:54,700
It looks nice.

513
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,660
It's the Stop Unwanted Encounter Spray.

514
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:58,740
I want this then.

515
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,900
I have had too many
unwanted encounters all this while.

516
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,260
This is the only danger that I face.

517
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,820
Now that I have this,

518

you are not taking it seriously, are you?

524

I'm not afraid of assassins.

Don't we have guards here?

526

have you regained your memory already?

they wouldn't do anything to you.

No way.

744

Has Her Majesty

745
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,060
taken any strange actions?

746
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:31,580
Not yet.

747
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:34,100
We're now almost inseparable

748
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,460
and I even handed the dagger to her.

749
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,940
Why hasn't she made a move yet?

750
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,940
Is it because using the dagger

751
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,100
is a little too obvious?

752
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:43,580
If Her Majesty assassinates you,

753
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:46,060
she can't run away from punishment.

754
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:47,460
You're right.

755
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:48,940
In your view,

756
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:51,620
what's the most hidden way for assassination

757
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:53,060
that wouldn't be found out?

758
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:54,780
You've asked the right person, Your Majesty.

759
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:56,140
The most hidden way

760
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:57,940
is definitely using poison.

761
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,460
Poison?

762
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:04,420
Shen Ao.

763
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,140
Are you willing to put up an act with me?

764
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:08,940
Your Majesty,

765
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,820
I'll accept all your orders.

766
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:11,820
Great.

767
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:24,660
Miss Baiyu,

768
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,540
actually,

769
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:28,660
I didn't mean to scold you that day.

770
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,460
There were too many people there.

771
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:32,180
If you really did that with His Majesty,

772
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:33,620
what would my sister-in-law think?

773
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:34,700
What would the others think?

774
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:37,940
You were so fierce.

775
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:48,660
Do you still remember that pavilion?

776
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,180
When we were little,

777
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,900
we played paper kites together over there.

778
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:58,340
Did we?

779
00:32:59,140 --> 00:32:59,820
You have forgotten?

780
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:01,020
It was so windy that day

781
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,540
that your kite was hung on top.

782
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:04,020
In the end, I went to get it for you.

783
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:06,540
I don't remember it.

784
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:09,940
That's understandable.

785
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:12,620
It happened so long ago,

786
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:14,620
it's normal that you don't remember it.

787
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:17,740
What...

788
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:19,780
What's this?

789
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,380
This thing?

790
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:24,300
I made it with two rice dumplings leaves.

791
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,940
Even though it's not completed yet,

792
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:28,140
would you like to take a guess

793
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:29,620
on what it is?

794
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:32,660
I can't figure it out.

795
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:34,100
I knew it.

796
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,140
Let me tell you.

797
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:38,060
It's a dragonfly.

798
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:39,660
Look.

799
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:42,860
If you like it,

800
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:44,140
when I finish making its head,

801
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:45,060
I'll give it to you.

802
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:46,780
It's all right.

803
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:48,220
It's okay,

804
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:49,540
you don't have to be so polite in front of me.

805
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:51,420
I'm not. I really don't need it.

806
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,700
I knew it.

807
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:56,300
You're worried because of my identity.

808
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:57,660
Even though

809
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,860
I have put a lot of effort
into making this dragonfly,

810
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,500
I'm still willing to give it to you.

811
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,940
Besides, I know much more than this.

812
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:05,860
How about you follow me back to Chonghua Hall?

813
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:07,700
It's fine, Your Highness.

814
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:08,660
I'm sorry,

815
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:10,860
I'm not worried or trying to be polite here.

816
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:12,340
I'm just not interested

817
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:13,380
in your matters, Your Highness.

818
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:15,940
If there's nothing else you want me to do,

819
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:17,140
I'll make a move first, Your Highness.

820
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,140
Farewell.

821
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:23,500
Wait.

822
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,300
Say it again.

823
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:31,980
It seems like not only are you not doing
what you should,

824
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:33,420
but you are being childish too, Your Highness.

825
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,300
I'll give you another chance.

826
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:39,180
Say it again.

827
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:42,060
I'll just say the same thing over and over again.

828
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:43,300
I said you're not doing your jobs,

829
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,180
childish, and being self-indulgent.

830
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:03,580
Young Lady,

831
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:05,340
this is our first time entering the palace.

832
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:07,540
His Majesty is going to meet us, right?

833
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,140
It's all right.

834
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:10,980
His Majesty is busy with his homework,

835
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:13,500
he'll be a wise king in the future.

836
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:15,940
Unlike the second prince

837
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:18,500
who idles away his time

838
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:19,780
and is not doing his jobs.

839
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:21,860
It's obvious that he's good for nothing.

840
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,820
But, when His Highness promised

841
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:25,740
to make you a new paper kite just now,

842
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,540
why did you look so happy?

843
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:28,460
I pretended.

844
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:30,740
If I hadn't sent him away,

845
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:32,900
we wouldn't have gotten our peace and quiet now,
would we?

846
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,420
You're so smart, Young Lady.

847
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,100
Liu Baiyu,

848
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,180
you didn't change at all.

849
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,180
You have eyes but fail to see,

850
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,580
your heart is full of hypocrisy.

851
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,220
Shen Ao, you're heartless

852
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:02,460
and inhuman!

853
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,500
I'll never take this medicine.

854
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,380
Take it away!

855
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:05,980
Your Majesty,

856
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:07,780
it's not easy to produce this medicine.

857
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:08,980
It's very effective for your chronic disease.

858
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:09,340
Please don't...

859
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,020
Stop!

860
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:12,380
I don't want to see this medicine anymore.

861
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,700
If I had known what was in your mind...

862
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:15,700
Your Majesty.

863
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,740
(What happened to Xuan?)

864
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,900
(Did he fall sick?)

865
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,180
(Or is it because he's exhausted himself
to teach me)

866
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,460
(that he has fallen sick?)

867
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:25,700
Inform Jinfeng

868
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,580
that I give her two more hours.

869
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,700
Tell her to come back later.

870
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:30,260
Your Majesty,

871
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:31,420
why is that so?

872
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:33,060
This sickness is too sudden,

873
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,820
I don't want to frighten her.

874
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:36,340
Your Majesty.

875
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:38,780
(Xuan,)

876
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,180
(you're so good to me.)

877
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:43,180
Get out of my sight, Shen Ao!

878
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:44,700
I don't want to see you!

879
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:45,460
Hurry and go.

880
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:46,820
Yes.

881
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:51,180
Is she gone?

882
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:56,500
How was my acting?

883
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:57,580
