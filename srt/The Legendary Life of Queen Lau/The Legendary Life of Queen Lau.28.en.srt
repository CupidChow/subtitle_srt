Something is wrong with Muyan Palace.

Why don't you tell the Queen?

to take her with me.

50

Perhaps I should go with you?

56
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,039
Never mind.

57

If the Empress Dowager found out,

58
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:56,759
she'd have my head for this.

I often come here to steal some trinkets.

73

Calm down, Jinfeng.

You did great.

88
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:06,700
You should lead the way.

Hurry up.

90
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:08,740
You know the place better.

91
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:09,620
Let's go.

92
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:15,980
Keep moving.

93
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:22,780
Are we safe here?

94
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,900
This is it.

95
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:32,740
Here?

96
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,380
Mother!

97
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,140
Be careful in here.

98
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:35,740
Mother!

99
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:38,420
Mother!

100
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:42,780
What is going on?

101
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:43,940
Why isn't anyone here?

102
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,100
Did I mess it up?

103
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,580
Character cards?

104
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,100
These belong to my mother.

105
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,220
Does your mother play card games?

106
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:54,700
Yes.

107
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,540
She says she's an unbeatable card player,

108
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,420
but she is the only person who knows the game.

109
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,620
Of course she is unbeatable.

110

If my mother's belongings are here,

111
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,700
she must have been here before.

112

Let's keep looking.

113
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,340
There might be other secret rooms.

114
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:07,980
There's something over here.

115

122

123
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:53,820

It's not that I wouldn't save you,

134
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,860
I was waiting for the right time.

135

You're awake, Your Majesty!

136
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,740
You have been asleep for hours.

137
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,740
That long?

138
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:15,420
Yes.

139
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,740
You must have been exhausted from worrying

140
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:18,780
about your mother.

141
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,540
But you can rest assured now.

142
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,780
News from the Grand Chancellor's Residence

143
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:22,900
says your mother is back.

144
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,340
Really?

145
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,860
But who saved my mother?

146
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,620
According to the eunuch,

147
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,620
your mother got lost

148
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,060
and went deeper into the mountainside.

149
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,580
She ran into a snake,

150
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,020
then, a bear.

151
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,740
Her tale was too scary,

152
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:36,940
and we were all terrified.

153
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,660
My dream actually came true?

154
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:40,860
And then?

155
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:42,020
And...

156
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,020
And she ran into

157
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,580
a fearless warrior who saved her.

158
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,340
He didn't tell us the details.

159
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:51,220
I didn't want to bother you, so I didn't pry.

160
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,700
A fearless warrior?

161
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,220
More!

162
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,540
Ease up on the vegetables.

163
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:12,580
I want that.

164
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,500
Eat more meat.

165
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,860
You've lost so much weight.

166
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:19,900
You know,

167
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,380
I was too busy playing card games

168
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,580
that I didn't have time for meals.

169
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,860
Aren't you worried at all?

170
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:27,740
Not at all.

171
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,540
I had a dream.

172
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:30,820
A dream?

173
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:39,940
It really is a wolf!

174
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:40,500
Mother!

175
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:46,180
Mother!

176
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:57,780
Liu Xie?

177
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:21,380
Delicious.

178
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,140
So,

179
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,180
if I didn't save you,

180
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,540
and someone else did,

181
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,300
would you elope with the other guy?

182
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,140
Impossible.

183
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,420
Why not?

184
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:34,660
I told you I wouldn't leave you

185
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:35,540
for another man.

186
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,340
I don't want anyone else to save me.

187
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:40,660
That's more like it.

188
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:52,660
Your Majesty!

189
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:54,980
How's it?

190
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,140
Is His Majesty coming here?

191
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,660
His Majesty is not coming.

192
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,340
What's wrong?

193
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,780
I forgot it.

194
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,460
It's a special occasion in the palace.

195
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,980
His Majesty is busy right now.

196
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:03,860
Busy doing what?

197
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,780
Picking the men.

198
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,940
He doesn't apologize
and is now busy selecting men?

199
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:11,860
Your Majesty,

200
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,540
you said His Majesty saved you.

201
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,420
Why would you want his apology?

202
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,660
(I don't mind if you want to play my hero,)

203
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,940
(but you must ensure your safety.)

204
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,340
(Don't you know I'll be worried about you too?)

205
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:28,900
[East]

206
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:41,340
[Voting Board]

207
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:44,980
Greetings, Your Majesty!

208
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:47,740
At ease.

209
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,220
Thank you, Your Majesty.

210
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:53,340
Your Majesty.

211
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,660
There are two parts to this year's selection.

212
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,540
The first part is a martial arts contest.

213
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,540
The second part is new to this year's selection.

214
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:00,620
The beauty contest.

215
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,500
Now, look over here!

216
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,140
This is the voting board!

217
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,540
Members of each palace

218
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:09,340
will vote based on your looks.

219
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,900
The final result will be counted
toward your overall score!

220
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:12,780
He looks nice.

221
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,300
-This guy looks great!
-He's handsome.

222
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,940
Let's start voting!

223
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:19,500
Vote for the guy!

224
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,060
I'm voting for him!

225
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:21,820
I'm voting for that guy!

226
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,140
Who set this rule?

227
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:26,100
Your Majesty,

228
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:28,420
the Empress Dowager set this rule.

229
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,060
She thinks the guards in the palaces

230
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,340
get worse by the year

231
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,380
and are affecting

232
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,100
our image.

233
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,540
Mother is being unreasonable.

234
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,980
How can we judge people by their appearance?

235
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,420
Take the board down.

236
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:39,140
Your Majesty.

237
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,700
It's not a bad thing to have

238
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,940
guards with good looks.

239
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,580
They'd be pleasant to look at.

240
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,660
Just do as I say and take the board down.

241
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,020
I'm selecting the guards.

242
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,980
I only judge them by their hearts.

243
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:51,780
Hold on.

244
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,100
Why isn't Yu Changya here yet?

245
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,100
Yu...

246
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,220
He's here, Your Majesty!

247
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,900
Imperial Physician Yu is here!

248
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:06,420
Imperial Physician Yu!

249
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:06,860
What is the meaning of this?

250
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,260
Imperial Physician Yu!

251
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,540
-Imperial Physician Yu!
-I like you!

252
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,100
Imperial Physician Yu!

253
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,140
Let's go!

254
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:15,260
-Imperial Physician Yu!
-Imperial Physician Yu is so handsome!

255
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,820
-Imperial Physician Yu!
-Imperial Physician Yu, you look striking!

256
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,060
You look so cool, Imperial Physician Yu!

257
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,020
Your skin looks great!

258
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,420
Demon.

259
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,900
He's a demon.

260
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,420
He made everyone from the palace...

261
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,060
Your Majesty!

262
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,100
Impressive moves, Your Majesty.

263
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,140
May I know why Your Majesty

264
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,180
has summoned me?

265
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,220
Imperial Physician Yu,

266
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,100
I've heard you're a great swordsman.

267
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,900
I want to challenge you to a fight.

268
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,900
That should set an example

269
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:49,660
for the future guards.

270
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:51,860
I gladly accept the challenge.

271
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,140
Someone,

272
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,380
get him a sword.

273
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:42,940
You like Jinfeng?

274
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,020
From the moment I first met her.

275
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,180
Are you engaged?

276
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,460
Before you did.

277
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,060
There is one more thing.

278
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,540
The letters Xuan sent her

279
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,780
were all written by me.

280
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,140
So more precisely speaking,

281
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:55,300
the man she loves is actually me!

282
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:00,780
Stop!

283
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,460
You neglected your duties

284
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,900
and came here for a fight?

285
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,220
What did I do wrong?

286
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,460
What did you do wrong?

287
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:13,900
My mother was right.

288
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,220
Men will never realize

289
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,220
their own mistakes.

290
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,540
I saved you,

291
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:19,860
why must I now apologize?

292
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:21,380
See?

293
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,540
You're too full of yourself.

294
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:23,780
Now we know for sure

295
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:24,980
who the hero and coward are

296
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:25,980
in the Queen's eyes.

297
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,380
Shut it.

298
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,700
It's none of your business.

299
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:31,460
Do you think anyone can simply be my hero?

300
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:33,260
I decide who becomes my hero.

301
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:33,900
And remember,

302
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,740
only I can lecture my man,

303
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,140
no one else can.

304
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,220
You heard it.

305
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:40,140
And you!

306
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,740
You are too full of yourself!

307
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,780
Do you think operating alone
makes you look cool?

308
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:45,500
Do you think you're so good
being the Emperor

309
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,740
and so that you can ignore my feelings?

310
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,260
Do you think you're a hero

311
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,180
for saving me

312
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:50,180
when I'm in danger?

313
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,180
I...

314
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:56,780
Everyone,

315
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:57,820
[Zhuque Gate]
calm down!

316
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:00,300
His Majesty has heard your thoughts.

317
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:01,300
Rest assured,

318
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,700
His Majesty will give you

319
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,260
a satisfying answer.

320
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,620
No!

321
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:08,380
We want to see His Majesty now!

322
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:09,780
The people from Xiyue

323
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:11,580
barged into my shop

324
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,820
and robbed me of my antiques!

325
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,700
Consider yourself lucky!

326
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:19,780
They broke into my house,

327
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,900
saying they were looking for someone.

328
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:24,860
And then, they took my dear Fucai!

329
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,300
My Fucai!

330
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,540
It's been my pet for over ten years!

331
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,660
The people from Xiyue claimed

332
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,820
they could walk freely in the capital

333
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,860
because His Majesty gave them permission.

334
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,100
Look at what happened!

335
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,700
They broke into my house

336
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,860
and didn't even flush after using the toilet!

337
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:42,980
I understand your frustrations.

338
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,060
Stop pushing!

339
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,300
You can't go in there!

450
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,100
Your Majesty.

451
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,500
Aren't you worried
His Majesty might never apologize?

452
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:06,420
I am worried.

453
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,620
But you're keeping him outside.

454
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,740
Does it matter?

455
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,500
My worry is my own,

456
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,300
but he should apologize for what he did.

457
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:15,860
But...

458
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:17,740
Ask away

459
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:18,860
and speak your mind.

460
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,020
I'm not going to punish you.

461
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:23,700
Your Majesty.

462
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:27,580
You and His Majesty
have feelings for each other,

463
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,660
but His Majesty

464
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,740
is still who he is in the end.

465
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,260
What do you mean?

466
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,020
I mean,

467
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:37,140
whatever the case is,

468
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,500
he is the ruler of this land.

469
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,820
He rules the people.

470
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,660
He's the most prestigious person in the world.

471
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:45,580
How can he apologize to another person?

472
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:46,740
Am I right?

473
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:50,540
Even if he rules the empire,

474
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,820
he is still a human being.

475
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:52,740
He still

476
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,260
eats, sleeps, and poos like the rest of us.

477
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,460
We can apologize,

478
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,460
why can't he do the same?

479
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,620
Anyway, he is in the wrong.

480
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:00,340
Everyone must

481
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,460
apologize for their mistakes.

482
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:02,380
Eat up.

483
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,900
That makes sense.

484
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:08,580
Try it out.

485
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:13,140
I ate so much just now
and the dress feels tight.

486
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:14,580
Your Majesty.

487
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:16,420
The dress seems breezy.

488
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:17,580
I know.

489
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,260
I find it breezy as well.

490
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,940
I wish I could wear this every day.

491
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:28,660
Why are you running away?

492
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,820
I can't go anywhere with you in the way.

493
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,060
I'm only blocking your way

494
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,100
because you wouldn't see me.

495
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,140
Fine, block all you want.

496
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,220
Just get down to business.

497
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:38,540
Fine. You want me to say it.

498
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:39,460
Talk.

499
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,380
What were those letters about?

500
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,620
What letters?

501
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:45,260
The letters you and Yu Changya
wrote to each other.

502
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,140
Do the letters matter?

503
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,380
Of course they matter.

504
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,380
Yu Changya wrote you those letters.

505
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:51,980
This proves that he likes you.

506
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:53,260
That means...

507
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:54,140
What is it?

508
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,020
It means you like him.

509
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:00,740
Say that again.

510
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:06,020
It means you're a little...

511
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:08,260
I dare you to say that again.

512
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,620
Fine, maybe you don't like him that much.

513
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,260
Speak nicely.

514
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:17,420
I'm the one questioning you.

515
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,540
What is going on?

516
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:21,780
Where are you going?

517
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:22,940
Writing letters.

518
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:24,060
I'm going to

519
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:26,180
fill the Xiangluo Hall with letters.

520
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:31,420
Yunzhang?

521
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:33,780
Yunzhang?

522
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:38,340
Yunzhang?

523
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:40,300
Are you still mad at Yu Changya?

524
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:42,860
Don't bring that up.

525
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,300
Is it because of the letters?

526
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:46,180
Your Highness,

527
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:48,300
let's not bring up unpleasant topics.

528
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:49,500
Did I say something wrong?

529
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,420
Should I not be upset?

530
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:00,940
Yu Changya convets my queen.

531
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,900
He even addresses her by her name!

532
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:05,820
"Jinfeng."

533
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:07,140
He's not fit to say her name!

534
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,700
I should teach him a lesson.

535
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,780
I risked my life

536
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,060
and saved Jinfeng.

537
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:17,460
She didn't even show the slightest gratitude.

538
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:21,020
The worst of it all,

539
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:22,740
I don't understand

540
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:24,580
why there were so many letters!

541
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:27,100
Yunzhang, calm down.

542
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,620
I think you're totally right.

543
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:29,220
I know!

544
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,060
Don't you think

545
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:31,380
she should apologize to me?

546
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,620
It's not that serious.

547
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:34,620
What do you mean?

548
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:37,340
You know how stubborn she is.

549
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:38,620
Don't take it so seriously.

550
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:40,620
Does it matter who's in the wrong?

551
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:41,540
What about the letters?

552
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:43,180
Should I forget this?

553
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,300
Yunzhang,

554
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:47,020
don't you get it?

555
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,420
What can you do about these letters?

556
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,380
Nothing.

557
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:52,140
Are you going to stay mad at her

558
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,380
because of the letters?

559
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:54,860
As a couple,

560
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:55,900
none of these should matter.

561
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:58,100
What matters is that both of you are happy.

562
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,020
Am I right?

563
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:02,020
When did you become a relationship advisor?

564
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:02,540
Yunzhang,

565
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:03,980
that is exactly why I came.

566
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,220
This is

567
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,580
the most popular novel nowadays.

This is the fifth edition.

Rumor has it,

572

reading this book

573
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,460

into the greatest master of love.

575
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,500
What is this nonsense?

576
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,220
Get rid of it.

577
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:20,740
You don't have to read it.

578
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:21,620
I'll read it.

579
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,420
It's just an apology.

580
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,780
I can use some practice.

581
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:26,020
I'll apologize on your behalf.

582
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,700
You?

583
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:28,460
Yunzhang,

584
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,060
wait and see.

585
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:39,660
Who is it so early in the morning?

586

Your Majesty!

alluring and mesmerizing.

592
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,940
China roses for the beauty.

593
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:58,740
The beauty is you.

594
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,580
Sufang, take it.

595

Come, it's time for breakfast.

his queen is adorable and lovely.

An adorable gigot for the adorable beauty.

601
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,220
That's enough.

602
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,100
Sufang, take it.

603
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:29,980
Let's eat the gigot.

604

Star in the sky...

612

Why do I find those lines

613
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:52,940
so familiar?

614
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,780
What are they doing?

is touched too.

apologized to anyone in his entire life?

642
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:29,660
Why are you crying, Sufang?

643

His Majesty's effort was so touching!

do you forgive His Majesty?

I didn't want it to be touching.

I just wanted an apology.

This is what men are like.

652

They know what you want,

653

but they want to save face.

654

I get it now.

It's my mistake.

That's right, Your Majesty.

658
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:06,300
Look,

659
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:08,380
he is the Emperor.

660
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:09,820
Given the effort he's put in,

661
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:12,140
I'd consider it impressive.

662
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:14,020
I should talk to him.

Sir.

667
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:30,980

at the palace entrance to appease the people.

669

Understood.

670

Don't you want to know what His Majesty wrote?

671

Don't bother.

672
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,060
Nothing he writes will help.

673
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,340
Are the people still protesting?

674
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:45,860
It got worse.

675

Good.

676

00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:55,420
the Muyan Palace has been unsealed.

681
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:56,620
Good.

682
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:00,620
Grand Chancellor,

683
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:03,620
I think something is fishy
about the Muyan Palace.

684
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:04,620
Why did you unseal it?

685
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:07,420
We can't keep investigating unless we do.

686
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:09,700
A wise move, Grand Chancellor.

687
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:11,620
By the way,

688
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,500
keep your eyes on Xiyue Empire's movements.

689
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:15,220
Yes.

690
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:17,380
The old guy is probably losing his patience.

691
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:18,620
Yes.

692
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:21,420
Dismissed.

693
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,060
Yes.

694
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:31,020
A storm is coming.

695
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:35,140
Your Majesty,

696
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:36,620
[Xuanchen Hall]
the notice has been posted,

697
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:37,860
but it's not working at all.

698
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:39,220
They tear it down as soon as we post it.

699
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,620
They are putting up a fight.

700
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:42,180
Your Majesty,

701
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:43,340
perhaps

702
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,740
I should post it again

703
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:45,780
and have someone guarding it.

704
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,100
Never mind.

705
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:57,860
Yunzhang!

706
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:00,340
Why are you here?

707
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:01,420
Why can't I be here?

708
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:02,380
Shuan,

709
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:03,660
leave us be.

710
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:04,340
Yes.

711
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:09,140
(Yunchong's plan actually worked.)

712
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:10,860
(She's been dealt with.)

713
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:12,860
Do you know why I'm here?

714
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,420
Because of my sincerity.

715
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,340
You're not as dense as I think.

716
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,500
Are you still mad at me?

717
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:18,860
Have I been mad at you?

718
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,260
How is your mood?

719
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,700
I've always been in a great mood.

720
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:22,860
I'm glad to hear that.

721
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:24,100
But you still owe me an apology.

722
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:26,380
What apology?

723
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:28,820
I knew you wouldn't get it.

724
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:29,580
Sufang.

725
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:33,020
What is this?

726
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:35,820
You and I

727
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,580
need to discuss this matter.

728
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:43,380
[Muyan Palace]

729
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,340
Well done.

730
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,220
You went into the Muyan Palace

731
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:50,060
and saved my mother without telling me.

732
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:51,620
Don't mention it.

733
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:52,420
Wrong.

734
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:54,140
That is absolutely wrong.

735
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:55,820
We are a couple.

736
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:57,020
A couple should set aside

737
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:58,260
individual heroism.

738
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,380
We should discuss

739
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:00,500
and help each other.

740
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,020
Who gave you the right to act on your own?

741
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:11,140
In this picture, you risk your life

742
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:12,340
to save me.

743
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,220
I look cool, right?

744
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:14,700
You look like a fool!

745
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,180
What if you got hurt?

746
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:17,180
Wouldn't I be sad?

747
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:17,900
What if you got killed?

748
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,340
I would become a widow.

749
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,020
Look at Yu Changya.

750
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:23,340
He is smart to stand there and wait.

751
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,420
Before you protect someone,

752
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:26,180
you should protect yourself.

753
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,620
He was right not to save you?

754
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,860
You're favoring him. But why?

755
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:32,860
We'll discuss that now.

756
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:38,860
You and Yu Changya are in a fight.

757
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:39,700
I won.

758
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:40,620
Childish.

759
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:41,860
Extremely childish.

760
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:44,140
He and I met in Xianpa Village.

761
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:45,820
He pesters me and wants
to give me plastic surgery.

762
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:47,380
He will not relent until he marries me.

763
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:48,940
But does it matter?

764
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:51,340
Don't you know who has my heart?

765
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:54,060
You should have

766
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:55,660
explained it to me.

767
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:57,660
Your Majesty,

768
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,100
did you forget what you said?

769
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,180
When I was about to explain

770
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,060
our relationship,

771
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:02,260
you told me, "never mind."

772
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:03,980
When did that happen?

773
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,180
Your Majesty, hear me out.

774
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:09,580
What you heard...

775
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:10,620
Never mind.

776
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:11,460
No!

777
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:12,620
I must explain myself.

778
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:14,380
What is there to explain?

779
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:15,420
I know everything.

780
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:20,180
You said you knew everything.

781
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:21,700
I thought you actually knew it.

782
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:24,540
That was because you and Yu Changya were...

783
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:25,540
Fine.

784
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:27,500
Even if you pretended to know,

785
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,140
you could have asked me

786
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:30,940
if you had doubts
about our relationship, not him.

787
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:31,620
What's wrong?

788
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:32,780
Is he more handsome, more important,

789
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,020
or perhaps more reliable?

790
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:35,940
What are you talking about?

791
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:38,060
Your mistake is beating around the bush

792
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:38,900
and not being more direct.

793
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,300
Your jealousy got the better of you

794
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:41,940
and you were too full of yourself.

795
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:44,940
(Yunchong was wrong.)

796
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:46,380
(I feel like she is right)

797
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:47,740
(to be so mad.)

798
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:50,340
Now you know what you did wrong.

799
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:51,580
Apologize.

800
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:54,780
Well...

801
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,540
Your Majesty!

802
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:01,500
Your Majesty! Bad news!

803
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:02,660
The imperial physician...

804
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:03,620
What's wrong?

805
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:05,340
He's been possessed!

806
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:16,980
Yu Changya, what are you doing?

807
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:24,060
Your Majesty,

808
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:26,940
I'm brewing medicine for you.

809
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:28,420
Do you have to do it

810
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:29,620
up there?

811
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:30,860
Your Majesty.

812
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,100
This is not your ordinary medicine.

813
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:36,860
It's called the Royal Beauty Pill.

814
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:39,260
It has the essence of heaven and earth.

815
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:43,020
The medicine is made just for you.

816
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:45,620
Why would I need medicine?

817
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:49,580
I want to apologize to you.

818
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,500
-Why are you apologizing?
-Why are you apologizing?

819
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:55,140
A few days ago, my recklessness

820
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:56,620
caused some misunderstanding

821
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:58,100
between you and His Majesty.

822
00:35:58,620 --> 00:35:59,860
It was my mistake.

823
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:03,060
I am brewing this medicine for you.

824
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:06,900
What happened here?

825
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,100
Mother...

826
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:33,140
Mother.

827
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:34,260
Are you all right?

828
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:34,820
I'm fine.

829
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:42,340
Thank you for catching the vessel, Your Majesty.

830
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,260
Don't mention it.

831
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:54,260
Oh, no.

832
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:57,460
I didn't brew the medicine

833
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:58,340
long enough.

834
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:00,620
Your Majesty can have it another day.

835
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:02,140
What is this monkey business?

836
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:04,100
Your Majesty.

837
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:05,460
As I said,

838
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:07,620
I must apologize to Her Majesty.

839
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:12,900
Your Majesty.

840
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:13,980
I made a mistake.

841
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:16,260
I am sorry.

842
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:17,260
All right.

843
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:18,260
I'm already pretty,

844
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:19,540
I don't need your beauty pill.

845
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:20,980
I'm glad you've learned from your mistake.

846
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:21,620
All right,

847
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:22,780
dismissed.

848
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,380
Empress Dowager, everything is fine.

849
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:26,140
I'm glad it is.

850
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:37,500
Mother,

851
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,260
I must get going.

852
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,580
I have work to see to.

853
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:09,660
What are you writing?

854
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:17,820
[The Search for Love Part 2]

855
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:20,380
The Search for Love?

856
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,420
You're writing the Search for Love?

857
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:24,620
You've read it?

858
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:26,060
Of course!

859
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:27,500
I'm the biggest fan!

860
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:28,500
But...

861
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:29,620
You wrote this?

862
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:31,020
Really?

863
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:32,820
Can you tell me

864
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:34,620
if the female lead is in love with the male lead

865
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:35,420
or the second male lead?

866
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:36,620
Who is her father anyway?

867
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:37,860
I don't get it at all!

868
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:38,940
She has an ex-boyfriend.

869
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,100
The guy died.

870
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,900
Is he faking his death or not?

871
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,620
I think he's faking it to lie to her.

872
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:46,020
My goodness, how do you know so much?

873
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,340
Are you still reading it?

874
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:48,500
I don't just read it,

875
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:49,300
look!

876
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:50,300
I carry them with me.

877
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:51,620
I read them when I feel bored.

878
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:54,380
What is in the next chapter?

879
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:58,140
The male lead upsets the female lead.

880
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:58,740
I knew it!

881
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:00,420
I knew he was problematic.

882
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:02,020
He's too paranoid.

883
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:02,980
He'll get himself into trouble!

884
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,380
I think

885
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:05,940
the second male lead is cute.

886
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:07,740
You think the male lead is weird too?

887
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:08,300
Yes.

888
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:10,380
I must make the male lead

889
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:12,420
apologize to the female lead.

890
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:13,740
Yes, he must!

891
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:14,780
But I think

892
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:16,300
the female lead shouldn't forgive him so easily.

893
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:17,420
This is how it should go.

894
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:19,620
"What do you want?"

895
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,340
"I'm here to apologize."

896
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:23,300
"I won't accept your apology."

897
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:25,220
"I really mean it."

898
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:27,060
"I'm not listening! I'm not listening!"
