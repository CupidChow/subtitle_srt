500
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,780
You told me that it is a formula?

501
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:21,540
Yes.

502
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:23,420
It's a beauty formula.

503
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,540
I don't understand Liu Xie.

504
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:26,860
There are so many other good things.

505
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:28,940
But why does he want that beauty formula?

506
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:33,300
Maybe your father wants
to preserve his youthful looks?

507
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:35,820
That's right.

508
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,860
That devil

509
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:38,980
must have wanted to preserve his youthful looks

510
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,260
so that he can keep on seducing my mother.

511
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,060
How can I find it?

512
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:44,900
Actually, we can work together.

513
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:45,740
Work together?

514
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:46,740
You are not that kind.

515
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:47,780
I'm not.

516
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:48,940
But I'm doing it for selfish reasons.

517
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:50,260
That, I can understand.

518
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:51,220
What are your selfish reasons?

519
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:53,100
After we found it, I want to make a copy of it.

520
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:56,020
After all, it's related to my profession.

521
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:57,780
I can understand that.

522
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:59,500
How can we find it then?

523
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,020
I need fewer guards in the palace

524
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,580
so that I can search through the palace.

525
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,300
If I remember it correctly,

526
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:06,260
there'll be a wedding
between Senior General Ling's family

527
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:08,180
and Grand Tutor Wei's family in two days.

528
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,140
You'll attend it with His Majesty.

529
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,620
It'll be best if you can convince His Majesty

530
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:13,380
to bring more guards with him.

531
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:14,580
That's simple.

532
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:16,220
Because I'm going to attend it with him anyway.

533
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:20,900
So, is that an agreement?

534
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:21,660
Yes.

535
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:22,860
I'll get going now.

536
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:33,220
Jinfeng.

537
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,980
Are you here to change your dressing?

538
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,100
Isn't it too early for that?

539
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:40,700
No.

540
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,940
I have something to tell you personally.

541
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:44,260
Go ahead.

542
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,020
From today onward,

543
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,780
you should just let Shuan

544
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,220
apply the medicine for me.

545
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:50,700
Why?

546
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,940
I understand now. I know.

547
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,060
You know?

548
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:57,940
Of course.

549
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,540
Shuan must have complained
that I didn't do a good job.

550
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:02,380
Last time, he already complained that I was being

551
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:03,340
too messy.

552
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,340
That's not the reason.

553
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,020
What's the reason then?

554
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:09,700
The reason behind this assassination

555
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,900
is that someone is jealous of our love.

556
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,620
That's why they did it.

557
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,300
If we continue

558
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,780
to show our affection for each other,

559
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,860
there'll be more hatred toward us.

560
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:20,260
When that happens...

561
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,820
When that happens, I'll protect you.

562
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:24,180
What if you are their target?

563
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:25,300
Are you foolish?

564
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,700
Then, you can block the attack for me again

565
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:28,940
just like what you did.

566
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:39,940
Actually, we don't have to
show our affection for each other.

our ceremony today with your presence.

just want to thank you
for your contributions to Donghao Empire.

It's only right for us
to congratulate you in person.

Have you seen him before?

Do you know her before this?

So, you'll be meeting each other

for the first time?

603
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,140
They are meeting each other for the first time.

604
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:08,700
Your Majesty.

605

Your Majesty.

606
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:12,260
It's only right for the parents

607

to arrange a marriage

Your Majesty.

610
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:18,300
We made this marriage agreement
when they were still kids.

611
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,540
No. I just want to say

612
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:22,860
that I didn't meet His Majesty
until we were married too.

613
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,660
So, it'll be amazing for you two as well.

614
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:28,780
Yes.

615
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:38,420
(Is it really here as stated in the note?)

616
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:41,260

This is good enough.

619

I have a gift for the bride.

620
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,060
It's too much.

621
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:55,940
Your Majesties have given us

622
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:57,380
so many gifts.

623
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:58,700
Those are from the Queen.

624
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,060
This is from me, Liu Jinfeng.

625
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:03,980
Your Majesty.

626
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:04,540
No need to kneel.

627
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:05,980
I'm Liu Jinfeng now.

628
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,300
My gift for you

629
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,500
is a wish.

630
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,300
If you need my help after this,

631
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,540
you can come to me.

632
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:14,220
Especially when he bullies you.

633
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:14,860
Let me tell you.

634
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:16,060
I'm very good at teaching evil people a lesson.

635
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,060
I won't do that, Your Majesty.

636
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:18,780
You better don't.

637
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:20,340
Remember to come to me.

638
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,580
Why aren't you saying anything?

639
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,940
You are really generous to others.

640
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,540
But you are so petty towards me.

641
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:41,220
I'm not.

642
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:42,740
You gave the bride a wish.

643
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:43,780
Why didn't you give me one?

644
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,580

645

There's nothing that you can't do.

646
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:49,380
Who told you that an emperor
can do whatever he likes?

647
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:51,220
Fine.

648
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:52,580
I'll give you a wish you.

649
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:53,300
What do you want?

Then, I hope

00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:03,500
that all of my wishes can be fulfilled.
