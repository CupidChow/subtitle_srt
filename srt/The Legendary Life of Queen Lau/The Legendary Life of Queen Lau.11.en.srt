even if I give them all to you, Your Majesty.

What did he mean by that?

168
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,880
Is he showing off

169
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:52,200
that he has amassed great wealth?

170
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:52,919
Don't worry.

171

He behaved so insolently.

172

His Majesty will punish him severely.

173
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,239
If he gets even unruly, just have his head.

Thank you for your generosity.

All these are good items.

Won't it be a pity

if you don't want them?

179
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:12,840
I only want one thing.

180
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,880
Something that was originally mine.

181
00:10:16,359 --> 00:10:17,919
I wonder if you're willing to give it to me.

From today on, I shall ever obey you.

I may not be able to do it today.

I shall wait for next year.

I'll never give up.

Aren't you afraid

that I never intend

to let you live until that day?

not to have any ideas about him.

I'm not going to bring contempt to myself.

330

How about just giving up

331

and living happily

332
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:08,760
like Her Majesty the Queen?

333
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,439
Like her?

334
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,959
She stays at the Cold Palace.

335
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:15,199
What's so happy about that?

336
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,920
The maidservants said

337
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,359
it's lively at the Western Cold Palace.

338
00:17:19,719 --> 00:17:21,680
Her Majesty has so many interesting ideas.

339
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,800
What's the use of having many interesting ideas?

340
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:26,640
Father dotes on her

341
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,680
and lets her be the Queen.
But she took it for granted.

342
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,000
If it were me...

343
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,439
What would you do if it were you?

344
00:17:36,239 --> 00:17:37,280
I have no idea either.

345
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,479
In any case, I'd obey Father.

346
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,479
You are such an amazing lady.

347
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,079
Whenever I see you standing

348
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:53,640
together with the Queen,

349
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:56,000
I always have the wrong impression,

350
00:17:56,199 --> 00:17:57,599
thinking that you are the Queen instead.

351
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:02,319
After all, when it comes
to appearance and upbringing,

352
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,319
you are more fitting

353
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:06,439
as the motherly model of the nation.

354
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:09,079
The Queen has arrived!

355
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:14,560
Your Majesty, why are you here?

356
00:18:14,959 --> 00:18:16,000
Could it be that His Majesty...

357
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,760
Why?

358
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:18,439
Why can't I return?

359
00:18:18,439 --> 00:18:19,959
This is my Xiangluo Hall.

360
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,199
Or...

361
00:18:21,199 --> 00:18:22,959
do you not want me to return at all?

362
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,760
I was...

363
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,719
Did anything happen?

364
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:31,319
Yes, Baiyu.

365
00:18:31,439 --> 00:18:32,959
When I wasn't around,

366
00:18:32,959 --> 00:18:34,839
you sure did a lot of things.

367
00:18:38,959 --> 00:18:41,199
I don't understand what you're saying.

368
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:43,640
Baiyu,

369
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,400
do you have feelings for His Majesty

370
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,520
and intend to be the Queen?

371
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,479
No, not at all.

372
00:18:50,959 --> 00:18:52,199
Why would I?

373
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,680
That's impossible.

374
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,719
Impossible.

375
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,479
Sufang.

376
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,560
Her Majesty and I saw

377
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,439
how you tried to seduce His Majesty.

378
00:18:59,439 --> 00:19:00,439
You can't deny that.

379
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:07,719
Young Lady,

380
00:19:07,719 --> 00:19:09,000
just tell Her Majesty

381
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,560
that you've given up on His Majesty.

382
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:13,760
What are you saying?

383
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,280
That's right.

384
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,199
I do fancy His Majesty.

385
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,119
Besides, I think I'm more suitable

386
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,800
to be the Queen than you.

387
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,359
How dare you...

388
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,560
Your Majesty, she actually admitted it.

389
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,000
So now we know.

390
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,000
Since this is the case,

391
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,760
Xiangluo Hall has no place for you

392
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,719
if you want to keep staying in the palace.

393
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,800
To the Cold Palace, you go.

394
00:19:55,199 --> 00:19:55,719
You...

395
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,680
Do you find it unbelievable?

396
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,239
Baiyu, haven't you heard

397
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,640
that women who went to the Cold Palace
cut ties with their pasts

398
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,920
to be born again.

399
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:09,000
They'll return for a payback.

400
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,520
But don't worry.

401
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,880
I've already renovated the Cold Palace.

402
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:15,880
Are you surprised?

403
00:20:16,479 --> 00:20:17,280
Is it unexpected?

404
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,160
Your Majesty.

405
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,119
Young Lady...

406
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:22,199
Young Lady doesn't like His Majesty at all.

407
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,239
She was speaking nonsense.

408
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,439
Please show us mercy.

409
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:27,280
Have mercy on us.

410
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,000
Fengyue, get up.

411
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:29,959
No need to beg her.

412
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,680
It's just the Cold Palace.

413
00:20:33,239 --> 00:20:33,800
Let's go.

414
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,439
I'll go.

415
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,199
Your Majesty,

416
00:20:42,439 --> 00:20:44,119
are you sure you want to do this?

417
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:45,040
What else can I do?

418
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:46,719
Didn't you see what happened tonight?

419
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:48,560
It was such a great barbecue gathering.

420
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,800
It ended just like that.

421
00:20:51,199 --> 00:20:52,239
In any case, there's no turning back now.

422
00:20:52,239 --> 00:20:53,199
We'll just settle it like this for now.

423
00:21:02,199 --> 00:21:02,800
Your Majesty,

424
00:21:03,479 --> 00:21:04,920
why are you taking out all these books?

425
00:21:05,479 --> 00:21:06,719
Tie, you're so forgetful.

426
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,119
You saw how His Majesty

427
00:21:08,239 --> 00:21:09,920
angrily denounced Liu Xie just now.

428
00:21:10,959 --> 00:21:13,359
He made Liu Xie agree in just a few words.

429
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,719
As long His Majesty ranks in the top three
in the imperial examination,

430
00:21:15,719 --> 00:21:16,560
he'll pass the reins to His Majesty.

431
00:21:17,479 --> 00:21:18,439
Look how forgetful I am.

432
00:21:18,439 --> 00:21:19,040
Your Majesty,

433
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,400
eat more.

434
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,479
Your Majesty,

435
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,280
Liu Xie is a cunning man.

436
00:21:23,479 --> 00:21:25,160
Are you sure he won't go back on his words?

437
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,640
He agreed to crown me
during my coming-of-age ceremony

438
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,640
when I forced him.

439
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,560
So I have to accept his notion this time.

440
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,760
When I have ranked in the top three,

441
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,400
let's see what he has to say.

442
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,040
So I planned

443
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,359
to spend my time at the Imperial Academy

444
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,880
and the study at all times.

445
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,280
Yunzhang,

446
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,800
focus on your studies.

447
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,280
Leave Sister-in-law to us.

448
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,599
We'll make sure she doesn't pull any tricks.

449
00:21:51,239 --> 00:21:53,280
What does this have to do with the Queen?

450
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,160
You're such a fool.

451
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,920
This is Scorpion Liu's trick

452
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,040
to let the Queen be His Majesty's study companion.

453
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,760
Even if she does pull some tricks,

454
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,560
I won't be bothered by it.

455
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,280
Your Majesty, you're indeed wise!

456
00:22:08,959 --> 00:22:09,800
Your Majesty, bad news!

457
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,719
Something bad had happened.

458
00:22:10,719 --> 00:22:11,760
The Queen...

459
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,439
What?

460
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,400
Did she refuse to move out?

461
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,000
No, not that.

462
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,439
She moved back into Xiangluo Hall.

463
00:22:15,439 --> 00:22:17,000
But she banished Miss Baiyu

464
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,040
to the Cold Palace.

465
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:18,640
What?

466
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,959
That's not something Jinfeng would do.

467
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:23,760
Yunzhang,

468
00:22:23,959 --> 00:22:24,959
I heard

469
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:27,040
when a woman stays at the Western Cold Palace,

470
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,280
their temperament will change drastically.

471
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,520
It looks like it's not baseless at all.

472
00:22:31,239 --> 00:22:32,280
You must be careful.

473
00:22:32,959 --> 00:22:35,040
Did she think a small stick like this

474
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,400
would bother me?

475
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,680
Dream on.

476
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,040
Shuan,

477
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:41,880
don't bother relaying news like this to me
in the future.

478
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,719
I don't want to hear any of it.

479
00:22:45,719 --> 00:22:46,359
Yes, Your Majesty.

480
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,800
This place may look decent.

481
00:22:57,239 --> 00:22:58,719
But it's still the Cold Palace.

482
00:22:59,040 --> 00:22:59,719
Young Lady,

483
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,880
the Queen is too much.

484
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,880
Why don't we return
to the Grand Chancellor's Residence?

485
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,359
We can't.

486
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,719
Father told me to stay in the palace,

487
00:23:07,239 --> 00:23:08,160
so I can't go back.

488
00:23:08,479 --> 00:23:09,239
I can't leave.

489
00:23:14,199 --> 00:23:14,719
Fengyue,

490
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,560
what's going on?

491
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,239
I heard

492
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:20,800
many concubines and maidservants died
at the Cold Palace.

493
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,959
Could that be their spirits

494
00:23:22,959 --> 00:23:24,040
making all the noise?

495
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,880
Don't scare me!

496
00:23:30,199 --> 00:23:31,119
Feng... Fengyue,

497
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:32,199
go and check it out.

498
00:23:32,199 --> 00:23:33,319
-I'm scared.
-It's all right.

499
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:34,719
Go now.

500
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,959
Fengyue, leave.

501
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:04,880
Liu Baiyu.

502
00:24:05,439 --> 00:24:06,520
Why are you here at this late hour?

503
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:18,839
What...

504
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:20,079
What do you want to do?

505
00:24:20,479 --> 00:24:21,719
We're both Father's daughters.

506
00:24:21,719 --> 00:24:23,319
You better don't do anything reckless.

507
00:24:23,479 --> 00:24:25,319
I especially prepared this rat poison.

508
00:24:25,479 --> 00:24:26,239
Rat poison?

509
00:24:26,239 --> 00:24:27,079
Liu Baiyu,

510
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,920
you'll get what you wished for.

511
00:24:29,199 --> 00:24:30,839
You want to be the Queen, don't you?

512
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,680
I can help you fulfill your wish.

513
00:24:33,439 --> 00:24:34,680
The Queen?

514
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,359
Did you see

515
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:40,839
how scared you were just now?

516
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,119
This rat poison

517
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:43,760
is for the rats here.

518
00:24:43,959 --> 00:24:45,479
I was putting an act at Xiangluo Hall just now.

519
00:24:45,479 --> 00:24:46,560
You fell for it, didn't you?

520
00:24:46,959 --> 00:24:48,599
Others may see it as me oppressing you.

521
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:49,719
But the truth is I was supporting you.

522
00:24:49,719 --> 00:24:51,199
My goal

523
00:24:51,199 --> 00:24:52,800
is to help you gain sympathy and love from others.

524
00:24:55,439 --> 00:24:56,959
I'm sure you're putting an act now.

525
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:57,839
I won't believe you.

526
00:24:58,319 --> 00:24:59,640
I'm not lying to you now.

527
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:01,680
I'll just make it clearer.

528
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:03,079
I'll take today's incident, for example.

529
00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:04,479
I realized

530
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,560
that as long as I'm in the Imperial Palace,

531
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,319
I'll have no human rights and freedom.

532
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:09,560
I'll always be ordered about

533
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,920
by Liu Xie and Duan Yunzhang.

534
00:25:11,319 --> 00:25:12,199
So I've decided

535
00:25:12,199 --> 00:25:13,040
to fight back.

536
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,560
I'll make them fight among themselves

537
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,920
while I control my own fate.

538
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,239
I want those who want to stay to remain here,

539
00:25:17,239 --> 00:25:18,560
while those who want otherwise to go.

540
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,760
What do you mean?

541
00:25:21,479 --> 00:25:22,479
That means to let you stay here,

542
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:23,400
so I can leave.

543
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,719
Your method is too inefficient.

544
00:25:25,719 --> 00:25:26,760
I need to help you to speed it up.

545
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,719
The earlier you become the Queen,

546
00:25:28,719 --> 00:25:30,079
the sooner I can leave the palace.

547
00:25:31,479 --> 00:25:33,160
Are you serious

548
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,479
about helping me?

549
00:25:34,719 --> 00:25:36,439
Don't you like His Majesty at all?

550
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,599
How do I put this?

551
00:25:38,599 --> 00:25:40,280
Duan Yunzhang does have his strengths.

552
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,839
He's serious about being an emperor.

553
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,040
He's studious and not a fool.

554
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,599
He's also polite to the servants.

555
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,359
He is good-looking too.

556
00:25:50,199 --> 00:25:51,160
But what's the point of all these?

557
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,000
He prefers fine liquor and women,

558
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,599
while I prefer a simple life.

559
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:56,640
We're not fated to be together.

560
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,079
Why are you still hesitating?

561
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,199
You're just scared of Liu Xie, right?

562
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,880
In any case, Liu Xie only needs a daughter

563
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,800
to become the Queen.

564
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,040
There's no difference
if either one of us becomes one.

565
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,959
Besides, you're more obedient.

566
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,160
Are you serious?

567
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,199
As long as we join hands,

568
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,119
we will make it.

569
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:20,520
What should we do now?

570
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,119
No need to whisper. There's no one else here.

571
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,280
Oh, you're right.

572
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:28,079
We must have a plan first.

573
00:26:28,199 --> 00:26:29,160
When he shows up,

574
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,479
I'll slap you.

575
00:26:30,479 --> 00:26:31,599
After that, you'll go into his arms

576
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:32,640
and cry...

577
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:39,220
[Imperial Academy]

578
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:42,839
Greetings, Your Majesty.

579
00:26:44,439 --> 00:26:45,839
Can I get up now?

580
00:26:47,959 --> 00:26:48,719
Rise.

581
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,520
(She's behaving strangely today.)

582
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,160
What brings you two here?

583
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,520
We're also His Majesty's study companions.

584
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,160
Oh, it's your side job.

585
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:02,680
I won't let you snatch my position that easily.

586
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,479
These two may not have
good academic achievements,

587
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,239
but they're better than you

588
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,839
when it comes to literacy.

589
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,920
Yes, you're right.

590
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,599
I know we have a huge gap between us.

591
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,520
So to catch up with you,

592
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:19,920
I have a study companion too.

593
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:23,119
A study companion like you
have a study companion too?

594
00:27:30,839 --> 00:27:32,239
Greetings, Your Majesty.

595
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,079
What were you doing?

596
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:36,400
Why are you only here now?

597
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,239
Are you my study companion
or am I your study companion?

598
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,880
Why are you talking lasciviously?

599
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,319
Are you trying to seduce His Majesty?

600
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,119
I...

601
00:27:42,479 --> 00:27:43,880
(What are these two up to?)

602
00:27:44,479 --> 00:27:46,199
(Are they trying to disrupt my studies)

603
00:27:46,199 --> 00:27:47,239
(by delaying me with their disputes?)

604
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:50,000
(I'll never fall for that.)

605
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,599
Stop looking! Hold this!

606
00:27:59,199 --> 00:28:00,199
Wait, why is he...

607
00:28:00,199 --> 00:28:01,040
Remember this.

608
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,520
I'm now the jealous queen who's bullying you,

609
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,560
while you're the damsel
waiting for His Majesty to save you.

610
00:28:05,959 --> 00:28:06,839
Just wait and see.

611
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,319
His Majesty will take pity on you,

612
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:10,079
help you, and fall in love with you.

613
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,680
Let's go to class.

614
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,280
All right.

615
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,040
Hurry up, Baiyu!

616
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,479
Stop wasting time!

617
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:18,400
I'll get a seat for you.

618
00:28:18,959 --> 00:28:19,479
Let's go.

619
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,000
I...

620
00:28:25,479 --> 00:28:26,400
There's a rat!

621
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:27,839
Where is it?

622
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:28,640
Over there.

623
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:29,560
It ran away.

624
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,560
Baiyu,

625
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,040
you better study well

626
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,479
since you have got a nice spot.

627
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:37,680
Sister-in-law,

628
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:39,560
this is my seat.

629
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,680
Is your name written on it?

630
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:43,880
It's against the rules.

631
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,959
What rules?

632
00:28:46,439 --> 00:28:47,199
Liu Baiyu, you better get up.

633
00:28:47,199 --> 00:28:48,040
What are you doing?

634
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:48,920
You fox!

635
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,160
Who are you calling a fox?

636
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,640
She's here to disrupt Yunzhang's studies!

637
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,680
Can't she just sit here?

638
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,479
This seat doesn't have your name on it.

639
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,000
Stay away from here.

640
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,199
-But...
-Don't touch me!

641
00:28:56,199 --> 00:28:56,839
I must sit here.

642
00:28:56,839 --> 00:28:58,239
You're making a scene

643
00:28:58,239 --> 00:28:59,280
and disrupting His Majesty from studying.

644
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,239
I didn't do that.

645
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:01,719
Sister-in-law, I must sit here.

646
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,160
Just sit over there.

647
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,119
I'm here to help Yunzhang with his studies.

648
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:12,040
-Don't come any closer!
-No!

649
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:12,880
I'm here to help Yunzhang with his studies!

650
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,959
Why can't you sit there?
Is this seat made of gold?

651
00:29:13,959 --> 00:29:15,400
I'm really here to help Yunzhang with his studies!

652
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,199
Enough talking!

653
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,160
Your Highness!

654
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,800
Who is fighting here?

655
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,000
Grand Tutor Wei.

656
00:29:26,439 --> 00:29:27,000
She...

657
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,599
Your Majesty.

658
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,199
As the Queen of the nation

659
00:29:32,199 --> 00:29:33,079
and a woman of nobility,

660
00:29:33,079 --> 00:29:34,439
how can you openly bully the prince

661
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:35,640
in the academy?

662
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,599
Moreover,

663
00:29:36,959 --> 00:29:38,880
he's your brother-in-law.

664
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:40,400
That's not what happened, Grand Tutor Wei.

665
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,119
Let me explain.

666
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:42,599
It's just a misunderstanding.

667
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:43,719
Explain what?

668
00:29:44,239 --> 00:29:45,880
Facts speak louder than words.

669
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,079
I've long heard

670
00:29:48,479 --> 00:29:50,760
that the Queen is ungrateful, eccentric,

671
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,880
and deviant.

672
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,719
I didn't believe it.

673
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:54,959
After seeing you today,

674
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,239
you're such a disappointment.

675
00:29:57,359 --> 00:29:58,959
I feel sorry and hurt for you.

676
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,959
Did you think I dare not punish you

677
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,000
because you're the Queen?

678
00:30:05,439 --> 00:30:05,959
No.

679
00:30:06,199 --> 00:30:08,239
You may be the Queen.

680
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,560
But

681
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:12,479
even if your father,
the Grand Chancellor, is here,

682
00:30:12,479 --> 00:30:14,359
he'll still have to give me some face.

683
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,599
It would be best if one mends their ways.

684
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:22,040
Put out your hand.

685
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,479
I won't admit it!

686
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,880
Even if I did something wrong,

687
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,719
it's all because I love His Majesty too much.

688
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,680
You love me too much?

689
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:32,880
I'll say it again.

690
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,400
Put out your hand.

691
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:39,439
Your Majesty,

692
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:42,040
I may not be partial to anyone in my duties.

693
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:43,280
I do know

694
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:46,000
the justification
that a pampered wife is a virtuous wife.

695
00:30:46,239 --> 00:30:49,560
So you'll have to bear the punishment

696
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:55,040
of having your palm being hit
on Her Majesty's behalf.

697
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,040
Thank you for coming to my rescue, Your Majesty.

698
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:03,920
Do it.

699
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,040
Yes, Your Majesty.

700
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,400
Stop hitting him!

701
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,400
Who are you?

702
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,359
Grand Tutor Wei,

703
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,760
I'm Her Majesty's study companion.

704
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,959
May I be bold to say this?

705
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,880
It is inappropriate

706
00:31:34,479 --> 00:31:35,119
for you to do this.

707
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,800
I can't believe a mere study companion

708
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,359
is trying to question me.

709
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,719
Please enlighten me, then.

710
00:31:40,959 --> 00:31:42,800
What was your original aspiration
as a grand tutor?

711
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:43,680
Original aspiration?

712
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,760
My original aspiration is based on,
"There'll be fire if you strike the stone,

713
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,560
and there'll be no smoke if you don't."

714
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:53,680
Since the Late Emperor
entrusted the Imperial Academy

715
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,760
to me

716
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:57,319
and bestowed me this Imperial Ruler,

717
00:31:58,199 --> 00:32:00,400
I shall not be unworthy of the Late Emperor.

718
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,680
I'll always use it

719
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,479
to beat you into shape

720
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:07,599
and help you have an upright and clear sight.

721
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:10,920
What an abusive way to help one
have an upright and clear sight.

722
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,959
Her Majesty is indeed wrong
to make a scene in the academy.

723
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,959
But you declared Her Majesty guilty

724
00:32:15,959 --> 00:32:18,719
entirely based on what you saw
without finding the cause.

725
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:21,079
May I be bold to ask if you have a clear sight?

726
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:23,880
You advised His Majesty to pamper his wife.

727
00:32:24,119 --> 00:32:26,359
But His Majesty and Her Majesty
are not getting along.

728
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,079
Yet, you let His Majesty take the punishment

729
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:31,239
on Her Majesty's behalf
just because you wish to do so.

730
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:34,160
May I be bold to ask again
if your conduct is upright?

731
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,280
"There'll be fire if you strike the stone,

732
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,439
and there'll be no smoke if you don't"

733
00:32:38,439 --> 00:32:40,680
is a metaphor used by Mr. Dongye

734
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,719
to advise students to study.

735
00:32:42,199 --> 00:32:44,040
What he's trying to express is

736
00:32:44,199 --> 00:32:45,560
that knowledge comes from learning.

737
00:32:45,719 --> 00:32:47,040
Knowledge doesn't come without effort.

738
00:32:47,479 --> 00:32:48,319
He's trying to emphasize

739
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:51,040
that one can only gain knowledge from studying.

740
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,640
One does not gain knowledge from beating.

741
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,880
Grand Tutor Wei,
you take its meaning out of context

742
00:32:58,079 --> 00:32:59,599
as a teacher at the palace.

743
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,439
Do you not do enough scholarly research?

744
00:33:04,959 --> 00:33:06,560
Who exactly are you?

745
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,640
I'm Liu Baiyu.

746
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,839
Apart from her study companion,

747
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,920
I'm also Her Majesty's elder sister.

748
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:15,000
Enough.

749
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,239
Grand Tutor Wei, punish me if you want.

750
00:33:17,439 --> 00:33:18,599
If you don't, let's start the class.

751
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:20,479
Stop wasting time.

752
00:33:20,479 --> 00:33:21,119
Your Majesty,

753
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:23,520
didn't you see how Baiyu helped you?

754
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,479
I didn't have to be punished.

755
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,040
It's all because of you.

756
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,199
It's all right.

757
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,160
Go back to your seats

758
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,400
and get back to study!

759
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:48,719
Here.

760
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,560
Sister-in-law,

761
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,079
where should I sit then?

762
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:55,160
You can sit anywhere you want.

763
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,479
Don't be seen.

764
00:34:07,479 --> 00:34:08,600
Don't let the Consort Dowager sees us.

765
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,280
All right.

766
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,159
Sister-in-law!

767
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:14,560
[Chonghua Hall]
Yunyan?

768
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,040
What brings you to Chonghua Hall?

769
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:17,760
I injured Yunchong

770
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,879
at the Imperial Academy during the day.

771
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:20,000
So I come to see how he's doing.

772
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:23,959
Yunyan!

773
00:34:23,959 --> 00:34:25,719
Please let me see Yunchong.

774
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:26,560
Huh? What?

775
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,320
Stop me from going in.

776
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:27,959
Yunzhang is here.

777
00:34:27,959 --> 00:34:28,719
Your brother.

778
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:30,760
No!

779
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,800
I will never let you get close

780
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,080
to Yunchong today!

781
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,239
(Why is she here?)

782
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,760
(Don't tell me she's waiting especially for me.)

783
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:40,760
Princess Yunyan,

784
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,159
just let me see him.

785
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:43,719
Liu Jinfeng,

786
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:45,600
I've misjudged you.

787
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:47,399
I never knew you could be this ruthless.

788
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,040
Not only did you banish your sister
to the Cold Palace,

789
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,719
but you also picked on my brother.

790
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,600
I will never give you the chance

791
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,760
to bully him again!

792
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:55,679
Yunyan,

793
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,280
do you really think I'm a ruthless person?

794
00:34:58,719 --> 00:34:59,879
Do you really think I wanted

795
00:34:59,879 --> 00:35:00,959
to send my sister to the Cold Palace?

796
00:35:01,439 --> 00:35:03,280
It's all your brother, the Emperor's fault.

797
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:04,879
(My fault?)

798
00:35:05,399 --> 00:35:06,120
(Why is it my fault?)

799
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,800
I hated Duan Yunzhang.

800
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:11,919
But when I see him and Baiyu
exchanging flirty glances at each other,

801
00:35:11,919 --> 00:35:12,879
I get so upset.

802
00:35:13,399 --> 00:35:14,320
I get jealous.

803
00:35:15,479 --> 00:35:17,239
I couldn't even control myself.

804
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:18,600
What else could I do?

805
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,399
(Don't tell me she really fell in love with me)

806
00:35:21,399 --> 00:35:22,760
(as she said at the Imperial Academy)

807
00:35:23,439 --> 00:35:24,320
(during the day?)

808
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:29,710
[Chonghua Hall]
Why are you causing a ruckus at this late hour?

809
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,840
You were punished on my behalf today.

810
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,239
Take these medicinal herbs.

811
00:35:36,159 --> 00:35:36,840
What?

812
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:37,959
Yunzhang,

813
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:39,919
you were punished in her stead?

814
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,199
No such thing.

815
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,320
Don't listen to her nonsense.

816
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,159
What evil thoughts are you thinking

817
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:47,600
for banishing your sister to the Cold Palace?

818
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,080
Did you just scold me?

819
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:54,000
You were all smiles with her

820
00:35:54,439 --> 00:35:55,639
but so fierce with me.

821
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,600
Could it be that you're feeling sorry for her?

822
00:36:00,479 --> 00:36:02,600
Could it be that you want
to go to the Cold Palace to see her?

823
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,120
Could it be that you'll change

824
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,120
the Western Cold Palace
to the Western Warm Palace?

825
00:36:07,439 --> 00:36:08,639
If you go and see her today,

826
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,439
I'll jump into this Taiyuan Pond.

827
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:11,639
I mean what I say.

828
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,560
I've sworn an oath

829
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,760
that you'll only love me in this life.

830
00:36:17,959 --> 00:36:20,360
You can never depose me or take in consorts.

831
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,879
(The Queen has lost her senses.)

832
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,600
(It looks like I have to believe)

833
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,360
(that I'm absolutely charming.)

834
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,959
(She may have resisted in many ways before,)

835
00:36:29,439 --> 00:36:30,879
(but she still fails to resist)

836
00:36:30,879 --> 00:36:32,000
(such a temptation.)

837
00:36:32,639 --> 00:36:34,639
(Now she's being irrational because of love.)

838
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,080
(How pitiful.)

839
00:36:36,959 --> 00:36:39,120
Taiyuan Pond is too shallow for you to die.

840
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,360
Are you a fool?

841
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,239
I'm going to visit Yunchong.

842
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,600
Yunyan, watch her

843
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,600
and don't let her wander off.

844
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:48,520
What does this mean?

845
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,479
(I behaved like a shrew just now.)

846
00:36:52,479 --> 00:36:53,600
(I was acting hysterically.)

847
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,120
(I'm sure he hates me a lot now.)

848
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,639
(Hurry and let me scare you away,)

849
00:36:56,639 --> 00:36:58,439
(so you'll go into the arms of Baiyu.)

850
00:37:02,479 --> 00:37:03,840
Your Highness, please endure.

851
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,439
Gently, please.

852
00:37:04,439 --> 00:37:05,520
Three. Two.

853
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,360
Oh, my.

854
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:10,439
Your Highness,

855
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:11,520
how do you feel now?

856
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:16,760
Are you all right now?

857
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:18,959
I can't believe it.

858
00:37:18,959 --> 00:37:19,560
I'm fine now.

859
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,000
You can leave now.

860
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:21,919
Yes, Your Highness.

861
00:37:21,919 --> 00:37:22,600
Remember.

862
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,120
Don't let my mother know about this.

863
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:25,840
Yes, Your Highness.

864
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,280
I shall take my leave now.

865
00:37:28,439 --> 00:37:29,080
Go.

866
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,639
It's all that jinx's fault.

867
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,439
She almost killed me.

868
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,520
Jinfeng is indeed rash and rude.

869
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:39,959
It's my fault.

870
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:41,239
Yunzhang,

871
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,760
I was talking about Liu Baiyu.

872
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:45,800
You see?

873
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,479
You're taking her side.

874
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,479
Liu Baiyu stood up for you

875
00:37:49,479 --> 00:37:51,120
at the Imperial Academy today

876
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,520
because she wanted to get on your good side.

877
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:53,639
Of course,

878
00:37:53,639 --> 00:37:55,399
Sister-in-law is behaving strangely lately.

879
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,280
She's becoming scarier.

880
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,040
Do you think I don't know all these?

881
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,879
But it's not their fault.

882
00:38:04,879 --> 00:38:06,639
I'm the one to blame.

883
00:38:08,439 --> 00:38:09,639
What does this have to do with you?

884
00:38:09,879 --> 00:38:10,959
How is it not related to me?

885
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,239
It's my fault for being too charming

886
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:17,120
that both women lost their rationality
because of me.

887
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:18,639
I should be blamed.

888
00:38:19,959 --> 00:38:20,560
Yunzhang,

889
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,120
is that a joke?

890
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,479
How is it a joke?

891
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,760
Didn't you see

892
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:27,879
how Jinfeng mistreated Liu Baiyu today?

893
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,120
Liu Baiyu may appear to be silently enduring it.

894
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,040
But you can see she has set her sights on me

895
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,560
and is prepared to seduce me at any time.

896
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,040
If this goes on,

897
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,520
how am I going to study

898
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,639
if a fight really breaks out between them?

899
00:38:41,239 --> 00:38:41,959
Yunchong,

900
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,919
I have a task for you.

901
00:38:44,439 --> 00:38:45,639
From tomorrow on,

902
00:38:45,959 --> 00:38:48,080
you'll be responsible
for keeping an eye on Liu Baiyu

903
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,120
to reduce her contact with the Queen.

904
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:50,959
While I

905
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,560
will be responsible
for reducing Jinfeng's anger

906
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,919
with my charm.

907
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,439
This will prevent the conflict

908
00:38:56,439 --> 00:38:57,760
between them from happening at the root.

909
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,040
Then we can create

910
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,760
a good learning environment.

911
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,639
Me?

912
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,040
Keep an eye on Liu Baiyu?

913
00:39:03,639 --> 00:39:04,560
No way.

914
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,239
Are you going

915
00:39:07,479 --> 00:39:08,639
to watch them torment me?

916
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,639
What if I get poor results in the examination?

917
00:39:14,399 --> 00:39:15,360
Fine.

918
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,120
I'll do my best for you.

919
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,320
That's more like it.

920
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,639
Liu Baiyu,

921
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,399
you better watch it.

922
00:39:32,479 --> 00:39:33,120
Shuan,

923
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:34,639
deliver my edict.

924
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,239
Say that I sympathize with the Queen
for renovating the Western Cold Palace.

925
00:39:39,159 --> 00:39:41,639
From now on, Western Cold Palace
will be changed to Western Warm Palace.

926
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:45,000
It'll be Liu Baiyu's temporary residence
in the palace.

927
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,120
Is there a meaning to this, Your Majesty?

928
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,840
Isn't it obvious enough?

929
00:39:49,879 --> 00:39:51,840
Liu Baiyu isn't one of my concubines.

930
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,600
She doesn't have the right
to stay at the Cold Palace.

931
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,879
If this gets out to those who don't know,

932
00:39:54,879 --> 00:39:56,760
they would think she's involved with me.

933
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,959
I don't want such a misunderstanding.

934
00:39:58,959 --> 00:40:01,120
If you change the name,

935
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,600
aren't you afraid Her Majesty might think

936
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,120
you're making advances on Miss Baiyu?

937
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,639
It's all right if she misunderstands.

938
00:40:06,959 --> 00:40:09,000
She'll be having a sleepless night

939
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,120
with her heart dissipating in the air.

940
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,080
When she finds out about this tomorrow,

941
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,639
she'll be extremely happy

942
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,439
and wild with joy.

943
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:16,639
Go now.

944
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,600
What did I tell you?

945
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:29,840
Men just won't admit it.

946
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,760
It was during the day
he treated you indifferently yesterday.

947
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:34,120
And he changed the name of the Cold Palace
on the same night.

948
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,239
You need to work harder today.

949
00:40:35,239 --> 00:40:36,639
You might conquer him.

950
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:37,760
Go.

951
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:44,760
Your Majesty,

952
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,120
thank you for changing the Western Cold Palace

953
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,360
to Western Warm Palace.

954
00:40:58,239 --> 00:40:58,919
Liu Baiyu,

955
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,520
you can just sit here.

956
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,360
Why? This isn't my seat.

957
00:41:03,439 --> 00:41:05,080
Do other seats have your name on them?

958
00:41:05,399 --> 00:41:06,360
It's against the rules.

959
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,600
What rules?

960
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,399
But that's...

961
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,679
