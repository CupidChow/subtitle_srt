Okay now.

124
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,279
I'll try shouting.

126

Hong from Jinxiu Palace

is secretly in love with Commander Su Jingtang.

137

There are more.

138
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:44,279
She even gave a handkerchief to him.

139
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,119
Now that I think about it, I'm already married.

140
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:49,440
Tang has also reached

141
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,880
the age to be in a relationship.

142
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,880
There are more here.

143
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:59,160
Shuan snores and drools when he sleeps.

144
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,160
I know that.

145

There are more here.

146

Yunyan likes to eat garlic.

147
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:11,959
She chews on flower petals every day
to freshen up her breath.

Yunyan?

149
00:07:12,679 --> 00:07:13,559
Yunyan.

150
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,119
Is this true?

151
00:07:15,119 --> 00:07:16,040
What's over there?

152
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:24,760
The new chef has to
sweep the floor as punishment

153
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,880
because his cooking is too bad?

154
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,600
You did that, right?

155
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:35,519
Your Majesty!

156
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:37,519
Your Majesty!

157
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:44,279
He's nowhere to be found.

158
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,160
His Majesty was here just now.

159
00:07:47,359 --> 00:07:49,239
Did he run away together with Her Majesty?

160
00:07:49,239 --> 00:07:50,079
Impossible!

161
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,839
His Majesty wouldn't leave me behind.

162
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,799
Why wouldn't he?

163
00:07:53,799 --> 00:07:55,239
Why would he?

164
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,079
-I'm His Majesty's favorite.
-I'm His Majesty's favorite.

165
00:07:58,079 --> 00:07:58,559
What proof do you have?

166
00:07:58,559 --> 00:07:59,239
Do you think you are that handsome?

167
00:07:59,239 --> 00:08:00,239
What proof do you have?

168
00:08:00,239 --> 00:08:00,720

336
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,479
What is Liu Baiyu doing lately?

337
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,159
I can't get used to her

338
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:05,599
not doing anything.

339
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,919
Lately, she has been asking me

340
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:10,400
to keep an eye on Her Majesty.

341
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,440
Her Majesty?

342
00:16:13,719 --> 00:16:14,960
Remember to inform me

343
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,400
if something happens.

344
00:16:17,359 --> 00:16:18,000
Yes, Your Highness.

345
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:24,960
Fengyue.

346
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,080
Why do you think

347
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:31,080
I'm doing this?

348
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:36,039
For His Majesty?

349
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:37,679
Yes.

350
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,960
Of course I'm doing this for Yunzhang.

351
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:43,159
Yunzhang and my sister-in-law are one.

352
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,599
If Liu Baiyu wants to do harm
to my sister-in-law,

353
00:16:45,599 --> 00:16:46,960
Yunzhang will be affected too.

354
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:48,280
Another thing,

355
00:16:48,719 --> 00:16:50,919
Liu Baiyu harbors ill intentions.

356
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:53,280
I don't want her to fall on the wrong path.

357
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,719
Anyway, I'm not doing this

358
00:16:55,719 --> 00:16:57,039
for myself.

359
00:16:57,679 --> 00:16:59,159
I don't have any feelings

360
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:00,280
for Liu Baiyu at all.

361
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,760
Understand?

362
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:04,919
Okay.

363
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:06,479
You can leave now if you understand.

364
00:17:22,719 --> 00:17:23,439
Chong.

365
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:25,920
Mother.

366
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,839
Why are you here?

367
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,800
Are you paying attention to Baiyu?

368
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,560
No.

369
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,199
Absolutely not.

370
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,119
I did it for Yunzhang and my sister-in-law.

371
00:17:35,239 --> 00:17:36,400
I'm doing this for the greater good.

372
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:38,599
Enough.

373
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,079
For the greater good?

374
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:41,319
You only know a few bombastic words.

375
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:42,520
And you keep using the same words.

376
00:17:42,959 --> 00:17:43,680
Mother.

377
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:50,959
Here.

378
00:17:52,439 --> 00:17:55,239
I just don't want you to misunderstand.

379
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:57,160
I won't misunderstand.

380
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,959
I just think

381
00:18:02,959 --> 00:18:04,920
that Baiyu is quite a nice lady.

382
00:18:05,239 --> 00:18:07,079
She's perfect.

383
00:18:08,239 --> 00:18:10,880
Don't you think that she is cunning?

384
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,839
Cunning?

385
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,160
That's good.

386
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,560
It means that she's smart.

387
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,239
Don't you think that she has a sharp tongue?

388
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,640
That's good too.

389
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,760
It means that she won't be bullied.

390
00:18:21,959 --> 00:18:23,199
Only a fool won't defend themselves.

391
00:18:23,959 --> 00:18:25,359
She's unreasonable too.

392
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,880
That's even better.

393
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,640
Or else, how can she handle you?

394
00:18:33,719 --> 00:18:34,640
Mother,

395
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,280
if you think

396
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:39,000
that all of Liu Baiyu's weaknesses
are her strength,

397
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,280
then, it's fine for me to like her?

398
00:18:41,439 --> 00:18:42,839
Of course it is.

399
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:43,439
Really?

400
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,760
I know my son best.

401
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,000
I won't misunderstand you, right?

402
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:52,800
No.

403
00:18:53,239 --> 00:18:53,880
Mother.

404
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,760
I didn't mean that.

405
00:18:56,119 --> 00:18:57,719
What I want to say is...

406
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,280
I...

407
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,959
Anyway, that's not what I meant.

408
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,800
Fine.

409
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,479
I won't believe you.

410
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,239
Why is he there?

411
00:20:19,959 --> 00:20:21,920
Why is he inside my story?

412
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:31,439
It should be like this.

413
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:39,260
[Capital]

414
00:20:49,479 --> 00:20:50,400
Don't throw away my vegetables.

415
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,520
-Don't throw away my vegetables.
-Old woman!

416
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:53,520
Are you going to pay
the protection racket today?

417
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,719
I haven't sold anything yet for today.

418
00:20:55,719 --> 00:20:56,800
-I beg you.
-Shut up!

419
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,560
I don't care.

420
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,479
-Destroy her stall!
-I beg you.

421
00:20:59,479 --> 00:21:00,719
Don't throw them away.

422
00:21:00,719 --> 00:21:01,479
What are you looking at?

423
00:21:01,479 --> 00:21:02,680
I beg you.

424
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,119
Well done!

425
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:11,040
Madam, are you okay?

426
00:21:11,239 --> 00:21:11,880
I'm fine.

427
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:13,280
Let me tell you.

428
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,359
With me here,

429
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:15,800
I won't allow you to bully the weak.

430
00:21:29,239 --> 00:21:30,000
What do you think?

431
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,040
It's me again.

432
00:21:31,959 --> 00:21:33,760
Why is it you again?

433
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,160
You...

434
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,040
You both...

435
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,359
(What do you think?)

436
00:21:56,359 --> 00:21:57,520
(It's me again.)

437
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:01,479
Liu Baiyu.

438
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,640
What's wrong with you? Wake up.

439
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,040
Why is it him again?

440
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,400
Yes.

441
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,880
I won't write it wrongly again this time.

442
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,000
Yunzhang!

443
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,199
Yunzhang. Yunzhang.

444
00:22:34,439 --> 00:22:35,239
Are you okay?

445
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,719
You should leave first.

446
00:22:37,719 --> 00:22:39,239
They'll catch up with us soon.

447
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,199
No.

448
00:22:40,199 --> 00:22:42,239
We promised to be with each other until the end.

449
00:22:42,239 --> 00:22:43,400
You can't die first.

450
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,680
What am I going to do if you die?

451
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,920
Having you in my life

452
00:22:49,239 --> 00:22:50,000
is already enough.

453
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,560
Yunzhang! Yunzhang!

454
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,560
Yunzhang.

455
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,479
I'm not dead. I'm alive again.

456
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,239
Why is it you again?

457
00:23:07,239 --> 00:23:08,160
Go away!

458
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,520
Why is it you again?

459
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,040
Why is it you again?

460
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,760
Go away!

461
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,000
Go away!

462
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:22,000
Go away!

463
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,560
You are not in my story.

464
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,040
You are not in my story!

465
00:23:34,439 --> 00:23:35,280
If you don't let me in again,

466
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,800
I'll kill those two guards.

467
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,160
Where are the two guards?

468
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,239
Xuan.

469
00:24:09,479 --> 00:24:10,920
I have something to tell you.

470
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,400
Tell me.

471
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,119
I've been here for a while already.

472
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,839
Although we didn't get along at first,

473
00:24:19,479 --> 00:24:21,959
overall, I had a good time here.

474
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:24,640
Before this, I thought that you had neither

475
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,640
literary nor military talents.

476
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,560
I thought that you were a weakling.

477
00:24:28,239 --> 00:24:30,000
This is what you thought about me before this?

478
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:31,520
Like I say, it's in the past.

479
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,760
It's different now.

480
00:24:33,199 --> 00:24:34,239
How is it different now?

481
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:35,119
Tell me.

482
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,880
Now, you've got the first place.

483
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,280
And you have taken over the court.

484
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,599
You even ran a dozen laps
around the imperial capital.

485
00:24:44,199 --> 00:24:45,359
Of course you are different now.

486
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,239
The food in the palace is really good.

487
00:24:49,239 --> 00:24:50,119
Eat more.

488
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,079
So...

489
00:24:55,079 --> 00:24:55,880
So what?

490
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,079
So, I've decided to give up.

491
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:02,079
Give up what?

492
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,079
The Imperial Palace is really nice.

493
00:25:04,599 --> 00:25:06,560
Every day that I've spent in the palace
has been joyous.

494
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:08,959
The food in the palace is good too.

495
00:25:09,719 --> 00:25:11,160
I really don't want to leave.

496
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,000
But I know that you hate me.

497
00:25:14,719 --> 00:25:16,040
I had bothered you with my theatrics

498
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,319
all this time.

499
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,400
I'm sorry.

500
00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:19,920
I'm at fault here.

501
00:25:20,479 --> 00:25:22,079
I've bothered you

502
00:25:22,239 --> 00:25:23,560
with my obsession and selfishness.

503

want to dance.

So, Her Majesty added another night class

so that those who can't dance
during the day can dance at night.

Because I'm not the emperor.

No wonder she had been training hard.

781
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:32,919
