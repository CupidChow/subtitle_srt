You shouldn't tire her out at night.

I agree.

54
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,839
It does look like a serious illness.

55
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,600
Give her a check-up.

69

70

that His Majesty has offended
the God of Culture and Literature.

89

I got it.

95

His Majesty must be faking it.

96
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,160
He wants to keep a low profile

97
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:00,959

no raiders-on-horse could ever
cross the Yin Mountain.

168
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,799
Really?

169
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:17,799
Let's find out.

170
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:23,260
[If the Winged General of Dragon City were there,
no raiders-on-horse could ever cross the Yin Mountain.]

171
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:24,040
Your Majesty.

172
00:07:24,239 --> 00:07:25,320
You were right.

173
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,959
That's amazing.

174
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,760
What was the phrase you always use

175
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,480
to compliment the Emperor?

176
00:07:33,559 --> 00:07:34,519
Your Majesty is wise.

177
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,119
Am I wiser than him now?

178
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,500
[If the Winged General of Dragon City were there,
no raiders-on-horse could ever cross the Yin Mountain.]

179
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,119
The old saying is right.

180
00:07:41,119 --> 00:07:43,679
To succeed, it has the be at the right time,
right place, and with the right person.

181
00:07:43,679 --> 00:07:45,359
I have the God of Culture and Literature
in the sky

182
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:47,079
and a Cuju field on the ground.

183
00:07:47,679 --> 00:07:48,880
And the right person...

184
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,040
She's right here.

185
00:07:58,839 --> 00:07:59,559
Baiyu.

186
00:07:59,559 --> 00:08:00,279
Come here.

187
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:00,959
You're here at the right time.

188
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:01,519
Come here.

189
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,320
-Can you do me a favor?
-Now?

190
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:02,880
Hurry up.

191
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,399
I'm in a hurry.

192
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:03,839
It'll only take you a while.

193
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,399
I'm in a hurry.

194
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:05,040
Just a while.

195
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,320
-Really...
-Just a while.

196
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:06,959
-A quick one.
-I'm in a hurry.

197
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:07,399
Just a short while.

198
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:09,040
All I need now is a teacher.

199
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,720
Look.

200
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,679
These are all the books I prepared.

201
00:08:11,679 --> 00:08:13,200
Explain all these to me.

202
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,440
I'm the best female shooter

203
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,600
in Xianpa Village.

204
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,600
This is a perfect plan.

205
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,600
You only need to memorize them.

206
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,880
There's nothing to explain.

207
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,959
Didn't Grand Mentor Wei say

208
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,519
that it's better to understand them
than to memorize them?

209
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:24,640
We should understand them,

210
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,959
instead of memorizing them.

211
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:26,720
Look at this one.

212
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,359
"The Master stood by the stream and said,

213
00:08:30,359 --> 00:08:32,040
'It passes on just like this,

214
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,320
all day and all night.'"

215
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,799
Which stream is this?

216
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:35,559
The Sichuan?

217
00:08:35,959 --> 00:08:36,959
And who is the Master

218
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:37,760
mentioned in the poem?

219
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,679
Is it a man or a woman?

220
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:41,600
All day and all night? Why?

221
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,359
Your Majesty.

222
00:08:42,359 --> 00:08:43,640
This is from the Analects of Confucius.

223
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,440
This is not something we can explain.

224
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,279
Everyone has a different version

225
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:48,839
of the Analects of Confucius.

226
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,079
How I understand it

227
00:08:50,079 --> 00:08:51,679
might not be how you understand it.

228
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:52,799
What I say

229
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:55,000
might not be accurate either.

230
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,119
There are different versions
of the Analects of Confucius?

231
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,040
I don't mean it literally.

232
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,880
You have to understand it yourself.

233
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,559
Understand it myself?

234
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,440
Fine. You can leave.

235
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,440
I will figure it out myself.

236
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,320
I'll get going.

237
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,080
Your Majesty.

238
00:09:16,239 --> 00:09:18,159
Why did you let her go?

239
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:20,679
There's no point keeping her around
if this isn't where she wants to be.

240
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,000
Let's continue.

241
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,559
I think

242
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,760
it's my showtime.

243
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:58,260
[Li Bai, Bring in the Wine]

244
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,240
[The accomplishment must bring total joy.]

245
00:09:59,241 --> 00:09:59,940
[Heaven made me, so I must be useful.]

246
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,679
The accomplishment must bring total joy.

247
00:10:03,719 --> 00:10:05,960
Do not allow an empty goblet to face the moon.

248
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,080
Heaven made me, so I must be useful.

249
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,640
I spend a thousand gold pieces,
but they'll return again.

250
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,159
Your Majesty.

251
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:13,799
You're right again!

252
00:10:15,479 --> 00:10:16,840
What do you think it means?

253
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,230
If Your Majesty doesn't know its meaning,

254
00:10:19,239 --> 00:10:21,039
how would I?

255
00:10:22,599 --> 00:10:23,960
We can't continue like this.

256
00:10:24,239 --> 00:10:26,000
I'm going to ruin my title as the prettiest face

257
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,840
in Xianpa Village.

258
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:27,719
Imagine

259
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,840
Grand Mentor Wei hitting my face with the ruler.

260
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,840
[Xiangluo Hall]
What is this supposed to mean?

261
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,640
Why didn't you ask me?

262
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,280
Yu Changya?

263
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:50,860
[The Analects of Confucius]

264
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:52,200
I got it.

265
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,760
Confucius said,

266
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,200
"When the Emperor is not benevolent,

267
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,280
he won't be able to protect the people.

268
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,559
When the scholar is not benevolent,

269
00:10:57,559 --> 00:10:58,520
he won't be able to protect his country.

270
00:10:58,719 --> 00:10:59,719
When the royal official is not benevolent,

271
00:10:59,719 --> 00:11:00,599
he won't be able to protect the temple.

272
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,479
When the civilian is not benevolent,

273
00:11:02,479 --> 00:11:03,520
he won't be able to protect his own body."

274
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,320
How about that?

275
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,640
Did I recite it correctly?

276
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:06,479
Idiot.

277
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,359
This is not from Confucius.

278
00:11:08,359 --> 00:11:10,039
It's obviously from Laozi.

279
00:11:10,599 --> 00:11:12,640
Are you trying to upset Laozi and Yunzhang?

280
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:15,440
This is from Han Fei.

281
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,479
Imagine him crawling out of his grave

282
00:11:17,479 --> 00:11:18,479
and tearing your mouth.

283
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,159
Shut up.

284
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,000
Your Majesty.

285
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,640
We have mentioned so many philosophers,

286
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,640
and none of them is the right answer.

287
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,000
Before the fight between the scholars
even starts,

288
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,719
they will already be dead
after hearing everything you bumpkins said.

289
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:33,719
Yunzhang.

290
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:35,280
Who wrote this?

291
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,200
How would I know?

292
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,640
If I knew, I wouldn't be sitting here with you.

293
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,440
Find the right answer now!

294
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,640
This is from Mencius'
Theory of Benevolent Government.

295
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,840
It means

296
00:11:48,239 --> 00:11:49,719
that the Emperor should rule the country
with benevolence.

297
00:11:49,719 --> 00:11:51,640
He should bring peace to the country
and the people

298
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,359
and make the dynasty prosperous.

299
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,080
Interesting.

300
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:12,559
Grand Mentor Wei said,

301
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:13,640
"One who is unaccountably solicitous

302
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,679
is hiding evil intentions."

303
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:15,280
Tell me.

304
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,080
Did Xuan send you here to ruin things for me?

305
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,239
With your current standard,

306
00:12:21,239 --> 00:12:23,520
do you think His Majesty needs
to ruin things for you?

307
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,640
(Baiyu is reluctant to stay here.)

308
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:29,440
(I still need to get someone else to help me.)

309
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,359
(After all, this annoying Yu
is quite a knowledgeable man.)

310
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:33,520
(Let's just keep him.)

311
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:35,000
(Even if he can't help me,)

312
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,440
(it's nice to steal
one of Duan Yunzhang's men too.)

313
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:42,840
Yu Changya.

314
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,200
You look really handsome today.

315
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:46,799
After all,

316
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:48,559
we grew up together, right?

317
00:12:49,479 --> 00:12:50,119
Although

318
00:12:50,119 --> 00:12:51,559
we had a tiny little misunderstanding
before this

319
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:53,640
because of my pretty face,

320
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,200
it was just a small difference

321
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,640
between us, right?

322
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,880
Besides,

323
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,559
we are both from the Xianpa Village.

324
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:01,960
It's amazing how fate brought us together.

325
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:03,679
Now that we are challenged by the same enemy.

326
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:05,200
Shouldn't we work hand in hand?

327
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:07,239
Enough of all the sweet words.

328
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,919
Cut to the chase.

329
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,400
Fine. Then, I'll cut to the chase.

330
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:12,599
I want you to help me with my studies.

331
00:13:12,599 --> 00:13:13,799
Let's defeat that...

332
00:13:14,479 --> 00:13:15,919
The Emperor, all right?

333
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:19,280
It's not entirely impossible,

334
00:13:20,119 --> 00:13:22,760
but I can't be working for free, right?

335
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:24,239
You're right.

336
00:13:24,479 --> 00:13:25,440
I've thought things through.

337
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:26,880
If you can help me defeat him,

338
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,799
I'll leave my face to you.

339
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,320
Really?

340
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,320
Do you want to reconsider it, Your Majesty?

341
00:13:35,719 --> 00:13:36,320
Think about it.

342
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,840
If I am to get hit in the face

343
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,400
a hundred times
by Grand Mentor Wei's Golden Ruler,

344
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,000
I might as well leave my face to this darned Yu.

345
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,520
Well?

346
00:13:43,719 --> 00:13:44,599
Are you going to take back your words?

347
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,119
I'm Liu Jinfeng and I never eat my words.

348
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:53,119
Yunzhang.

349
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:53,919
Yunzhang.

350
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:55,200
Have you thought this through, Yunzhang?

351
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:56,799
Yunzhang.

352
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:58,479
You should never trust Liu Baiyu.

353
00:13:58,479 --> 00:13:59,000
He's right.

354
00:13:59,080 --> 00:13:59,679
Also,

355
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:01,599
don't drink the green tea.

356
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:03,000
She might try to poison you.

357
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,880
He's right, Your Majesty.

358
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,479
That's enough. You're dismissed.

359
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:07,760
Baiyu can help me with my studies.

360
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,239
-Yunzhang!
-Your Majesty!

361
00:14:09,239 --> 00:14:09,880
Yunzhang, give it a second thought.

362
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,159
-Your Majesty.
-Yunzhang!

363
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:15,799
Your Majesty has ditched us.

364
00:14:16,719 --> 00:14:18,119
He doesn't care about us anymore.

365
00:14:19,719 --> 00:14:20,960
I've told you so.

366
00:14:21,479 --> 00:14:22,840
Don't get fooled by her beauty.

367
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:24,599
That woman

368
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:26,320
is not one to be trifled with.

369
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,400
Your Majesty.

370
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:30,359
Your Majesty.

371
00:14:30,359 --> 00:14:31,760
Should we do something now?

372
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,640
You're right.

373
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:36,919
When the enemy takes action, I shall too.

374
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,479
She made us do this.

375
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,440
I am very sure

376
00:14:43,719 --> 00:14:45,960
that if His Majesty doesn't change his mind,

377
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:48,000
Liu Baiyu

378
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,320
will be the second most suspicious person

379
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,520
in the imperial city.

380
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,679
She will definitely

381
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,960
turn the entire palace upside down.

382
00:14:56,119 --> 00:14:56,679
Yes.

383
00:15:00,719 --> 00:15:01,280
(Ladies and gentlemen.)

384
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,440
(This is today's weather forecast.)

385
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,719
After a period of heavy rain,

386
00:15:05,719 --> 00:15:08,239
we're finally welcoming good weather.

387
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,440
Today, in the imperial capital,
the weather will turn from cloudy to sunny.

388
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,000
The wind force is around two to three.

389
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,679
The intensity of the ultraviolet ray...

390
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,080
What are you doing?

391
00:15:17,359 --> 00:15:18,000
I have something...

392
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,280
It's nothing much.

393
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,200
I only want you

394
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:25,000
to read this out.

395
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,479
What's this?

396
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,479
This is very important.

397
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,440
This will affect His Majesty's future endeavors.

398
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,599
Just read it out.

399
00:15:38,599 --> 00:15:40,640
There's always a master among a group of three.

400
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:43,280
It means when a group of people get together,

401
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,239
there must be someone who can teach me something.

402
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:49,200
Disciples are not always inferior to masters.

403
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:52,679
Not all students are inferior to their teachers.

404
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:55,640
Masters are not always better than disciples.

405
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:58,760
Teachers are not always
smarter than the students.

406
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,599
Some learn sooner than others.

407
00:16:00,719 --> 00:16:03,000
Some people learn faster, and some are slower.

408
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,200
Everyone has their own fortes.

409
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,840
Everyone is good at their own fields.

410
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,960
That is all.

411
00:16:10,479 --> 00:16:11,440
Do you need a translation for that too?

412
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,039
That is all.

413
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,919
(The Imperial Academy examination
is around the corner.)

414
00:16:18,239 --> 00:16:21,280
(This is a major event
that will affect His Majesty and Donghao Empire.)

415
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,520
(His Majesty's beauty is beyond compare.)

416
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:25,039
(His Majesty's intelligence is unparalleled.)

417
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:26,599
(His Majesty is brave)

418
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:28,440
and extremely smart.

419
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,799
His Majesty is the most perfect man on earth.

420
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,280
His Majesty enrolled in the Imperial Academy
at the age of five.

421
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:34,960
Let's go.

422
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,640
He studied all day and all night.

423
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,400
(He has read all the literature)

424
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,000
(and known everything in the world.)

425
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,440
(He studied hard, not for his own fame)

426
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,559
(but for the peace of the world.)

427
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,679
For His Majesty,
the people of the nation mean everything.

428
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,359
Nothing is more important
than the will of the people.

429
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,880
[Emperor]
(He is the best emperor in thousands of years,)

430
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,200
(and we wish his name can live forever.)

431
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,520
Let's vote for His Majesty.

432
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,440
I'm voting too.

433
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:55,760
Me too.

434
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,960
Let's vote for His Majesty.

435
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,520
Let me go first.

436
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:00,470
[Emperor]
Wait. I'm going to vote too.

437
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:01,479
Me too.

438
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:09,479
It seems like a war has been declared.

439
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,719
Shrill winds rise, waters cold.

440
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:17,159
The hero shall go and never come home.

441
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:24,660
[Queen]

there is more laughter in the palace than ever.

Thanks to her,

459
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,880
our lives have become happier than ever.

(Doesn't Her Majesty worth our support?)

467

It has to be touching
and at the same time, impactful.

468
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:31,760
It has to make the headlines.

469

Don't allow them to get swayed again.

470

What do you think?

It's extremely touching.

478
00:18:43,719 --> 00:18:44,760
Go to the Astronomical Observatory now.

479

All the best, Imperial Physician Yu!

480

I'll read Her Majesty's script first.

Don't hit me.

00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,359
Can you give us an idea

497
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,760
of how to resolve the current situation?

498
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:44,520
Your Majesty.

499
00:19:44,959 --> 00:19:47,680
There is only one last option.

500
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,599
And what is it?

501
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:50,880
My suggestion

502
00:19:51,199 --> 00:19:53,760
is to let His Majesty and Her Majesty

503
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:55,640
stay together all day and all night.

504
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,479
What?

505
00:19:56,599 --> 00:19:57,520
They should be inseparable.

506
00:19:57,959 --> 00:19:58,719
No way.

507
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,959
They will be more intimate than ever.

508
00:19:59,959 --> 00:20:01,040
-No way.
-That's not going to happen.

509
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,680
Just study well.

510
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:08,959
I've already sent a few men to the Yi Academy

511
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,680
to clean up a room for Your Majesties.

512
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:13,599
Finally.

513
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,359
His Majesty and Her Majesty

514
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:20,479
can finally spend some good time together,

515
00:20:20,479 --> 00:20:22,160
all day and all night.

516
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,119
-No way.
-No way.

517
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:24,920
Grand Mentor Wei.

518
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,199
I don't think

519
00:20:26,199 --> 00:20:27,479
your idea will work.

520
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:30,479
Your Majesty.

521
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,760
I'm doing this for...

522
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:34,839
That's enough, Grand Mentor Wei.

523
00:20:39,479 --> 00:20:40,079
Your Majesty.

524
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:41,479
I'm doing this for your sake.

525
00:20:41,479 --> 00:20:42,239
Forget it.

526
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,280
Grand Mentor Wei,

527
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:47,439
why don't we just let them study together?

528
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,479
It's better for the husband and wife
to have their own space.

529
00:20:50,479 --> 00:20:50,880
Right?

530
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,839
-No.
-No.

531
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,239
I've decided to build a small hut
in the peach forest

532
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,920
so that Jinfeng and I can study there.

533
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:03,760
(I'll keep you under a close watch.)

534
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,680
(Let's see what else you can do.)

535
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:08,319
The small hut has to

536
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:09,439
have good ventilation.

537
00:21:09,439 --> 00:21:10,959
What if we both pass out as we study?

538
00:21:11,719 --> 00:21:13,599
(I'll freeze you to death.)

539
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:15,119
Sure.

540
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:16,479
To make things fair,

541
00:21:16,479 --> 00:21:19,239
Chai Tiezhou will be in charge
of serving meals to the hut every day.

542
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,319
(Easy peasy.)

543
00:21:22,439 --> 00:21:24,920
(I'll starve this glutton to death.)

544
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,040
(Are you trying to starve me?)

545
00:21:28,199 --> 00:21:29,959
(A thin camel is still bigger than a horse,)

546
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:32,439
(not to mention a weak horse like you.)

547
00:21:32,439 --> 00:21:33,800
(Come at me.)

548
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:35,400
(Let's see how I beat you up.)

549
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:40,820
[Peach Forest Hut]

550
00:21:42,479 --> 00:21:43,959
What a coincidence, Your Majesty.

551
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,079
Your Majesty.

552
00:21:59,160 --> 00:21:59,800
Here's a peach for you.

553
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:13,359
Do you want to have a competition?

554
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,199
Sure.

555
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,520
Let's take it as a warm-up
before the real examination.

556
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:17,880
What should we compete on?

557
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,040
You decide.

558
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,560
Sure?

559
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,280
I always keep my words.

560
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:24,119
Sure.

561
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:25,880
Let's do "duiyi".
(* "duiyi" can mean "pay Go" or "chicken wings")

562
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,040
That's very brave.

563
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:36,400
Fine.

564
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,000
This smells so good.

565
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:44,359
Yunyan, more chili powder.

566
00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:45,599
This is my mother's secret recipe.

567
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:45,920
Sure.

568
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,599
It's delicious.

569
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:47,560
It smells so good.

570
00:22:56,359 --> 00:22:57,560
Are you done yet?

571
00:22:57,839 --> 00:22:58,760
Your Majesty, just another minute.

572
00:22:58,760 --> 00:22:59,359
Don't worry.

573
00:22:59,359 --> 00:22:59,880
Your Majesty.

574
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,719
This is our first time starting a fire.

575
00:23:02,959 --> 00:23:04,479
Isn't Chai here too?

576
00:23:04,479 --> 00:23:05,800
Is it that difficult to start a fire?

577
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:07,439
Your Majesty.

578
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,359
I've burned my hands.

579
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:11,199
It's not easy to start a fire
with these charcoals.

580
00:23:11,239 --> 00:23:12,040
How useless of you.

581
00:23:12,239 --> 00:23:13,800
You call yourself an imperial chef, huh?

582
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,359
Hurry up!

583
00:23:14,599 --> 00:23:15,760
Fan it.

584
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,359
What happened to the weiqi game?

585
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:20,479
I don't see any weiqi pieces here.

586
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,599
Can you stop eating?

587
00:23:21,959 --> 00:23:22,760
Duiyi?

588
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:24,239
They are right here.

589
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:25,880
Chicken wings.

590
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:28,520
Do you want one?

591
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,319
I won't charge you.

592
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,319
Are you not happy with this?

593
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:32,920
Of course not.

594
00:23:33,959 --> 00:23:35,359
The Emperor broke his promises.

595
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:35,920
Who?

596
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:36,719
Fine.

597
00:23:36,719 --> 00:23:37,719
I'm in a good mood today.

598
00:23:37,719 --> 00:23:38,560
I'll let you win this round.

599
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,680
What are we playing next?

600
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,040
You...

601
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,079
It's not up to you now.

602
00:23:43,239 --> 00:23:44,000
You decided for the previous round,

603
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
so it's our turn now.

604
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:45,520
He's right.

605
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:49,599
We can't let them cheat again.

606
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:50,359
You're right.

607
00:23:51,239 --> 00:23:52,280
We can't lose another round.

608
00:23:52,439 --> 00:23:53,760
It's too embarrassing.

609
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,760
I've got an idea.

610
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,319
Let's play mounted archery.

611
00:24:00,479 --> 00:24:01,760
Sure.

612
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:28,199
Stop laughing.

613
00:24:28,959 --> 00:24:29,920
We're doing mounted archery.

614
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,079
Why is there a donkey?

615
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,839
You mentioned mounted archery.

616
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:34,439
You didn't say I had to ride on a horse.

617
00:24:36,479 --> 00:24:37,640
Are you trying to cheat again?

618
00:24:37,719 --> 00:24:39,000
I always cheat.

619
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,079
Did you just realize this?

620
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:46,680
That's not fair.

621
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:48,400
This is a competition,

622
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,959
but no one says this is a fair competition.

623
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,119
A man of honor knows what must be done
and what must not be done.

624
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:54,680
Isn't this a little too much?

625
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,719
I'm not a man of honor.

626
00:24:55,719 --> 00:24:56,880
I'm a woman.

627
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,520
It's fine.

628
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,479
Never mind.

629
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,839
A real man never hurts a woman.

630
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:05,000
We'll beat them in the examination.

631
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,680
Don't... Don't come near me.

632
00:25:10,199 --> 00:25:11,520
Go there.

633
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:13,280
This woman...

634
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,520
Confucius said,

635
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,400
"If a noble person is not grave,
he will not call forth any veneration,

636
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:22,479
and his learning will not be solid.

637
00:25:22,719 --> 00:25:24,160
Hold faithfulness and sincerity
as first principles.

638
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:29,560
Have no friends who are not as good as yourself.

639
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,199
When you have made mistakes,
do not fear to correct them."

640
00:25:39,199 --> 00:25:39,839
Get up now.

641
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,479
What are you doing?

642
00:25:40,479 --> 00:25:41,319
You gave me a scare.

643
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:43,040
You...

644
00:25:43,239 --> 00:25:45,439
Not only are you slacking off,
but you're also disturbing my study.

645
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,479
Who disturbs your study?

646
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:49,000
Do you know how I fell asleep?

647
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,800
I fell asleep listening
to you reciting the literature.

648
00:25:52,439 --> 00:25:53,920
How unreasonable.

649
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:54,920
Me? Unreasonable?

650
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,359
You've been talking
about Confucius for the entire night.

651
00:25:56,359 --> 00:25:57,119
Aren't you tired yet?

652
00:25:57,119 --> 00:25:58,199
Even if you're not tired, Confucius is.

653
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:01,239
I got it.

654
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,479
Is this your agenda?

655
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,359
You tried to make me fall asleep

656
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:05,680
so that you can study on your own.

657
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:07,920
I almost fell into your trap.

658
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,479
I'm going to study now.

659
00:26:10,479 --> 00:26:11,199
Don't disturb me.

660
00:26:17,079 --> 00:26:17,800
Confucius said,

661
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,959
"Is it not pleasant to acquire knowledge,

662
00:26:18,959 --> 00:26:20,000
and be able to constantly apply it?

663
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,199
Is it not delightful to receive friends

664
00:26:21,199 --> 00:26:22,160
coming from afar?

665
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,359
A man who feels no resentment
at being cold-shouldered by others,

666
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:23,839
is he not a gentleman?"

667
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:25,000
Confucius told you to keep it down.

668
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,479
-Is he not a gentleman?
-Keep it down!

669
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:29,680
Confucius said,

670
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,560
"They are only a few,

671
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,040
who are filial to their parents,

672
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:33,479
dare offend their superiors."

673
00:26:33,479 --> 00:26:34,280
Confucius said...

674
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:58,079
The fallen flower is lifeless.

675
00:26:58,479 --> 00:26:58,959
It...

676
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,280
It...

677
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,479
It...

678
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,319
Your Highness should study more.

679
00:27:07,319 --> 00:27:08,479
Intelligence

680
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,199
doesn't make you kind.

681
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:11,959
However many flowers are there,

682
00:27:11,959 --> 00:27:14,800
they won't be able to cover your ugly heart.

683
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,040
Your Highness adds flowers to your bath.

684
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,920
I add flowers to my tea.

685
00:27:22,119 --> 00:27:23,560
Those who have different beliefs
can't be friends.

686
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,079
I wonder

687
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:25,920
if Grand Mentor Wei
taught Your Highness this phrase?

688
00:27:26,439 --> 00:27:26,920
I...

689
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,400
Even if he did,

690
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,640
I'm sure Your Highness has forgotten about it.

691
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:30,400
You...

692
00:27:32,119 --> 00:27:32,719
Liu Baiyu.

693
00:27:32,719 --> 00:27:33,520
What are you doing?

694
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,800
It was a mistake.

695
00:27:35,199 --> 00:27:37,560
But Your Highness can add these flowers
to your bath.

696
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:40,359
Your Highness must be thinking this.

697
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:42,439
"Liu Baiyu is a cunning and vicious woman.

698
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,680
What mistake? She did it on purpose."

699
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,199
Your Highness is rarely this smart.

700
00:27:49,199 --> 00:27:50,000
You were right.

701
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,199
Liu Baiyu...

702
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:54,160
You...

703
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,560
You just wait.

704
00:28:05,239 --> 00:28:06,959
Your Highness.

705
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,959
Why did Your Highness

706
00:28:10,719 --> 00:28:12,319
summon me here?

707
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:17,520
I saw what happened
between you and Yunchong today.

708
00:28:18,839 --> 00:28:20,280
I didn't...

709
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,239
It wasn't intentional.

710
00:28:23,079 --> 00:28:25,800
It doesn't matter if it was intentional or not.

711
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,599
Have a seat.

712
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,239
Sit next to me.

713
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:33,959
Come on.

714
00:28:34,439 --> 00:28:35,040
Have a seat.

715
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,520
Sit down.

716
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,280
Sure.

717
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,959
Baiyu, what food do you like?

718
00:28:45,959 --> 00:28:47,560
This? This? Or this?

719
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,560
Which one do you prefer?

720
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,439
Do you want tea?

721
00:28:49,439 --> 00:28:50,400
It's fine.

722
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,760
Don't be shy.

723
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,400
Make yourself at home.

724
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,719
I dare not.

725
00:28:54,719 --> 00:28:55,479
You dare not?

726
00:28:55,479 --> 00:28:56,640
Why not?

727
00:28:57,479 --> 00:28:58,400
Try this.

728
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,719
It's delicious.

729
00:28:59,719 --> 00:29:00,400
Try it.

730
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,199
Thanks, Your Highness.

731
00:29:01,199 --> 00:29:02,319
Let me show you this.

732
00:29:03,239 --> 00:29:05,079
Look at this.

733
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,079
Aren't they nice?

734
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,640
They're nice, right?

735
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:09,719
This one too.

736
00:29:09,719 --> 00:29:10,520
Look at this.

737
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:13,400
Do you like it?

738
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,719
I do!

739
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:15,920
They are all yours now.

740
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,800
I can't accept this.

741
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,359
Accept them.

742
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,079
Sure.

743
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:20,880
Miss Baiyu.

744
00:29:22,199 --> 00:29:23,160
Actually,

745
00:29:23,319 --> 00:29:25,640
I want to ask you for a favor.

746
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,760
Please help me.

747
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,079
What... What is it about?

748
00:29:30,119 --> 00:29:32,640
I saw what happened this morning.

749
00:29:33,319 --> 00:29:34,640
I'll be able to rest assured

750
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:36,640
if you can keep Yunchong company.

751
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,640
The examination is in a few days.

752
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,479
The boy never focuses on his study.

753
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,239
If you can help him

754
00:29:44,239 --> 00:29:47,160
with his revision in the coming few days,

755
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,040
I think it won't be a problem

756
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,319
for him to improve his ranking, right?

757
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,839
Yunchong is no longer young.

758
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:55,560
If you can help him with his studies,

759
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,400
and if the Grand Chancellor thinks
that he is a good candidate,

760
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,920
he might be able to work
alongside the Grand Chancellor in the future.

761
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,880
Don't you agree?

762
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,719
All right.

763
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:05,119
You'll move into Yunchong's palace tomorrow.

764
00:30:05,479 --> 00:30:06,079
But...

765
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,000
Please.

766
00:30:08,359 --> 00:30:09,719
Just do me a favor.

767
00:30:09,959 --> 00:30:11,000
Do Yunchong a favor.

768
00:30:11,199 --> 00:30:12,400
Do Yunchong a favor.

769
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,800
Help that poor boy, please.

770
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,640
Yes.

00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,280
Your Highness.

774
00:30:43,479 --> 00:30:44,520
What are you doing?

775
00:30:44,839 --> 00:30:45,599
Her Highness has ordered

776
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:47,119
Your Highness to focus on your studies.

777
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:50,000
Your Highness.

778

A decree from Her Highness.

779
00:30:52,959 --> 00:30:54,640
Studying can make your mother happy.

780
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,560
When your mother is happy,
your family will be happy as well.

781
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,280
What if I just refuse

782
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,280
to study?

783
00:30:59,439 --> 00:31:01,439
Her Highness had expected this.

784
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:02,239
Send him in.

785
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,239
You must study.

786
00:31:03,439 --> 00:31:04,000
Yes.

787
00:31:06,119 --> 00:31:06,719
How dare you.

788
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:08,920
Put me down!

789
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,000
Who gave you permission to do this?

790
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,800
It seems like Mother isn't that cruel after all.

791
00:31:34,719 --> 00:31:36,199
She knows that I have a hard time studying,

792
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,439
so she sent me a female study companion.

793
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,199
I have no choice but to accept this offer then.
