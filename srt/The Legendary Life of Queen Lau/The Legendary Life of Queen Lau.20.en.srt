We get exposed to the sun when we work.

170
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,279
That's why you need a whitening facial cream.

171
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,000
This is made with the best milk

172
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,880
produced in Xianpa Village.

173
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,359
It was then brewed for 118 days.

174
00:07:16,359 --> 00:07:17,279
It works really well.

175
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:18,799
You have to try it for yourself.

176
00:07:20,119 --> 00:07:21,239
Wait.

177
00:07:21,239 --> 00:07:22,320
The same old rule.

178
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,119
Fill in the questionnaire first.

179
00:07:23,119 --> 00:07:23,679
Sufang.

180
00:07:23,679 --> 00:07:24,399
Distribute the questionnaire.

181
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:24,839
Sure.

182
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:26,200
We offer similar products for men too.

183
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,880
Guys, fill out the questionnaire.

184
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,679
Fill out the questionnaire.

185
00:07:28,679 --> 00:07:30,519
Everyone will get one.

186
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:32,559
You'll get the product after you fill it up.

187
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:34,119
Yes.

188
00:07:34,119 --> 00:07:35,799
Fill in your height, weight,

189
00:07:35,799 --> 00:07:37,279
and your ancestor's occupations.

190
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:37,839
Yes.

191
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:39,160
This can help us

192
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,399
understand your skin conditions.

193
00:07:47,359 --> 00:07:48,920
"Did your ancestor serve in the army?"

194
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:50,959
What does that have anything to do

195
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:52,040
with my skin condition?

196
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:54,279
You know nothing about this.

197
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,760
If your ancestor was a soldier with rough skin,

198
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,279
it might run in your genes.

199
00:07:59,079 --> 00:07:59,959
Makes sense.

200
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:01,119
Fill it out now.

201
00:08:12,119 --> 00:08:13,200
Cut the slices thinner.

202
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,320
Hurry up.

203
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,359
It's almost mealtime.

204
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,839
"Is your ancestor of a foreign bloodline?"

205
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,359
What does this have anything to do

206
00:08:20,359 --> 00:08:21,440
with the color of my lipsticks?

207
00:08:21,559 --> 00:08:22,239
You're so stupid.

208
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,640
Of course, it will make a difference.

209
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,440
Just fill it.

210
00:08:24,679 --> 00:08:25,440
He's right.

211
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,239
Her Majesty is the beauty expert in this palace.

212
00:08:27,239 --> 00:08:28,320
She is always right.

213
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,720
"Did your ancestor serve in the army?"

214
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,839
What does that mean?

215
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:33,839
Look.

216
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,340
[Shoulder width, bust, waist, hips,
name, age, weight, origin]

217
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,839
Jinfeng, look.

218
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,959
Now you understand
how fun it is to earn money, right?

219
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:40,880
Look at all the money.

220
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,880
You earned all these with your hard work.

221
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,359
Tell you what.

222
00:08:44,359 --> 00:08:45,400
If we can open a beauty workshop

223
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,200
out there,

224
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,640
we'll be able to double what we earned
in the Muyan Palace.

225
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,960
Not bad, right?

226
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,719
It makes perfect sense, right?

227
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:57,520
It does.

228
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,039
I'm the Queen.

229
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,520
Why should I run a business with you?

230
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:03,039
I'm supposed to hang around idly.

231
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:03,919
Now, you want me to work.

232
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:05,000
Who is the fool here?

233
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,280
Do you still need these?

234
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,239
I'll keep them if you don't need them anymore.

235
00:09:09,239 --> 00:09:10,159
Why do you want these?

236
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,039
Why do you want these?

237
00:09:12,239 --> 00:09:14,080
I'm collecting their personal information

238
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,359
so that I can develop new skincare products.

239
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,039
I want this because...

240
00:09:18,119 --> 00:09:18,840
I'm the Queen.

241
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,960
I just want to read them.

242
00:09:20,479 --> 00:09:21,320
Can you understand these?

243
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,440
You can barely read.

244
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,640
You want to read them?

245
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,760
Who says I can't read?

246
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,200
Who says I won't understand these?

247
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:29,359
Fine. You can read.

248
00:09:29,359 --> 00:09:30,119
Otherwise, how did we manage

249
00:09:30,119 --> 00:09:31,760
to exchange love letters back then?

250
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,440
Xuan, how are you doing?

251
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,359
-Enough.
-Xuan, does your head still hurt?

252
00:09:38,359 --> 00:09:39,599
-Enough.
-Xuan, I want to...

253
00:09:39,599 --> 00:09:40,640
Shut up.

254
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:42,320
Yu Changya, you're so annoying.

255
00:09:42,479 --> 00:09:44,400
I let the matter go when you impersonated Xuan

256
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,200
and wrote me letters.

257
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,599
Why did you have to bring it up now?

258
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,960
After all, you used to have a crush on me.

259
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:51,359
Why wouldn't I bring it up?

260
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,679
Yu Changya, you...

261
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,640
Xuan.

262
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,960
Your Majesty, I can explain.

263
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,200
-What you heard was...
-There's no need for an explanation.

264
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:05,400
No, but...

265
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,559
I have to explain myself.

266
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:08,400
That is not necessary.

267
00:10:08,479 --> 00:10:09,200
I got it.

268
00:10:10,719 --> 00:10:11,719
Really?

269
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,520
[Taihe Hall]
Don't be mad, Your Majesty.

270
00:10:16,719 --> 00:10:17,599
I'm not mad.

271
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,599
Are you really not upset

272
00:10:19,599 --> 00:10:21,520
by the conversation
between Imperial Physician Yu and Her Majesty?

273
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:22,919
What a fool.

274
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,359
Can't you see it yet?

275
00:10:24,359 --> 00:10:25,239
I can't see it.

276
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,799
We overheard the conversation

277
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:29,200
right when we passed by the Lingshu Academy.

278
00:10:29,359 --> 00:10:30,080
Why?

279
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,840
It's a trap.

280
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,479
Don't you like reading a huaben?

281
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:34,640
This is exactly like

282
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,640
the plot in the huaben.

283
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,200
You hear what you want to hear

284
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,760
when you want to hear it.

285
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,320
Your Majesty, so that means

286
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,119
Her Majesty did it deliberately

287
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,440
so that you could overhear the conversation.

288
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,159
That's right.

289
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,159
It is a very decent trick,

290
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,919
but she is a poor actress.

291
00:10:51,239 --> 00:10:52,760
Your Majesty is indeed wise.

292
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,039
Jinfeng put up an act

293
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,559
just for me.

294
00:10:57,359 --> 00:10:58,520
I can't lose to her.

295
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:00,200
I need to start

296
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,159
studying the questionnaire.

297
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:01,760
Let's go.

298
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:05,420
[Shoulder width, bust, waist, hips, name, age, weight, origin]
[Did your ancestor serve in the army?]

299
00:11:08,359 --> 00:11:09,320
However, I don't understand

300
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:10,760
why Sister-in-law made them

301
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,239
fill in this questionnaire.

302
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:13,359
This is a trap.

303
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:14,719
There must be an agenda behind this.

304
00:11:14,719 --> 00:11:15,479
Wait. Look...

305
00:11:15,479 --> 00:11:16,919
What kind of questions are these?

306
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:19,080
What do they have anything to do with skincare?

307
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,919
This has nothing to do
with their skincare regime.

308
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:23,520
They should confront me.

309
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:24,799
Yunzhang.

310
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,880
Do you know what my sister-in-law is trying to do?

311
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:27,960
Such a simple trick.

312
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,159
How can I not understand her?

313
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:30,719
My emperor is indeed the best.

314
00:11:30,719 --> 00:11:31,840
He even managed to figure this out.

315
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,840
Your emperor?

316
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,840
He's mine.

317
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,840
The Emperor I admire the most.

318
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,359
Your emperor?

319
00:11:35,359 --> 00:11:36,039
-It's mine.
-Mine...

320
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:37,200
That's enough.

321
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,200
This is not the right time to argue.

322
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,080
Let Yunzhang talk.

323
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,479
Actions speak louder than words.

324
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:42,119
How can we be of help?

325
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:43,640
The imperial bodyguards and I
are at your disposal.

326
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,520
You gave me a scare.

327
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,280
Stop pulling your blade out of nowhere.

328
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:45,799
Shuan.

329
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,599
Bring me a brush.

330
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,440
Sure.

331
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,039
Your Majesty.

332
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:50,799
Do you have to draft a decree
for a trivial matter like this?

333
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:51,640
You can just give a verbal order.

334
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,200
Your Majesty.

Luckily, Imperial Physician Yu did this survey.

Otherwise, we wouldn't have known what to do.

you will make up another excuse

Don't worry.

It's going to be different this time.

I need to discuss something with you.

Be careful.

Let's split up.

385
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:11,880
It has been a few days
since I last saw Your Majesty.

Your Majesty is blooming.

I haven't seen you recently.

Those are just trivial matters
in the Imperial Hospital.

391
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,280
Your Majesty will have to take care
of all the major issues

392
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,640
when you start governing the country.

393

I have something to do.

What has Yu Changya been up to?

397

There's something I want to say,

One of them is in charge of the production,

407
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,320
and the other one is in charge of selling.

408
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,559
They are working really well together

409
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:00,960
and have earned quite some money.

410
00:15:04,479 --> 00:15:05,919
It's nothing much.

411
00:15:06,119 --> 00:15:07,880

about Her Majesty and Imperial Physician Yu.

413
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,799
Your Majesty won't take it to heart, right?

414
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:14,520
How can I not take it to heart?

415

If I don't get bothered by it,

416

all of Jinfeng's efforts will be wasted.

some tricks to attract my attention.

419
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,520
It seems like I need to do more than just hinting.

420
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,119
I need to be more upfront with my feelings.

Just like this eye cream.

473
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,959
It has amazing anti-aging properties.

474
00:17:38,959 --> 00:17:39,839
Apply a little bit of this

475

around your eyes...

That's right.

479
00:17:46,959 --> 00:17:49,239
That's because I didn't apply the eye cream today.

480
00:17:49,239 --> 00:17:49,760
Look.

481

I only skip one day and it's already this bad.

482
00:17:51,439 --> 00:17:52,520
If you use this every day,

483

you'll be better than the Queen

484

who can be better than Empress Dowager.

I want one too.

491
00:18:08,439 --> 00:18:10,520
Is this the new management style you created?

492
00:18:11,439 --> 00:18:12,000
Yes.

493
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:14,280
Don't they all look very spirited

494
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,560

496
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,640
This is too much.

497
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:20,040
If all of them want to

498
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,119
be the Queen and the Empress Dowager,

499

are you trying
to turn the Imperial Harem upside down?

500
00:18:25,319 --> 00:18:26,800
It was just a joke.

501
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,199
Don't take it too seriously.

502
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,160
I beg your pardon.

503
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:30,520
No.

504
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,040
When everyone focuses
on their own skincare routine,

505
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,280
no one will have the time
to make any mischief in the Imperial Harem.

506
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,880
It's prohibited to trade in the Imperial Harem.

507
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,199
You know this better than others.

508
00:18:38,839 --> 00:18:40,719
Have I given you too much power,

509
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:42,160
resulting in you forgetting about the rules?

510
00:18:42,479 --> 00:18:43,719
I didn't forget about the rules.

511
00:18:43,719 --> 00:18:44,479
Fine.

512
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,680
Then, the Queen shall be punished
according to the palace rule.

513
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,400
Wait a moment.

514
00:18:51,959 --> 00:18:52,920
Your Majesty.

515
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,479
This all happened because of me.

516
00:18:54,479 --> 00:18:56,520
It has nothing to do with Her Majesty.

517
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:58,719
I instigated her to do this.

518
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,560
It was my mistake.

519
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:06,199
Your Majesty.

520
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,199
I was told
that Imperial Physician Yu and the Queen

521
00:19:09,199 --> 00:19:10,640
hailed from the same place.

522
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,160
They were once in a relationship.

523
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,239
Look.

524
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,719
When Her Majesty made a mistake,

525
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,800
Imperial Physician Yu
immediately defended her.

526
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,520
Don't you think...

527
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,199
Your Highness.

528
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,640
Baiyu and I came from the same place too.

529
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,479
Why didn't you suspect
that we were in a relationship?

530
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:27,239
You and Baiyu?

531
00:19:27,239 --> 00:19:28,640
Others might not be bothered by this,

532
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,439
but if you and Imperial Physician Yu
were really a thing,

533
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,760
that is going

534
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,239
to bring shame to His Majesty.

535
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,640
We can easily find out
whether they were once a couple.

536
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:41,079
Investigate this.

537
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:41,839
Wait.

538
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,479
Zhang.

539
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,400
You're blooming.

540
00:19:50,239 --> 00:19:53,079
I think it has been a few days
since I last saw you.

541
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:54,079
Yes.

542
00:19:54,439 --> 00:19:56,160
I have been busy with state affairs.

543
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,439
I didn't even have time to visit Mother.

544
00:19:58,439 --> 00:19:59,760
I hope Mother can forgive me.

545
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,880
Don't worry.

546
00:20:02,239 --> 00:20:03,239
Of course, you should focus
on important matters.

547
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,000
But then again,

548
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,920
why is Mother here?

549
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:11,920
You don't know anything about the Imperial Harem.

550
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,800
Leave them to me.

551
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,479
I got it.

552
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:15,640
Mother, I'll leave you to this.

553
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:18,760
Zhang,

554
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,079
why don't you get back to work?

555
00:20:21,079 --> 00:20:21,800
It's fine.

556
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,680
I'll stay here to watch

557
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,199
as I would like to learn from Mother.

558
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,319
Fine.

559
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,880
Take the Queen and Imperial Physician Yu away.

560
00:20:32,119 --> 00:20:32,760
Wait a minute.

561
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,119
Mother.

562
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,160
What have these two done?

563
00:20:37,719 --> 00:20:38,800
According to the news I received,

564
00:20:39,479 --> 00:20:42,880
the Queen and Imperial Physician Yu
have been trading illegally in the palace.

565
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,160
From where did you get the news?

566
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,640
Mother, there must have been a misunderstanding.

567
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,400
It wasn't illegal trading.

568
00:20:55,479 --> 00:20:56,880
I gave permission to that.

569
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:01,079
You gave permission to that?

570
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:01,959
Yes.

571
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,079
The Queen is trying to prepare

572
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:06,079
for Mother's birthday.

573
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:07,640
She was busy

574
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,880
developing these skincare products.

575
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,280
She was just too scared to bring them to you.

576
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,119
Therefore, she gave it to the maidservants

577
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:14,199
and tried it on them.

578
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,599
What about the romantic relationship
between her and Imperial Physician Yu

579
00:21:16,719 --> 00:21:17,959
that became a subject of gossip?

580
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:19,920
That is another misunderstanding.

581
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,640
I sent Imperial Physician Yu

582
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,719
to assist the Queen.

583
00:21:24,439 --> 00:21:25,800
I am here to find out

584
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,479
who is gossiping about them.

585
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,959
She set up stalls at random places in the palace,

586
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,160
vandalized the facilities,

587
00:21:33,439 --> 00:21:34,599
and ruined the palace's image.

588
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,839
Did you give permission to those too?

589
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:36,520
Of course, I did.

590
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:39,920
I designed this booth myself.

591
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,119
Do you like it, Mother?

592
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,560
Also...

593
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,359
She...

594
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,959
She sells fake products of poor quality,

595
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,439
causing many to suffer from an allergic reaction.

596
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,839
Did you give your permission to that too?

597
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:52,959
Who is suffering from an allergic reaction?

598
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,479
Not me.

599
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,760
Not me.

600
00:21:59,119 --> 00:21:59,920
Are you suffering from an allergic reaction?

601
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,280
I...

602
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:01,839
Tell me now.

603
00:22:02,839 --> 00:22:04,040
Are you suffering from an allergic reaction?

604
00:22:04,199 --> 00:22:04,719
I...

605
00:22:05,439 --> 00:22:06,560
Are you suffering from an allergic reaction?

606
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,239
I...

607
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,160
I think I'm passing out.

608
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:17,920
Mother.

609
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,520
After everything that has happened,

610
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,000
I'm sure Jinfeng meant well.

611
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:22,680
Why don't we just let this go?

612
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,079
Lest things turn uglier from here.

613
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,160
Jinfeng.

614
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,359
Look at you.

615
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,560
Why didn't you

616
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:36,800
tell me sooner?

617
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:37,839
Your Majesty.

618
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:38,959
I didn't have a chance to tell you.

619
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,839
Why don't you try our latest product?

620
00:22:40,839 --> 00:22:41,839
It's really effective.

621
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:42,920
It smells really good too.

622
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,439
You can try it.

623
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,439
It has a citrus scent.

624
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,560
Let me smell it.

625
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:51,319
You just had mandarin oranges.

626
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,640
The citrus scent on your hand is too strong.

627
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,640
But this works really well.

628
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,479
Look at them. They can speak for this product.

629
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:57,800
Fine.

630
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,280
Send a set to my place.

631
00:22:59,280 --> 00:22:59,839
Sure.

632
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:01,920
Two sets.

633
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:02,839
All right.

634
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,680
Thanks, Your Majesty and Your Highness.

635
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,800
I got it.

636
00:23:11,319 --> 00:23:12,880
Did you get it?

637
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:13,880
What?

638
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:15,359
Stop acting dumb.

639
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,239
Between you and me,

640
00:23:17,239 --> 00:23:19,199
there are things we don't need to say out loud.

641
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,599
You're such a fool,

642
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,880
but a very handsome one.

643
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,520
Is he handsome?

644
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,000
The Empress Dowager has been
obsessed with dancing recently.

645
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Why did she suddenly decide to check on us?

646
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,359
Someone must have told on us.

647
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,680
That's very likely.

648
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:55,439
Who do you think did that?

649
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,400
Baiyu?

650
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,439
Don't disturb me.

651
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:00,359
I'm writing a huaben. Get out now.

652
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,599
It's been a while since I last saw her
leaving the Western Warm Palace.

653
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:12,439
It wasn't her.

654
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,640
Yu Changya?

655
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:19,800
Imperial Physician Yu.

656
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:20,839
Her Majesty said

657
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,839
she wants 30 lipsticks of different colors

658
00:24:22,839 --> 00:24:24,359
within three days.

659
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,359
She also wants 30 bottles of facial creams
with different functions

660
00:24:26,359 --> 00:24:28,199
and 30 bottles of eye cream of different scents.

661
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,959
If you can't do it,

662
00:24:30,479 --> 00:24:31,640
you will have to bear the consequences.

663
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:34,239
That's impossible.

664
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,760
It makes sense if he tries to set you up.

665
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,760
But why would he want to set himself up?

666
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:43,839
Who else could it be, then?

667
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,119
Cui.

668
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,040
Come here.

669
00:24:52,959 --> 00:24:53,800
Eunuch Shuan.

670
00:24:54,199 --> 00:24:55,040
His Majesty said

671
00:24:55,199 --> 00:24:56,439
you did a pretty good job.

672
00:24:56,439 --> 00:24:57,199
He is rewarding you.

673
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,640
Thanks, Eunuch Shuan, for the compliment.

674
00:25:00,239 --> 00:25:01,119
You're welcome.

675
00:25:01,239 --> 00:25:02,199
Let's look forward

676
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:03,640
to working together again in the future.

677
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:05,800
Eunuch Shuan.

678
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,959
Why did His Majesty want me
to tell on Her Majesty?

679
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,599
What a foolish girl.

680
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:12,520
It was a decree from His Majesty.

681
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,079
We should obey and never question.

682
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:14,560
I got it.

683
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,880
Eunuch Shuan is right.

684
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,880
All right. Go back now.

685
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:29,599
Could it be him?

686
00:25:35,479 --> 00:25:36,760
You didn't expect this, did you?

687
00:25:36,959 --> 00:25:38,359
It was me.

688
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,119
I'm rich now.

689
00:25:44,119 --> 00:25:45,160
Let's share this.

690
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,640
One for you, and one for me.

691
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:52,479
One for you, and one for me.

692
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,520
One for you, and one for me.

693
00:25:55,079 --> 00:25:56,359
If it wasn't for the Empress Dowager
who ruined our business,

694
00:25:56,359 --> 00:25:57,839
we would've been able to earn even more.

695
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,160
It wasn't the Empress Dowager.

696
00:25:59,959 --> 00:26:00,839
What?

697
00:26:02,959 --> 00:26:05,079
Of course, it was her.

698
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:06,400
That old lady is really mean.

699
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,760
Jinfeng, do you know something I don't?

700
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,880
We're partners now,

701
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,920
so don't ask questions when you shouldn't.

702
00:26:15,959 --> 00:26:16,400
You...

703
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,119
What?

704
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:18,319
Stay out of my business.

705
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:19,199
Wait.

706
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,760
Haven't you got this yet?

707
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,640
What are you talking about?

708
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,800
All suitors in this world

709
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,640
are the men.

710
00:26:25,719 --> 00:26:27,000
You're a girl.

711
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,280
Why are you trying to court a man?

712
00:26:29,959 --> 00:26:31,000
Do you want to hear the proper answer

713
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,280
or my personal thoughts?

714
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,880
Judging from our relationship,

715
00:26:35,199 --> 00:26:36,239
I want to hear your personal thought.

716
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,599
All right. My personal thought.

717
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,599
I know the situation very well,

718
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:40,920
but you don't.

719
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,079
Who am I courting?

720
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:43,119
His Majesty.

721
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,359
And who's that?

722
00:26:44,359 --> 00:26:45,520
My husband.

723
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,640
I'm courting my husband.

724
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,479
It makes perfect sense.

725
00:26:47,479 --> 00:26:48,880
All right. Fine.

726
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,000
I don't like that answer.

727
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:50,959
Give me the proper answer.

728
00:26:51,079 --> 00:26:52,439
Then, it's even simpler.

729
00:26:52,439 --> 00:26:53,199
I'm the Queen.

730
00:26:53,199 --> 00:26:54,000
I do whatever I like.

731
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,760
Stay out of my business.

732
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,199
Jinfeng!

733
00:27:03,439 --> 00:27:04,520
You gave me a scare.

734
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:05,719
Sorry.

735
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,160
This is the final question,

736
00:27:08,719 --> 00:27:10,239
and I want you to answer it seriously.

737
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,719
Shoot.

738
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,160
When we were in Xianpa Village,

739
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,599
would you fall for me

740
00:27:17,199 --> 00:27:19,199
if I didn't bring up plastic surgery?

741
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,479
No.

742
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:25,319
Why not?

743
00:27:26,239 --> 00:27:27,800
It's very simple.

744
00:27:28,439 --> 00:27:31,160
I remember when I was 16 years old.

745
00:27:32,199 --> 00:27:34,160
You were 16 years old too.

746
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:38,319
(One day, when I was walking on the street...)

747
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:39,599
Hey.

748
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:40,199
Are you heading out?

749
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,079
-I'm working.
-Mister.

750
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,520
Be careful, madam.

751
00:27:50,119 --> 00:27:50,800
Watch out.

752
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,439
Are you all right, madam?

753
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,079
I'm fine.

754
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,040
Here.

755
00:28:05,719 --> 00:28:06,719
Haven't you got it yet?

756
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,000
You don't like me

757
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,119
because I helped an old lady?

758
00:28:14,119 --> 00:28:15,040
I'll tell you another story.

759
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:15,839
Let's see if you can understand this.

760
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,920
I was 16 years old.

761
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,160
I'll start the poem.

762
00:28:21,479 --> 00:28:23,000
One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven.

763
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,839
Seven. Six. Five. Four. Three. Two. One.

764
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:27,640
Good one.

765
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,760
I don't think you can do it again.

766
00:28:28,959 --> 00:28:29,959
I don't think you can do it again.

767
00:28:29,959 --> 00:28:30,760
Again.

768
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,319
Sure.

769
00:28:32,439 --> 00:28:34,680
Up and down, left and right.

770
00:28:35,479 --> 00:28:37,479
Left and right, up and down.

771
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,479
Good one.

772
00:28:39,719 --> 00:28:41,040
What a good poem.

773
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,760
Wait.

774
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,000
That's rubbish.

775
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,520
It's not.

776
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,680
What nonsense is that?

777
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,280
Why would I cite

778
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,479
such a lousy poem?

779
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,719
I don't remember what the poem was about.

780
00:28:51,719 --> 00:28:53,119
And that's not the main point too.

781
00:28:53,239 --> 00:28:55,319
It's the story that matters. Do you get it yet?

782
00:28:55,319 --> 00:28:56,319
I got it.

783
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,160
You don't like me

784
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:01,160
because I'm too talented.

785
00:29:02,719 --> 00:29:04,119
Let me tell you one last story.

786
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:05,160
Listen carefully.

787
00:29:06,439 --> 00:29:07,520
That year,

788
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,560
I was still 16 years old.

789
00:29:37,439 --> 00:29:38,560
Do you get it now?

790
00:29:39,479 --> 00:29:41,359
I'm even more confused now.

791
00:29:41,719 --> 00:29:42,839
You don't like me

792
00:29:43,199 --> 00:29:46,079
because I helped the needy.

793
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,119
Stupid. How stupid.

794
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:49,839
Do you really need me to make things this clear

795
00:29:49,839 --> 00:29:50,760
before you can get it?

796
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,880
What did I do?

797
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,800
Don't tell me I was too good.

798
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,119
Can you tell me what I did wrong?

799
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,239
You're perfect...

800
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,880
but you're too girlish.

801
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,560
Don't be sad.

802
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,599
Your parents gave birth to you.

803
00:30:06,599 --> 00:30:07,599
Don't blame them for this.

804
00:30:08,959 --> 00:30:09,719
Yu Changya.

805
00:30:10,119 --> 00:30:11,439
When it comes to love,

806
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,000
you can never explain why

807
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,520
you like or don't like a person.

808
00:30:14,719 --> 00:30:15,920
You can't force it.

809
00:30:18,959 --> 00:30:19,520
I'll get going.

810
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,079
I'll leave some for you.

811
00:30:38,479 --> 00:30:39,079
Yunzhang.

812
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,359
This is the hidden chair I just invented.

813
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,479
When you hide this behind your back,

814
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,920
you can just sit on it.

815
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:46,239
However, in others' eyes,

816
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,359
it looks like you're standing.

817
00:30:47,439 --> 00:30:48,439
You won't feel tired this way.

818
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,079
This is interesting.

819
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:51,880
His Majesty is wise and brave.

820
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,839
He is very fit physically.

821
00:30:52,959 --> 00:30:55,000
Does he need this to keep himself standing?

822
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:56,800
Just in case.

823
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,719
This is a very convenient tool.

824
00:30:57,719 --> 00:30:58,640
You can even fold it.

825
00:30:59,959 --> 00:31:00,520
Yunchong.

826
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:02,359
How much weight can this bear?

827
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,640
This...

828
00:31:04,119 --> 00:31:04,760
Don't worry.

829
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,920
This can hold two men of your size.

830
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,199
You can trust its quality.

831
00:31:07,479 --> 00:31:09,520
That should be enough.

832
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,560
Let me keep this good stuff.

833
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,760
In my opinion, food is the most important thing.

834
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,119
I prepare concentrated beef jerky for you.

835
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:16,920
One piece of these
and you won't feel hungry for half a day.

836
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:17,760
-Is that so?
-Then...

837
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,719
if one of these can make you
not feel hungry for half a day,

838
00:31:19,959 --> 00:31:21,040
why did you prepare a whole plate of this?

839
00:31:21,319 --> 00:31:21,959
This...

840
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,959
It tastes good. I'll keep it.

841
00:31:24,199 --> 00:31:24,800
Try it.

842
00:31:26,199 --> 00:31:26,800
Try it.

843
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,160
Something bad has happened, Your Majesty.

844
00:31:28,599 --> 00:31:29,400
Something bad has happened, Your Majesty.

845
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,880
He's here again.

846
00:31:31,199 --> 00:31:31,839
Who?

847
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:39,300
[Arranged Marriage Proposal]

848
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,400
Your Majesty.

849
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,640
Your Majesty.

850
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,959
Something bad has happened, Your Majesty.

851
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:47,439
Wake up, Your Majesty.

852
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,920
What's with all the fuss?

853
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,680
Something bad happened, Your Majesty.

854
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:53,040
How bad is it?

855
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,119
Anyway, my afternoon nap
is more important than that.

856
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,359
The Grand Chancellor...

857
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,680
The Grand Chancellor
is arranging another marriage.

858
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,560
What?

859
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:00,760
Your Majesty.

860
00:32:01,079 --> 00:32:03,079
Scorpion Liu has no respect for you.

861
00:32:03,079 --> 00:32:04,040
He didn't even give you a heads-up

862
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,119
before he sent
this arranged marriage proposal here.

863
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:05,920
He did it once before.

864
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:06,880
And he did it again.

865
00:32:07,199 --> 00:32:08,280
What does he take His Majesty for?

866
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,239
Are you a toy of his?

867
00:32:09,239 --> 00:32:10,079
How audacious.

868
00:32:10,439 --> 00:32:11,400
Your Majesty.

869
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,439
That's not what I meant.

870
00:32:12,439 --> 00:32:13,560
I didn't mean to call you a toy.

871
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,439
Scorpion Liu has gone too far.

872
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,719
Yunzhang.

873
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,880
Are you going to agree to this?

874
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,199
Don't you dare to say yes.

875
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:25,800
I didn't say yes.

876
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,479
I swear I didn't.

877
00:32:26,479 --> 00:32:27,439
This is outrageous.

878
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,880
Don't worry.

879
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:30,800
We can discuss this later.

880
00:32:31,079 --> 00:32:32,119
There's nothing to discuss.

881
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:33,079
Send a decree now

882
00:32:33,079 --> 00:32:34,199
and tell him that you won't agree to this

883
00:32:34,199 --> 00:32:34,800
and you won't allow this to happen.

884
00:32:35,479 --> 00:32:36,280
Calm down.

885
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,359
It's not as easy as you think.

886
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:38,199
How can I calm down?

887
00:32:38,199 --> 00:32:39,800
Liu Xie has already ruined my life.

888
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,439
Now, he's planning to ruin
another daughter's life too.

889
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:42,400
Are you talking about Liu Baiyu?

890
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,800
Although Liu Baiyu betrayed me,

891
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,160
he shouldn't punish her like this.

892
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,119
I don't think you can call this a punishment.

893
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:50,439
I'm definitely not going to agree to this,

894
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,599
but marrying into the palace
isn't a punishment, right?

895
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,959
It depends on who she's going to marry.

896
00:32:53,959 --> 00:32:55,199
It's fine

897
00:32:55,719 --> 00:32:56,800
if she's going to marry you.

898
00:32:57,079 --> 00:32:58,000
If she is going to marry him,

899
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,319
of course, it's a punishment.

900
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,439
Yunzhang.

901
00:33:05,719 --> 00:33:06,760
It's my name.

902
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:07,980
[I beg for Your Majesty's permission
to betroth my daughter to Prince Yunchong.]

903
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:11,520
Mother.

904
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,160
Something bad has happened.

905
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,439
What's wrong, Mother?

906
00:33:14,439 --> 00:33:14,880
What's the matter?

907
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,160
Your father...

908
00:33:18,119 --> 00:33:19,760
Your father is going to betroth you

909
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,520
to the useless Prince Yunchong.

910
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,760
Duan Yunchong?

911
00:33:28,199 --> 00:33:28,959
Sister-in-law.

912
00:33:28,959 --> 00:33:30,160
That's too much.

913
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:31,959
Why is it a punishment to marry me?

914
00:33:32,439 --> 00:33:33,920
I'm a pretty decent guy too.

915
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,719
You?

916
00:33:35,719 --> 00:33:36,719
Forget it.

917
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,599
This is not the right time

918
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:39,160
for the two of you to quarrel.

919
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,479
Regardless,

920
00:33:41,479 --> 00:33:43,520
I will not agree to this marriage.

921
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,400
I won't allow Scorpion Liu to manipulate us

922
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,040
by doing this.

923
00:33:47,479 --> 00:33:48,839
Liu Xie is a bad person,

924
00:33:48,839 --> 00:33:50,400
and he's trying to make his daughter
a bad person too.

925
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,479
He clearly knows that Baiyu likes you,

926
00:33:52,479 --> 00:33:54,319
but he wants to betroth Baiyu to you.

927
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,520
That's turning
an innocent woman into a prostitute.

928
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,319
Rubbish.

929
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,280
There's nothing between Baiyu and me.

930
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,239
Why is she an innocent woman
if she's marrying Yunzhang?

931
00:34:02,239 --> 00:34:03,560
Why is she a prostitute
when she's betrothed to me?

932
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,719
Sister-in-law, you owe me an explanation.

933
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:06,599
Why do you look angrier than I am?

934
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,160
That's...

935
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:07,719
Wait.

936
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:09,520
This is not the right time to quarrel.

937
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,920
We should think of a solution.

938
00:34:12,319 --> 00:34:13,239
I'm not going to marry him.

939
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:19,760
Don't worry.

940
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,879
I won't marry you.

941
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,800
Me? Worry?

942
00:34:23,479 --> 00:34:23,879
You are not worried at all.

943
00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:25,280
Do I look like I'm worried?

944
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:25,840
Your Majesty.

945
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:27,639
I would rather die alone in the palace

946
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:28,639
than marry him.

947
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:29,919
Don't worry, Baiyu.

948
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:30,479
Wait.

949
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,040
Answer me.

950
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:34,479
What's wrong with marrying me?

951
00:34:34,959 --> 00:34:36,800
Why won't you marry me?

952
00:34:37,479 --> 00:34:39,439
Your Highness is a good man,

953
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:42,840
except for the fact
that you're uneducated, jobless,

954
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,560
always idling around, honey-tongued,

955
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,560
and born with a face I loathe.

956
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:49,919
Don't be mad yet.

957
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,399
I'm not done yet.

958
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:52,679
Fine.

959
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:54,280
Continue.

960
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:55,959
This is how

961
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,879
the strangers

962
00:34:57,879 --> 00:34:58,919
would comment about you.

963
00:34:59,439 --> 00:35:00,719
But

964
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:01,800
that's not what I think.

965
00:35:03,879 --> 00:35:06,639
I think

966
00:35:06,919 --> 00:35:08,679
those words are not enough to describe

967
00:35:08,679 --> 00:35:09,800
how bad Your Highness is.

968
00:35:09,919 --> 00:35:10,719
Liu Baiyu, you...

969
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:11,959
Your Highness.

970
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,280
It seems like we won't get married,

971
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,320
and we're now enemies.

972
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,600
Fine. Liu Baiyu.

973
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,879
You have underestimated me.

974
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,560
Stay here.

975
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,760
You just wait.

976
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:23,639
What?

977
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,800
I'm bringing the Empress Dowager
and my mother here.

978
00:35:26,439 --> 00:35:29,040
You lost the fight, so you're bringing
the Empress Dowager and Consort Dowager here.

979
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,560
Fine. I'll just stay here
and wait for my punishment.

980
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,520
I'll bring them here to be my witnesses.

981
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,439
It just so happens that my brother is here too.

982
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,280
I want Yunzhang to send a decree.

983
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,159
He'll place his stamp here.

984
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,560
Then, you'll have no choice but to marry me.

985
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:40,719
Besides,

986
00:35:40,919 --> 00:35:42,959
tell Liu Xie to prepare all the dowry.

987
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:44,959
I will definitely marry you.

988
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,000
You...

989
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,080
Liu Baiyu, tell you what.

990
00:35:48,399 --> 00:35:49,679
I'll marry you.

991
00:35:49,919 --> 00:35:51,239
Are you scared yet?

992
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,600
What just happened?

993
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,679
I think Yunchong has gone mad.

994
00:36:07,159 --> 00:36:08,080
Take a look at this.

995
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:10,199
These are in trend this year.

996
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:12,760
Look at this.

997
00:36:13,879 --> 00:36:14,919
This one looks good.

998
00:36:15,399 --> 00:36:16,120
Try it on.

999
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,320
Purple?

1000
00:36:19,239 --> 00:36:21,560
We only wear that
when we're building the pigsty in the village.

1001
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:26,679
This.

1002
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:28,840

I never mean that.

This color is pretty decent.

Black can hide the stains.

Gold is the color of wealth.

Fine.

Have I ever lied to you?

You've got a point.

A favor?

There's no need to be shy.

1036

We are husband and wife.

Of course, I'll help.

I brought you food.

All the soldiers of the eight battalions

are the soldiers who have worked
for the previous emperors.
