00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,480
Tell him that my condition has gotten worse

168
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,239
and can't greet him
because I can't get out of bed.

169
00:08:12,239 --> 00:08:12,839
Go.

170
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:13,760
Yes, Master.

171
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:16,959
Sir.

172
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:18,959
You haven't attended the assembly in days.

173
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,399
And you are going to give His Majesty
the cold shoulder today?

174
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:22,880
Of course.

175
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,000
He hates that I'm in control of everything,
doesn't he?

176
00:08:25,119 --> 00:08:26,880
So, I'll let go of that control now.

177
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:28,119
Go.

178
00:08:28,239 --> 00:08:29,600
Ask my wife to wait for me at the backdoor.

179
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,839
It's such a beautiful day.

180
00:08:34,359 --> 00:08:35,440
Now that I'm free,

181
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,640
why should I deal with the Emperor?

182
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,079
I should go for a walk with my wife.

183
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,000
Go now.

184
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:40,839
Yes, sir.

[Grand Chancellor's Residence]

186
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:57,719
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

187
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:00,000
My master's condition has gotten worse.

188
00:09:00,119 --> 00:09:01,119
He can't get up from his bed.

189
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,679
His message is loud and clear.

190
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:04,840
He won't see me.

191
00:09:05,719 --> 00:09:06,400
Shuan.

192
00:09:07,359 --> 00:09:08,200
Announce the decree.

193
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:11,200
A decree from His Majesty.

194
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:14,719
[Decree]
"The Grand Chancellor has fallen sick from work.

195
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,520
He should be resting.

196
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,000
But my coronation is in seven days.

197
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,599
As the Grand Chancellor of the nation,

198
00:09:20,599 --> 00:09:21,679
he's the pillar of the country.

199
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:22,719
He is the guest of honor.

200
00:09:22,719 --> 00:09:23,880
So he has to attend

201
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,840
the coronation ceremony."

202
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:25,559
End of the decree.

203
00:09:26,359 --> 00:09:27,080
Take the decree.

204
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:28,520
I don't dare to do it.

205
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:31,559
Shuan.

206
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,080
Go.

207
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:37,799
Let's go back.

208
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:38,679
Return to the palace!

209
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,980
[Imperial Decree]

210
00:09:50,599 --> 00:09:52,919
What does the decree

211
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:53,919
by our son-in-law mean?

212
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,359
He forces me to show up

213
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,080
and crown him myself.

214
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,159
That's an interesting strategy.

215
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,000
You are so annoying.

216
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,280
Scorpion Liu, let me tell you.

217
00:10:07,479 --> 00:10:09,599
I don't care what your plot is.

218
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,679
Our son-in-law was at our front door,

219
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:12,559
but you wouldn't let him in.

220
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:13,760
What is the matter?

221
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:14,719
I'll go and invite him.

222
00:10:15,599 --> 00:10:16,599
Going out is more important.

223
00:10:16,599 --> 00:10:18,200
You haven't toured the capital, have you?

224
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,200
I'll show you around now.

225
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,159
No. I want to go out, but...

226
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:21,960
There's no but.

227
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,919
Let's go.

228
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:23,880
Let's go.

229
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,039
Your Majesty.

230
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,239
I've been thinking about it the whole way back.

231
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,320
Why do you want to force Liu Xie to come out?

232
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:34,799
Isn't it better to let him hide?

233
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:35,880
Not necessarily.

234
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,559
If Liu Xie continues to be absent,

235
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,840
not only others will feel uneasy about it,

236
00:10:42,359 --> 00:10:45,239
but it'll also be harder for me
to take over the reins.

237
00:10:46,599 --> 00:10:47,359
If that happens,

238
00:10:47,359 --> 00:10:49,119
even when I take over the reins,

239
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:51,200
it won't be in a proper manner.

240
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:53,679
And the other officials fear Liu Xie.

241
00:10:54,359 --> 00:10:55,799
They are afraid that he'll seek revenge on them.

242
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,000
So, I'm afraid that they'll try to handicap me.

243
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:04,000
Why didn't I think of that?

244
00:11:04,359 --> 00:11:05,000
Your Majesty.

245
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,799
What should we do then?

246
00:11:08,359 --> 00:11:09,239
So,

247
00:11:10,119 --> 00:11:12,799
I want him to crown me in front of everyone.

248
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,239
I want to tell him that I'm an adult now.

249
00:11:15,479 --> 00:11:17,359
So, if he still doesn't let me take over the reins,

250
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,119
it means he wants to revolt against me.

251
00:11:21,239 --> 00:11:22,440
I see.

252
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:24,840
But what if Scorpion Liu

253
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:26,080
doesn't attend the coronation?

254
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,359
Then, I'll wait.

255
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,559
Until he's blamed for the delay of my coronation.

256
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:35,840
Let the people condemn him.

257
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,640
Then, we'll find out

258
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,919
what his intentions are.

259
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
You are brilliant.

260
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:43,440
Since you already found out

261
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,200
that Her Majesty didn't poison you,

262
00:11:45,359 --> 00:11:47,239
are you going to release her from the Cold Palace?

263
00:11:47,599 --> 00:11:48,520
I better don't.

264
00:11:49,599 --> 00:11:51,799
She'll want to leave the palace if she comes out.

265
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,359
The situation is different now.

266
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:54,479
I don't want her

267
00:11:54,479 --> 00:11:56,719
to become the variable between me and Liu Xie.

268
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,239
Is that really the reason why?

269
00:11:58,559 --> 00:11:59,799
What other reasons do I have?

270
00:12:00,359 --> 00:12:01,960
Maybe you don't want her

271
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,919
to leave the palace.

272
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,640
What nonsense are you talking about?

273
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,479
Did I not make myself clear?

274
00:12:07,479 --> 00:12:08,080
Come on.

275
00:12:08,479 --> 00:12:09,719
Let me tell you again

276
00:12:09,719 --> 00:12:10,520
about the pros and cons.

277
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,440
Don't.

278
00:12:11,719 --> 00:12:13,000
The issue between you and your wife is above me.

279
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,559
Whatever you say is right.

280
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:15,239
I'll get going now.

281

You...

282
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:20,679
How reckless.

283
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,239
Finally, I had a good night's sleep.

284
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,119
I'm hungry, Sufang.

285
00:12:30,119 --> 00:12:31,239
Me too.

286
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,760
Your Majesty, it's time for your meal.

287
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:35,799
It came right on time.

288
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:40,679
So little food?

289
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:42,119
It's not even enough!

290
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,359
It's time for Her Majesty to go on a diet.

291
00:12:44,359 --> 00:12:45,000
You...

292
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
What did you say?

293
00:12:47,359 --> 00:12:48,599
Which division are you from?

294
00:12:48,599 --> 00:12:49,080
You are so rude!

295
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:49,919
Forget it, Sufang.

296
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,080
I think it's Duan Yunzhang
who asked her to do this.

297
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:54,000
Go back and tell His Majesty

298
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,320
that he's so benevolent.

299
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,559
His benevolence is as much as the rice here!

We'll have to feed ourselves.

How can we drink this, Your Majesty?

306
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:21,200
Duan Yunzhang doesn't even give us some water!

307

How about we go out and hunt some birds again?

It's raining so heavily outside.

00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:26,159
Believe in me.

333
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:37,799
Your Majesty.

334
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,760
Did you come to me today

335
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,640
because the Queen did something again?

336
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,200
Your Majesty.

337
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:45,799
Two nights ago,

338
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:48,039
Her Majesty caught rats at the Cold Palace.

339
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,159
Yesterday, she only got

340
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:52,359
a little bit of rice and some greens.

341
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:55,520
And there's a lot of dirt inside the well.

342
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,719
We can't drink from it at all.

343
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,559
There was heavy rain at night.

344
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,640
And it made a huge hole in the roof.

345
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:03,039
She doesn't get to eat well or sleep well.

346
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:05,679
She has no energy to do anything.

347
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:08,039
Is that so?

348
00:15:08,599 --> 00:15:10,080
I'm telling the truth.

349
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,640
I wouldn't lie to you.

350
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,719
(I never thought that Liu Jinfeng)

351
00:15:13,719 --> 00:15:15,400
(would one day be in such a predicament.)

352
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:18,520
(But these tricks are too petty.)

353
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,760
(I wonder who did those things.)

354
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:22,280
Sufang.

355
00:15:23,359 --> 00:15:25,000
I sent you to spy on her.

356
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,440
But you keep defending her.

357
00:15:28,359 --> 00:15:29,679
Looks like

358
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:31,760
your loyalty lies with her now.

359
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,520
Your Majesty.

360
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,640
I'm just telling the truth.

361
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,760
Okay. I got it.

362
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,239
I'll ask Su Jingtang to withdraw a few guards.

363
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,559
As for what to do say,

364
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,400
just convey my message.

365
00:15:52,599 --> 00:15:53,200
Yes, Your Majesty.

366
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:54,880
I'll get going now.

367
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:06,080
Your Majesty, hurry up and come in.

368
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:06,719
There's no one here.

369
00:16:10,119 --> 00:16:10,679
Sufang.

370
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:12,400
There's really no one here. They are all gone.

371
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,599
There is so much food here.

372
00:16:13,599 --> 00:16:14,960
Can we just take the food?

373
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,479
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

374
00:16:16,479 --> 00:16:17,200
I already know

375
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,039
the working shift of all the guards.

376
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:20,400
No one will be patrolling

377
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,799
around the Imperial Kitchen right now.

378
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,159
When did you find out this information?

379
00:16:24,719 --> 00:16:25,440
Well...

380
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:26,719
Your Majesty.

381
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:27,640
Hurry up and choose the food that you want.

382
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,440
That's right.

383
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:29,640
I want this eggplant.

384
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,239
Here.

385
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:31,880
Take this too.

386
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,840
Let's get a Chinese sausage too.

387
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,520
Yes.

388
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,840
I'll take one cabbage too.

389
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,320
Cabbage.

390
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,919
-I'll take some celery too.
-I'll take...

391
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:38,880
More food here.

392
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,100
Sufang.

393
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,580
Did we take the wrong route?

394
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:50,940
This is not the route to the Cold Palace.

395
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:51,500
Your Majesty.

396
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,420
This path will lead us to the warehouse.

397
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:54,980
Maybe we'll be able to pick up something

398
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:55,980
that we need.

399
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,260
We won't be that lucky.

400
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,700
Your Majesty, look.

401
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:06,980
Your Majesty, come here!

402
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,220
We are really lucky.

403
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:10,900
Sufang.

404
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,260
Now, we have everything we need.

405
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:12,780
Let's go.

406
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:20,460
Your Majesty.

407
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:22,300
Do you want me to go up and help you?

408
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,780
How can I let you do this kind of heavy labor?

409
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:25,980
I can do it myself.

410
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,860
Okay now. It's all done.

411
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:44,700
Sufang.

412
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,220
We made a mistake.

413
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,540
We should've lain down in the house

414
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,940
and enjoyed the moon
before we fixed the hole on the roof.

415
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:51,140
Your Majesty.

416
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,140
Hurry up and come down.

417
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,220
Isn't it better for us

418
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,620
to enjoy the moon while we grill some meat

419
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:55,860
in the courtyard?

420
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,300
You are right.

421
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:58,780
I'm coming.

422
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,380
Your Majesty, here you go.

423
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,540
It smells so good.

424
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,460
The moon tonight is so beautiful.

425
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,700
That's right. It's beautiful.

426
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,220
Your Majesty.

427
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,060
The water is still dirty.

428
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,620
We can't drink it at all.

429
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:25,860
Your Majesty.

430
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:29,700
Your Majesty.

431
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,420
What kind of a new toy is this?

432
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,820
You'll know soon.

433
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:36,180
This is a simple water filter that I invented.

434
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,780
Water filter.

435
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,020
Can it really filter the water?

436
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:44,420
Look.

437
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,980
The water is really flowing out of it.

438
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:47,140
Your Majesty.

439
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,660
We have clean water now.

440
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,420
That's right.

441
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,580
Your Majesty, you are amazing!

442
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,540
Now, we can cook rice with the rice.

443
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,140
Let's get more water.

444
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:55,900
Here.

445
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:57,180
Is this enough?

446
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:57,660
It's enough.

447
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:58,860
-It's enough. Let's go.
-Let's go.

448
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,020
Let's go and cook.

449
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,500
Let's go.

450
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,300
Are you sure you saw it correctly?

451
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,940
She has liquor, meat, and water?

452
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,820
She's not crying, throwing a tantrum,

453
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:10,740
or getting mad?

454
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,140
That's impossible.

455
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,580
My plan is so meticulous.

456
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,060
There's no way for her to live so comfortably.

457
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:30,900
Fine.

458
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,260
You are very resourceful, aren't you?

459
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,780
I'll have to step up my game then.

460
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,100
These are enough to make four dishes
and a bowl of soup, right?

461
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,620
Of course, Your Majesty.

462
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,660
The vegetables are quite fresh.

463
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,220
We have my favorite greens too.

464
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:50,780
Hurry up, Sufang.

465
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:52,260
Come here. Hurry up.

466
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:55,580
-Your Highness.
-How is it?

467
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,500
They are inside.

468
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,100
Good.

469
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:06,740
Sufang.

470
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,340
Where did these wasps come from?

471
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,380
This is so scary.

472
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,300
It's so terrifying!

473
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,020
-Sufang!
-Your Majesty!

474
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:12,980
Your Majesty.

475
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,660
The wasps are coming to sting me!

476
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,140
I'll chase them away for you!

477
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,780
This is bad! My face is going to be ruined!

478
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,620
Don't be afraid, Your Majesty!

479
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:21,220
-Your Majesty!
-I can't take it anymore!

480
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:21,780
Your Majesty!

481
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,340
I'm going to faint.

482
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,780
Your Majesty, don't faint!

483
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,060
Your Majesty, I'll chase all the wasps away!

484
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,580
It's safe now, Your Majesty!

485
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,780
Wake up! Don't scare me!

486
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:33,740
She fainted?

487
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:36,060
Wake up, Your Majesty!

488
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:36,900
I will go take a look.

489
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,140
Your Majesty, wake up!

490
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:43,500
Where are they?

491
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,100
Don't come after me!

492
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:55,820
Yunyan.

493
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:56,380
Don't come after me!

494
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,300
Get out now.

495
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:58,140
Get out.

496
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,380
Hurry up and run.

497
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:04,980
Hurry up.

498
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,780
Yunyan, why are you here?

499
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:07,660
Are you okay?

500
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,460
Your Majesty, don't touch it.

501
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,220
You were stung by a wasp.

502
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,180
I was stung?

503
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:14,260
Is it swelling?

504
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,060
A little bit.

505
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,260
No wonder it's so painful.

506
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,100
Don't touch it.

507
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,540
Why did you help me?

508
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:19,940
I was the one who...

509
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,220
I didn't want them to sting your cute face

510
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:21,940
and ruin it.

511
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:22,620
Let me tell you.

512
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:23,540
If it was Yunzhang,

513
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:25,340
I would have left him to die.

514
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:26,860
It feels hot over here.

515
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,860
What about our food?

516
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,180
It wasn't easy for us to steal the food.

517
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,580
-What a pity.
-That's right.

518
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,100
We stole the food for nothing.

519
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:40,220
How can she leave without thanking you?

520
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,580
No wonder no one likes her.

521
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,340
What do you mean by that?

522
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:45,860
Don't you know, Your Majesty?

523
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:46,620
It's so painful.

524
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:47,860
You can tell me while we treat my wound.

525
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:48,780
Okay.

526
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,460
Greetings, Your Highness.

527
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:57,420
May I know why Your Highness summoned me?

528
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,180
It's nothing.

529
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,060
Come and take a seat.

530
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:02,620
But...

531
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,180
Don't be shy. Come and take a seat.

532
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:07,780
Thank you, Your Highness.

533
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,740
Baiyu, don't get me wrong.

534
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,860
I just want to chat with you.

535
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,820
When you first entered the palace,

536
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:23,460
you already left a deep impression on me.

537
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:26,260
But I didn't have the chance

538
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,860
to spend some time with you.

539
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,540
Thank you, Your Highness.

540
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:34,260
Your father is so cruel.

541
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,940
You are such an amazing lady.

542
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,180
Whenever I see you standing

543
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,940
together with the Queen,

544
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:48,340
I always have the wrong impression,

545
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:49,620
thinking that you are the Queen instead.

546
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:54,540
After all, when it comes
to appearance and upbringing,

547
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,540
you are more fitting

548
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:58,540
as the motherly model of the nation.

549
00:22:59,300 --> 00:22:59,860
No.

550
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,020
I wouldn't dare.

551
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,860
But fate is such a tricky thing.

552
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:12,060
I heard that if it weren't for Liu Jinfeng,

553
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,980
you would've been the Queen instead.

554
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,620
It's already in the past.

555
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,540
It's not too late to mention it now.

556
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:24,580
Baiyu.

557
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,620
I really adore you.

558
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,100
That's why I say this to you.

559
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:33,020
Since you are in the palace now,

560
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:34,820
you'll have to rely on yourself

561
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,940
to build your future.

562
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:37,940
Right?

563
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,340
If you are free,

564
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,860
you should spend more time with me.

565
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,860
If you are facing any difficulties,

566
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,100
I'll be sure to help you.

567
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:52,660
Understand?

568
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,100
Your Majesty.

569
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,420
Will this work?

570
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,940
How about I go to the Lingshu Academy

571
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,220
to get you some medicine?

572
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:05,300
It's okay, Sufang.

573
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,540
My mother taught me

574
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:07,340
that if I'm stung by a wasp,

575
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,460
I just need to apply some wild grass

576
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:09,540
that can take away the heat and venom.

577
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:10,980
Your Majesty.

578
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,780
You really know a lot of things.

579
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:13,980
Sufang.

580
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:14,980
Continue with your story.

581
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,700
Why is Yunyan so unpopular?

582
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:19,860
That's a long story.

583
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,260
Chain of contempt?

584
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:28,300
Why will this bad habit exist in the palace?

585
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,300
Your Majesty, keep it down.

586
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,660
Let me tell you in detail.

587
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,860
At the top of the chain of contempt,

588
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:37,780
lies the Empress Dowager.

589
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:40,420
It's then followed by the Consort Dowager.

590
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:44,420
Next, it's Prince Yunchong.

591
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,820
What about Yunyan?

592
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:46,660
Yunyan?

593
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,380
She's at the bottom.

594
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,700
Although Yunyan and Yunchong

595
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,180
are both the Consort Dowager's children,

596
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:58,580
the treatment they get is totally different.

597
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:02,420
I heard that when the Consort Dowager
was giving birth to Yunyan,

598
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,780
she had a hysteria.

599
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:04,980
She almost

600
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:06,660
choked her to death.

601
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:12,700
Everyone in the palace knows
that Yunyan is not favored.

602
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:15,180
So, Yunyan

603
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,660
always wants to act fierce in front of the maids.

604
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:21,620
So, she comes off as arrogant and bossy.

605
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:25,180
Maybe she just needs some love.

606
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:26,780
She needs some love?

607
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:29,100
Looks like I'm not the only one

608
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,380
who's suffering inside this palace.

609
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,540
People in the Imperial Palace
are so cold and snobbish.

610
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:35,380
Life is hard inside here.

611
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:03,780
This is...

612
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:06,420
This is the medicine for your face.

613
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:08,780
I have my own medicine.

614
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:10,060
Look. It's almost gone now.

615
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:12,380
Eat the food then.

616
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:14,260
Thank you for saving me.

617
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:16,100
So much food.

618
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,180
Let's eat together.

619
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:19,100
I don't want to eat with you.

620
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:21,060
Did you poison the food?

621
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:23,300
Impossible.

622
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:23,860
I...

623
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:28,700
I ate it too.

624
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,020
I was joking.

625
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,380
How can you be so cute?

626
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:34,620
You always say that I'm cute.

627
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:35,700
So annoying.

628
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,020
Sufang, sit down.

629
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:37,740
Let's eat together.

630
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:38,580
Come on.

631
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:40,700
Come on.

632
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,140
Thank you, Your Majesty.

633
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:46,820
Dig in.

634
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,060
Let's eat together.

635
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:52,220
Let's make some clay dolls after we eat.

636
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:53,780
Clay dolls?

637
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:56,740
What's so fun about making clay dolls?

638
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,340
Think of it as keeping me company then.

639
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:00,700
Fine.

640
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:07,380
This is so good.

641
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:12,660
Zhang.

642
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,460
After your coronation,

643
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,260
you'll be a true adult.

644
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:16,860
Yes.

645
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:20,340
I'll work even harder after this.

646
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,620
That's not what I meant.

647
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:23,780
I just want to say

648
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,500
that the nation can't be without a queen.

649
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,620
Now that the Queen
is banished into the Cold Palace,

650
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,460
you have to do something about it.

651
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:30,860
Are you saying

652
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:33,500
that I should let her out?

653
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,660
What I mean is

654
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:38,540
that you can consider

655
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,780
adding someone new to the Imperial Harem.

656
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,260
You know Liu Baiyu, don't you?

657
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,220
She's beautiful,

658
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:46,580
well educated, and outstanding.

659
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,340
I think she's a good match for you.

660
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:49,820
If you like her,

661
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:50,580
-I...
-Mother.

662
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,420
Now that the Grand Chancellor
is not managing the national affairs,

663
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:56,620
I have so much work to do.

664
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:58,700
I don't have time for this.

665
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,500
We can talk about it again after I'm done

666
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,580
with my work.

667
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:05,460
I have to leave now.

668
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,620
Yunyan, here you go.

669
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,300
I made this especially for you.

670
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:25,180
This...

671
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:27,700
Is this me?

672
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:28,460
Of course.

673
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:29,860
She's so cute. Who else can she be?

674
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:33,900
(No one has ever given me a clay doll.)

675
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,140
What do you think? Do you like it?

676
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:36,220
Yes.

677
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:37,860
You can come here often.

678
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:38,860
We can have a lot of fun here.

679
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,740
Yunzhang is going to have his birthday soon,

680
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:44,900
how about you make one for him?

681
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,580
Duan Yunzhang?

682
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:48,220
Don't even think about it.

683
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:54,260
Actually, he's been quite upset lately.

684
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:57,580
Imperial Physician Shen from Lingshu Academy
suddenly passed away.

685
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:58,540
What?

686
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:00,780
Shen Ao is dead?

687
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,020
What happened?

688
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:03,940
I don't know.

689
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:06,220
It's not my place to meddle in.

690
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:08,660
I just think

691
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:10,340
that you are so good at making clay dolls.

692
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,780
If you make one for him,

693
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:12,780
he may release you

694
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:14,140
from the Cold Palace if he's happy.

695
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:16,660
You want me to yield to Duan Yunzhang?

696
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:17,940
Never.

697
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:20,340
Not only did he lock me in this Cold Palace,

698
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,460
but he also made things difficult for me.

699
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:22,940
The food, the well,

700
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:24,100
and the hole on the roof.

701
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,300
I won't forget those things he did.

702
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,340
I'm sorry, Sister-in-law.

703
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:33,740
Actually, I'm the one who did those things.

704
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,220
-What?
-What?

705
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:41,020
Your Majesty.

706
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:43,940
Actually, when we stole
from the Imperial Kitchen

707
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,660
and got the materials on our way

708
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:47,020
to the warehouse to fix the roof,

709
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:50,220
everything was arranged by His Majesty.

710
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:51,980
-What?
-What?

711
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:57,700
(Are both of them the shy type?)

712
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,980
(Didn't Duan Yunzhang say that he'll punish me)

713
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:02,140
(after searching Xiangluo Hall?)

714
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,660
(He's still not here after so long.)

715
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,820
(Did he do these things)

716
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:09,020
(because he doesn't want me to leave the palace?)

717
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:12,860
My dear sister-in-law,

718
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,420
please make one for him.

719
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:15,540
What?

720
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:32,300
(Your Majesty.)

Fengyue.

00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:45,820
Look.

742
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,580
Is this a nice pose?

743
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:49,380
You look beautiful no matter how you pose.

744
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:52,140
Do you think His Majesty will like it?

745
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:54,900
So many men in the imperial capital

746
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,540
are taken with your beauty.

747
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:58,180
I'm sure His Majesty will too.

748
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:00,860
But...

749
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:03,980
But what?

750
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:06,700
But first, His Majesty has to walk down

751
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,580
this really long corridor
after the morning assembly.

752
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,740
The Consort Dowager said

753
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,860
that His Majesty will definitely
use this path after the morning assembly.

754
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,060
I'm sure she's right.

755
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:17,460
Young Lady.

756
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:18,740
Hurry up, His Majesty is here.

757
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,900
Hurry up and check my hair.

758
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,020
You look very nice.

759
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:24,420
You look beautiful.

760
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:39,300
Yong Lady.

761
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:40,500
Your Majesty.

762
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,140
She sprained her ankle.

763
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:46,300
Greetings, Your Majesty.

764
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:50,340
Your Majesty,

765
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,620
I was practicing my dance.

766
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,980
But there are some moves that I can't master yet.

767
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:55,900
I heard that you are an expert
in music and dancing.

768
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,460
Can you give me some pointers?

769
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,820
You sprained your ankle, so you shouldn't dance.

770
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:02,860
I didn't.

771
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:04,340
Fengyue was too anxious.

772
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:05,660
I can dance for you now.

773
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:19,940
Hurry up, Sufang.

774
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,380
We have to get to Xuanchen Hall
before Duan Yunzhang

775
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:22,260
finishes his morning assembly.

776
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:22,860
Your Majesty.

777
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,780
You are giving His Majesty his birthday gift.

778
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:26,260
You're not doing something bad.

779
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,620
Why do you have to sneak around?

780
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:28,460
What do you know?

781
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:29,340
I'm giving him a gift.

782
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,980
But it doesn't mean that I want to see him.

783
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,900
If I see him again, I'll get angry...

784
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:42,060
Your Majesty.

785
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,940
Don't be mad.

786
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:46,460
It's okay. I'm not mad.

787
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:52,180
You are bending your waist
at an incredible angle.

788
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:54,660
Your sleeves are flowing as if they are flying.

789
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,740
You dance like swallows

790
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:58,980
in the snow.

791
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:01,860
You can dance perfectly.

792
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:03,780
I don't know

793
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:05,620
what else you need to work on.

794
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:08,380
Is His Majesty

795
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,060
complimenting Baiyu?

796
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:10,940
Your Majesty.

797
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:12,420
Can't you tell?

798
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:13,380
Liu Baiyu

799
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:15,420
is trying to seduce His Majesty.

800
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,100
Even the other consorts do this

801
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,740
in private.

802
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:19,900
But she's doing this

803
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,020
in broad daylight.

804
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:22,940
How dare she tries to seduce His Majesty
in such an open place?

805
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,100
Your Majesty.

806
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:25,900
You can't be lenient to her

807
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,100
just because you are her sister.

808
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:28,980
You have to teach her a lesson.

809
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:30,380
Should we go there

810
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:32,020
and tear off her hair?

811
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,300
Okay. Let's go.

812
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,140
Really?

813
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:41,500
Do you really think that it's good?

814
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:44,500
So, what do you want to show me?

815
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,820
Didn't you say that you have some moves
that you can't master?

816
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:50,500
Isn't it better that I can master
all the moves well?

817
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:52,900
This is so pointless.

818
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,820
You made me stand here for so long for nothing.

819
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:56,020
Your Majesty.

820
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:59,580
Was the dance not nice enough

821
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:00,980
or was it too simple?

822
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:03,500
I can dance while reciting some poetic words too.

823
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:05,500
Those are not important.

824
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:07,380
Not important?

825
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:10,140
I have both the talents and the good looks.

826
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:13,100
At first, I wanted to perform this dance for you

827
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,340
during your birthday.

828
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:17,460
So, I wanted to show it to you first.

829
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:19,620
I never thought that you would dislike it.

830
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:22,260
Since it was for my birthday,

831
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:25,500
why didn't you keep it to yourself
until the day itself?

832
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:27,100
Why did you show it to me now?

833
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:28,380
What is the point of this?

834
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:31,940
What is meaningful to you, then?

835
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:35,700
Obviously...

836
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,540
(Why am I thinking about that bumpkin?)

837
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:11,020
(I shouldn't have that kind of taste.)

838
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:12,940
(I must be too busy lately.)

839
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:14,020
(That's why I'm hallucinating.)

840
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:18,220
Your Majesty.

841
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:21,900
Your Majesty, what's wrong?

842
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:22,620
Don't come closer!

843
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:27,660
I can't seem to get rid of the daughters
of the Liu family.

844
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:29,860
But let me tell you.

845
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:31,860
Don't try to seduce me.

846
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:33,940
I won't fall for you.

847
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:41,220
Young Lady, it's okay.

848
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:43,380
As expected from His Majesty.

849
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:45,940
He doesn't have the same mindset as the others.

850
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,740
How did it turn out to be like this?

851
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:58,860
Your Majesty.

852
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:00,940
Why didn't you teach her a lesson just now?

853
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,180
Why did you leave instead?

854
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,700
Why should I teach her a lesson?

855
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:06,100
Obviously, Baiyu has listened to me.

856
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:08,380
She has made up her mind
to replace me as the Queen.

857
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:10,180
So, she's seducing His Majesty now.

858
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:12,220
Besides, I think His Majesty

859
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:14,060
has feelings for her too.

860
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:15,500
Why do I think

861
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,500
that His Majesty has zero interest in her?

862
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:19,660
He even complimented her.
That's not zero interest.

863
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:21,740
Fine. He's interested in her.

864
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:23,620
As long as you are happy.

865
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:24,940
I'm happy.

866
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:26,060
I'm ecstatic.

867
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:27,660
I'll regain my freedom soon.

868
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:29,100
I feel so glad.

869
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,220
Why do I think

870
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:35,500
that you are not happy?

871
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:36,460
I am happy.

872
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:37,740
I'm really happy.

873
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,860
I feel so energetic when I think about it.

874
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:43,460
I'm ecstatic.

875
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:03,740
What are you doing?

876
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:06,220
Your Majesty, you are making me dizzy.

877
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:07,980
Where do you want to go?

878
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:10,620
The Western Cold Palace.

879
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:13,580
Are you going to visit Her Majesty?

880
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:14,220
Yes.

881
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:16,020
I want to see for myself

882
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:18,060
if she's really that scary in private.

883
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,140
I don't want to be deceived by her looks.

884
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:29,100
Sufang, what sound is that?

885
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:30,500
Your Majesty.

886
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,620
The guards are training on the field nearby.

887
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,580
Where are you going, Your Majesty?

888
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:36,460
I want to watch them.

889
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:37,940
Isn't it great to watch so many handsome men
without their shirts on

890
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,100
wielding the weapons and fighting each other?

891
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,540
You can't do that.

892
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:41,860
Why not?

893
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,340
It's not proper for a queen to do so.

894
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:46,060
It's not proper for Duan Yunzhang
to watch a girl dance either.

895
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:47,340
We can be improper together.

896
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:50,660
But theoretically,
you are still being grounded right now.

897
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:51,540
Since we sneaked out,

898
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:53,100
we can't show up so blatantly.

899
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,140
That's easy.

900
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:14,580
Your Majesty, come down.

901
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:16,660
It'll be bad if someone sees you.

902
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,100
It has been a long time

903
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:21,100
since I last saw such virile men.

904
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:22,220
They are so muscular.

905
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:23,220
I'll watch them for one more moment.

906
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:24,460
Sufang, it'll be your turn next.

907
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:25,860
Your Majesty.

908
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:29,220
Your Majesty.

909
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:30,620
Come down.

910
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:33,700
No.

911
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,660
Don't forget about your status.

912
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:37,860
You are the Queen.

913
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:39,900
I know.

914
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:42,220
I'm the Queen in the Cold Palace.

915
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:44,100
Duan Yunzhang.

916
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:46,020
Since we are just husband and wife in name

917
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,020
and we hate each other,

918
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,940
you should just enjoy your dance,

919
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:50,420
while I watch the men doing their training.

920
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:51,620
We can just do what we like.

921
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:53,020
What dance?

922
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:57,220
Liu Baiyu said

923
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:58,740
that it was supposed to be my birthday present.

924
00:39:58,740 --> 00:39:59,420
Your Majesty.

925
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:01,860
Her Majesty wanted to give you
a birthday present too.

926
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:03,180
She made a clay doll herself.

927
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:04,220
I didn't.

928
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:05,020
It was a failed product.

929
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:06,100
I already crushed it.

930
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:08,540
(She doesn't even want
to give me a failed clay doll.)

931
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:09,900
(She even destroyed it.)

932
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,500
(She's indeed scary.)

933
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:13,660
(Hurry up)

934
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:15,180
(and invite me to your birthday party.)

935
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:16,700
(Then, I'll reluctantly forgive you)

936
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,580
(for sending me into the Cold Palace.)

937
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,740
Looks like you are enjoying your life

938
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:23,020
in the Cold Palace.

Shuan.

940
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:27,220
Send someone to increase
the height of the walls around this palace.

941
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:31,940
What?

942
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:33,940
I can't believe you, Duan Yunzhang.

943
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:35,380
Not only did you send me into the Cold Palace,

944
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:37,140
but now, you also want to take away
my entertainment?

945
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:39,020
Fine. Increase the height of the walls.

946
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,220
The higher your walls are,

947
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:41,940
the higher my ladder can be.

948
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:43,140
You can try.

Shuan.

950
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:49,140
Go back and tell Tang

951
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:50,540
to train at another place.

952
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:51,340
They are too noisy.

953
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:52,860
They've disturbed the Queen.

954
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:55,220
What? They are not noisy at all.

955
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:56,500
Are you doing this on purpose?

956

Yes, I am.

Another thing.

958
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:02,500
Take apart this ladder and use it as firewood.

959
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:04,420
Yes, Your Majesty.

960
