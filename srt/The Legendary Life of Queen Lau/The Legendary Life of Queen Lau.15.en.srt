00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,919
we can talk about them.

168
00:09:02,479 --> 00:09:03,280
What is

169
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,720
this?

170
00:09:06,319 --> 00:09:07,040
This one?

171
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,439
This is an unfinished product.

172
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,360
I still haven't figured it out yet.

173
00:09:11,439 --> 00:09:12,999
But I'm going to add some fishing lines to it.

174
00:09:12,999 --> 00:09:14,519
Then, I'll be able to move it.

175
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,519
Look.

176
00:09:16,199 --> 00:09:17,559
Doesn't it look like me?

177
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,759
Yes.

178
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:23,999
What about this?

179
00:09:24,119 --> 00:09:24,879
What is this?

180
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:25,920
This one?

181
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:28,119
This is the ingenious lock designed by me.

182
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:29,720
Let me tell you.

183
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,119
Those things in the palace...

184
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,160
So it can...

185
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:44,840
Okay.

186
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,680
Three is enough.

187
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,639
You don't have to continue.

188
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,040
Your Highness.

189
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,400
I have a question for you.

190
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:52,680
What is it?

191
00:09:53,119 --> 00:09:56,559
Are these things really
more important than studying?

192
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,280
These things are as important as my life.

193
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,840
Does it mean
that you are willing to do anything

194
00:10:03,439 --> 00:10:04,920
for them?

195
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,400
Of course.

196
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,519
Not only...

197
00:10:12,319 --> 00:10:12,959
Liu Baiyu.

198
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,319
You are acting strange today.

199
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,319
Why do you suddenly care for me

200
00:10:18,319 --> 00:10:19,360
and want to talk to me?

201
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,800
Your Highness, you...

202
00:10:24,119 --> 00:10:25,559
Is this how you think about me?

203
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:32,280
Then you are right.

204
00:10:34,199 --> 00:10:35,439
Liu Baiyu, what do you want?

205
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,559
I'm telling you.

206
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,079
I'm not easy prey.

207
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:40,920
Your Highness, you've misunderstood me.

208
00:10:41,439 --> 00:10:43,879
I have zero interest in you.

209
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:46,680
But I'm interested

210
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,280
in these things.

211
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:52,800
What...

212
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,160
You!

213
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:54,879
-What are you doing?
-Stay away!

214
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:55,800
-Give it to me!
-Don't move.

215
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,879
Are you going to study? Do you like to study?

216
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:57,759
Liu Baiyu, let me tell you.

217
00:10:57,759 --> 00:10:58,999
Don't threaten me with my things!

218
00:10:58,999 --> 00:11:00,199
I don't like to study.

219
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,040
Don't!

220
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:01,559
Do you like to study?

221
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:03,199
I'll study the book.

222
00:11:03,199 --> 00:11:04,439
Chushibiao, the Northern Expedition Memorial,
memorize it!

223
00:11:04,439 --> 00:11:05,559
There's no Chushibiao here.

224
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:06,680
-No.
-Your Highness.

225
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,199
Your Highness, look over here.

226
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:10,519
My head!

227
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:11,280
Don't!

228
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,360
I'll study it. I'll memorize it.

229
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:12,920
I'll memorize it.

230
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,559
What's the first sentence in Chushibiao?

231
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,319
When the late emperor
was building the nation...

232
00:11:17,319 --> 00:11:18,199
You are not reciting it well enough.

233
00:11:18,199 --> 00:11:19,040
That's not right. Again.

234
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,119
When the late emperor was building the nation,
the empire was divided into three...

235
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,360
Recite it properly.

236
00:11:26,199 --> 00:11:26,879
Your Highness.

237
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:29,639
Don't you think that Miss Baiyu is too fierce?

238
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:30,759
What do you know?

239
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,759
Finally,

240
00:11:33,199 --> 00:11:34,999
there's hope for my son.

241
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:36,280
Your Highness,

242
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,400
I don't understand.

243
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,439
Why do you like Miss Baiyu so much?

244
00:11:39,439 --> 00:11:41,079
Miss Baiyu is amazing.

245
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,559
She's smart, beautiful,

246
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,639
gentle, and virtuous.

247
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,439
Most importantly...

248
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,680
I understand now.

249
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,920
Most importantly,

250
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,439
she's the daughter of Grand Chancellor Liu.

251
00:11:53,439 --> 00:11:54,160
It'll be helpful

252
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,800
to His Highness in the future.

253
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:56,639
Yes.

254
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,999
That's quite important too.

255
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,240
But the most important thing is...

256
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,400
Look. He can recite Chushibiao already

257
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,519
in such a short time.

258
00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:09,920
Louder.

259
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,759
Please look after Chong for me,

260
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,920
our great ancestors.

261
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,280
Maybe he can get
the Zhuangyuan title this time.

262
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:32,519
You look

263
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:34,439
quite handsome when you just sit here

264
00:12:34,439 --> 00:12:36,280
and say nothing.

265
00:12:39,999 --> 00:12:41,439
You are quite pitiful actually.

266
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:43,920
You are so young.
But you already have to fight with Liu Xie.

267
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,439
No wonder you hate him so much.

268
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:47,240
You are stressing yourself out.

269
00:12:48,439 --> 00:12:50,800
Liu Xie is ruthless, unpredictable,

270
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,959
and cunning.

271
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,400
Meanwhile, you just have a tiny brain

272
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,519
that lacks imagination.

273
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,759
Indeed, you are only good

274
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:57,160
at deceiving me.

275
00:12:59,439 --> 00:13:01,319
Should I just forgive you?

276
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,280
Fine.

277
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:07,400
You had suffered a lot
in the past few days too.

278
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,720
So, I already have my revenge.

279
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,639
We are even now.

280
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,680
I'll count to three.

281
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,639
If you don't say anything,
I'll take it that you agree to it too.

282
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,079
Three.

283
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,040
Two.

284
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,400
You are awake.

285
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:23,999
It was so close.

286
00:13:23,999 --> 00:13:25,400
What do you mean?

287
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:26,639
What do you want?

288
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,119
Nothing.

289
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:29,840
I've already thought it through.

290
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,160
Studying is pointless.

291
00:13:31,439 --> 00:13:32,280
I give up.

292
00:13:37,319 --> 00:13:38,999
So, you know

293
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,360
that you can't defeat me.

294
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,240
That's why you give up, right?

295
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:43,680
You can think however you want.

296
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,079
I just want to fight with you in another way.

297
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:49,639
How?

298
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,920
Follow me if you dare.

299
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:57,430
What's wrong with your nose?

300
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:58,430
What's wrong with yours?

301
00:13:58,439 --> 00:13:59,920
Can't you smell it?

302
00:14:01,439 --> 00:14:02,360
I don't smell anything.

303
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,040
Why did you bring this here?

304
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:04,879
Isn't it obvious?

305
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:05,720
It's for you to wear.

306
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,639
You want me to wear the outfit of a eunuch?

307
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:11,079
Do you want to go louder?

308
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:11,999
So that everyone in the palace

309
00:14:11,999 --> 00:14:13,600
will know that you are going
to wear the outfit of a eunuch.

310
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:16,079
What are you trying to do?

311
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,240
Do you dare to wear it or not?

312
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,400
Just admit defeat if you can't do it.

313
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,040
Why are you standing there?

314
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:36,840
Well.

315
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,119
You want to fight, don't you?

316
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,480
Why are we here then?

317
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,879
What you learned in school is just on paper.

318
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:43,199
I'm going to let you experience it for real.

319
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,480
Experience what?

320
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:45,720
Let's go.

321
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:48,680
Take this.

322
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,119
How insolent of you.

323
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,680
Do you know what is this?

324
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:55,480
Green vegetable.

325
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,319
It's called cabbage.

326
00:14:57,319 --> 00:14:58,680
You eat it every day. How can you not know?

327
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,559
It's even more interesting over there.

328
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,879
Don't simply wander around.

329
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:08,040
What kind of smell is that?

330
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,119
Do you know how many eggs
this chicken will lay?

331
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,439
Ask the chicken.

332
00:15:11,439 --> 00:15:12,360
How will I know?

333
00:15:19,439 --> 00:15:20,119
Three eggs.

334
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,600
Why?

335
00:15:21,999 --> 00:15:23,319
Come here and check it out tomorrow
if you don't believe me.

336
00:15:23,319 --> 00:15:24,280
I'm not that free.

337
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:28,759
What are you doing?

338
00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:29,999
Someone is coming. We have to hide.

339
00:15:29,999 --> 00:15:30,720
What else?

340
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,119
This is your territory.
You have nothing to be afraid of.

341
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,480
Don't talk.

342
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,280
Where are you, thief?

343
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,079
How dare you steal from the imperial farm!

344
00:15:45,119 --> 00:15:45,920
What are you doing?

345
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:48,720
Who is it?

346
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,480
Your master!

347
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,319
You are crazy.

348
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,319
Where is the thief?

349
00:15:58,519 --> 00:15:59,079
Let's go.

350
00:16:01,119 --> 00:16:01,999
We have to hide.

351
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:03,999
I'm so tired.

352
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:04,759
So scary.

353
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:05,360
So you say that now.

354
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,280
This is all your fault.

355
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:08,160
That eunuch is so competent.

356
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,600
Reward him handsomely tomorrow.

357
00:16:12,439 --> 00:16:14,600
Does that chicken really have
three eggs inside its belly?

358
00:16:14,999 --> 00:16:15,879
Why would I lie to you?

359
00:16:16,439 --> 00:16:18,439
Fine. I'll check it tomorrow.

360
00:16:18,439 --> 00:16:20,480
If it's not true, then, it'll be treason.

361
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,920
I won't die for three eggs.

362
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:23,920
He's gone now, right?

363
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,680
What do you think? Is this fun?

364
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:26,759
Yes.

365
00:16:26,999 --> 00:16:27,759
Do you want to have more fun?

366
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:28,400
Lead the way.

367
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:28,999
Let's go.

368
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,920
Enough. Stop it.

369
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,639
Give it a try. It's fun.

370
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:37,480
No.

371
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,480
I'll disturb others from sleeping.

372
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,959
Give it try. It's a new experience.

373
00:16:40,439 --> 00:16:40,879
Hurry up.

374
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:41,720
Just once.

375
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,280
Close your ears.

376
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,439
Isn't it fun?

377
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:47,600
It felt fun.

378
00:16:48,119 --> 00:16:49,199
Do it again.

379
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,079
Who is it?

380
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:53,840
Let's run.

381
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,559
I knew that it was a bad idea.

382
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,079
Who was ringing the bell?

383
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,240
Who is it?

384
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:18,380
[Philosophy]

385
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:20,300
[Philosophy, History, Monograph, Classics]

386
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:23,319
Is this fun?

387
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:23,840
Yes!

388
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:25,559
Where's next?

389
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,079
Let me think.

390
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,119
How about...

391
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:28,759
Who is it?

392
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:29,999
Who is it?

393
00:17:29,999 --> 00:17:31,119
Someone is here. Run.

394
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,519
Who did this?

395
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,200
This...

396
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,200
Chase after the culprit!

397
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:46,719
Roger that!

398
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:54,960
Hurry up.

399
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,599
I can't run anymore.

400
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:56,560
Why are your legs so short?

401
00:17:58,639 --> 00:17:59,639
I have an idea.

402
00:17:59,639 --> 00:18:00,280
Let's hide here.

403
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:00,920
What should we do?

404
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:07,800
What should we do now?

405
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:09,359
Calm down.

406
00:18:09,479 --> 00:18:10,280
I have an idea.

407
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,239
Yes.

408
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,400
This.

409
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:34,119
Over there.

410
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,239
Let's go.

411
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,560
They are gone.

412
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:44,200
Do you want to go somewhere for more fun?

413
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:45,200
We have more places to go?

414
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,040
Of course.

415
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:46,759
Come with me.

416
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:56,719
It's so beautiful.

417
00:18:58,479 --> 00:18:59,280
What do you think?

418
00:18:59,719 --> 00:19:00,759
I didn't lie to you, right?

419
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,440
This is so fun.

420
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,359
You are so uncultured.
Is "fun" the only word in your vocabulary?

421
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,680
What has it got to do with being cultured?

422
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,639
Are you not having fun?

423
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,119
I am.

424
00:19:14,479 --> 00:19:16,400
They say that dog that bites is usually quiet.

425
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,879
You look so serious

426
00:19:17,879 --> 00:19:18,960
usually.

427
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,560
But you can be quite wild too.

428
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,479
Of course.

429
00:19:23,479 --> 00:19:24,440
Who are you calling a dog?

430
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,560
You are a wild beast, okay?

431
00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:28,999
You are so petty.

432
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,080
So petty.

433
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:32,719
Do you know?

434
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,920
What you did tonight

435
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,999
was just a small part of something
I did when I was young.

436
00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:40,479
I had climbed all of the roofs in this palace

437
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,879
when I was young.

438
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,359
I can't believe you.

439
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:45,400
You can compete with me about anything.

440
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,560
But you want to compete in climbing roofs?

441
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,440
Why are you so competitive?

442
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,200
Aren't you tired?

443
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,839
Climbing a roof is nothing to be bragged about.

444
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,839
Back then, I sat on the roof of Taihe Hall

445
00:19:54,999 --> 00:19:57,440
while I tore apart the memorials one by one.

446
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,560
Then, I said this while pointing to Liu Xie.

447
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,160
"Being an emperor is too boring.

448
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:04,239
I don't want to be an emperor anymore.

449
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,999
You can be the emperor instead,
Grand Chancellor Liu."

450
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:08,200
I didn't stop,

451
00:20:08,479 --> 00:20:09,719
my articulation was perfect,

452
00:20:09,999 --> 00:20:11,239
and I didn't even blink at what I said.

453
00:20:12,239 --> 00:20:13,920
You were such a rebel?

454
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,239
I was not a rebel.

455
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,239
I was just tough.

456
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:20,639
Didn't he beat you up?

457
00:20:22,719 --> 00:20:23,680
He did.

458
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,800
But then, I ran away from the palace.

459
00:20:29,239 --> 00:20:31,960
I don't know if you are tough or stupid.

460
00:20:32,239 --> 00:20:33,479
Why did you have

461
00:20:33,479 --> 00:20:35,119
to go against Liu Xie?

462
00:20:35,639 --> 00:20:37,200
Did it cause you any lasting harm?

463
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,560
What nonsense is that?

464
00:20:38,879 --> 00:20:40,400
I'm here in all of my glory, right?

465
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:45,160
Why didn't you want to be the emperor?

466
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,479
In the past few days,
you had been studying the whole day

467
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:49,440
so that you could
take over the imperial affairs.

468
00:20:50,879 --> 00:20:52,920
Everyone was once young and ignorant.

469
00:20:53,639 --> 00:20:54,920
I was still young.

470
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,119
I didn't know how important my duties were.

471
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,400
No. It still doesn't sound right.

472
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:03,800
What do you mean?

473
00:21:05,479 --> 00:21:07,320
How is your wanting to be the emperor

474
00:21:07,479 --> 00:21:09,359
has anything to do
with being afraid of Liu Xie?

475
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:11,710
[Hanyuan Hall]
Is it because you were young and timid?

476
00:21:11,719 --> 00:21:14,119
But you even scolded Liu Xie
while pointing at him.

477
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:15,359
You even ran away from the palace.

478
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:17,599
Why didn't you fight back

479
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:18,800
when he challenged you

480
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,960
for the authority?

481
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,479
You don't know anything.

482
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,960
I was enduring the humiliation
for a greater cause.

483
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,239
I wanted to make him put down his guard.

484
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,239
How did you know about my dark...

485
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,479
My past?

486
00:21:38,999 --> 00:21:41,239
Many people in the palace know about it.

487
00:21:42,239 --> 00:21:43,920
It's not a surprise for me
to know about it too.

488
00:21:44,479 --> 00:21:45,639
I never thought

489
00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:47,560
that you could be so crafty
at such a young age.

490
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,999
Liu Xie is quite ruthless.

491
00:21:49,239 --> 00:21:50,599
But you are treating him so badly now

492
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:52,359
just because he lectured you.

493
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:53,999
You are quite petty.

495
00:21:57,719 --> 00:21:58,759
Do you think

496
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:00,800
that I'm a foolish emperor

497
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,400
who regards my officials as enemies

498
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,920
because I can't take criticism well?

499
00:22:05,639 --> 00:22:06,239
I...

500
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:08,320
I didn't think of you like that.

00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,960
You did.

502
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,479
I can't believe myself.

503
00:22:15,479 --> 00:22:16,839
Why am I here, bracing the cold wind

504
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:17,999
and looking at the imperial capital?

505
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,719
I should go back to my readings.

506
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,680
What are you doing? Calm down.

507
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:25,599
I want to know what happened.

508
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:28,999
Really?

509
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,639
Very much so.

510
00:22:32,999 --> 00:22:33,719
Fine.

511
00:22:34,239 --> 00:22:35,960
Since you care about me so much,

512
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:38,960
I'll show you your father's true color

513
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,639
with words.

514
00:22:41,999 --> 00:22:45,599
We have to start from the time
when I ran away from the palace.

515
00:22:59,200 --> 00:22:59,920
All of you, check over there!

516
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,879
The rest of you, come with me!

517
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:01,639
Roger that!

(To avoid capture,)

519
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:21,080

(and left the imperial capital.)

521
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:26,080
(And I saw that the outside world
was totally different)

522
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,479
(from the life in the palace.)

523
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,239
It was my first time seeing so many people

524
00:23:51,239 --> 00:23:53,680
who were starving
and freezing with nothing to wear.

525
00:23:54,879 --> 00:23:56,999
They just lied on the roadside like animals.

526
00:23:58,239 --> 00:23:59,239
They could die at any time.

527
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,639
So many people were suffering.

[Hanyuan Hall]

529
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,479
After that, I heard from the people

530
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,320
that it was because
of a disastrous flood in the south.

531
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:15,080
When I was in court,

532
00:24:15,639 --> 00:24:17,560
the officials had mentioned it.

533
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,359
And I was given the reports too.

534
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,080
But I tore them apart because it felt boring

535
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:22,920
to me.

536
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:25,759
Don't be too upset about it.

537
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,359
You were young.

538
00:24:27,719 --> 00:24:29,239
You can still change

539
00:24:29,239 --> 00:24:30,519
and be a good emperor.

540
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:31,879
I know.

541
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:35,200
So, after a few days,

542
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,400
I really wanted to come back.

543
00:24:36,999 --> 00:24:38,800
But it would be too embarrassing

544
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,719
to be caught.

545
00:24:40,759 --> 00:24:43,040
So, I wanted to run back
to the Grand Chancellor's Residence

Wasn't that good?

It was.

551
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,440
I thought it was a good idea.

552
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:55,400
But it was just me who felt that way.

553
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,519
Not your father.

554
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,680
You are too humble, Grand Chancellor Liu.

555
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:08,119
Everyone knows that the young Emperor of
the Donghao Empire is ignorant of the affairs.

556
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:10,960
You are the one in charge.

My Lord

559
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:16,920
and take over his position,

560
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:19,479
he will send his army to support you

and help with your cause.

562
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,280
When you succeed,

563
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,239
you just need to give us ten of your cities.

564

I'm grateful for his kindness.

565

If I need it in the future,

566
00:25:29,239 --> 00:25:30,479
I'll ask for his help.

567

What?

568

How dare you collude with Xiyue.

This is treason!

575
00:25:44,639 --> 00:25:46,759
You've betrayed my father's trust

576

by entrusting the nation to you.

577
00:25:48,479 --> 00:25:50,200
I'm going to take away your position
as the Grand Chancellor!

578
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:51,479
Be smart

If I go into prison now,

who is going to deal
with the nation's issues tomorrow?

583
00:26:02,759 --> 00:26:05,479
I'll study hard after this

584
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,080
and protect my father's nation.

585
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,639
I won't let traitors like you steal it away!

586
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,040
Good.

587
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,440
Since you had heard my secret conversation,

588

let me tell you this then.

If I'm going to steal away
Donghao Empire from you,

Kill me?

594
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,879
Looks like you don't
understand the situation yet.

595
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,080
I'm the one who's holding
the reins over the regime

596
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:39,040
and the military power of the Donghao Empire.

597
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,280
You should be grateful

598
00:26:41,479 --> 00:26:42,960
and thank me personally

599
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,440
for not killing you.

600
00:26:44,719 --> 00:26:46,639
You can't be so ungrateful

601
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:48,200
and dream about killing me instead.

602

How are you

603
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,119

sparing your life and making you
into a puppet emperor

608

until you are old enough
to take over the court.

If you make me unhappy one day,

I know that Liu Xie is bad.

Don't worry.

618

This time, you'll be able
to take over the court

There's nothing to be forgiven.

Even if you didn't forgive me,

636

we had done so many things together.

And we even watched the stars together.

638

667
00:29:58,599 --> 00:29:59,639
Don't you know?

668
00:29:59,999 --> 00:30:00,839
What happened last night?

669
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,960
Two assassins sneaked in and caused a mess.

670
00:30:04,239 --> 00:30:05,119
Assassins?

671
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,879
Luckily, nothing major happened.

672
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,960
But Commander Su wanted
to investigate the Imperial Harem.

673
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,839
So, we were all questioned.

674
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,519
That's why I am late.

675
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:22,839
What is it?

676
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:25,479
Are you going to ask me whether or not

677
00:30:25,479 --> 00:30:26,639
I've copied "On the Six Fallen States"?

678
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,519
Not only did I not finish it,

679
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:30,080
but I didn't even start.

680
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,759
Do you feel mad?

681
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,040
But it's pointless for you to be mad today.

682
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:34,719
Look.

683
00:30:34,719 --> 00:30:35,999
There's nothing on my desk.

684
00:30:35,999 --> 00:30:37,200
You can't threaten me now.

685
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,119
Liu Baiyu,

686
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,440
you won't be able

687
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,440
to defeat me.

688
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:46,160
What is this?

689
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,839
You fixed it?

690
00:30:55,519 --> 00:30:56,320
Your Highness.

691
00:30:56,759 --> 00:30:58,239
I thought about it for a long while
after I went back.

692
00:30:58,639 --> 00:31:00,160
I realized

693
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,759
that I was too overbearing last time.

694
00:31:01,879 --> 00:31:03,440
So, I fixed them all

695
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,440
and brought them back to you.

696
00:31:05,879 --> 00:31:06,759
This one too.

697
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,040
This...

698
00:31:12,999 --> 00:31:15,960
I had worked on it for so long.

699
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,879
Why couldn't I fix it?

700
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:23,040
Don't cry.

701
00:31:23,639 --> 00:31:24,999
It's just a toy.

702
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,359
I can just fix it again.

703
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,680
Your Highness.

704
00:31:29,879 --> 00:31:32,320
Actually, I don't want to force you to study.

705
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:34,359
But I have to follow
the orders of Consort Dowager Xu.

706
00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:36,040
I have no choice.

707
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,200
And I'm not the one

708
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,320
who wants you to copy
"On the Six Fallen States".

709
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,960
It's an order from Consort Dowager Xu.

710
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,800
Please help me with it.

711
00:31:42,879 --> 00:31:44,280
Copy it for me.

712
00:31:44,479 --> 00:31:47,119
Or else, Consort Dowager Xu will blame me

713
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,960
for failing.

714
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,080
I never thought that
it would be so hard on you.

715
00:31:54,639 --> 00:31:57,040
I'll get you some tea

716
00:31:57,119 --> 00:31:59,200
while you copy it.

717
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,800
Your Highness, please have some tea.

718
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,479
Fine.

719
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,879
I'll help you then.

720
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,479
But you have to grind the ink for me.

721
00:32:24,759 --> 00:32:25,759
Of course.

722
00:32:26,599 --> 00:32:28,320
Since you've worked so hard today,

723
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,960
I'll allow you to sit down while you serve me.

724
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:32,479
Thank you, Your Highness.

725
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:36,680
(What a fool.)

726
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:39,119
(Threatening you is not
the only method I have.)

727
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,160
(I want to tell you)

728
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,920
(that you'll never be able to defeat me.)

729
00:32:53,879 --> 00:32:54,639
Baiyu.

730
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,800
Help me get that book

731
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,920
on the second row of the book cabinet.

732
00:32:59,080 --> 00:32:59,719
Okay.

733
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,040
Move.

734
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,560
Liu Baiyu, move.

735
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:10,800
Liu Baiyu, let me tell you.

736
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:11,999
Before you came,

737
00:33:11,999 --> 00:33:12,920
I already applied

738
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,639
a layer of superglue on the chair.

739
00:33:14,879 --> 00:33:15,479
You!

740
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:16,560
You didn't expect that, did you?

741
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,359
You are too naive to fight me.

742
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:21,719
Sit tight for today.

743
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,040
I'm going to go out to have fun today.

744
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,080
You can come with me.

745
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,359
But you have to carry the chair yourself.

746
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,400
Come back! You!

747
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,280
Come back!

748
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,320
Duan Yunchong!

749
00:33:51,999 --> 00:33:53,080
(Unfortunately,)

750
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,040
(this place doesn't have
as many stars as Xianpa Village.)

751
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:56,359
(Are you dumb?)

752
00:33:56,359 --> 00:33:58,080
(All the stars in the sky are the same.)

(Fine.)

(Bring me there when we have the chance.)

00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,160
Xuan!

758
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,440
Xuan!

759
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,320
I'm here.

760
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:28,280
What did you call me?

761
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:28,999
Xuan.

762
00:34:28,999 --> 00:34:30,080
Isn't that your name?

763
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,440
Before this, you called me...

764
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:33,560
We are friends now.

765
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,080
I shouldn't call you Duan Yunzhang anymore.

766
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,479
When did we become friends?

767
00:34:37,479 --> 00:34:38,519
Yesterday.

768
00:34:38,519 --> 00:34:40,080
We've reconciled yesterday, right?

769
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,839
Or do you want me to call you Des...

770
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:42,879
Enough.

771
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,440
Xuan is good enough.

772
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:45,559
You can call me that.

773
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:46,720
It's late now.

774
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:47,359
I have to read.

775
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,119
What? Let's go out to play.

776
00:34:49,279 --> 00:34:50,079
Again?

777
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,200
I'll bring you to a place

778
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,200
where you've never been before
within the imperial capital.

779
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:52,879
That's impossible.

780
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:53,760
I've been to every place here.

781
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,119
When have I ever lied to you?

782
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:55,639
Let's go.

783
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:57,680
Hurry up.

784
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,359
Hurry up. I'm sure you've never seen it before.

785
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,559
Hurry up.

786
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:06,920
[Treasure Pavilion]
We are here.

787
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,000
This is the most mysterious place you meant?

788
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:10,920
Yes. The Treasure Pavilion.

789
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:11,760
You've never been here, right?

790
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,520
Let me tell you.

791
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,839
We have a treasure pavilion
in Xianpa Village too.

792
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:14,879
But only the Village Head went there.

793
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:15,720
It's really mysterious.

794
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,000
Why did you bring me here then?

795
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:18,319
To explore it.

796
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:19,680
Maybe we can find some treasures

797
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,599
that I can bring back to my mother.

798
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:21,720
Are you crazy?

799
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,359
Let's go.

800
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:25,420
[Treasure Pavilion]

801
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,960
Why is your family so poor?

802
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,079
You don't have many things here.

803
00:35:32,119 --> 00:35:33,119
I gave most of the treasures out

804
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:34,559
when I married you.

805
00:35:36,039 --> 00:35:36,920
Don't say that.

806
00:35:37,639 --> 00:35:38,599
Since you've visited the place,

807
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:39,559
let's leave now.

808
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,599
No.

809
00:35:40,879 --> 00:35:41,680
Wait.

810
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,440
Wait for what?

811
00:35:43,279 --> 00:35:43,799
Well...

812
00:35:43,799 --> 00:35:45,799
Let me take a look around for a moment.

813
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,680
Who are these men in black?

814
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,400
Who are you?

815
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:52,720
(Why are there two people here?)

816
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,480
(We don't need unnecessary complications.)

817
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:55,960
Retreat!

818
00:36:01,639 --> 00:36:02,799
Be careful, Your Majesty!

819
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:19,440
Stop fighting.

820
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,520
We are on the same side.

821
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:22,079
What do you mean?

822
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,079
Let her go.

823
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:29,839
Holding me hostage will be charged differently.

824
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,079
You are being too serious in this.

825
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,039
We agreed on a simple act, right?

826
00:36:38,039 --> 00:36:39,000
You'll just let us go
when we are outside, right?

827
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:39,920
Why are you fighting him for real?

828
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:40,879
Hurry up and get it done!

829
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,039
Yes.

830
00:36:42,039 --> 00:36:43,400
You'll delay the main course
if you don't cut it out now.

831
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,839
Don't focus on fighting, just get it done!

832
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,039
Yes.

833
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:50,079
You are quite smart.

834
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:50,879
What's your name?

835
00:36:50,879 --> 00:36:52,240
I'll ask your leader
to give you more money later.

836
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:53,480
Our master said

837
00:36:53,799 --> 00:36:54,920
that this should be a covert mission.

838
00:36:55,039 --> 00:36:55,559
Yes.

839
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,079
I didn't say that.

840
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,520
Are you the real assassins?

841
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:10,920
What else do you think?

842
00:37:13,319 --> 00:37:13,960
Your Majesty!

843
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,240
Walk!

844
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,559
Please spare me. We can talk.

845
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:19,319
-We can talk.
-Let's leave now!

846
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,760
-Who are they?
-Your Majesty!

847
00:37:22,559 --> 00:37:23,559
-Who are they?
-I'm fine.

848
00:37:23,559 --> 00:37:24,279
Are you okay, Your Majesty?

849
00:37:24,279 --> 00:37:24,960
That was scary.

850
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:25,559
I'm fine.

851
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:26,599
It was so terrifying.

852
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:28,079
Let's go back
and summon the imperial physician.

853
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:28,760
Let's go.

854
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:31,520
Since we are already at the gate,

855
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,760
let's go out and take a walk around.

856
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,960
Are you trying to distract me from my studies?

857
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:35,559
Yes.

858
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:36,960
So straightforward.

859
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,200
If you don't go out with me,

860
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,319
I'll go to the Astronomical
Observatory Broadcast Station

861
00:37:39,319 --> 00:37:40,760
to tell everyone that you are the one

862
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,319
who created the mess last night.

863
00:37:42,839 --> 00:37:43,559
You are threatening me.

864
00:37:43,559 --> 00:37:44,720
Yes. Can you tell?

865
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,319
If that's the case, let's go.

866
00:37:45,319 --> 00:37:46,319
The sun will set soon.

867
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:47,839
Another day.

868
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:49,559
The assassins just ran away.

869
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:50,839
It must be dangerous outside now.

870
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,960
We should catch them first.

871
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:53,960
What if we can't catch them

872
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,000
because they are too fast?

873
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:57,319
Think about it.

874
00:37:57,319 --> 00:37:58,400
They were all wearing masks.

875
00:37:58,559 --> 00:37:59,879
Did you see their face?

876
00:37:59,879 --> 00:38:00,440
No.

877
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:01,920
Did you see their face?

878
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:04,319
Look. You didn't see their face.

879
00:38:04,319 --> 00:38:05,079
If we can't catch them,

880
00:38:05,079 --> 00:38:07,079
they'll go back and regroup,
and there'll be no end to this.

881
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:08,039
So, at this time,

882
00:38:08,039 --> 00:38:09,559
we should go out and bait them.

883
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,000
Let's go.

884
00:38:14,279 --> 00:38:15,200
Do you understand what she said?

885
00:38:15,799 --> 00:38:17,079
No, I don't.

886
00:38:17,079 --> 00:38:17,960
No? Let's go then.

887
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,319
Your Majesty.

888
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:23,200
Are they coming or not?

889
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,070
[Precious Pavillion]
Are we at the right place?

890
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,319
I'm sure.

891
00:38:27,559 --> 00:38:30,359
They say something about the pavilion.

892
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,960
There's only one Precious Pavillion
in the palace, right?

893
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,359
You are right.

894
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:35,879
Let's wait then.

895
00:38:36,039 --> 00:38:37,680
Her Majesty is unpredictable.

896
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,279
Maybe she won't be here.

897
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,879
It'll be nice for us to get the money

898
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:41,720
without having to do anything.

899
00:38:42,039 --> 00:38:43,039
That's right.

900
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:50,760
Is this your idea of spreading the news?

901
00:38:51,319 --> 00:38:52,680
Long live, Your Majesty!

902
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,720
Long live, Your Majesty!

903
00:38:55,039 --> 00:38:56,000
Your people are prospering

904
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,079
because of your wisdom.

905
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:59,599
Now, you are here to be one with us.

906
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:01,079
We've been waiting for years.

907
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,720
Finally, we get to see you.

908
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:04,350
[Zhong'an Teahouse]
You've governed the country well

909
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,359
and given us a good life.

910
00:39:06,839 --> 00:39:08,000
We and our future generations

911
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:10,039
will never forget your kindness!

912
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:14,680
How do you know that I'm the Emperor?

913
00:39:15,559 --> 00:39:16,319
Everyone can tell

914
00:39:16,319 --> 00:39:17,839
that you are the emperor from your outfit.

915
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:18,839
Is it that obvious?

916
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,000
Okay now. You may rise.

917
00:39:22,879 --> 00:39:24,240
It's just my duty.

918
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:26,920
When I was young, my father asked me

919
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,839
to become a great emperor when I grow up.

920
00:39:29,079 --> 00:39:29,960
Don't worry.

921
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,039
From now on, I'll continue
to rule the country with all my efforts.

922
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:33,359
I won't disappoint you.

923
00:39:33,559 --> 00:39:34,240
You may rise up.

924
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,400
You got it wrong!

925
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,000
Who hired this temporary actor?

926
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,720
He can't even remember his script.

927
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:41,559
How insolent!

928
00:39:41,559 --> 00:39:42,879
Shut up.

929
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,319
According to the script,

930
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,760
it should be "kill them all"!

931
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:48,279
My knees are painful from kneeling down.

932
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:49,480
As I said,

933
00:39:49,559 --> 00:39:51,279
although the emperor is just a bit role,

934
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:51,920
you can't just simply hire a cheap actor.

935
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:52,760
Bit role?

936
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,559
They say that I'm a bit role?

937
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:55,440
Fine.

938
00:39:55,879 --> 00:39:56,920
I'll show you

939
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,279
the wrath of the Emperor today!

940
00:39:58,279 --> 00:39:58,760
Don't!

941
00:39:58,760 --> 00:39:59,960
-Kill them!
-Don't!

942
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:00,480
Forgive them.

943
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:00,839
Your Majesty!

944
00:40:00,839 --> 00:40:01,760
Kill them all.

945
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:02,680
Forgive them.

946
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,000
-Kill them all!
-Forgive them.

947
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,200
Don't let me see you again.

948
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,559
I'll beat you up if I do.

949
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,920
I think this is nice.

950

-Yes.
-Look at this.

951
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:09,480
This is pretty.

952
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,359
This is nice too.

953
00:40:10,359 --> 00:40:11,440
Calm down.

954
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,559
You just need to change your outfit.

955
00:40:12,559 --> 00:40:14,400
And no one will recognize you anymore.

(I'll think of it as bonding of sort.)

Let me tell you.
We are outside of the palace now.

00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,520
I'll just do this once.

962
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,920
I won't do this again next time.

963
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:35,559
Okay now.
