25
00:01:55,839 --> 00:01:56,639
Your Majesty.

26
00:01:56,639 --> 00:01:57,800
Her Majesty was all right

27
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,559
when she woke up this morning.

28
00:01:58,559 --> 00:02:00,160
After her afternoon nap,
she felt that her face was a little dry.

29
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,480
Therefore, I put on a facial mask for her.

Her Majesty started mumbling unintelligibly.

What facial mask is that?

Why didn't I receive it?

87
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,519
It was half done

88
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,600
when we had a big fight.

89
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,239
Why don't you give it to me now?

90

No.

91
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,320
Do you think you can get it just like that?

92
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,239
I don't want to give it to you.

93
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:20,720
What's this?

94
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:24,239
Not this one.

95
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,760
You can throw away the rest,

96
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,799
but not this one.

97

What actually is this?

98
00:05:28,799 --> 00:05:29,440
Sir.

99
00:05:30,679 --> 00:05:31,679
Yu... Yu Changya...

100
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,160
How dare you try to throw away my stuff?

101
00:05:43,799 --> 00:05:45,480
I'll throw away yours later.

102
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:47,519
What happened?

103
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,079
Yu Changya has been arrested.

104
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:52,160
When?

105
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,519
The Empress Dowager was poisoned this morning,

106
00:05:54,679 --> 00:05:56,640
and he somehow got himself involved.

107
00:05:57,239 --> 00:05:58,920
He is now locked up
at the Ministry of Internal Affairs.

108
00:05:59,239 --> 00:06:01,279
His Majesty wants to question him personally.

109

Besides,

110
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:05,399
His Majesty has also ordered a search
at the Lingshu Academy today.

111
00:06:06,359 --> 00:06:07,160
I'm afraid...

112
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:13,600
His Majesty is smarter than I expected.

113
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,040
It seems like Yu Changya's identity
will soon be exposed.

114
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,839
What should we do then?

115
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,799
The most important thing now
is to put Xiyue Empire under control.

116
00:06:22,119 --> 00:06:23,559
As long as we can manipulate them,

117
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,799
we still stand a chance.

118
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:28,239
Where is the Xiyue troop now?

119
00:06:29,359 --> 00:06:30,200
They break camp today.

120
00:06:30,559 --> 00:06:32,239
It's estimated that they will leave the border

121
00:06:32,239 --> 00:06:33,480
in six to seven days.

122
00:06:35,239 --> 00:06:36,440
Leave the border?

123
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:40,399
I'm afraid it's not that simple.

124
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:47,359
Grand Chancellor, where are you going?

125
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,839
I'm going to save Yu Changya.

126
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,160
It's time to put him to use.

127

Yu Changya.

128

You have betrayed my trust.

129
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:05,160
If you have already decided that I'm guilty,
there's no need for all the talking.

130
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,839
You said I betrayed your trust
before even giving me a chance to explain.

131
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,959
Why don't you just convict me of any crime?

132
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:13,720
You're really stubborn.

133
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,760
How do you explain this?

134
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,679
This is the herb I use to develop the facial mask.

135
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:22,959
It's called the Bolan Herb.

136
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,519
It's found in Xiheng Mountain,

137
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:26,839
a famous mountain in Xiyue Empire.

138
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,600
It's available all year round.

139
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,760
It carries a unique scent,

140
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:32,760
but it's highly poisonous when consumed.

141
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,359
It is a moisturizing herb.

142
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,799
Adding it to the facial mask
can give it a moisturizing effect.

143
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,200
Sure.

A clearance pass to go through
the valley checkpoint.

147
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,640
Whoever holds this

148
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:49,440
can travel

149

between Donghao and Xiyue as they wish.

150

You have been planning for this.

151
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:57,040
You obviously have a hidden agenda.

152
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,600
I have to leave the country to collect the herbs.

153
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:02,480
That's why I need this pass.

154

How does this prove
against my loyalty to Your Majesty?

155
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,000
Aren't these the hard evidence?

156
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:14,440
I did keep a few things,

157
00:08:15,239 --> 00:08:16,399
but the Imperial Harem
is an unpredictable place

158

and everyone has their own schemes.

It was my first time in the palace.

160
00:08:19,559 --> 00:08:22,040
Naturally, I have to keep these things with me
just in case.

161
00:08:22,799 --> 00:08:24,359
Your Majesty concluded that I was trying
to assassinate the Empress Dowager

00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:27,559
just because of my possession of these items.

Wise in your own eyes.

164

Is Your Majesty trying to make up something

just so you can convict me for the Queen's sake?

00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,039
Yu Changya.

167
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:39,919
I've never said

168
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,479
that this is about you trying to assassinate
the Empress Dowager.

169
00:08:45,119 --> 00:08:46,119
Then, what is it about?

170
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:49,960
I did suspect you.

171
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,799
However, all this stuff

172
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:53,200
cleared my suspicion.

173
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,799
You've lived in the palace for a long time.

174
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,760
If you had intended to hurt
me and the Empress Dowager,

175
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,200
you wouldn't have waited until now.

176
00:08:58,359 --> 00:09:01,479
If you were trying to kill her
with the facial mask you developed

177
00:09:02,239 --> 00:09:04,760
that contained Bolan Herb from Xiyue Empire,

178
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,440
wouldn't that be a little too obvious?

179
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,719
Am I right?

180
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,239
Imperial Physician Yu.

181
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,960
Or should I call you

182
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,760
Crown Prince Li?

183
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,960
The former Crown Prince of the Xiyue Empire.

184
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:24,919
Why are you here at the Donghao Empire?

185
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,159
Crown Prince Li.

186
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,880
This is not something I made up.

187
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,359
Do you want to explain yourself?

188
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:37,679
I guess you've run out of words.

189
00:09:39,599 --> 00:09:41,799
We'll send you
to the Court of Judicial Review then.

190
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,559
I have something to say.

191
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:50,479
What are you doing here, Grand Chancellor?

192
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,479
Your Majesty.

193
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:55,200
We can't hand Yu Changya over
to the Court of Judicial Review.

194
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,799
This is the Ministry of Internal Affairs.

195
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,039
I understand.

196
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,239
All cases under the Ministry of Internal Affairs
are handled within the Imperial Court.

197
00:10:03,359 --> 00:10:04,799
The Grand Chancellor has no say in these affairs.

198
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,919
I understand that too.

199
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,280
So the Grand Chancellor knows
Yu Changya's identity too.

200
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:12,000
If you still want to stick your nose
into this issue,

201
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,799
that means you have deceived the Emperor.

202
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:16,359
Of course, I understand.

203
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,479
Then, are you still going to defend him?

204
00:10:19,479 --> 00:10:20,000
Yes, I am.

205
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,080
From now on,

206
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:24,679
leave Yu Changya's case to me.

207
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,320
Your Majesty can rest assured.

208
00:10:34,719 --> 00:10:35,440
Liu Xie.

209
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,080
I hope

210
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,119
you don't overstep the boundary between us.

211
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:43,000
I have another piece of advice for Your Majesty.

212
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,679
Don't set a boundary

213
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:47,320
between us.

214
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,679
(My dear.)

215
00:11:12,239 --> 00:11:13,200
(I'll never force you)

216
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,760
(to do things that you don't want to.)

217
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:18,840
(This is your favorite Molan Tea.)

218
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,760
(I hope that you can be reminded of us)

219
00:11:22,479 --> 00:11:24,440
(when you are drinking the tea.)

220
00:11:25,719 --> 00:11:27,000
(I wish you well.)

221
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:32,825
[Molan Tea]

222
00:12:17,359 --> 00:12:18,960
After all these years,

223
00:12:22,359 --> 00:12:23,479
all I want

224
00:12:23,479 --> 00:12:24,880
is to live a peaceful life with my child.

225
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:28,440
Yet you thought I betrayed you,

226
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,760
and you tried to poison me with the Molan Tea.

227
00:12:33,359 --> 00:12:34,919
You're very determined

228
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:36,719
to end our relationship.

229
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,200
Li Yuan.

230
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,599
It was your own ruthlessness that hurt you,

231
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:48,159
not me.

232
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,000
Your Highness.

233
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:53,960
I've placed the antidote in Lingshu Academy
in secret.

234
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,919
You can rest assured.

235
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:56,200
I have got everything sorted out.

236
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,760
What a cruel man.

237
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,799
I'm sure he didn't expect

238
00:13:01,359 --> 00:13:04,200
the poison he gave me would accidentally hurt
the wrong person.

239
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,119
Your Majesty.

240
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,400
Someone sent

241
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,039
this Molan Tea to me today.

242
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:12,280
I know it's Your Majesty's favorite,

243
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,400
so I brought it here to share with you.

244
00:13:14,719 --> 00:13:16,159
Thank you so much.

245
00:13:17,599 --> 00:13:19,559
How is the preparation
of Yunchong's wedding going?

246
00:13:20,119 --> 00:13:21,559
Thanks for your concern, Your Majesty.

247
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:23,000
It's all prepared.

248
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:24,599
It's good to hear that.

249
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,039
I watched

250
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:27,679
Yunchong grow up.

251
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,559
Now that he's getting married,

252
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,479
I'm genuinely happy for him.

253
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:35,400
Try this, Your Majesty.

254
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,239
Anything else can I help Your Highness with?

255
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:50,400
Wait here.

256
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:51,159
Yes, Your Highness.

257
00:14:19,119 --> 00:14:20,719
Send this to the Grand Chancellor.

258
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,559
Yes, Your Highness.

259
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:22,200
Remember

260
00:14:22,479 --> 00:14:24,200
to personally pass it to Liu Xie.

261
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,799
If anyone else lays a hand on this,

262
00:14:28,479 --> 00:14:29,760
we'll be done for.

263
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:30,719
Yes, Your Highness.

264
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:38,679
No.

265
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,280
I won't let him off so easily.

266
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,719
Help me figure out

267
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,239
how to resolve this issue.

268
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,599
This is easy, Your Majesty.

269
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:48,159
I'll bring a few men with me

270
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:49,559
and break into the Ministry of Internal Affairs
in the middle of the night.

271
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,719
Then, I'll kill him on the spot.

272
00:14:50,719 --> 00:14:52,119
That makes no sense.

273
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,440
Are you trying to kill someone
in the Ministry of Internal Affairs?

274
00:14:53,599 --> 00:14:55,039
You'll be dead before you even step foot in it.

275
00:14:55,119 --> 00:14:55,840
Jing.

276
00:14:56,359 --> 00:14:57,440
Why are you so stupid?

277
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,520
That's not the right way to kill someone.

278
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,599
Your Majesty.

279
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,840
I suggest you

280
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,479
send him

281
00:15:03,479 --> 00:15:04,880
a bowl of poisoned rice tomorrow.

282
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,039
It only needs a mouthful

283
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,520
to kill him.

284
00:15:07,599 --> 00:15:09,400
Who told you to kill him?

285
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,559
Yunzhang.

286
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,200
Liu Xie went to the Ministry of Internal Affairs
to save him.

287
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,599
If you don't want to kill him,

288
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,080
why did you gather all of us here

289
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,440
late at night?

290
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,640
Did I ever tell you

291
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,039
that Liu Xie was my target?

292
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:21,440
The person I want to deal with is Yu Changya.

293
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:25,239
Yu Changya?

294
00:15:25,239 --> 00:15:26,919
It wasn't him who put the poison there, right?

295
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:31,440
He is the former Crown Prince of the Xiyue Empire.

296
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,799
Why did he sneak

297
00:15:34,239 --> 00:15:35,280
into my Imperial Palace?

298
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:35,919
Your Majesty.

299
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,640
As far as I know,

300
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:39,520
he didn't come here by himself.

301
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,200
You were the one who brought him here.

302
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:41,700
Then...

303
00:15:44,359 --> 00:15:45,880
Why didn't he tell me his identity?

304
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,200
He was removed from his position
as the Crown Prince.

305
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,400
It's too embarrassing to bring it up.

306
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,440
He has to take care of his image too.

307
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,359
Then...

308
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,440
Why was he sneaking around

309
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,719
in the imperial capital?

310
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,640
Your Majesty.

311
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,359
He's indeed a little feminine,

312
00:16:01,359 --> 00:16:03,000
enjoys befriending the maidservants

313
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:04,280
and selling them beauty products,

314
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,880
and sometimes, sweet-talks the Empress Dowager
and the wet nurses,

315
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,440
but there's nothing bad about him.

316
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:12,440
I thought you weren't on the same page.

317
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,159
Why are you defending him now?

318
00:16:14,919 --> 00:16:15,559
Yunzhang.

319
00:16:15,719 --> 00:16:16,640
We're not defending him.

320
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:18,119
We simply feel sorry for him.

321
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,159
Sorry?

322
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:20,479
Why?

323
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,940
Haven't you heard of the story

324
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:23,910
about the former Crown Prince
of the Xiyue Empire?

325
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:27,670
I haven't.

326
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,140
-Such a poor thing.
-Such a poor thing.

327
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,350
Your Highness.

328
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:34,740
Your Highness!

329
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,500
Something bad happened.

330
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:37,820
Your Highness.

331
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:40,260
His Majesty has passed away.

332
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:47,180
Uncle?

333
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:49,870
Attack!

334
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,870
-Attack!
-Attack!

335
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:54,990
(The Crown Prince of Xiyue
was originally named Li Ya.)

336
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:56,870
(He was the only son of the Emperor of Xiyue.)

337
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:59,030
(He grew up
receiving love and attention from everyone,)

338
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:00,060
(and had lived a rather successful life
compared to his peers.)

339
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,430
(However, that didn't last.)

340
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,030
(His father died an untimely death)

341
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,550
(when he was still a kid.)

342
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:06,790
(Then...)

343
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:09,620
Where is he?

344
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:11,260
[May Everything Last]

345
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,100
He's not far from here yet.

346
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:12,860
Go after him.

347
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:14,310
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

348
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:28,200
[Ya]

349
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:03,190
Doesn't he deserve our sympathy?

350
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,460
Wait a minute.

351
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:06,670
How did you know about this?

352
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:07,620
Your Majesty.

353
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,790
You spend most of your time in the palace.

354
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,190
There are many rumors like this out there

355
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:11,260
that you haven't heard of.

356
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,620
There are a lot of rumors
about the Crown Prince of Xiyue

357
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,710
shared among the people.

358
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,030
There are many stories

359
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,380
adapted from this incident.

360
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,830
I think I know this best.

361
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,190
I specifically asked Baiyu

362
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,030
if it was really worth it to write a story

363
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,140
about the Crown Prince of Xiyue.

364
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,460
Guess what Baiyu said.

365
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:26,860
-What?
-I've no idea.

366
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:27,860
She said

367
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:31,140
that the Crown Prince of Xiyue
makes the best fit for a protagonist.

368
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:33,430
Handsome, strong, and pitiful.

369
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:34,190
He's all of the above.

370
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:34,980
How great is that?

371
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,140
Do you also know

372
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:41,100
that he was later rescued by Liu Xie?

373
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,430
That part was fictitious.

374
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,740
I was immersed in the story,

375
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,500
and somehow Liu Xie's name popped up in my mind.

376
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:50,950
Your Majesty.

377
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:52,590
Yu Changya is at fault,

378
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,220
but he has his difficulties too.

379
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,190
Just forgive him.

380
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:56,070
He's right.

381
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:56,740
Your Majesty.

382
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:58,980
I'll organize a barbecue night when he's released.

383
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,140
Let's talk

384
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,190
over drinks.

385
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,460
He's right, Yunzhang.

386
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:05,220
Although Yu Changya and Sister-in-law

387
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,590
were really close before this,

388
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:08,030
it was all in the past.

389
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,710
It's just an identity he carried.

390
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:10,910
It's not a big deal.

391
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:14,430
I got it.

392
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:15,830
Let's hit the sack.

393
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:18,070
Good night, Your Majesty.

394
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,030
We'll get going then.

395
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:26,310
Why are you still here?

396
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:27,950
Yunzhang.

397
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,260
I have another question for you.

398
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:30,910
Go ahead.

399
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:34,030
There are actually many opportunities

400
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:35,590
for you to kill Liu Xie, right?

401
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,710
But you are still keeping him alive.

402
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:41,030
You're capable of killing him,

403
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,260
but you don't want to kill him.

404
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,590
Perhaps subconsciously,

405
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:49,670
you think that Liu Xie

406
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:52,590
is not what we normally perceive him to be.

407
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:55,830
Who taught you these words?

408
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:58,740
Who do you think taught me these words, Yunzhang?

409
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:01,830
Liu Baiyu, I guess.

410
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:03,910
Baiyu said

411
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,460
that you'll understand it

412
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:06,830
once I say these words.

413
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,220
I'll get going.

414
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:16,950
Have I really wronged Liu Xie?

415
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,260
Sir, just as you expected,

416
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,740
Li Yuan and his 5,000 Xiyue soldiers

417
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:24,070
have retreated to the valley checkpoint
and set up a camp there.

418
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:25,670
They're biding their time.

419
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,310
Any other news?

420
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:29,310
We got news from our informant.

421
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,310
Although the military wasn't having high morale,

422
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:33,500
Li Yuan insisted on carrying out his plan.

423
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:36,220
He refused to return to the Xiyue Empire.

424
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,670
He's digging his own grave.

425
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:41,740
Sir,

426
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,070
what are we waiting for?

427
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:46,590
This is the best time for us to launch an attack.

428
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:47,910
It's not the right time yet.

429
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,430
What are we waiting for, Grand Chancellor?

430
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:52,030
We're waiting for the most important thing.

431
00:21:10,225 --> 00:21:13,175
[According to the posthumous edict,
Crown Prince Ya will inherit the throne.]

432
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,430
This is it.

433
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:18,260
I'll dispatch the troops now.

434
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:19,190
Wait.

435
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,190
Why are you in such a hurry?

436
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:22,790
You've worked for me for so many years.

437
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:24,310
Can't wait for me to finish my words?

438
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:26,220
Got it, sir.

439
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,590
You should stay out of this.

440
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,670
This concerns the people of Xiyue,

441
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:34,190
so we shall leave it to them.

442
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:01,310
Yongfu.

443
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:03,740
Why are you here?

444
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:09,790
What happened?

445
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:11,430
Don't ask any questions.

446
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:12,430
Don't say anything.

447
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:13,830
You're the only person I trust now.

448
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,830
Hide him somewhere.

449
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:18,310
I'll send someone to pick him up in a few days.

450
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:21,030
The only thing I can tell you

451
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:22,980
is that this boy has had a very tough time.

452
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:24,910
No, but...

453
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:26,190
Mother.

454
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,070
Mother.

455
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,380
Who is he?

456
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:54,740
What a poor boy.

457
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:09,790
Mother.

458
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:10,830
Look at his mouth.

459
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:12,140
He looks like he has a fish mouth.

460
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:13,460
Mother.

461
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,740
Look at his eyelashes.

462
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:16,220
[Ya]
They are really long.

463
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:18,980
Mother.

464
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,590
Who is he?

465
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:21,740
What's his name?

466
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:26,030
His name is...

467
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:28,740
Yu Changya.

468
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:50,980
Yu Changya.

469
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:54,790
Jinfeng.

470
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:56,260
Jinfeng.

471
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,550
I knew you would come here.

472
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:02,310
I thought

473
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:03,460
you were having a tough time in there,

474
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,910
but it seems like you're adapting pretty well.

475
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:06,740
You're here to save me.

476
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:08,380
You don't want to see me suffer, right?

477
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,910
Enough of all the nonsense.

478
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:11,860
I'm here

479
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:13,460
to ask you a question.

480
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:15,910
Ask away.

481
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,550
You didn't move into the palace

482
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:18,910
so that you could hurt him, did you?

483
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:22,140
Does it matter?

484
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,620
Of course, it matters.

485
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:25,620
We grew up together.

486
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:28,190
You are evil, arrogant,

487
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:29,310
and annoying,

488
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:31,070
but we're still friends, aren't we?

489
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,670
I would hate to turn friends into enemies.

490
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:35,910
Then...

491
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,950
If I'm here to hurt him,

492
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:41,430
does it mean that we can't be friends anymore?

493
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,310
That's for sure.

494
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:44,460
He's my husband.

495
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:45,590
I'll stand up against anyone

496
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:46,980
who tries to lay a finger on him.

497
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:49,670
Don't worry.

498
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,310
We won't be enemies.

499
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,380
It's good to hear that.

500
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:56,460
But

501
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:00,220
we knew each other first.

502
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:00,860
What?

503
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:02,910
Nothing.

504
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:26,590
Your Majesty.

505
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:59,740
Why are you so quiet?

506
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:02,220
You should be explaining yourself.

507
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,860
Don't get mad.

508
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,670
I only went there to ask him a question.

509
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:06,710
What question was it?

510
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:10,550
I...

511
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:13,550
I was just kidding.

512
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:15,550
Someone informed me

513
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:16,790
immediately after you arrived
at the Ministry of Internal Affairs.

514
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,340
If I didn't trust you,

515
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:19,670
I would've rushed over right away.

516
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,430
Don't you want to know what the question was?

517
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:22,260
It doesn't matter.

518
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,380
You've already provided an answer to my question.

519
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:26,070
Which question?

520
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:27,550
You told me

521
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:29,070
that you would always pick me over him.

522
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:36,310
It's fine.

523
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:39,740
(What a beautiful life.)

524
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,910
(It's even better when I get to be at your side.)

525
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:44,030
Grand Chancellor.

526
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:47,070
Yu Changya has stayed at the Ministry
of Internal Affairs for quite some time.

527
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:48,790
Have you discovered anything yet,
Grand Chancellor?

528
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:52,030
I would have forgotten about this
if Your Majesty hadn't brought it up.

529
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:53,620
I have done a thorough investigation

530
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:55,070
on Yu Changya.

531
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:56,790
Tell me about it, Grand Chancellor.

532
00:26:57,430 --> 00:27:00,070
Yu Changya is indeed the former Crown Prince
of the Xiyue Empire.

533
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:02,500
I was about to ask Your Majesty to issue a decree.

534
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:05,740
Li Yuan has dispatched his army
to the valley checkpoint.

535
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,310
We can dispatch our troops there

536
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,790
and use Crown Prince Li as our captive

537
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:10,140
to force Li Yuan and his soldiers to retreat.

538
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:10,830
That's not a good idea.

539
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:13,860
Li Yuan and his soldiers have been staying still.

540
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:16,380
If I use this to blackmail him,

541
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:18,860
this will ruin Donghao Empire's reputation.

542
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:20,980
Besides, I've given the warriors of Xiyue my words.

543
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:22,710
I won't initiate an attack.

544
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:23,860
Your Majesty.

545
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:25,220
You're soft-hearted like a woman.

546
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:27,310
I'm just being a benevolent emperor.

547
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,030
You can't be sitting here and awaiting your fate.

548
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:30,590
I'm trying to repay hatred with kindness.

549
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:32,950
It seems like we can't reach a mutual agreement.

550
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:35,340
I will act of my own accord.

551
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:35,980
Liu Xie.

552
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:40,830
Yu Changya is now
at the Ministry of Internal Affairs.

553
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:42,790
Do you think you're capable

554
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:44,980
of sneaking him out of the imperial capital?

555
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:48,710
I don't know if I'm capable of doing that,

556
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:52,030
but I will definitely get hold of the man.

557
00:27:58,620 --> 00:27:59,310
Shuan.

558
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:01,500
Pass on my decree.

559
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:04,030
Tell Tang to keep a close eye on Yu Changya.

560
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:07,190
I don't think anyone can sneak him out

561
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:09,260
of the imperial capital under my watch.

562
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:10,310
Yes, Your Majesty.

563
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:32,950
Let's go.

564
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:36,310
Wait.

565
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:37,790
What's wrong?

566
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:39,070
Who are you?

567
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:40,590
Enough talking. Let's go now.

568
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:41,620
I won't go with you

569
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:42,710
if you won't reveal who you are.

570
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:43,310
You...

571
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:44,670
-You're exactly like your mother.
-Hey! What are you doing?

572
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:46,790
Stay where you are.

573
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:02,670
Who are you?

574
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,860
Why is Yu Changya on your back?

575
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:06,260
There they are.

576
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:08,140
After them! Quick!

577
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:09,430
Hurry up!

578
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:13,670
It's me.

579
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:16,100
Mother?

580
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:19,790
Hurry up!

581
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:20,740
This way!

582
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:24,740
This way! After them!

583
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:28,100
Your Majesty.

584
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:29,460
That was terrifying.

585
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,140
I saw two bad guys running in that direction.

586
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:32,190
Go!

587
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:33,340
All of you. Come with me!

588
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:35,190
They're probably not far from here yet.

589
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:36,430
That was terrifying.

590
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:37,740
I got a scare.

591
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:41,100
Too terrifying.

592
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:54,590
My goodness.

593
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:55,980
I'm exhausted.

594
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:58,340
I'm so tired.

595
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:06,310
We're done for.

596
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:15,790
Why are you here?

597
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:17,140
I should be asking you this question.

598
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:19,190
I...

599
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:20,100
What?

600
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,380
Catch them! Quick!

601
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:24,380
Quick!

602
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,430
Why are you staring at me?

603
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:31,430
I...

604
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:33,430
Why do you think I'm staring at you?

605
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:34,460
Figure something out!

606
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,550
Zhang Qian.

607
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:37,340
Get to work.

608
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,550
Let's go.

609
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:50,910
You caused all the trouble

610
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:52,260
and now I have to resolve it for you.

611
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:54,460
Go ahead then.

612
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:06,260
It's just you and me now.

613
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:07,910
I'll allow you to explain yourself.

614
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:09,790
What is there to explain?

615
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:11,710
Did you let Yu Changya go?

616
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:13,220
How is that possible?

617
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:14,380
How could I...

618
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:16,430
Yes, I let him go.

619
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:19,140
Did your father tell you to do that?

620
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:20,380
No.

621
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:21,590
Then, why?

622
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:23,710
I was just...

623
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,500
What else could I have done?

624
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:29,220
You told me that you would always pick me

625
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,500
over your father.

626
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:32,860
But today, you chose your father over me.

627
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:34,620
That's not true, Yunzhang.

628
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:35,740
I got it.

629
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:39,310
You're first Liu Xie's daughter,

630
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:41,910
then my Queen.

631
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:44,310
I shouldn't have trusted you.

632
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,620
What are you talking about?

633
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:46,590
I told you

634
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:47,670
I didn't do it for my father.

635
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:48,670
Then, why did you do it?

636
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:50,860
I did let him go,

637
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:52,710
but it wasn't because of my father.

638
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:54,340
Why won't you believe me?

639
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:56,590
You want me to believe you,

640
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:58,340
but you didn't even give me
a plausible explanation.

641
00:31:58,340 --> 00:31:59,860
How am I supposed to trust you?

642
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:02,140
Trust requires no explanation.

643
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,550
You should trust me because you trust me.

644
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:04,950
Trust needs no explanation.

645
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:07,140
It's up to you if you don't trust me.

646
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:08,590
I let him go.

647
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:10,140
I'm going back to the palace
to await my punishment,

648
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,220
Your Majesty.

649
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:16,500
My mother told me

650
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:17,500
only bad guys would always suspect

651
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,100
that others want to hurt them.

652
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:37,910
Who are you?

653
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:39,260
Why haven't I seen you before?

654
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:41,470
I am...

655
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,660
Why are you hiding here?

656
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,420
I ran away from the palace...

657
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,350
I ran away from home.

658
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:49,470
Why?

659
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:51,180
Were your family members mean?

660
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:52,300
It was Grand...

661
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:54,870
My tutor punished me.

662
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:57,420
I was really upset so I ran away.

663
00:32:57,950 --> 00:32:58,830
Tutor?

664
00:32:58,990 --> 00:32:59,870
Your teacher?

665
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:01,110
My mother said

666
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:02,950
all teachers are good.

667
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,380
I guess your teacher punished you

668
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:06,780
most probably for your own good.

669
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:09,500
Yes.

670
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:10,990
Now I understand

671
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:12,780
why my tutor punished me.

672
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:13,900
I didn't do well enough.

673
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:15,110
That's right.

674
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:17,540
Only bad guys would always suspect

675
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:18,950
that others want to hurt them.

676
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:21,070
You don't look like a bad guy.

677
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:22,350
By the way,

678
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:23,380
what's your name?

679
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:24,900
It's getting late.

680
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,140
My mother is probably worried about me.

681
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,470
I'll tell you my name

682
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:29,110
when we meet again.

683
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:29,710
See you.

684
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:46,020
It's her?

685
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:59,780
I did tell you
that I would pick you over my father.

686
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:00,660
But that was my mother.

687
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:01,990
What else could I have done?

688
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:05,900
The Emperor Star?

689
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:07,420
That's all a lie.

690
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,460
I don't want the Emperor Star.

691
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:19,390
Whoever wants it can keep it.

692
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:51,910
Liu Xie.

693
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:56,190
Did you find this?

694
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:57,110
It's mine. Give it back to me.

695
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:59,630
I found this.

696
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:01,150
Why should I give it to you?

697
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:02,980
You found this in front of the Xiangluo Hall.

698
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:04,220
Obviously, it's something I lost.

699
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:06,300
This is a road
that leads to many different places.

700
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,940
This could belong to anyone.

701
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,390
How do you prove that it's yours?

702
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:11,220
Are you doing this on purpose?

703
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:13,430
Then tell me.

704
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:14,630
Where did you get this?

705
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:16,910
His Majesty gave it to me.

706
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:18,150
He said this was what his mother left behind.

707
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,940
It's very important to us. Give it back to me.

708
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:22,910
This belonged to Consort Li?

709
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:27,870
This is really important.

710
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:28,940
How could you

711
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:30,070
lose it?

712
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:32,070
I was only...

713
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:34,150
Look.

714
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:37,020
You left a scratch here.

715
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:38,540
His Majesty will be really sad

716
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:39,590
if he sees this.

717
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:41,260
Then, what should I do now?

718
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:43,300
I'll help you.

719
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:44,740
I'll find a good craftsman to fix this

720
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:46,910
when I go out of the palace.

721
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:48,190
I'll return it to you after I've fixed it.

722
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,070
You're never this kind.

723
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:51,870
Forget it if you don't trust me.

724
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:54,830
It was the Queen, not me, who broke this piece

725
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:56,190
Consort Li left behind.

726
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,020
You can have it.

727
00:35:57,910 --> 00:35:58,870
I'll take it.

728
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:00,070
Your Majesty.

729
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,700
Liu Xie.

730
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:12,430
Your Majesty.

731
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:13,590
We've searched every corner of the palace,

732
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:14,630
but to no avail.

733
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:16,980
However, we found this in the prison.

734
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:21,190
Your Majesty.

735
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,190
[Bliss]
Look at the embroidery.

736
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:24,670
I think it belongs to Her Majesty.

737
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:28,870
If you can't find him in the palace,
try searching outside the palace.

738
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:30,670
Leave no stone unturned.

739
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:31,870
Yes, Your Majesty.

740
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:34,350
What is Your Majesty looking for?

741
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:41,190
Why is the Grand Chancellor here late at night?

742
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:45,390
I heard that Yu Changya...

743
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,670
Grand Chancellor,
are you trying to defend the Queen?

744
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:48,540
Her Majesty?

745
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:52,070
Yes.

746
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:54,390
Your Majesty is right. It was the Queen.

747
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:57,630
Then go ahead, Grand Chancellor.

748
00:36:59,150 --> 00:36:59,910
What?

749
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:02,190
Aren't you trying to defend the Queen?

750
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,190
It hit me all of a sudden.

751
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:08,190
The Queen's concern
is also Your Majesty's concern.

752
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:10,020
Therefore, this is your household affair.

753
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:11,190
It's something I shouldn't interfere in.

754
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:14,870
I'll get going.

755
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:18,190
By the way,

756
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:20,430
make sure not to lose that,

757
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:22,300
Your Majesty.

758
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:31,830
Sufang.

759
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:34,190
Did I sound mean?

760
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:36,540
After all, I did let him go.

761
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:42,500
But why didn't he believe me?

762
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,350
He always thinks
that Liu Xie is trying to hurt him.

763
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:46,150
He always thinks that I'm on Liu Xie's side too.

764
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,390
I told him I'm not,

765
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:48,630
but he just won't believe me.

766
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:49,700
Isn't that too much?

767
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,940
Should he apologize first

768
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,390
or should I do it?

769
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:00,940
I'm talking to you, Sufang.

770
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,110
Yes, Your Majesty.

771
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:06,070
So you also think I should apologize to him?

772
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:07,460
Apologize?

773
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:08,590
I'll do it.

774
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:09,460
It's not a big deal.

775
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,220
I'll talk to him tomorrow.

776
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:11,020
