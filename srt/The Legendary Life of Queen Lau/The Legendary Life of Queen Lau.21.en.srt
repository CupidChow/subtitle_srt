00:09:35,239 --> 00:09:36,880
What do you mean, Your Majesty?

168
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,400
Didn't Zhang

169
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,520
marry Grand Chancellor's daughter as well?

170
00:09:42,239 --> 00:09:44,200
But I need to remind you.

171
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:49,119
The most important thing between husband and wife

172
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,280
is to have a harmonious relationship.

173
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:54,679
I understand.

174
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,599
But His Majesty and Her Majesty

175
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:00,520
weren't on good terms with each other initially.

176
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,200
Our queen is quite special.

177
00:10:05,359 --> 00:10:07,119
Although she isn't as smart,

178
00:10:07,119 --> 00:10:08,440
thoughtful, and intelligent

179
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,280
as Baiyu...

180
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:09,840
Enough.

181
00:10:13,359 --> 00:10:15,320
Don't you feel exhausted saying so many words?

182
00:10:16,239 --> 00:10:17,400
I do feel exhausted.

183
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:18,359
Don't you know?

184
00:10:18,359 --> 00:10:20,039
Since my son is about to get married,

185
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,640
there are many things to prepare.

186
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,119
The date of marriage.

187
00:10:24,119 --> 00:10:25,280
The location of the mansion.

188
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,640
The type of wedding attires.

189
00:10:27,239 --> 00:10:28,799
There are many things to consider.

190
00:10:29,119 --> 00:10:30,919
I'm having a headache thinking about it.

191
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:33,119
I won't be drinking tea with you today.

192
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,840
I have many things to prepare.

193
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,760
We'll go and make preparations first.

194
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:37,960
Biyun, let's go.

195
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,520
Yes, Your Highness.

196
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,760
I'm leaving, Your Majesty.

197
00:10:49,719 --> 00:10:51,159
She must have done it purposely.

198
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:51,919
It's so hot.

199
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,760
Look how arrogant she is.

200
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,960
Her son is just going to marry Liu Baiyu. So what?

201
00:10:58,479 --> 00:10:59,559
Xianpa Village!

202
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,039
I'm finally back!

203
00:11:01,479 --> 00:11:02,840
Why did you bring me here?

204
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,679
This is Xianpa Village.

205
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,239
[Xianpa Village]
A few decades ago,

206
00:11:08,239 --> 00:11:09,640
it didn't go by this name.

207
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:11,400
It was called Qilian Village.

208
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:13,239
Do you know

209
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:14,840
why it was called this name, Your Majesty?

210
00:11:15,239 --> 00:11:16,640
I don't even know about it.

211
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:20,239
There was a Wu family here.

212
00:11:20,719 --> 00:11:24,280
His ancestors gave birth to seven sons in a row.

213
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,840
So, the village is known as Qilian.
[* Qilian means seven in a row]

214
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,159
Since the old days,
this village had been full of men.

215
00:11:31,239 --> 00:11:34,760
But nowadays,
the village is called Xianpa Village.

216
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:37,479
There's not even a strong man
who can work in this village.

217
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,520
It's because of war.

218
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,159
There's a story like that?

219
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:47,039
In the Battle of Eight Kings 70 years ago,

220
00:11:47,359 --> 00:11:50,280
the total number of men from Qilian Village
who died in battle

221
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,679
was 3,143.

222
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:55,520
In the Turmoil of Jizhou 50 years ago,

223
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,880
the total number of men
from this village who died in battle

224
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:01,559
was 2,853.

225
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:02,640
30 years ago,

226
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,280
during the Rebellion of Xinan,

227
00:12:04,719 --> 00:12:08,559
in which Your Majesty said your ancestors
invented the Imperial Formation,

228
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,159
the total number of men who died in battle

229
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:14,559
was 1,651.

230
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,559
To Your Majesty,

231
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:19,159
they are just numbers.

232
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:22,880
But to every family in this village,

233
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,479
it is a painful past.

234
00:12:28,719 --> 00:12:30,359
Our village was so pitiful.

235
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:35,159
Your Majesty studied the way of Confucius
and Mencius and you want to govern the empire

236
00:12:35,479 --> 00:12:37,000
with benevolence and righteousness.

237
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:40,000
I agree with that.

238
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:44,880
But I still need to teach Your Majesty a lesson.

239
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:48,280
The benevolence is not the benevolence of women.

240
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,479
The righteousness is not
the righteousness of the martial arts world.

241
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:04,359
Father.

242
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,760
Can I ask you a question?

243
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,559
Go ahead.

244
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,520
How many people from our village died?

245
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:14,880
Which war are we talking about?

246
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,159
The one that happened 70 years ago.

247
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:23,640
3,153.

248
00:13:24,359 --> 00:13:25,719
What about the war from 30 years ago?

249
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,159
1,650...

250
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,440
You are really good at lying.

251
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,840
You are lying to the Emperor, Father.

252
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,000
Be quiet.

253
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,400
I made up the story.

254
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,000
It's not lying.

255
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,479
At most,

256
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,000
I used a very dramatic method

257
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,880
to tell His Majesty that he is an emperor

258
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,799
and not a saint.

259
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,479
How did you make a lie

260
00:13:47,479 --> 00:13:48,599
sound like it's the truth?

261
00:13:48,599 --> 00:13:49,719
That is a good question.

262
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,000
Do you know why

263
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,640
there's truth in this world?

264
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,280
Because someone told a lie.

265
00:13:57,559 --> 00:13:58,200
Enough.

266
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,400
Tonight,

267
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,359
you'll stay here with His Majesty.

268
00:14:00,359 --> 00:14:01,320
I've prepared everything.

269
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,080
Just think of it
as returning to visit your relatives.

270
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:07,400
What about my mother?

271
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,880
You've met her already.

272
00:14:10,239 --> 00:14:11,119
Already?

273
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,200
When was it, Father?

274
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,239
Yunzhang.

275
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,400
You must be hungry.

276
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,679
This is our village's specialty.

277
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:27,960
Castle Full of Golden Armor.

278
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:28,760
Have some.

279
00:14:29,359 --> 00:14:31,200
You knew all about this, right?

280
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,880
Don't listen to my father's nonsense.

281
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,960
I was forced.

282
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,200
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

283
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,599
I didn't expect him

284
00:14:41,599 --> 00:14:42,760
to throw all the information out

285
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,280
without even telling me.

286
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,719
I was wrong. I apologize.

287
00:14:49,119 --> 00:14:50,440
At the time, I was...

288
00:14:51,239 --> 00:14:51,919
Jinfeng.

289
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,280
You already knew such an easy concept

290
00:14:55,719 --> 00:14:57,960
of conducting yourself as the Queen.

291
00:14:58,239 --> 00:14:59,960
But you didn't tell me directly

292
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,679
and used such a roundabout way to tell me.

293
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,559
I should thank you.

294
00:15:07,719 --> 00:15:09,159
I used to foolishly think

295
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:10,200
you made the questionnaires

296
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,400
to understand me.

297
00:15:11,719 --> 00:15:13,799
But I realized what you did was more meaningful.

298
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,119
You wanted me to know the empire,

299
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,679
the people,

300
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,840
and how to be a good emperor.

301
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,960
Am I right?

302
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,520
Yes.

303
00:15:29,599 --> 00:15:30,280
Jinfeng.

304
00:15:31,119 --> 00:15:32,359
I know what to do.

305
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,000
You said I could hit the drum

306
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,919
but why did I get hit by the drum instead?

307
00:15:52,359 --> 00:15:53,440
It's my fault.

308
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,200
Why does Jinfeng

309
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,400
still have a bad temper after becoming the Queen?

310
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,520
It's my fault.

311
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,400
I didn't teach her well.

312
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,559
It's exactly your fault.

313
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,960
You wanted me to meet her.

314
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,039
But what's this nonsense that you arranged?

315
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:06,679
Okay.

316
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,400
I'll make a better arrangement next time.

317
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,799
I'm so dizzy.

318
00:16:11,719 --> 00:16:13,799
Am I seriously injured?

319
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:15,359
Why do I feel so painful?

320
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,599
It's all my fault.

321
00:16:17,719 --> 00:16:18,760
I'm wrong.

322
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,520
What do you mean?

323
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:22,640
Why did you keep washing my right foot?

324
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,400
Are you looking down on my left foot?

325
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,119
Let's switch it to the other foot then.

326
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:43,780
No matter where they are,

327
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,180
Master has ordered us

328
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,420
to find them even if it means

329
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,100
turning the capital upside down.

330
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:49,940
Move!

331
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:50,740
Move!

332
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:03,060
Both of you, go to East Gate.

333
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,700
Both of you, go to West Gate.

334
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,340
We'll enter the city
from both the east and west.

335
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,100
It won't do.

336
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:13,820
As the ancient saying goes,

337
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,460
make a feint in the east, but attack in the west.

338
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,660
Heading to the same place from both sides

339
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:18,860
is not right.

340
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,060
No.

341
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,740
Sun Tzu's Art of War says

342
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:23,380
the art of war

343
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,700
is of vital importance to the Empire.

344
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,220
It is a matter of life and death,
a road either to safety or to ruin.

345
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,740
An inquiry is of the utmost importance.

346
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,500
To be exact, the first is political.

347
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,500
The second is timing. The third is geography.

348
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,100
The fourth is...

349
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,180
No.

350
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,300
All of you are wrong.

351
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,500
According to the "Attack by Stratagem" chapter,

352
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,580
the best way is to win by strategy,

353
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,940
followed by diplomatic relations,

354
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,740
followed by crushing the army,

355
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,140
and finally, by attacking a city.

356
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:47,020
Attacking the city is not a viable method.

357
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,460
Enough!

358
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,620
What are you talking about?

359
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:52,780
Did you only learn

360
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,900
about military theories in class?

361
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:01,900
Take them away!

362
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,300
Your Majesty.

363
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,660
I have something to report.

364
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,500
Grand Chancellor, please speak.

365
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,500
There's a lack of military funds.

366
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,940
I hope Your Majesty can think about

367
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:17,940
increasing taxes to be used as military funds.

368
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,540
I object!

369
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:20,820
Speak.

370
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,900
You don't know this, Your Majesty.

371
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:26,340
Yesterday, a group of men in black
rushed into the Grand Tutor's Residence

372
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:29,220
and captured the Grand Tutor

373
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,020
along with a few dozen students.

374
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,260
Their whereabouts are still unknown until now.

375
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:34,380
What?

376
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:36,500
Who did that?

377
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,180
Who else could it be?

378
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:41,140
The rumors of tax increases

379
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:43,980
have been spreading all around the capital.

380
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,580
With the Grand Tutor
and his students being captured,

381
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:50,020
everyone in the capital is panicking.

382
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:53,340
I request Your Majesty
not to approve Grand Chancellor's request

383
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:56,420
and release Grand Tutor Wei and his students.

384
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,100
Everyone, please leave for now.

385
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:11,540
I have something important
to discuss with the Grand Chancellor.

386
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,980
Dismiss.

387
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:15,500
-We will be leaving, Your Majesty.
-We will be leaving, Your Majesty.

388
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:25,580
Grand Chancellor.

389
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,700
Did you really do it?

390
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,180
Do you even need to ask?

391
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:31,860
Am I not the one

392
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,220
who always does these things?

393
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:36,300
Grand Chancellor, why did you do that?

394
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:40,060
Before asking me, Your Majesty must understand

395
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,340
why so many students

396
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:44,620
were gathering in Grand Tutor Wei's house.

397
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,620
I have an idea about that.

398
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,700
I will also deal with Grand Tutor Wei.

399
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,100
Grand Chancellor, you should release them.

400
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,700
What if Grand Tutor Wei still can't come out?

401
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,300
Grand Chancellor, do you need

402
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,500
to put everyone on the spot?

403
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,860
Actually, it's easy to get Grand Tutor Wei out.

404
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,060
It depends on your decision, Your Majesty.

405
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,860
You are trying to make a deal with me?

406
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:14,540
It's obvious.

407
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,580
But this deal is worth it for you, Your Majesty.

408
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:21,820
Tell me about it.

409
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:26,020
Calm the grievances
of the people in the capital in three days.

410
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,180
If Your Majesty can do that,

411
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,260
I guarantee

412
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:30,940
Grand Tutor Wei and his students

413
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,860
will return safely.

414
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:35,500
Deal.

415
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,860
I'll be leaving then.

416
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:49,940
At the moment,

417
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,180
we only have one method.

418
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:51,860
What is it?

419
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:52,580
Jing.

420
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,980
How many imperial bodyguards do you still have?

421
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,260
Counting those who are on duty and off duty,

422
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:59,340
around 20 people.

423
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,540
The men under you

424
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,300
are fewer than the people I have
in the Imperial Kitchen.

425
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,260
We have blades.

426
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,020
What do you have?

427
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,540
We have cleavers.

428
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,260
Let's compare. Come.

429
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:07,540
Stop fighting.

430
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,500
Twenty people are fine.

431
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:10,980
Your Highness.

432
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,060
What are you trying to do?

433
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:12,780
It's obvious.

434
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,020
Now that there's chaos out there,

435
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,620
why else would I request men from you?

436
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:17,220
Well,

437
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,620
we only have 20 people.

438
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,300
There are at least 200 citizens

439
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,620
who are protesting.

440
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:22,100
That's...

441
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,100
What can we do?

442
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,100
You really have no clue, huh?

443
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,340
Can we calm down

444
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,860
the protesting citizens out there?

445
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,420
I'm requesting men from you

446
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:31,540
to save Wei in the prison.

447
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,180
No.

448
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,620
You will be beheaded for this.

449
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,580
Even the Emperor is going. Who dares to behead us?

450
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,100
That's not right.

451
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,220
You're right, Your Majesty.

452
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,420
I think so too.

453
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,180
Twenty people are too many.

454
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:45,220
Just a few of us are enough.

455
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,340
Come here. We'll do this.

456
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,060
I'll scout ahead.

457
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,260
Protect His Majesty here

458
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:57,980
and wait for my signal.

459
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,700
What if you get caught?

460
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,700
I'll tell them my identity.

461
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,860
I'm an imperial bodyguard after all.

462
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:03,620
What can they do to me?

463
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:04,340
You're so rash.

464
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,460
Who would break into the prison
by revealing their identities?

465
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,620
I am the Emperor, Duan Yunzhang.

466
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,020
Open the gate immediately.

467
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,300
Open the gate immediately!

468
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,340
Let's go.

469
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:17,940
What is His Majesty doing?

470
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,780
Doing one thing as a diversion.

471
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,160
Yunzhang must have something else planned.

472
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,500
The design of this place is complicated.

473
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,460
His Majesty must have placed many men around.

474
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:25,740
Just wait here.

475
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,940
I want to meet the Grand Tutor alone.

476
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:28,540
Yunzhang.

477
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:29,340
Your Majesty!

478
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:31,340
It's too dangerous, Your Majesty!

479
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:31,940
Come back.

480
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,100
Grand Tutor, you have suffered.

481
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:50,420
I have a bet with Grand Chancellor Liu.

482
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:52,340
If I can calm the public grievances,

483
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,060
they will release you.

484
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,980
Are you blaming me?

485
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,540
Grand Tutor, please say something.

486
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:06,820
Let him say it.

487
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:07,660
Young man.

488
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:08,780
What did you call me?

489
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:10,740
No. Junior.

490
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,340
Grand Tutor Wei has left a message.

491
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,060
What is it?

492
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,100
Grand Tutor Wei said

493
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:20,100
if his students only know
how to talk about strategies

494
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:21,740
without adapting to the situation,

495
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:25,860
he'd rather die in the prison.

496
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,060
What else did he say?

497
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,220
He also said

498
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:32,220
he is annoyed at hearing his students speak.

499
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,580
No one should disturb him tonight.

00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,620
Thank you for your guidance, Grand Tutor.

501

Sir, can we leave?

502

Go back.

Sir.

How's your investigation?

505
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:59,660
I've cross-referenced the list

506

507

Just leave it to me.

Yes, sir.

The rapacious Grand Chancellor Liu.

Helper of the tyrant, Queen Lau.

Greedy Queen, Evil Emperor.

516
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,260
Both the Emperor and the Queen are mad.

517

A cruel government that's worse than a tiger.

Doesn't the person who wrote this feel afraid?

It's serious and he will be beheaded.

It is serious indeed.

Please tell His Majesty to calm down.

523

You should tell me to calm down first.

Look at it.

526
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,420
It was Liu Xie and His Majesty
who are asking them for money.

527
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:01,660
Why did they involve me?

I feel so aggrieved.

529

Liu Xie is so evil.

530

He is not only harming His Majesty but me as well.

What a coincidence.

Isn't this my dear father?

I see it clearly.

These old maids

00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,060
The idol of the old maids

669
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:23,580
is Grand Chancellor.

670
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:27,260
Pretty faces. So they are all fond of pretty faces.

671
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,020
Pretty Face.

672
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:35,580
What's wrong with you?

673
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:36,660
Did someone beat you up?

674
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:38,540
Show me. Don't hide from me.

675
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:44,980
What's wrong with you?

676
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:48,260
Don't run. I won't laugh at you.

677
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:49,300
I need you for something.

678
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,420
I won't laugh anymore.

679
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:52,260
It's fine. I won't laugh at you.

680
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:55,140
Don't cry. It's fine.

681
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,780
I won't tell anyone else.

682
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:58,460
I have a favor to ask from you.

683
00:30:58,580 --> 00:30:59,260
It's true!

684
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:01,780
What are they doing?

685
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:02,740
I don't know.

686
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:03,980
What are they doing?

687
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:05,900
I don't know.

688
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:10,260
Let go. Let go!

689
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,500
It's so funny!

690
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:26,700
Yu Changya.

691
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,540
Are you done laughing?

692
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:32,180
Obviously not.

693
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:34,540
Yu Changya. You deserve it.

694
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,380
I'm respecting the elderly.

695
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:39,780
Those old maids have no one to depend on.

696
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:40,500
I'm accompanying them

697
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,580
and doing facials for them

698
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,140
to earn a bit of money. What's wrong with that?

699
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,860
You were doing a facial over here?

700
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,660
Besides, are you really

701
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:49,020
earning just a bit of money?

702
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,900
Why did you look for me anyway?

703
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:56,740
I want you to send a letter to my mother.

704
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:57,300
No.

705
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,100
Do you really trust me?

706
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,220
I didn't in the past,

707
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,660
but it's different now.

708
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:05,300
From what I saw,

709
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,580
I can already create many different stories.

710
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:11,620
I'll definitely send you the letter.

711
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:12,900
Where's the letter?

712
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:14,820
Here.

713
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,180
Aren't you afraid that I'll take a peek?

714
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:18,820
No.

715
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:19,860
With your intelligence,

716
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,060
you won't understand it.

717
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,220
I really don't understand.

718
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:36,660
Why are you here?

719
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,340
The Imperial Palace belongs to me.

720
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,700
I can be anywhere I want.

721
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,020
Why are you here?

722
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:42,500
What's yours is mine.

723
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,940
I can also be anywhere I want.

724
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:46,500
Where have you been? Who did you meet?

725
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,500
What have you done?

726
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:48,660
Just now...

727
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:50,540
Why should I tell you?

728
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,740
I am the Emperor.

729
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:53,220
I have the right to know

730
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,660
everything that happens in the palace.

731
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,540
Did you just...

732
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:57,620
Nonsense. I didn't.

733
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,580
I won't tell you if you won't admit it.

734
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:00,420
Are you...

735
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:01,420
Will you admit it?

736
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:02,180
I'm leaving if you're not.

737
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:02,820
Stand there.

738
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:07,420
I got jealous.

739
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:09,700
What?

740
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:12,540
I admitted it. Stop pretending.

741
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:16,060
Did you get jealous of Yu Changya?

742
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:19,980
I thought you wanted some juicy gossip.

743
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,540
Do you even want those old women?

744
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:22,860
What old women?

745
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,860
Don't spread it.

746
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:31,620
Otherwise,

747
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:33,540
there won't be juicy gossip like this anymore.

748
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,740
I got jealous for nothing.

749
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:38,580
Of course.

750
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:39,820
You are so much better than Yu.

751
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:41,860
But I didn't expect

752
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:44,180
so many interesting things
to happen in the Imperial Palace.

753
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:45,060
I wonder if Sufang

754
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:46,060
has any more gossip.

755
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:47,380
I need to ask her again later.

756
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:49,420
Why are you all interested in these things?

757
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:50,380
We are not the only ones.

758
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:53,140
Everyone in the world is interested in it.

759
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:54,980
You don't get it, right?

760
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:55,700
Let me tell you.

761
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,940
Do you know what the things

762
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,740
that people talked about most
in Xianpa Village are?

763
00:33:58,860 --> 00:33:59,780
It's not whether there is a landslide

764
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:01,060
or an earthquake somewhere.

765
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:02,940
It is whether Wang's daughter

766
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,900
wants to marry Li's son

767
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,260
or Fang's son.

768
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:06,700
Also

769
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:07,940
whether the old woodcutter's son

770
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,100
is his biological son.

771
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:09,580
And

772
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:10,540
who was the one

773
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,980
who stole Granny Wang's chicken?

774
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,380
What?

775
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:15,340
Young man.

776
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:16,940
You are the Emperor.

777
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:18,620
Your job is to think about the Empire.

778
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:19,660
But normal citizens

779
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:20,780
only think about

780
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,740
household issues when they wake up.

781
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:23,940
What concerns them
are not the Empire-related issues

782
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:25,220
but household issues.

783
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:26,780
That's what a normal citizen is thinking.

784
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:27,580
Understand?

785
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:30,780
I got it!

786
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,300
I know that

787
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,460
but why are you so excited?

788
00:34:34,707 --> 00:34:36,107
Now, let me share more with you.

789
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,500
Do you understand?

790
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:40,180
We do understand.

791
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:42,620
But why do we need to understand all these?

792
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:43,540
Exactly.

793
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,660
What dishes
does the Grand Chancellor's chef cook every day?

794
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:47,420
What flowers are planted in Prince De's backyard?

795
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:48,620
Which fabric shop

796
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:49,820
did Commandery Prince Wen's
womenfolk patronize?

797
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:50,540
Also.

798
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:52,900
How many times does the Ministry of War's
Official Pi visit the restaurant every month?

799
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:55,060
How many servants does
the Ministry of Rites' Official Wu have?

800
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,820
How are they related?

801
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,500
Grand Tutor Wei is right.

802
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:01,300
It's no use to think about it that way.

803
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,500
We need to learn to adapt.

804
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,420
Is this what you call adapting?

805
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,060
Your gamble with Scorpion Liu

806
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,260
is to calm the public grievances.

807
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:09,140
How are they useful?

808
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:11,340
This is just the first step.

809
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:13,140
Something greater is coming.

810
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:24,460
Madam Fu.

811
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,260
Why are you here?

812
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,340
Jinfeng asked me to give you this letter.

813
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,860
Do you understand it?

814
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:35,740
I understand.

815
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,060
Wait for me.

816
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:38,460
Madam Fu.

817
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,060
What's wrong with your mouth?

818
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:41,780
It's nothing.

819
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:42,980
Wait for me here.

820
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:43,940
I won't be long.

821
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:44,460
Sure.

822
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:54,620
All right.

823
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,660
Take these to Jinfeng.

824
00:35:59,020 --> 00:35:59,980
So many?

825
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,460
What are they?

826
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:02,340
Oh.

827
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:04,180
When you see Jinfeng, remember to tell her

828
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:05,180
that I'm doing fine.

829
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,860
Ask her not to worry.

830
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:08,540
Sure.

831
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:13,420
Madam Fu.

832
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:14,740
Well...

833
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,620
Jinfeng is now the Queen.

834
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:18,700
Do you think these things...

835
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,060
