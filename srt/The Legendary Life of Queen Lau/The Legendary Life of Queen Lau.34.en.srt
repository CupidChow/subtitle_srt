Why should I tie you up if I can let you go?

29
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:37,119
I want to go back to the palace.

Look, you're talking crap again.

31
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:40,559
Of course I tied you up because I knew

32
00:02:40,559 --> 00:02:42,160
you were going to the palace.

33
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,800

Go.

95

that you don't want to rebel?

Is it that hard?

00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,279
I don't want to rebel.

105
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,200

00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,720
Why do we have to rebel

110
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,320
and do such an ungrateful thing?

111
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,079
I quit too.

112
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:41,399
His Majesty has said
that he will not attack Xiyue Empire.

you didn't think I'd catch you, did you?

125
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,559
Ridiculous!

126
00:07:43,679 --> 00:07:44,559
You're the one being ridiculous!

127
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:46,359
Do you know what crime you have committed?

128
00:07:46,559 --> 00:07:48,119
This is a crime that will bring about
nine familial exterminations.

129
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,600
The most important thing
is that His Majesty is your son-in-law.

130
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,839
That means he's in your nine relations too.

131
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:54,480
Wouldn't you be doing him a disservice?

132
00:07:54,559 --> 00:07:55,440
If I were to harm His Majesty,

133
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,000
would I have to put myself in danger?

134
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,920
You've ruined my plan!

135
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,799
Great.

136
00:08:23,799 --> 00:08:24,720
Your Majesty, you're mighty.

137
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,559
So my father is going to save His Majesty?

138
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,880
Yeah. What else do you think he's going to do?

139
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,719
They all said my father is...

140
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:44,919
Traitor?

141
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,559
I've told you before

142
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,880
that his face

143
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,599
and the way he smiles

144
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,000
are handsome,

145
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,159
but

146
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,960
it's easy for people to misunderstand him.

147
00:08:59,359 --> 00:08:59,840
Mother,

148
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,000
so you're saying

149
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,640
that the members of the palace are rebelling?

150
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,799
There are a lot of people in that palace.

151
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,400
I didn't lay so many pits.

152
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,960
You are a queen

153
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,400
who has never seen much of the world.

154
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:09,679
It's rebellion.

155
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:12,119
Do you think it's as easy as making a carriage

156
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:13,239
or building a house?

157
00:09:13,479 --> 00:09:15,000
Who would want to rebel

158
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,320
when they can lead a good life?

159
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,280
Didn't you say...

160
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,960
I mean, someone asked them to rebel,

161
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:24,440
but they won't necessarily do it.

162
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:27,440
Mother, you're confusing me.

163
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,039
Let me give you an example.

164
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,280
For example,

165
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:33,799
I wanted you to study hard

166
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:35,880
and be a well-mannered daughter,

167
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,119
but did you do that?

168
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,039
I didn't.

169
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,000
That's why.

170
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,039
You may not even listen to your mother,

171
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,640
let alone an old man you don't know.

172
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:49,679
Liu Xie,

173
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,679
didn't we have a deal?

174
00:09:52,239 --> 00:09:53,359
Since you can't bear to do it,

175
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:55,239
I'm willing to kill the young emperor for you.

176
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,159
If you share ten cities with me,

177
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,840
I'll make you the Emperor of the Donghao Empire.

178
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,479
It's the best for both of us,

179
00:10:00,719 --> 00:10:01,559
isn't it?

180
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,080
Of course not.

181
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,559
Do I need your support

182
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,000
if I want to be an emperor?

183
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,239
Moreover,

184
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,440
are those cities the only ones
you're ambitious about?

185
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:13,799
Do you think I don't know

186
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:15,080
what you've done in the last few years?

187
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:17,799
Scorpion Liu,

188
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:20,440
you're really cunning.

189
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,039
Honestly,

190
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,599
I don't care

191
00:10:23,599 --> 00:10:24,640
about being an emperor or not.

192
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,880
You don't even want to rule the world,

193
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,559
so tell me what you want?

194
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,719
I can't even explain it

195
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:33,280
to people like you.

196
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,880
You'll just have to die in peace.

197
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:36,880
Die?

198
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:40,159
Do you really think I came alone?

199
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,000
I got it.

200
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,159
You're talking about your spies

201
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:48,440
in the palace, aren't you?

202
00:10:49,359 --> 00:10:50,559
Then, I'll give you a chance now.

203
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,520
Just shout

204
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:54,880
and see who will obey your orders.

205
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,520
What a fool.

206
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,599
Right,

207
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,640
I have good news for you.

208
00:11:03,359 --> 00:11:05,479
Your nephew has gone back.

209
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:08,679
I think he should have passed
the valley checkpoint by now.

210
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,280
He isn't alone

211
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:11,559
as well.

212
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:15,280
I gave him 20,000 elite soldiers
of the Jingji Battalion.

213
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:15,840
You...

214
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:18,479
Li Yuan,

215
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,039
in your current situation,

216
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:22,599
you will still have some dignity

217
00:11:23,119 --> 00:11:24,599
if you die in Donghao Empire.

218
00:11:25,188 --> 00:11:26,280
If you go back

219
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,559
to your Xiyue Empire, I can't guarantee

220
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,440
what your nephews

221
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,039
will do to you.

222
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
That's it, okay?

223
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,039
Right, Your Majesty.

224
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,280
Is it appropriate for me to deal with it this way?

225
00:11:45,119 --> 00:11:47,719
You do have a point.

226
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,880
If you want to kill me, just do it.

227
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:54,880
What are you two putting up an act here?

228
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:56,599
All right.

229

Guard.

230
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,280
Yes.

231
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:01,599
Kill him.

232
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:06,479
Just kill him as the Grand Chancellor said.

233
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,440
Yes.

234
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,119
Take him out.

235
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,039
Scorpion Liu,

236
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,719
you're vile!

237
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,440
You're a vile man!

238
00:12:17,239 --> 00:12:18,760
Do you remember what I told you?

239
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:19,919
Don't ever forget it.

240
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:21,679
Go.

241
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,359
Why are you still standing here?

242
00:12:26,719 --> 00:12:27,320
Get lost.

243
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,559
We...

244
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,640
Thank you, Your Majesty.

245
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:08,520
Do we have to knock her out first or...?

246
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:11,280
What's the point of knocking her out
when she's asleep?

247
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,400
So how are we going to do it?

248
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,039
Like this.

249
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:18,679
Killing people is not like killing chickens.

250
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:21,320
Didn't you work in the Imperial Kitchen before?

251
00:13:21,599 --> 00:13:23,359
Isn't it common for you to kill chickens?

252
00:13:28,719 --> 00:13:29,320
I...

253
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,400

254
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,679
Your Majesty, you're awake.

255
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,080
I...

256
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:49,280
I feel my heart is beating too fast.

257
00:13:50,119 --> 00:13:52,719
It's as if there's a feeling
that the palace will be chaotic tonight

258
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,599
and that something will happen.

259
00:13:55,719 --> 00:13:58,039
It's a very peaceful night at the Imperial Palace.

260
00:13:58,479 --> 00:13:59,840
There's no sound at all.

261
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,039
How about I take you out for a look?

262
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,440
Yes.

263
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,039
Your Majesty.

264
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:04,919
Do you want to go out and take a look?

265
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:05,799
Come on.

266
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:07,000
Here.

267
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:15,080
Your Majesty, look.

268
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:16,599
It's very peaceful, isn't it?

[Qianluo Hall]

00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:23,919
Perform conjuring tricks.

271
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:24,880
I'm glad it's fine.

272
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:27,159
Your Majesty,

273
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:28,520
let us perform some conjuring tricks for you.

274
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,919
It will help you sleep.

275
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,799
Right, Your Majesty,

276
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:31,960
I'm good at performing conjuring tricks.

277
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,479
-Yes.
-Let's go

278
00:14:32,479 --> 00:14:33,159
and take a look.

279
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,239
I can change something
into a red flower and a mouse.

280
00:14:37,359 --> 00:14:38,559
I know many tricks.

281
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:40,880
They all love the tricks I perform.

It's been

284
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,799
a long night.

285
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:11,960
Your Highness.

286
00:15:14,719 --> 00:15:15,520
How is it?

287
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,359
Exactly as you expected.

Where are you going, Your Highness?

I can't be unrighteous

even if he's unkind.

Your Highness.

299
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,130
The Grand Chancellor informed us

300
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,730
to let you bid farewell to him.

301
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:37,050
The Grand Chancellor also said

that he's received that thing.

303
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:54,490
What else did the Grand Chancellor say?

304
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,100
The Grand Chancellor said

305
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,930
that it's up to you to decide
whether he should live or die.

Let's go.

307
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,090
It seems that Liu Xie, that cunning man,

308
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,250
has long noticed
that something is wrong with you.

Is that what you want to say to me?

310
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:27,020
What else do you want me to say to you?

311

You're a traitor,

312
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,850
so what do you want me to say to you?

313
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:31,130
Li Yuan,

314

do you remember

315
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,130
what you said to me back then?

316
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:37,610
You said you'll come and take me home
when you've achieved great success.

317
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:41,330
I've never cared about
achieving great success or not.

318
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:45,420
I only remember that you'll come and take me home.

319
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,300
You are not

320

the same Li Yuan I knew back then.

321
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:55,250
Maybe you are the same Li Yuan all along,

322
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:57,490
but I am the one

who is wrong.

Do you remember this dagger?

325
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:15,700
This is the dagger

326
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:19,940
you used to stab your elder brother in the chest.

327
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,330
I should have expected

328
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:31,450
that you would be able to take my life
when you could bear

329
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,300
to kill even your own family.

330
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:39,490
Since I'm in such a state,

331

just kill me right away.

332

that it is up to me to decide
whether you live or die.

00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:18,450
Why should I leave?

336
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:20,970
I'll trade you for military power
with Duan Yunzhang.

337
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:23,090
Only with military power,

338
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,580
can I regain what I have lost.

339
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,090
I should have known

340
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,060
you're such an ungrateful

341
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:34,940
and unrepentant man.

342
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:38,700
Listen here.

343
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:40,210
Since the moment

344
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:41,850
I killed my elder brother with my own hands,

345
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:44,330
I've never been able to turn back.

346
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:45,370
Move.

347
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,130
His Majesty has decreed

348
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:15,130
that Consort Dowager Xu is to be absolved

349
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,330
of all past crimes

350
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:18,780
for her meritorious capture of the traitor.

351
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:21,370
It's all

352
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,940
over.

353
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:50,820
Mother,

354
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:51,940
it's morning.

355
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:56,610
I can see it.

356
00:20:57,370 --> 00:20:58,900
It's all over, right?

357
00:20:58,900 --> 00:20:59,700
Let go of me now.

358
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,820
Let me go back now.

359
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,660
What's the rush?

360
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:05,660
The key issue remains unresolved.

361
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:06,820
What issue?

362
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:13,330
Of course, it's about your father and His Majesty.

363
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:14,210
They've been talking all night

364
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:15,450
and they still haven't settled it?

365
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:17,820
I'll teach you one more thing.

366
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,580
Do you know

367
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:20,900
what the most important thing for men is?

368
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:21,540
What is it?

369
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,850
Pride.

370
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:24,450
It is normal for them

371
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,330
to converse all night for their pride.

372
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,420
And who do you think will give in,
Father or His Majesty?

373
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:33,210
I think it will be His Majesty.

374
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:34,330
How so?

375
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:37,130
I took a guess.

376
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:57,540
Grand Chancellor.

377
00:21:59,646 --> 00:22:00,490
What's wrong, Your Majesty?

378
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,580
Are you hungry?

379
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,060
I will ask for breakfast to be served.

380
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,210
I'm not hungry.

381
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:09,210
Are you hungry, Your Majesty?

382
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:12,490
I'm not hungry either.

383
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:27,090
Your Majesty,

384
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:32,850
do you remember what the Late Emperor said to you

385
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:34,180
before he passed away?

386
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:35,780
Of course I do.

387
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:37,900
Tell me.

388
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:44,970
My father told me to be a benevolent ruler,

389
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:47,020
to bring peace and prosperity to the country,
to enrich the people,

390
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,820
and to be a man like no other before

391
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:49,730
or since...

392
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:50,820
Enough.

393
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:52,020
It's not these.

394
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:55,700
Just a little further back.

395
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:02,580
Father has told me to listen to you.

396
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,820
Yes, that's it.

397
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:06,700
What do you mean?

398
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:10,490
Your Majesty, will you listen

399
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,370
to what I say now?

400
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,850
Please go ahead.

401
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:19,450
I think

402
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:21,850
you should apologize to me.

403
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:24,060
You want me to apologize to you?

404
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:25,490
Why do I think

405
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:27,850
it should be you
who has to give me an explanation first?

406
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:29,060
Explanation?

407
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,700
What do I need to explain?

408
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:33,780
Back then, you asked Li Yuan

409
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,580
to help you to usurp the throne,

410
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,820
and you claimed to replace me.

411
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:39,820
But today you suddenly said

412
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,850
you're not interested in being an emperor,

413
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:44,450
and you got rid of Li Yuan right away.

414
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:47,420
You're always so fickle,

415
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,090
confusing,

416
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:50,060
and mystifying.

417
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:51,900
Shouldn't you give me an explanation?

418
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:57,490
I'm not sure if by "back then" you mean...

419
00:23:57,490 --> 00:23:58,820
You haven't forgotten, have you?

420
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:03,490
It was when I left the palace,

421
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,420
I sneaked into your residence

422
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:07,940
and overheard your private talks
with the emissary of the Xiyue Empire.

423
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:12,540
Of course I remember that.

424
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,610
Now that we're talking about your childhood,

425
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:18,850
do you remember

426
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,610
what you did back then?

427
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,300
Look at me.

428
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:57,940
What should we do?

429
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:18,850
Your Majesty.

430
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:21,060
Your Majesty!

431
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:25,850
What is this?

432
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:27,850
What is it?

433
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:30,610
Doesn't it look like you?

434
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:33,090
I've been looking at your face

435
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:35,330
every day at the morning assembly.

436
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:38,420
Is this the political discourse
you promised me you would complete?

437
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:40,020
Is this a political discourse?

438
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:40,490
Right,

439
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:42,820
do you see any of them

440
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:44,090
like you in here?

441
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:53,060
So, you've been looking at my face

442
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,940
every day at the morning assembly, right?

443
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:58,300
I've always heard the maids say

444
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,580
you are handsome.

445
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:02,180
Of course I have to study
what makes you so handsome.

446
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:03,820
State affairs are so boring,

447
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:05,370
and they are none of my business.

448
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:06,700
What did you say?

449
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,210
State affairs are boring?

450
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:11,300
Hand!

451
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:13,490
It's lunchtime!

452
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:14,300
Just punish me tomorrow.

453
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,180
Your Majesty!

454
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:39,610
Your Majesty.

455
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:47,330
Can you explain

456
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:50,250
how someone who should be studying
at the Imperial Academy at this moment

457
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:52,970
can be lying on the grass in the Imperial Garden?

458
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:56,250
Tell me.

459
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:04,250
That's so scary!

460
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,610
I dare not to do this anymore.

461
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,580
Help me see

462
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,730
if there's any more of that bug back there.

463
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:11,450
Your Majesty,

464
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,130
stop pretending, okay?

465
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:14,900
How many times have you pulled this trick?

466
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:19,940
I'm really afraid.

467
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:25,090
Forget it.

468
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:26,420
Today's examination

469
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,250
will be held in Xuanchen Hall.

470
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:33,970
No.

471
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:34,660
No way.

472
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:35,820
Get up.

473
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,130
I don't want to take the examination.

474
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:40,130
I won't go down.

475
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:41,420
Your Majesty.

476
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:42,250
That's too dangerous.

477
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:43,300
-Come down, Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty, come down now.

478
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,250
I will count to three.

479
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:46,420
Try it if you don't want to get down.

480
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:48,180
I won't go down.

481
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:49,780
Aren't you great?

482
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:51,090
Come up and beat me.

483
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:51,700
You...

484
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,180
I just didn't finish it on time.

485
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:55,490
What is there to see in all these piles

486
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:56,970
of boring stuff every day?

487
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,540
How dare you beat me!

488
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:00,250
Even my father never beat me once.

489
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:02,850
Am I not as important as these memorials?

490
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:04,130
Your Majesty.

491
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:06,900
It's okay for you to mess around.

492
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:08,730
But these memorials

493
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,490
are about the livelihood of the people.

494
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:14,180
How long are you going to be so willful?

495
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,060
When will you understand

496
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:18,020
that you have a responsibility
on your shoulders?

497
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:19,330
You keep saying about responsibility every day.

498
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:20,250
You're so annoying!

499
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,300
Being the Emperor is so tiring and boring!

500
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:23,540
I don't want to be one anymore.

501
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:24,660
You can be one yourself!

502
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:27,250
Help yourself, Your Majesty.

503
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:28,730
Take it away.

504
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:30,370
Grand Chancellor.

505
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:31,540
Grand Chancellor, where are you going?

506
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:34,060
Not only do I not want to be the Emperor anymore,

507
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:34,850
but...

508
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:36,250
but I also want to leave the Imperial Palace.

509
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:40,020
It seems that you have remembered everything.

510
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:44,300
We all have our moments of ignorance.

511
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:45,330
I am no exception.

512
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:46,660
Anyway,

513
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:50,090
what does this have to do
with your mystification?

514
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:53,700
If I had not been

515
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,780
a dictatorial and treacherous official

516
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:58,450
who had been eyeing the throne at all times,

517
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:01,900
would you have amended your ways

518
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:05,210
and become a wise emperor?

519
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:07,940
You mean...

520
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:09,970
You should still remember

521
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:13,130
what you said
when you discovered the so-called conspiracy

522
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:15,020
between me and the emissary

523
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:16,820
from the Xiyue Empire.

524
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:20,130
Your Majesty!

525
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:21,300
Liu Xie!

526
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:22,940
You've got a lot of nerve!

527
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,610
How dare you conspire with the Xiyue Empire

528
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:25,700
to commit rebellion?

529
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:27,090
You'll have to

530
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,700
go to prison to pay for your crime!

531
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:29,580
Your Majesty,

532
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,060
if I were imprisoned,

533
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:35,250
who would handle
the affairs of the nation tomorrow?

534
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:38,330
From now on, I will be diligent and disciplined

535
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:39,970
in guarding my father's empire,

536
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:42,300
and I will not let you and other traitors steal it.

537
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:44,060
Diligent and disciplined.

538
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:45,820
Guarding your father's empire.

539
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:48,330
I have always remembered this.

540
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:52,780
Because this was the first ambitious statement

541
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:56,020
I heard from you since I was appointed

542
00:29:56,450 --> 00:29:58,300
by the Late Emperor to assist you.

543
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:00,330
Before that,

544
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:03,490
I was so disappointed in you

545
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:06,090
that I was going to give up.

546
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:10,490
So you pretended to be treacherous
all these years

547
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:12,970
just to motivate me

548
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:15,420
to work hard to be a good emperor.

549
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:17,900
You think too highly of yourself, don't you?

550
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:20,700
There is another reason

551
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,780
why I was doing this.

552
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:24,300
Another reason?

553
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,660
It seems that you still don't understand.

554
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:31,420
When Li Yuan first tried to usurp the throne,

555
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:33,450
he asked someone to negotiate with me

556
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:36,490
and said he would help me
to usurp the throne, but he demanded some cities,

557
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:40,090
which proved that he was ambitious
to invade Donghao Empire.

558
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:43,900
At that time, I was just playing along with him.

559
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:46,450
But by chance, you saw it

560
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:49,060
and thought I had treasonous intentions.

561
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:53,490
At that time, the spies that Xiyue Empire
had planted in Donghao Empire

562
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:54,660
hadn't yet been found.

563
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:58,180
I thought I might as well
beat them at their own game.

564
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:02,210
At least in Donghao Empire, with me,
a great treacherous official

565
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:04,820
eyeing the throne, in the way,

566
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:07,580
Li Yuan would have to stay behind,

567
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:08,660
no matter how ambitious he was.

568
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:11,940
So I had time to find out the spies.

569
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:14,450
Are you telling me

570
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:16,730
that all the spies captured before
were spies from Xiyue Empire?

571
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:18,850
Including Elder General Ling
and Grand Tutor Wei?

572
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,020
You guessed it right.

573
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:23,940
So,

574
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:26,610
you're being honest with me today

575
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:30,130
because you've found all the spies?

576
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:31,250
That's for sure.

577
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:33,780
Now that Li Yuan was executed,

578
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:35,300
everything is over,

579
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,780
and you can apologize.

580
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:43,210
You're a good and bad person at different times.

581
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:44,370
You're mystifying.

582
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:45,820
Why should I apologize to you?

583
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:49,370
The Late Emperor said
that you should listen to me,

584
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:50,450
which means

585
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,610
that you should listen to my advice
when I am a good person

586
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:55,370
and listen to my crap when I am a bad person.

587
00:31:56,370 --> 00:31:57,250
Shouldn't you apologize

588
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:59,850
for not listening to me

589
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:01,730
and being suspicious of me?

590
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:04,090
Since ancient times,

591
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:06,660
only officials have ever
apologized to the Emperor,

592
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,970
not the Emperor to the officials.

593
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:11,060
You're wrong.

594
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:14,130
Didn't Jinfeng teach you this?

595
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:16,210
What?

596
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,020
Apologize when you're wrong,

597
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:19,660
no matter who you are.

598
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:24,850
I'm sorry.

599
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:31,420
Grand Chancellor,

600
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:33,940
why did you have to

601
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,730
make such a big detour before

602
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:37,020
and not explain it clearly?

603
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:38,060
You're wrong again.

604
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:38,940
What's wrong again?

605
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,730
Didn't Jinfeng teach you this either?

606
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:45,060
What's the point of explaining

607
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,490
if you believe?

608
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:49,340
Everyone doesn't understand

609
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:52,060
why I married Jinfeng into the palace,

610
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:53,860
and now I'm telling you

611
00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:55,460
it's because of this.

612
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,700
She has something that you don't have.

613
00:32:58,220 --> 00:32:59,460
And these are the things

614
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:02,170
that an emperor should know,

615
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:04,700
and they are things a man should know.

616
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:09,530
I got it.

617
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:14,340
It seems that not only
do I have to apologize to you

618
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:16,010
but also have to thank you

619
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:19,010
for giving me Jinfeng.

620
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:20,890
You're welcome.

621
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:22,980
Grand Chancellor,

622
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:24,530
I still have a question.

623
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:25,740
Please go ahead, Your Majesty.

624
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:29,130
I have heard that you didn't see Jinfeng before.

625
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:30,370
So how did you know

626
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:31,770
what kind of person she is?

627
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:34,100
Well,

628
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:37,370
like mother, like daughter.

629
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:39,370
I believe in her mother.

630
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:40,740
Without explanation,

631
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,170
of course I believe her too.

632
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:44,620
I understood.

633
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:47,770
Then, I will take Jinfeng back to the palace later.

634
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:49,580
Well...

635
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:51,860
I don't think it's possible.

636
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:53,650
How so?

637
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:56,060
In my opinion,

638
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,290
it won't be as easy as you think

639
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:01,130
to get Jinfeng back to the palace.

640
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:03,980
After all, you went a bit too far before.

641
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:06,060
Isn't that what you said?

642
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:08,250
Jinfeng should believe what I said.

643
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:12,380
What I just said was reasonable,

644
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:15,770
but sometimes, it's a little difficult

645
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:17,140
to reason with women.

646
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:21,340
What should I do, then?

647
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:23,690
I really don't know about this.

648
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:25,970
After all, this is your household affair,

649
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:27,420
and I cannot interfere with it.

650
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:28,900
Where are you going?

651
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:30,660
Father told me to listen to you,

652
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:31,820
and now you're running away?

653
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:33,180
Your Majesty,

654
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:35,820
you should think about how to coax the Queen.

655
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:37,580
I really can't interfere with it.

656
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:39,660
I shall take my leave.

657
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:40,380
Hey.

658
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:41,580
Grand Chancellor.

659
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:42,900
You...

660
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:46,900
How irresponsible.

661
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:55,100
Reporting to Your Majesty,

662
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:57,450
an urgent report came from
the valley checkpoint last night

663
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:00,060
about a coup in Xiyue Empire.

664
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,730
The Emperor of Xiyue, Li Yuan, was assassinated

665
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:05,620
and his military power was taken back.

666
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:07,820
I have verified

667
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:11,730
that the coup was planned by Li Ya,
the son of the Late Emperor of the Xiyue Empire,

668
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:15,210
who is also the former crown prince.

669
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:23,100
Your Majesty.

670
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:24,900
Your Majesty.

671
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:26,580
Yes? What's the matter?

672
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:29,140
A coup took place in Xiyue Empire.

673
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:30,730
Coup?

674
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:32,420
I got it.

675
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:33,530
Anything else?

676
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:35,620
Your Majesty,

677
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:38,930
won't you issue a decree?

678
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:42,730
It's none of my business if they have a coup.

679
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:45,140
What are you nervous about?

680
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:48,620
Anything else to report?

681
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:54,770
Your Majesty.

682
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,140
I have received a secret message

683
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:01,180
that Consort Dowager Xu
has caused trouble in the harem

684
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:04,210
and Prince Qi is not the son of the Late Emperor.

685
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:07,620
Who sent you the secret message?

686
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:08,620
Well,

687
00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:10,820
I don't know about that.

688
00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:14,620
I have plenty of these secret messages here.

689
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:18,730
It's as if it says

690
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:22,210
that the Queen isn't
the Grand Chancellor's daughter

691
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:25,770
and that the Minister of War
is a spy of the Cangwu Empire.

692
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:27,660
Spy?

693
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,010
Your Majesty.

694
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,580
I... I'm not.

695
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:31,690
Your Majesty,

696
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:33,580
I'm willing to die to prove my innocence.

697
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:35,180
Don't die yet.

698
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:36,490
I haven't finished my sentence.

699
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:38,420
And this

700
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:44,180
says that the wife of the Minister of Rites

701
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:47,860
is the daughter of a traitor
from the former dynasty.

702
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:50,140
Your Majesty,

703
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:53,010
my wife is the daughter
of a loyal and virtuous official.

704
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:55,690
She is definitely not the daughter of a rebel.

705
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:58,340
Please investigate it, Your Majesty.

706
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:00,660
You two, please rise.

707
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:04,450
-Thank you, Your Majesty.
-Thank you, Your Majesty.

708
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:07,340
In fact, what I mean is

709
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:10,250
that most of these secret messages are lies.

710
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:12,730
If I were to read these secret messages every day,

711
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,340
how would I have time
to get on with real business?

712
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:18,100
You are wise, Your Majesty.

713
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:21,450
I have therefore decided to abolish

714
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:22,900
the practice of all secret messaging

715
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,140
in the future.

716
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:25,770
Any matter,

717
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:28,010
be it impeachment or reporting,

718
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:29,290
should be done openly.

719
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,530
It is only right

720
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:32,490
that between you and me,
the Emperor and the officials,

721
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:33,970
should not be suspicious

722
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:35,060
of each other.

723
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,240
Yes, Your Majesty.

724
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,250
So, anything else?

725
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:48,970
If there's nothing,

726
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:50,820
I would like to ask you a question.

727
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,620
As the old saying goes,

728
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:56,340
improve yourself, reconcile your family, govern
your country wisely, and bring peace to the world.

729
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:00,100
Reconciling the family is a little difficult.

730
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:02,210
So I'd like to ask you all

731
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:04,180
how you have been

732
