General Zhu

57
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,919
brought 5,000 Xiyue soldiers with her.

58
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,279
They are stationed right outside the city gate.

59
00:03:28,559 --> 00:03:30,240
If His Majesty refuses to marry her,

60
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,720
she will invade the city.

Do you get it?

62
00:03:34,559 --> 00:03:36,679
So you're asking me
to let His Majesty take her as a consort.

I...

64

I'll be even more direct.

65
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,399
The people of the Xiyue Empire

66

are strong fighters.

67

They're not a force to be taken lightly of.

68

If we do not agree to the marriage alliance,

69

we won't be able to resist them.

to the marriage alliance.

hurry back and placate my mother.

78

the deposed crown prince, Li Ya,
is within the capital.

they could not find a single trace of him

102

despite having searched the entire city.

103
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,959
I venture to guess

104
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,839
that he might have taken the risk

105
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,040
and hid within the palace.

106
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,320
Impossible.

107
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:20,880
Our spies inside the palace told me

108
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,440
that he wasn't there.

109
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,760
You can leave now.

110
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,559
Yes, Your Majesty.

111
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:38,640

112

what is Li Yuan trying to do?

113

A marriage alliance.

114
00:05:44,559 --> 00:05:45,880
He even sent stationed
his troops around the borders.

115
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,640
He is a greedy fellow.

116
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:52,320
But if he gets his way,

117
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,119
there would be

118
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:54,519
even less hope for you, Your Highness.

119
00:05:56,559 --> 00:05:58,359
All I need to do is get that name list,

120
00:05:58,359 --> 00:06:00,040
get rid of his spies within the Imperial Palace,

121
00:06:00,239 --> 00:06:01,480
and he'll be out of leverage.

122
00:06:03,359 --> 00:06:04,839
All that's left will be up to Liu Xie.

123
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,600
Haven't you always been making other moves

124
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,720
because you don't trust that man?

125
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,160
Liu Xie is hard to read.

126
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:15,799
But I have a feeling...

00:07:18,679 --> 00:07:19,279
Your Majesty.

144
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:21,200
No news from the barracks outside the city.

145
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:21,920
Your Majesty,

146
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,799
we've searched the palace.

147
00:07:22,799 --> 00:07:23,920
Her Majesty is indeed nowhere to be found.

148
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,399
There must be a mistake.

149
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:27,079
Maybe Her Majesty didn't go to the barracks.

150
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:27,799
No.

151
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:29,480
She must've gone there.

152

But if she had,

153
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,440
why would there be no news of her?

154
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,839
Unless...

155
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,359
Unless she has fallen into unexpected danger.

156

Honey goes great

with whole roast lamb.

158
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:56,200
And when it's half cooked,

159
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,440
add some coarse salt.

160
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:58,679
Just wait till you get a taste of this.

161
00:07:59,359 --> 00:08:00,399
Do you have coarse salt?

162
00:08:00,679 --> 00:08:01,279
Yes.

163
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,359
Oh, you do.

164
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,920
That's all?

165
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,760
That's all we have.

166
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,799
All right. This will do.

167
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:08,839
This lamb needs to be cooked longer.

168
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:09,880
Listen.

169
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,880
When it's almost done,

170
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,000
sprinkle some coarse salt

171
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,839
and cumin on it,

172
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:13,880
and it'll be delicious.

173
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:14,799
Miss,

174
00:08:15,239 --> 00:08:16,720
who did you say you were just now?

175
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,640
The Queen of Donghao, Liu Jinfeng.

176
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:25,320
No way.

177
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,559
There's no way someone like you is the Queen.

178
00:08:26,799 --> 00:08:27,359
I think

179
00:08:27,679 --> 00:08:29,320
she just came here

180
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,559
to see all the men.

181
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,600
Pipe down.

182
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,320
Don't snicker.

183
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,840
I think she's interesting.

184
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,719
She even knows how to roast lamb.

185
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,200
We've been out here for so many years.

186
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,960
I've never met someone as interesting as her.

187
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,359
Listen up.

188
00:08:40,359 --> 00:08:41,679
No one is to expose her.

189
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:42,400
Got it?

190
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,280
-Yes.
-Right.

191
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,880
Where's General Zhu?

192
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,000
I have business with her.

193
00:08:48,119 --> 00:08:49,239
She knows her stuff.

194
00:08:50,239 --> 00:08:51,400
General Zhu is busy.

195
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,239
Just keep roasting the lamb.

196
00:08:52,239 --> 00:08:53,520
I'll take you to her later.

197
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,520
All right.

198
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,280
Do we have any other roasting spits?

199
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,200
I don't think two lambs will be enough.

200
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,200
I'll roast another lamb.

201
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,359
-We do!
-Go and get it.

202
00:08:59,359 --> 00:09:00,479
-We do.
-I'll go and get it.

203
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,479
All right.

204
00:09:02,479 --> 00:09:03,840
We can put the salt on this one now.

205
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,200
The way she roasts lamb

206
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,640
really reminds me of my sister.

207
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,679
Before I left on this expedition,
my mother and my sister told me

208
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:21,320
they will make lamb for me when I return too.

209
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,559
How is it?

210
00:09:46,599 --> 00:09:47,400
It's the same taste, all right.

211
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,479
Bring some for Jinfeng

212
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:50,840
when you go to the palace tomorrow.

213
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,719
She loves my roasted lamb.

214
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:55,960
No need.

215
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,039
Why not?

216
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,640
Didn't you say

217
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,679
these lambs are offerings from Xiyue?

218
00:10:02,239 --> 00:10:04,159
The ones inside the palace can't compare to these.

219
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:05,760
Right now,

220
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,119
she has more than enough Xiyue lambs.

221
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,200
She doesn't need any more.

222
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,159
Really?

223
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,840
I guess the palace must have quite the supply.

224
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,679
Yongfu,

225
00:10:17,119 --> 00:10:19,200
why don't we roast that little pig of yours?

226
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,000
Don't you dare!

227
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,200
You...

228
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,000
Don't even think about roasting my Piggy.

229
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,200
Just kidding.

230
00:10:29,359 --> 00:10:31,000
Can you grill two buns for me then?

231
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,200
All right.

232
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,719
You're old, but you have quite the appetite.

233
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:38,799
You can sure eat a lot.

234
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,119
Well, I'm old and vigorous.

235
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,359
Someone.

236
00:10:59,239 --> 00:10:59,719
Yes,

237
00:10:59,719 --> 00:11:00,599
Your Majesty?

238
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:02,320
Summon Liu Xie.

239
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:03,239
Yes, Your Majesty.

240
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,559
Oh, please hurry up, Grand Chancellor.

241
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:11,200
His Majesty needs to see you urgently.

242
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:13,359
Shuan.

243
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:17,799
Where's that sound coming from?

244
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,760
From Qianluo Hall.

245
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:23,479
Qianluo Hall?

246
00:11:23,719 --> 00:11:26,239
Consort Dowager Xu
has liked to play this song lately.

247
00:11:26,239 --> 00:11:27,239
She plays it quite often.

248
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,000
Consort Dowager Xu?

249
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,679
Is something the matter, Grand Chancellor?

250
00:11:34,599 --> 00:11:35,919
Nothing. Lead the way.

251
00:11:40,239 --> 00:11:41,799
Consort Dowager Xu.

252
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,239
Grand Chancellor.

253
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:49,239
Because of the marriage alliance,

254
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,119
Jinfeng went to the Xiyue military camp.

255
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,239
I summoned you here
to figure out how we can get her back.

256
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,679
It's that taste.

257
00:12:04,119 --> 00:12:05,239
We're talking about the Queen.

258
00:12:05,359 --> 00:12:06,239
Your daughter!

259
00:12:07,239 --> 00:12:08,119
I heard you.

260
00:12:08,719 --> 00:12:10,760
That's why I said that, didn't I?

261
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,840
What did you say?

262
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,080
It's that taste.

263
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,880
I don't have the time for riddles.

264
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,440
This is a serious matter.

265
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,119
We haven't come to a decision
regarding the marriage alliance yet.

266
00:12:21,599 --> 00:12:23,359
We need to come up
with a solution as soon as possible.

267
00:12:23,359 --> 00:12:24,000
Your Majesty,

268
00:12:24,359 --> 00:12:26,559
how do you know if she won't be able

269
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:28,200
to enter the barracks alone

270
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,559
and solve the matter

271
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:31,200
without needing a single soldier all by herself?

272
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,000
What do you mean?

273
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,320
I'm telling you that the matter

274
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,320
is not as complicated as you think it is.

275
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,440
My mother was right.

276
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,400
Lamb from Xiyue Empire is the best, after all.

277
00:12:57,799 --> 00:12:59,440
You've had our lamb before?

278
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:00,359
No.

279
00:13:00,359 --> 00:13:01,320
But my mother has.

280
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,599
She said she had it a lot as a child.

281
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,359
Your mother is from Xiyue too?

282
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:06,919
Well, I never asked.

283
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:09,640
Don't you care where she is from?

284
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,159
Why should I?

285
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,440
Does it make a difference?

286
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,760
You guys are from Xiyue Empire.

287
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,679
I'm from Donghao Empire.

288
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:16,039
But we're all eating lamb here, aren't we?

289
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:18,400
Fair point.

290
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:21,960
What else can you do

291
00:13:22,239 --> 00:13:23,239
besides roasting lamb?

292
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:25,400
A lot of things.

293
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,559
Perform for us then.

294
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:27,520
No, no.

295
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,359
Come on.

296
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,359
Oh, don't.

297
00:13:29,359 --> 00:13:29,960
Give us a performance.

298
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,640
Oh, that won't do.

299
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,760
Let's have her perform for us, shall we?

300
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,119
All right! Come on!

301
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,320
Good idea!

302
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:37,840
Come on!

303
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,719
All right then.

304
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,159
Let's see...

305
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:45,679
You have a xun!

306
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,520
This thing?

307
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,559
My mother gave this to me.

308
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,640
My mother taught me
how to play this thing when I was a kid!

309
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,200
Really?

310
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,200
I'll play a song with this.

311
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:54,200
Let's have her play us a song!

312
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,119
Play us a song!

313
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,320
Come on!

314
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,000
All right. Here I go.

315
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,760
Play us a song!

316
00:15:37,119 --> 00:15:37,760
Someone!

317
00:15:44,719 --> 00:15:46,200
Who is playing the xun?

318
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,080
And they're even playing such a bewitching song.

319
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,479
Speak!

320
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,679
What do you think?

321
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:15,400
Why are you guys crying?

322
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,880
Was it that bad?

323
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,230
No.

324
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:22,430
You played beautifully.

325
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:24,180
Why are you guys crying then?

326
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:27,500
I miss my mother.

327
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:30,430
I want to go home.

328
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:31,940
I don't want to fight anymore.

329
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:33,790
I want to go home.

330
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:36,140
I want to go home.

331
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,310
Tell your general then.

332
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:39,940
Tell them you don't want to fight anymore.
Tell them you want to go home.

333
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:44,790
She is right.

334
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:46,180
Let's tell His Majesty

335
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,470
we don't want to fight anymore.

336
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,670
We want to go home!

337
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:50,870
Yes!

338
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:52,820
-We want to go home.
-We don't want to fight anymore.

339
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,470
We want to go home.

340
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,700
We don't want to fight anymore.

341
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,870
We've been on this expedition for three years.

342
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,380
They said we could go home after the war ended.

343
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,380
But we're getting further and further away.

344
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,230
We've come all this way,

345
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,380
but they won't let us go home.

346
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:04,380
Right.

347
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:05,980
Let's tell His Majesty

348
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:08,030
we want to go home!

349
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:13,830
We want to go home!

350
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:14,830
Who wants to go home?

351
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:22,910
General Zhu!

352
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:23,860
I've been looking for you all day.

353
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:24,950
I want to talk to you.

354
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:28,310
Who said they wanted to go home?

355
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:35,670
Your Majesty.

356
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:37,830
I wish to go home.

357
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:39,590
Why?

358
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:41,620
Your Majesty,

359
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,460
I've been out here for three years.

360
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:44,710
I've never returned home during this period.

361
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,340
I have an elderly mother waiting for me at home.

362
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,910
Please grant my wish, Your Majesty.

363
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,590
What is your name?

364
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:53,340
The Chiliarch of the Vanguard, Rong Dan.

365
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:54,980
Rong Dan.

366
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:56,950
All right.

367
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:58,620
Men.

368
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,460
Take him down and chop his head off.

369
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:03,910
Have mercy, Your Majesty!

370
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,310
Your Majesty!

371
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:07,670
Have mercy, Your Majesty!

372
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:08,670
Your Majesty!

373
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,550
Have you no heart?

374
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:13,460
All he wanted was to go home,

375
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,590
and you sentenced him to death!

376
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,460
Who else wants to go home?

377
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:23,590
You were the one who played
the Song of Return, weren't you?

378
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:26,550
The Queen of the Donghao Empire.

379
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:28,430
You know me?

380
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:31,030
Donghao Empire proclaims itself
as a great empire.

381
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,260
But they sent a mere woman such as you

382
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,790
to disturb the minds of my soldiers.

383
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,380
What's even more ludicrous

384
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,620
is that my men

385
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:39,620
actually fell for your tricks.

386
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:41,140
I disturbed the minds of the soldiers?

387
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,830
When have I ever done that?

388
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:43,980
You've been having them fight endless wars

389
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:44,790
and refusing to let them go home.

390
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,070
You're the one that's disturbing their minds!

391
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:47,070
Refusing to admit your deeds.

392
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,790
Men! Arrest her!

393
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:50,910
Why?

394
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:52,190
I was right, wasn't I?

395
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:53,830
You're old, evil,

396
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:54,830
and heartless!

397
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,460
You despicable old man!

398
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,430
I hit a sore spot, didn't I?

399
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,500
You're absolutely cold-blooded!

400
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,430
Let me go!

401
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,140
Your Majesty!

402
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:23,550
Your Majesty! Terrible news!

403
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:29,310
We just received this from Xiyue Empire.

404
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,260
Is this what you mean by "not complicated"?

405
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:45,220
Is this what you mean by "easy"?

406
00:19:51,067 --> 00:19:52,625
[Queen Lau has trespassed into Xiyue's barracks.]

407
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:53,675
[We ask that the Emperor of Donghao
come and fetch her himself.]

408
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,710
Things are indeed a little more complicated

409
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,310
than I expected.

410
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:02,740
But it's not a big deal.

411
00:20:02,987 --> 00:20:05,037
They just want Your Majesty to go to them alone.

412
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:08,260
Is that what they want?

413
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:10,310
Or is it what you want, Grand Chancellor Liu?

414
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:14,190
We share the same sentiment.

415
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:19,030
I ask Your Majesty to go to the barracks alone

416
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:20,460
and save my daughter

417
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:23,030
as well as Donghao Empire's Queen.

418
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:38,710
Jinfeng!

419
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:41,590
Yu Changya?

420
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:42,830
Don't say a word.

421
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:43,710
Come with me now.

422
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,430
No. I can't leave.

423
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:47,590
No? Do you want to die?

424
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,430
The matter hasn't been solved yet. I can't leave.

425
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:50,500
Jinfeng,

426
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:52,070
now is not the time to be stubborn.

427
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:53,500
Do you know where you are?

428
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,790
Do you know who took you?

429
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:55,830
No.

430
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,030
Do you?

431
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:00,620
In any case, you must return
to the palace with me at once.

432
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:01,710
If not, something terrible will happen.

433
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:02,950
I can't leave.

434
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:05,830
Someone is coming. You should go now.

435
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:07,310
Leave with me!

436
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:08,260
We can't go together!

437
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:08,910
There are so many pairs of eyes

438
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:09,910
in this camp.

439
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:11,260
Do you think they are blind?

440
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:12,910
I appreciate the sentiment.

441
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:13,710
Don't worry about me.

442
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:14,830
I'll be fine.

443
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:15,670
Leave now.

444
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,190
Don't worry.

445
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:18,950
I am the Queen, after all.

446
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:20,310
They can't do anything to me.

447
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:21,310
Besides,

448
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:23,310
someone will come
and take me back with them properly.

449
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:24,070
Now, go!

450
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:25,260
Hurry!

451
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,310
Take care of yourself.

452
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,460
I knew it was you.

453
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:56,910
I don't know you.

454
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:57,830
You must have mistaken me
for someone else, General.

455
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:58,830
Do you really not recognize me?

456
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,950
I really don't know who you are, General.

457
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,550
I will remember

458
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:09,860
what you did for me today.

459
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,500
Your Highness!

460
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:17,340
Your Highness,

461
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:20,260
you heard that song last night as well,
didn't you?

462
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:23,790
I said

463
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:26,550
I would wait for you to come back.

464
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:37,710
Say no more.

465
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,550
I've made my decision.

466
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,340
-Your Majesty!
-Yunzhang!

467
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,310
Don't waste your breath.

468
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,190
I've made up my mind.

469
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:46,260
Your Majesty,

470
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,830
we're not here to stop you.

471
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,910
What are those things in your hands?

472
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:52,710
Yunzhang,

473
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:53,710
this is

474
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:55,500
the Flying Needle Shooter I made for you

475
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,100
for your trip to the barracks.

476
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,220
Just press this button and...

477
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:02,950
Yunchong,

478
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,830
what is this thing?

479
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:13,950
I didn't mean to do that.

480
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,830
Go and get some rest.

481
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,030
Thank you, Your Majesty.

482
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:18,740
Slowly now.

483
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:22,620
With this, no one can get close to you.

484
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:24,670
What about you?

485
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:25,550
Your Majesty,

486
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:27,260
this is the Poisonous Dirty Bun

487
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:29,260
I've specially prepared for you.

488
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:30,740
Forget taking a bite of it.

489
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,030
Just one whiff

490
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:34,550
and one will be out
for three days and three nights.

491
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:35,910
Your Majesty,

492
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:38,030
this is my family heirloom, the silver armor.

493
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:38,830
With it,

494
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:40,140
no one will be able to lay a finger on you.

495
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:44,910
All this nonsense.

496
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:47,070
Forget about if they work or not.

497
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:48,590
Even if they do work,

498
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,030
do you think I can carry all of these with me

499
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:52,380
as I cross through the army?

500
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:52,980
Yunzhang,

501
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,340
we didn't prepare these for you

502
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:55,860
to go up against the army.

503
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:56,340
-Yes.
-That's right.

504
00:23:57,910 --> 00:23:59,260
Who do you expect me to use them against, then?

505
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:01,260
Zhu Tan, of course.

506
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,220
That's right, Your Majesty.

507
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:04,790
You always say that we don't think of everything.

508
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:05,500
This time,

509
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,220
we've had everything all thought out.

510
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:08,380
First of all,

511
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,710
the Xiyue Empire wants a marriage alliance.

512
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:12,100
Who would they want you to marry?

513
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,710
Zhu Tan, of course.

514
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:15,550
Secondly,

515
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:17,030
they wanted you to go alone.

516
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:17,980
What else could they be planning?

517
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:19,500
They intend to make sure
the deal is "sealed", of course.

518
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:21,500
They want to take you down
without issuing a decree.

519
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:22,550
Thirdly,

520
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:24,140
and most importantly,

521
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,380
my sister-in-law is there, isn't she?

522
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:27,590
So what could they be after?

523
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:29,340
They want her to witness everything, of course.

524
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:30,670
They want to humiliate her

525
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:31,830
and get her to back down.

526
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,310
Maybe they were hoping
that she would die from anger.

527
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:35,710
In that case, Zhu Tan wouldn't even
need to become your consort.

528
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:36,710
She might become your new queen.

529
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:38,030
That's why

530
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,030
we came up with this foolproof plan.

531
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,830
If Zhu Tan comes near you,

532
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:44,380
use this shooter to get her.

533
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:45,620
If this won't get her,

534
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:48,260
eat my bun and pretend to faint.

535
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:51,910
If she takes further action,

536
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:53,830
then you put on the armor.

537
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:55,260
I guarantee nothing will happen,

538
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,500
and your purity will be intact.

539
00:24:58,740 --> 00:24:59,670
Thank you.

540
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:02,100
But...

541
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,140
You guys can keep these to yourselves.

542
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:03,740
Yunzhang,

543
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:05,030
at least choose one.

544
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:06,860
No need.

545
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:08,190
Keep them.

546
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,030
Well, then, Your Majesty,

547
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,620
take extra care.

548
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:13,790
Your Majesty,

549
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,620
we will wait for you to return safely.

550
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:16,430
Your Majesty,

551
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:17,860
I await your safe return as well.

552
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:19,910
Get some rest.

553
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:21,310
I'm off.

554
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:29,460
[Zhuque Gate]

555
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:30,100
Your Majesty!

556
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,500
I finally caught up with you.

557
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:35,030
Why are you here, Grand Chancellor?

558
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:37,710
To give Your Majesty a hand, of course.

559
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,710
You've already made the decision

560
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:41,100
to send me there alone.

561
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:42,910
Why bother putting up this pretentious act?

562
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:44,340
Your Majesty,

563
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,670
take a look at this first.

564
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,425
[The Emperor of Donghao has decided
to take a woman of Xiyue as his consort.]

565
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:56,740
Save your breath, Grand Chancellor.

566
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:57,980
I will never agree to the marriage alliance.

567
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,830
Don't be so quick to turn me down.

568
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:00,830
Keep it.

569
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,030
It might come in handy.

570
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,100
And this too.

571
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,500
My wife made this.

572
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,340
She heard you're going to see Jinfeng.

573
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:12,460
You can give this to her.

574
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:15,710
This is a lamb from Xiyue Empire.

575
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:17,740
My wife prepared this

576
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,190
using her special Xiyue recipe.

577
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:19,860
Try some.

578
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,740
Thank you,

579
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:23,100
but I'm not hungry.

580
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:26,620
Your Majesty.

581
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:28,950
15 years ago,

582
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:31,910
it was here that I saw the Late Emperor off.

583
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,260
It was with this battle

584
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:35,140
that the Late Emperor
eliminated the barbarians,

585
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:36,790
established his name far and wide,

586
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:37,950
and won the hearts of the people.

587
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:43,190
May Your Majesty carry
his wisdom and martial knowledge,

588
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,980
carry on his legacy, and achieve great things.

589
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:51,980
Well, if I'm doing this,
I might as well go all out.

590
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:54,590
What a touching scene
between a subject and his ruler this makes.

591
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:18,740
What's this?

592
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:21,310
This is my home.

593
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:23,980
The Imperial Palace doesn't look this.

594
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:25,310
This isn't the Imperial Palace.

595
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,670
It's my home in Xianpa Village.

596
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:28,190
Xianpa Village?

597
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:30,100
What's it like?

598
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:31,590
Xianpa Village? Well, it's...

599
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:35,030
Why are you asking about that?

600
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,140
Don't worry.

601
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,100
I won't harm you.

602
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:39,460
I'm here to save you.

603
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,710
Save me?

604
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:44,100
That's right.

605
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,030
Why?

606
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,380
Because...

607
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,310
You're important to him.

608
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:53,340
General Zhu,

609
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,070
so you think His Majesty will be grateful to you

610
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:56,430
for saving me

611
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:57,710
and that will make him marry you?

612
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,500
In fact, I came to ask you

613
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:02,460
why you must marry him.

614
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,380
Don't you know he doesn't like you?

615
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,310
I know.

616
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:07,460
The person he likes is you.

617
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:10,590
General Zhu,

618
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,830
why did you agree to the marriage then?

619
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:14,190
Would you be happy

620
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:15,380
marrying someone who doesn't like you?

621
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,550
If my happiness

622
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:19,340
can buy peace between the two empires,

623
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:20,950
then I'm willing to sacrifice my happiness.

624
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:23,500
I may be a general,

625
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:25,790
but I know you don't necessarily
have to protect your home and nation

626
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:27,100
on the battlefield.

627
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:29,430
Rather than sacrificing so many lives,

628
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:31,430
it would be better just to take my happiness.

629
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,140
General Zhu,

630
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,790
who told you

631
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:38,340
sacrifices must be made to achieve peace?

632
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:40,310
Let me tell you what peace is.

633
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:43,100
This is our Xianpa Village.

634
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,950
The village lives in peace and harmony.

635
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:46,500
No one owes anyone anything.

636
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:48,790
Even the Fang family that I don't get along with
has never said something like,

637
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:49,710
"Marry me,

638
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:51,140
or I'll steal your chickens!"

639
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:52,550
Do all these sacrifices

640
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:53,980
actually bring peace?

641
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,670
That in itself is not peace.

642
00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:00,340
What do you think peace is, then?

643
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:01,670
Look. It's true

644
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:03,590
that peace itself doesn't need anyone

645
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:05,460
to sacrifice their interests or happiness.

646
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,620
As long as everyone wants peace,

647
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,340
then they will naturally have peace.

648
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:10,220
The Emperor of Donghao has arrived.

649
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,500
He actually came.

650
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:16,550
I can't believe he only got here now.

651
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,220
Emperor of Xiyue.

652
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:53,220
I never expected that our first meeting

653
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,790
would be under such circumstances.

654
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:58,620
Life is unpredictable.

655
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:02,220
You actually came alone.

656
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:03,550
Yes.

657
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:04,790
There is nothing to be afraid of.

658
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,100
You are young and bold indeed.

659
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:09,380
Impressive and imposing indeed.

660
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:11,430
I've heard the people of the Xiyue Empire

661
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:12,790
are straightforward and direct.

662
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:14,710
So stop beating around the bush.

663
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:15,260
Tell me.

664
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:17,310
What will it take for you to release my queen?

665
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:18,710
Young emperor,

666
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:21,950
aren't you afraid that I'll seize you
right this moment as well?

667
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,260
That way,
I will have two bargaining chips in my hand.

668
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:26,430
I'll see how you will end up then.

669
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:28,500
Go ahead.

670
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:30,070
I would like to see

671
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:32,030
how you will handle the consequences as well.

672
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:35,950
Young emperor,

673
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,860
I was merely jesting.

674
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,590
The people of Xiyue are simple.

675
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:41,670
How about this?

676
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:43,430
If you agree to the marriage alliance

677
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:46,260
and give us the cities

678
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:47,860
along the borders,

679
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:49,830
I'll consider this matter settled.

680
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:51,860
And if I don't?

681
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:56,460
Bring her here.

682
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:58,710
Yunzhang!

683
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,910
If you don't,

684
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,140
then don't blame me for what I do next.

685
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:08,950
The people of Xiyue keep their words.

686
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:10,910
But if you agree,

687
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,340
I will keep my promise.

688
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,670
Oh, don't hesitate any longer.

689
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:20,910
I have fine liquor and meat ready in my camp.

690
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:23,310
Issue the decree,

691
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,710
and you can marry General Zhu
right here right now.

692
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:26,310
Hey...

693
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,620
As for the cities...

694
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:29,790
Consider them betrothal gifts.

695
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:32,460
See? That way,
your reputation will be saved as well.

696
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,260
Doesn't that sound good?

697
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:35,710
Don't be so quick to turn me down.

698
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:36,830
Keep it.

699
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:37,980
It might come in handy.

700
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:40,790
My wife made this.

701
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:43,140
This is a lamb from Xiyue Empire.

702
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:45,220
My wife prepared this

703
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,670
using her special Xiyue recipe.

704
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:48,790
15 years ago,

705
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:51,710
it was here that I saw the Late Emperor off.

706
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,220
It was with this battle

707
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,980
that the Late Emperor
eliminated the barbarians,

708
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:56,500
established his name far and wide,

709
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:57,670
and won the hearts of the people.

710
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,860
May Your Majesty carry
his wisdom and martial knowledge,

711
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:04,790
(carry on his legacy, and achieve great things.)

712
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:07,950
Emperor of Xiyue,

713
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:10,100
if I agree,

714
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,670
will my queen and I be able to leave safely?

715
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:15,460
Of course.

716
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,310
This is a joyous occasion.

717
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:19,620
Would you allow the soldiers

718
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:22,140
of the Xiyue Empire outside the tent
to witness it as well?

719
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:23,500
Of course!

720
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,430
Who said you could marry her?

721
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,740
The harem must not interfere with state affairs.

722
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:30,950
Silence.

723
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:31,670
I...

724
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:35,860
Emperor of Xiyue.

725
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:37,310
[Imperial Decree]
Please.

726
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:41,380
Warriors of Xiyue.

727
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,342
[Imperial Decree]
The Emperor of Donghao has decided

728
00:32:43,343 --> 00:32:45,170
[Imperial Decree]
to take a woman of Xiyue as his consort!

729
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:46,410
The two empires will be tied

730
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:47,980
and united for eternity.

731
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:51,370
Great!

732
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,220
Emperor of Donghao,

733
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:55,980
we appreciate your graciousness.

734
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:56,700
How about this?

735
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:58,130
With everyone here,

736
00:32:58,370 --> 00:32:59,980
let us hold the wedding straight away.

737
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:01,580
Hold on, Emperor of Xiyue.

738
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:02,980
What is it?

739
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,370
Emperor of Xiyue,

740
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:06,010
you must have gotten the wrong idea.

741
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:08,410
The woman of Xiyue that I agreed to marry

742
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,060
is not General Zhu.

743
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:11,770
What?

744
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:16,010
The woman of Xiyue I speak of is my queen.

745
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:17,890
Young emperor,

746
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:19,700
you're messing with me.

747
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:21,890
When have I lied to you?

748
00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:24,770
It is stated clearly in the decree.

749
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:27,010
If I marry a woman of Xiyue,

750
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,530
the two empires shall be tied
by an alliance of marriage.

751
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:31,860
You expect us
to believe your queen is a woman of Xiyue

752
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:32,860
just because you said so?

753
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:34,170
My mother-in-law,

754
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:37,010
the wife of the Donghao Empire's
current Grand Chancellor,

755
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:38,620
is from Xiyue.

756
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:40,860
Naturally, that means my queen
carries the blood of Xiyue as well.

757
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:41,650
This is absurd.

758
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:43,060
That's only your claim.

759
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:44,580
What proof do you have?

760
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:46,340
What proof do you have

761
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:48,770
to say that my mother-in-law
isn't from Xiyue Empire then?

762
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:52,890
Yes. I carry the blood of Xiyue.

763
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:53,980
As real as they come.

764
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:56,250
Is this true?

765
00:33:56,650 --> 00:33:57,220
Yes.

766
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:58,700
I can prove that she is.

767
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:00,130
She knows how to make our roasted lamb.

768
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,250
That's right.

769
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:03,100
She played the Song of Return.

770
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:04,530
She used my xun.

771
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:05,220
See?

772
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:06,740
This is the best proof.

773
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:09,490
Silence!

774
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:11,730
Emperor of Xiyue,

775
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:14,010
are you going to go back on your own word

776
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,290
before your men?

777
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:16,770
I've said so before.

778
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:19,970
I am willing to marry a woman of Xiyue
and form an alliance with your empire.

779
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:21,770
Do you have any other complaints?

780
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:26,010
Young emperor,

781
00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:27,860
don't get ahead of yourself.

782
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,180
Don't forget

783
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:31,180
that you are in my military camp right now.

784
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:33,060
Of course.

785
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:35,490
But do remember

786
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:38,450
that you are standing
on Donghao Empire's land right now as well.

787
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:41,180
Report!

788
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:44,450
Report!

789
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:46,730
Jingji Battalion of the Donghao Empire
has lined up outside the city.

790
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:47,380
What?

791
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:48,690
Who is leading them?

792
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:49,860
The Grand Chancellor, Liu Xie.

793
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:51,660
Why is he here?

794
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:54,180
He called it a military exercise.

795
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:56,140
A military exercise...

796
00:34:56,490 --> 00:34:57,770
That Scorpion Liu...

797
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:02,010
Soldiers of Xiyue,

798
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:03,770
fear not.

799
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:05,580
I will not wage war.

800
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:10,490
I've read the war reports
left by the Late Emperor.

801
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:11,580
15 years ago,

802
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:13,930
Donghao and Xiyue had engaged in a fierce war.

803
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:17,450
Donghao emerged victorious.

804
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:19,730
But you might not be aware of this.

805
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:21,580
In the report,

806
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:24,970
the Late Emperor did not proclaim victory.

807
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:26,900
Instead,

808
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:30,420
he mentioned the suffering
that war brought upon the people.

809
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:32,660
The Xiyue Empire is sparsely populated.

810
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:35,930
Those in the military
often spend years away from home.

811
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:37,970
My father once said

812
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:41,210
that the people of the Xiyue Empire
are kind, brave,

813
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:42,620
and peaceful.

814
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:45,620
But peace shouldn't come at a price.

815
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:47,010
If everyone wishes for peace,

816
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:49,100
then there will be no war.

817
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:51,730
I promise you here today.

818
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:54,140
That so long as I am alive,

819
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:57,620
I will never wage war against Xiyue Empire.

820
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:02,730
Right!

821
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:04,210
We don't want to fight anymore!

822
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:05,580
We want to go home!

823
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:07,730
We want to go home!

824
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:08,900
We don't want to fight anymore!

825
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,420
We want to go home!

826
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:12,530
-We want to go home!
-We don't want to fight anymore!

827
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:14,450
We want to go home!

828
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:16,930
Where to?

829
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:18,970
Home.

830
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,210
We don't want to fight anymore!

831
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:22,900
We want to go home!

832
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:47,100
You...

833
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,730
What... What is all of this?

834
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:49,580
I'm dressed like this,

835
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:50,860
and you still don't know why I'm here?

836
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:52,340
To...

837
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:54,010
Today?

838
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:55,060
What about it?

839
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:56,100
No, I...

840
00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:58,860
This... This is too hasty...

841
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:01,140
I thought so at first, too.

842
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:02,900
But my brother insisted that I come today.

843
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:04,690
What does His Majesty have to do with this?

844
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:05,860
Shuan, read the decree.

845
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:08,690
Receive the decree, Yunchong, Baiyu.

846
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:10,210
I receive His Majesty's decree.

847
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:13,180
With the Mandate of Heaven,
the Emperor thus decreed:

848
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:14,620
The daughter of the Liu family, Liu Baiyu,

849
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:15,730
is gentle, virtuous,

850
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:17,010
honest, respectful,

851
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:18,420
talented, elegant,

852
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:19,450
and...

853
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:19,970
Shuan.

854
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:20,730
That's enough.

855
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:22,060
Baiyu has so many good qualities.

856
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:23,580
It'll be dark by the time you finish listing them.

857
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:24,860
I receive the decree.

858
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:26,730
Come on.

859
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:29,210
Here.

860
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:33,380
Did you need to get all dressed up just for this?

861
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:34,770
You told me this yourself, didn't you?

862
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:36,180
This is how it goes in your stories.

863
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:37,180
To have a sense of ritual.

864
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:38,730
Make everything a special occasion.

865
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:41,490
I thought...

866
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:43,210
What did you think it was going to be?

867
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:43,860
I...

868
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,930
Did you think
we would have our wedding night today?

869
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:46,620
I...

870
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:48,490
What nonsense are you spouting?

871
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:49,660
It's not nonsense.

872
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:51,100
We will have our wedding night sooner or later.

873
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:51,620
I...

874
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:55,290
Who is going
to spend their wedding night with you?

875
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:56,860
Who are you going to
spend your wedding night with

876
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:58,060
if not me?

877
00:37:58,210 --> 00:37:58,690
I...

878
00:37:59,100 --> 00:37:59,930
Miss Baiyu.

879
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,930
His Majesty has issued another decree.

880
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:05,210
It's a wedding gift

881
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:06,450
for you and Prince Yunchong.

882
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:08,010
Perhaps it will grant your wish.

883
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:15,210
[Imperial Decree]
A decree from His Majesty.

884
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:16,860
"My brother, Yunchong,

885
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:18,010
is filial, loyal,

886
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:19,100
studious, intelligent,

887
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,180
and virtuous.

888
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,820
On behalf of our ancestors,

889
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:23,820
I hereby grant him the title of Prince Qi.

890
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:25,420
That is all."

891
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:27,860
I accept the decree.

892
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:31,100
Miss Baiyu,

893
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,210
from today onwards,
you are the consort of Prince Qi.

894
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:38,930
Greetings, Prince Qi and Consort of Prince Qi.

895
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:39,580
Rise!

896
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:42,100
-Thank you, Prince Qi.
-Thank you, Prince Qi.

897
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:43,420
Go on.

898
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:48,010
I shall return now, Your Highness.

899
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:48,730
All right.

900
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:53,180
Liu Baiyu,

901
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:54,210
listen up.

902
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:55,210
From now on,

903
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:56,690
I'm the only man you can show interest in.

904
00:38:56,690 --> 00:38:59,060
I... I told you that's not what I meant.

905
00:38:59,060 --> 00:38:59,970
What did you mean then?

906
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:01,970
All right.

907
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:02,620
Never mind.

908
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:03,730
I have something important to show you.

909
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:04,930
Come on.

910
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:11,530
Yunzhang gave us a residence

911
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:12,930
in the east of the city.

912
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,730
This is the design
I came up with for our residence.

913
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:16,210
Look.

914
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:17,340
This is

915
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:19,060
a study I designed especially for you.

916
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:20,340
It'll be warm in winter and cool in summer.

917
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:21,010
In the future,

918
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:22,210
you can write your huabens here.

919
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:23,730
I put the garden in the center.

920
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:25,010
You can plant anything you want.

921
00:39:25,010 --> 00:39:26,380
Trees, plants, and flowers.

922
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:27,580
Anything you want.

923
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,450
Guess what this place is for?

924
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:31,140
I prepared this for your mother.

925
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:33,140
Your mother was confined
in the Grand Chancellor's Residence.

926
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:35,180
I asked Yunzhang to let her move in with us.

927
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:37,060
Your mother won't be lonely then.

928
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:39,620
This spot represents
the breath of the white pieces.

929
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:42,690
If the black pieces fill that breath,

930
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:44,380
then the white pieces will lose.

931
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:45,420
They will be removed.

932
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:46,580
This is called removing them from the board.

933
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:52,420
You asked me to teach you
how to play weiqi, didn't you?

934
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:53,530
Why aren't you paying attention?

935
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,970
It looked interesting when you were playing it

936
00:39:56,970 --> 00:39:58,210
with Grand Tutor Wei.

937
00:39:58,210 --> 00:39:59,900
But why is it so boring now?

938
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,730
How do you know it's boring?
You haven't even played it.

939
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:03,660
I know it's boring without even playing it.

940
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:05,060
So why should I bother playing it?

941
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:10,580
I'm going to make something.

942
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,010
What are you making?

943
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:13,060
You'll find out in a bit.

944
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:21,900
Done.

945
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:23,180
What is this?

946
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:24,010
It's you.

947
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:25,210
What?

948
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:26,210
It is you.

949
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:29,210
I'm answering the question you asked me.

950
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:31,250
What question?

951
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:32,420
You asked me

952
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:34,210
who I would choose
between Liu Xie and you, didn't you?

953
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:35,930
I've decided. I'm going with you.

954
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:37,490
Even though

955
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:39,210
I don't think Liu Xie would actually harm you,

956
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:41,770
he can be unpredictable.

957
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:44,060
If he actually meant you harm someday,

958
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:45,490
I would protect you.

959
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:53,340
So what is this thing?

960
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:55,140
A pig or a bear?

961
00:40:55,490 --> 00:40:56,140
A pig.

962
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:57,100
Look at the nose.

963
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:58,060
-It's so...
-Your Majesty!

964
00:40:58,930 --> 00:40:59,620
Your Majesty!

965
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:00,420
What's wrong?

966
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:01,180
The...

967

The Empress Dowager was poisoned!

968
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:03,930
