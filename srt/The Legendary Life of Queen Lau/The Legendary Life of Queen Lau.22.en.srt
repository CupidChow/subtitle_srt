00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,780
isn't it?

171
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,540
As soon as I step outside, something happens.

172
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,500
Enough.

173
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,420
Mother.

174
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,180
What was that about?

175
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:18,540
My fortune told me

176
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,780
that today is not a good day to go out.

177
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,180
So I tied myself up.

178
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,660
You... What about your mouth?

179
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:25,500
Mouth?

180
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,220
After eating the chilies, my body heat rose.

181
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:31,980
I haven't reprimanded you.

182
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,660
Why did you say your father took a concubine?

183
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:36,860
Why did you say my father took a concubine?

184
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,100
Why did you say her father took a concubine?

185
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,700
Have you verified this?

186
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,900
You heard a little rumor and took it as true.

187
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:46,660
Sir,

188
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:47,980
His Majesty has arrived.

189
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,060
I'm going to take a look.

190
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:51,780
Help me entertain my guests.

191
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:52,300
Yes.

192
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:54,380
Yunzhang?

193
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,700
My son-in-law is here?

194
00:06:58,940 --> 00:06:59,660
Your Majesty.

195
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,100
Yunzhang.

196
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,140
My son-in-law.

197
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:03,660
Yunzhang.

198
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:04,540
Why are you here?

199
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,300
Since you have such a happy occasion
at your residence,

200
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,460
wouldn't it be better
to share the joy with everyone?

201
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:12,420
Let's go.

202
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:13,540
Let's go in and have a look.

203
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,580
What are you trying to do?

204
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:20,660
You said

205
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,620
that if I could quell the people's discontent,

206
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,580
you would release Grand Tutor Wei and the others.

207
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,100
Do you remember it?

208
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:27,820
So?

209
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,740
Now that the tax issue has been put to rest,

210
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,940
I think the people should be more concerned

211
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,620
about your family affairs now.

212
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,340
So this is what Your Majesty came up with.

213
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,780
Your Majesty.

214
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,540
I remember everything you taught me.

215
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,740
This is just beating you

216
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,900
at your own game.

217
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,820
You are wise, Your Majesty.

218
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:58,580
So when will the tax increase be implemented?

219
00:07:58,940 --> 00:07:59,420
Right.

220
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,500
How could you forget about this?

221
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:01,540
Yes.

222
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,580
Explain to us about the tax increase.

223
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:04,620
Tax increase?

224
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,220
No way.

225
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,180
We strongly oppose it.

226
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,220
Yes, we strongly oppose the tax increase.

227
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,860
We strongly oppose the tax increase.

228
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:11,540
Liu Xie.

229
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:13,980
You're really...

230
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,940
Your Majesty, do you think you could get away

231
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:16,820
with using

232
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:19,220
falsehoods to deceive people?

233
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,620
Didn't Grand Tutor Wei teach you

234
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:22,980
that no prairie fire can destroy the grass,

235
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,700
and it shoots up again
with the spring breeze blows?

236
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,340
You underestimate me.

237
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,340

[Habits of the officials of the Imperial Court]

239
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:33,540
What is this?

240
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,620
Before you say anything, just take a look.

241
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,980
You don't know anything about the dirty doings

of these officials, do you?

243
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,460
I have done the math.

If I find out their unknown properties,

245

I won't have to worry

about this year's military funds

247

or even next year's.

248
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,180
Your Majesty's wisdom

249

and benevolence

250
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,620
are a great blessing to the nation.

no tax increase this year!

253
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:13,620
That's great.

254
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:17,220
Thank you, Your Majesty.

can you release them now?

Of course.

260
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,900
I'll sneak into his bedchamber

261
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:40,700
and then slowly approach his bed,

262
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,860
aiming for the target when he's not aware of it

263
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,900
and leaving no loose ends.

264
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,340
Your Majesty,

265
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,860
are you going to steal or rob?

266
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:49,780
It doesn't matter.

267
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,100
What matters is getting that thing.

268
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:52,900
But Your Majesty,

269
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,540
do you know what it is?

270
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,300
The secret treasure

271
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,340
of an old eunuch and an old maid.

272
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,660
The old eunuch left it
to His Majesty before he died,

273
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,700
and His Majesty
still carries it with him every day.

274
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:06,020
These tips from Old Maid Fang Yu are not enough?

275
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,340
You still don't understand?

276
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,540
I don't.

277
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:10,820
This is...

278
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,300
A decree from the Empress Dowager.

279
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:23,540
Read it.

280

00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:27,540

This...

285
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,380
What does the Empress Dowager mean?

286
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,660
You don't understand this?

287
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,740
Is that what the Empress Dowager means?

288
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,380
Yes, that's what she means.

289
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,420
When?

290
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,380
The Empress Dowager means

291
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,420
to give you ten days to prepare.

292
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,300
Ten days?

293
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:46,700
The Empress Dowager said

294
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,220
that if you think it's too soon...

295
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,740
I can't wait one more day.

296
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:50,780
Just make it tonight.

of giving His Majesty to that woman?

303
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,100
Mind your words.

304

What do you take His Majesty for?

Look how worried Yunzhang is.

308
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:10,460
Nonsense.

309

When have I ever been worried?

310
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,220
Is this something that can be rushed?

311
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:16,380
Your Majesty,

312
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,020

Let's find a way

00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,820
to get Yunzhang out of this mess first.

317
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:25,820
In my opinion,

318
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:28,140
the easiest thing to do
is to tell the Empress Dowager directly

319
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,300
that this matter cannot be rushed.

320
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,980
There has to be a process of advance preparation.

321
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,180
Just like when we cook a dish,

322
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,660
there is a process
of cutting and matching the ingredients.

323
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,380
It's too abrupt to do it

324
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:36,460
straight away.

325
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:37,900
That makes sense.

(No way.)

Why not?

333
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,860
That's not straightforward.

334
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:31,820
If this fails,

335
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,540
His Majesty will still be in the tiger's mouth.

336
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,460
So what do you suggest?

337
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,540
I think we should just do it directly.

338
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:39,820
Do you know

339
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,220
what the key to this is?

340
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:42,940
No.

341
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:43,940
I didn't do it before.

342
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:44,740
You're such a fool.

343
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:45,820
Think about it.

344
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:48,500
Where do you usually do this?

345
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,180
Xuanchen Hall.

346
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:53,660
Be specific.

347
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:55,740
Side hall.

348
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,180
In bed.

349
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:00,540
Yes.

350
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,740
When I have cut off the legs of the bed,

351
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,140
I will see how they can have children

352
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,660
without a comfortable bed.

353
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:06,700
That's right.

354
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,420
Yes.

355
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:09,780
Bed.

356
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,460
Do you like it?

357
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,820
So do you like the heart,

358
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,100
or the bed,

359
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,860
or this?

360
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,100
Stop.

361
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,540
It's no use breaking the bed.

362
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:40,900
Is there a shortage of beds

363
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,380
and craftsmen in the palace?

364
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:43,900
Even if you break it today,

365
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,100
you can get a new one tomorrow.

366
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:45,860
Does it even work?

367
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,020
So what's your better idea?

368
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,100
What to do if this or that

369
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:48,820
doesn't work?

370
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,540
I think

371
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,100
we should use the most direct method.

372
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,460
Say it directly.

373
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,380
What to say?

374
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:00,700
Just say

375
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:02,940
that Yunzhang

376
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,340
is impotent.

377
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,740
You're impotent!

378
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,020
What to do?

379
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:16,700
Yunzhang.

380
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:21,460
Yunzhang.

381
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,140
Enough.

382
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,780
You have nothing more to do here.

383
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:27,460
Just leave.

384
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:31,660
Yes.

385
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,260
Your Majesty.

386
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:41,260
What's it?

387
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,820
The Queen has passed a message to you.

388
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:43,580
What did she say?

389
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:46,540
She said she'd be here tonight.

390
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:47,620
So fast?

391
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:48,780
If you think it's fast,

392
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:49,860
I'll go...

393
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,500
You should go and get ready now.

394
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:53,580
Go.

395
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:54,880
I...

396
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,780
Today is a good day.

397
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:06,260
[Grand Chancellor's Residence]

398
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,860
Did you know that the Empress Dowager
issued a decree today?

399
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,540
How can I not know what you know?

400
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:17,020
Can you bear to let your daughter
be with Duan Yunzhang?

401
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:20,900
You go and ask

402
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,860
all the parents on the street

403
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:23,580
if they can bear

404
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,180
to have their daughters

405
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,300
be the legitimate queen.

406
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:27,820
If one of them says he can't bear it,

407
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,660
I'll go to the palace
and tear up the Empress Dowager's decree.

408
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,180
I can't bear it!

409
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:32,820
So what if you can't bear it?

410
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:37,420
Liu Xie,

411
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:38,820
you tricked me!

412
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,780
The fact that you got tricked

413
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,300
means you still have value.

414
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,500
Our deal has just begun.

415
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,500
Why are you so anxious?

416
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,340
What about Jinfeng?

417
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,620
Do you think there is a better choice for Jinfeng

418
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,580
than to be the Queen

419
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:00,940
until our plan is completed?

420
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,100
Grand Chancellor Liu.

421
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:07,540
So you still remember

422
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:09,020
our plan?

423
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,980
Everything that is happening now

424
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,100
is part of our plan.

425
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:17,860
All right.

426
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,460
Then, remember our plan clearly.

427
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,300
I will get back everything

428
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,220
that belongs to me!

429
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:26,780
Including Jinfeng.

430
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:37,740
This young man is so vigorous.

431
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,500
It seems that every man

432
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:44,180
has a girl in his youth

433
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:46,340
who makes him fall head over heels.

434
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,060
Jinfeng.

435
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:10,620
Your Majesty.

436
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:17,580
Have a drink.

437
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:18,140
Okay.

438
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:21,980
How is it?

439
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:23,860
What is this?

440
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:25,860
Wine.

441
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,860
Putting fresh grapes in wine?

442
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,220
What a waste.

443
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,100
Let's not waste any more time.

444
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:31,980
Let's get right to it.

445
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,260
Let's go.

446
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,340
Do you like it?

447
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,700
What is it? It's in the way.

448
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:41,860
Come on, sit down.

449
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,060
You have to promise me one thing first.

450
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,220
What is it?

451
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:48,340
Let me start.

452
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:49,420
This...

453
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,180
I don't think it's a good idea.

454
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,300
How so?

455
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,700
I'm not even embarrassed yet.

456
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,100
All right then.

457
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:07,980
Where's your treasure?

458
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,420
What treasure?

459
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,180
The treasure that the old eunuch gave you.

460
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,180
What do you think I mean?

461
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,820
Why would a eunuch leave a treasure to me?

462
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:16,820
How do I know?

463
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,180
Take it out, I need it.

464
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,340
You need it?

465
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:21,300
It's not that I need it.

466
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,460
Anyway, just take it out.

467
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:22,820
Wait.

468
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,500
Who told you that I have a treasure?

469
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,620
Old Maid Fang Yu.

470
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,100
She said that Fu gave you his treasure

471
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,300
before he died.

472
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:30,740
Fu?

473
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:31,580
Which Fu?

474
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:35,100
The Fu that Old Maid Fang Yu referred to.

475
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,540
His name is Bai Fu.

476
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,780
That's Eunuch Bai.

477
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:39,740
Eunuch Bai?

478
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:40,980
His name isn't Fu Huaqian?

479
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,700
What are you trying to say?

480
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,540
Did he give you any personal treasure?

481
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,620
What personal treasure?

482
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,700
You don't even know what personal treasure is?

483
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,180
Oh, no!

484
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,300
What Eunuch Bai?

485
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,620
What a waste of effort!

486
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:58,940
What are you looking for?

487
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,180
It's funny to say.

488
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,740
I don't even know what I'm looking for.

489
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:05,220
Forget it.

490
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,300
Skip this.

491
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,620
Let's move on to the next section.

492
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,700
Are you ready?

493
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,180
Do I need to get ready for this?

494
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:13,420
We can start whenever
and wherever we want, can't we?

495
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:15,420
That's fine too.

496
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,020
Come on.

497
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:20,620
What are you doing?

498
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,180
Bone setting.

499
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:23,940
Who asked you to set my bones?

500
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:24,740
Empress Dowager.

501
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:25,740
Isn't the Empress Dowager's decree today

502
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,100
meant to have your bones set?

503
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:28,580
Get down.

504
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:30,580
Why do you have to be mean?

505
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:31,580
I didn't volunteer to do it.

506
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,100
She doesn't mean bone setting.

507
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,460
What does she mean, then?

508
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,100
Although there is also

509
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,860
a slight connection to bone.

510
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,020
What's the connection?

511
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,540
That is to make you conceive my child.

512
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,260
(I'm not here to give a gift.)

513
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:13,540
(I'm here to... to...)

514
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,820
(To mock her.)

515
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,460
Are you here to mock me?

516
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:25,940
How do you know?

517
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,780
Do you think it's appropriate for a girl

518
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,020
to drink so much liquor?

519
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,180
Haven't I always been

520
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:41,100
a vicious supporting actress in your mind?

521
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:44,020
When did I become a girl?

522
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,020
Supporting actress?

523
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,020
What does supporting actress mean?

524
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,100
Have you ever read a huaben?

525
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,380
Or watched operas?

526
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:57,100
The supporting actress is a woman

527
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,860
who is always abandoned by the hero

528
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,220
and suppressed by the heroine,

529
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,700
always with a vicious face

530
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:05,460
but no one understands her inner pain.

531
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,980
And you're called a supporting actor.

532
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:12,900
What does supporting actor mean?

533
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:16,660
The supporting actor is the man
who is inferior to the hero in every way

534
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:18,460
but is always pestering the supporting actress

535
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,060
with his wishful thinking.

536
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,220
I told you not to drink.

537
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,420
This is not liquor?

538
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,060
What did I just say?

539
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,740
Wishful thinking.

540
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,020
Liu Baiyu...

541
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:38,860
Liu Baiyu.

542
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,220
What a lovely name.

543
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,540
Snowy white skin,

544
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,140
slender and graceful.

545
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,140
I was meant to be the Queen.

546
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:52,180
My father told me all this.

547
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:55,260
But it was his other daughter

548
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,740
who's in the Xuanchen Hall tonight.

549
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:02,980
So that's what

550
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,820
you're sad about?

551
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,580
You don't understand anything.

552
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:08,740
I don't.

553
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,980
I don't understand why you want to be the Queen.

554
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,060
Is it that much fun to be the Queen?

555
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:15,300
Because only by being the Queen,

556
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,420
can I prove myself

557
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,220
to my father and my mother.

558
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:19,540
To prove what?

559
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:20,460
To prove that...

560
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:24,180
Forget it.

561
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,100
You wouldn't understand even if I told you.

562
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,260
I think it's because
you haven't figured it out yourself.

563
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,060
Forget it, I'm not going to talk to you about it.

564
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:35,700
This is for you.

565
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:38,220
This is...

566
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,420
Although I'm here to mock you,

567
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:43,580
I'm also here to reconcile with you.

568
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:44,380
Reconcile?

569
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,300
About the sudden arranged marriage,

570
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,660
it was wrong of me to say that I would marry you

571
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:50,900
without thinking it through.

572
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,860
So you've thought it through now?

573
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:53,780
Of course.

574
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:55,780
That's good then.

575
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,180
I've thought about it very carefully.

576
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,860
I must marry you.

577
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:06,460
Oh, right.

578
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,180
This is how it works.

579
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:12,940
Got it?

580
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:02,980
Have you made up your mind?

581
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,580
To give birth to your child?

582
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:05,220
Yeah.

583
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,340
It's not impossible.

584
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:07,900
Really?

585
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,820
What I mean is that you must think it through.

586
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,500
I don't like to force people.

587
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,220
I just don't think it's right.

588
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:19,460
What's not right?

589
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:21,940
I am the Emperor and you are the Queen.

590
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:24,100
Our children are either princes or princesses.

591
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,460
It stands to reason.

592
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,140
That's your rule.

593
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:29,460
I mean it's not in accordance
with the rules of Xianpa Village.

594
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,940
What are the rules of Xianpa Village?

595
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,820
In Xianpa Village,

596
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,620
it would be so romantic to have a child.

597
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:36,780
What's romantic about it?

598
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:37,700
Tell me.

599
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,420
In Xianpa Village, after the wedding,

600
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:42,580
the couple must go and live
in Xianpa Mountain for six months.

601
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,900
Is there a magnificent palace
on Xianpa Mountain?

602
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:46,940
No.

603
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:48,620
Is there a wide range of delicious food?

604
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:49,300
No.

605
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:50,740
Are there fancy clothes?

606
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:51,420
No.

607
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,740
So what's on Xianpa Mountain?

608
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:55,820
There are huts,
vegetable fields, and personal treasures

609
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,420
on Xianpa Mountain.

610
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:00,340
No. What exactly is the personal treasure?

611
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,620
In Xianpa Village,

612
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:02,460
a pair of elderly people

613
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,020
will put their prepared token

614
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,340
into a lucky bag

615
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:07,500
and give it to their favorite youngster

616
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,620
who will then

617
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:10,140
share the bag

618
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:11,100
with their other half

619
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,460
on their first night on Xianpa Mountain

620
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:14,260
and enjoy the blessing together.

621
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:15,820
That's it?

622
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:17,180
My mother said

623
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,620
that simplicity is the way to love.

624
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,860
What else did your mother say?

625
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,260
My mother also said

626
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,620
that couples need to love each other

627
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,980
so that their children
can grow up healthily and happily.

628
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:27,580
Even though we're married,

629
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:29,420
we've never stayed on Xianpa Mountain,

630
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,100
so we can't have children.

631
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,780
I understand it now.

632
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,420
Really?

633
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,420
Don't you mean

634
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:37,700
that there is a lack

635
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,980
of a dating process between us?

636
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,660
Is that what I meant?

637
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:43,300
Yes.

638
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:44,500
How about this?

639
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:45,980
You sleep here tonight.

640
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:46,820
I'll sleep outside.

641
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,020
Don't worry.

642
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,820
I will give you

643
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,780
a satisfying romantic experience.

644
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,060
Xuan.

645
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:03,780
Xuan.

646
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,460
Xuan.

647
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:18,500
What are you doing here?

648
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:20,700
To date with you.

649
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,580
It starts now?

650
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:23,500
Don't worry.

651
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,140
After a night of study,

652
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,900
I have learned the essence of dating.

653
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:28,100
What is it?

654
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,580
It is written
that the first step in a relationship

655
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:33,420
begins with grabbing your lover's hand.
