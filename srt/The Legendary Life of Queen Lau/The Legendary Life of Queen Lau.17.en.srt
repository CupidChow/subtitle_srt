You forged my handwriting to frame Yunzhang.

227

Good job.

00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,839
Let me ask you something.

529
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:48,880
There are as many stars here

530
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,400
as there are in Xianpa Village.

531
00:20:50,719 --> 00:20:52,079
Didn't I tell you this before?

532
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:53,959
You're looking at the same stars.

533
00:20:54,719 --> 00:20:56,760
Why do I feel like they are different?

534
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,560
Perhaps

535
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,479
it's the companion that makes it different.

536
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,160
You said you wanted to ask me a question.

537
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,439
Why did you

538
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,920
help me?

539
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:22,400
Aren't we rivals?

540
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,920
We're not only rivals,

541
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,079
but we're also friends.

542
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,079
It's a win-win situation.

543
00:21:27,239 --> 00:21:28,719
You wanted to be the Zhuangyuan,

544
00:21:28,719 --> 00:21:29,719
and I didn't want to get the last place.

545
00:21:29,719 --> 00:21:30,719
There's no conflict between these two.

546
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,280
That makes sense.

547
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:35,640
Why did we take the bet so seriously?

548
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,560
We look so foolish.

549
00:21:37,239 --> 00:21:38,160
I know.

550
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:43,359
Is there any other reason?

551
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,319
Also,

552
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,040
you look good.

553
00:21:50,479 --> 00:21:51,119
It's true.

554
00:21:51,199 --> 00:21:52,599
You really look good.

555
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,680
You haven't seen
how all the maidservants went crazy over you

556
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,160
when you were running today.

557
00:21:56,199 --> 00:21:57,160
Nonsense.

558
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,040
That's not true.

559
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,520
I have another question for you.

560
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:10,640
Why do you have so many questions?

561
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,839
What did you add

562
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:14,079
to the candle the other day?

563
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:15,479
Why did I fall asleep so soundly?

564
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,560
About that...

565
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,479
Give me a proper answer.

566
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,079
You look really tense on normal days.

567
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:24,119
I wanted you to have a good rest.

568
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,119
It was a remedy we did back home.

569
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,199
What remedy is that? It works so well.

570
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,800
We grew up very poor.

571
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,199
When we were kids,

572
00:22:33,199 --> 00:22:34,640
our mothers used to go out to work.

573
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,239
Those kids were especially pitiful

574
00:22:36,239 --> 00:22:37,160
without their mothers around.

575
00:22:37,479 --> 00:22:39,040
Some kids wouldn't stop crying.

576
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,319
The doctors in the village

577
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:41,560
invented this remedy.

578
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,079
When you burn the Mirror Moon Sand,

579
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:44,119
it will release a scent
similar to their mothers'.

580
00:22:44,199 --> 00:22:45,599
That's why the kids could sleep soundly.

581
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,040
The scent of mothers.

582
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,839
Why? Are you missing your mother?

583
00:22:57,599 --> 00:22:58,959
No, I'm not.

584
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:01,079
I think

585
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:05,359
Mirror Moon Sand is a pretty elegant name.

586
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:07,199
Are you too shy to admit
that you miss your mother?

587
00:23:07,199 --> 00:23:08,199
I miss my mother a lot.

588
00:23:08,839 --> 00:23:10,800
I miss the red braised pork my mother cooked.

589
00:23:11,199 --> 00:23:12,040
Beef stew.

590
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:13,400
Cabbage and lamb.

591
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:15,400
What a glutton.

592
00:23:16,199 --> 00:23:17,719
It's a taste I can only get from my mother.

593
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,560
I don't remember

594
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,280
what my mom's food tasted like.

595
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,680
Let's not talk about this anymore.

596
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,479
You haven't told me

597
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,079
what Mirror Moon Sand actually is.

598
00:23:36,199 --> 00:23:37,839
I worry that it might upset you.

599
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,119
Don't worry. Just tell me the truth.

600
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,640
I have run around the imperial city ten times.

601
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,359
Do you think I will get upset by this?

602
00:23:43,479 --> 00:23:44,079
Tell me the truth.

603
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,319
Mirror Moon Sand is made
with the earth in the mountains

604
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:51,319
and the droppings of 30 different insects.

605
00:23:51,319 --> 00:23:52,040
Droppings?

606
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:55,719
That's all.

607
00:23:55,719 --> 00:23:56,800
You can take your time
to digest the information.

608
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,520
Sufang, let's go.

609
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,319
Sufang.

610
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,680
Sufang, let's go home.

611
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,920
Mothers smell like droppings.

612
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,199
Is she kidding me?

613
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:22,719
That's quite interesting.

614
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:41,160
-Help!
-Stand right there.

615
00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:43,400
-Stop running.
-Help!

616
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,880
Help!

617
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,439
Stop running.

618
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,079
Help!

619
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,160
You have nowhere to run now.

620
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,839
Do you know who I am?

621
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,400
We have no idea who you are,

622
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,680
but it's not like we care.

623
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,319
We only care about money.

624
00:24:56,439 --> 00:24:57,520
-Give it to me.
-Don't touch me.

625
00:24:57,959 --> 00:24:58,520
Let it go!

626
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,119
Give it to me.

627
00:24:59,719 --> 00:25:00,640
Let go!

628
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:02,160
Get your hands off her.

629
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,439
Who are you?

630
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,760
It doesn't matter who I am.

631
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,400
Brat.

632
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,680
Do you have a death wish?

633
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:10,280
Attack!

634
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,000
Mister.

635
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:33,959
Thank you so much.

636
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:34,880
You're welcome.

637
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:36,000
I'm here

638
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,119
to save you.

639
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,000
What's your name, mister?

640
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:41,599
It doesn't matter what my name is.

641
00:25:42,239 --> 00:25:44,439
I'll see you under the peach tree.

642
00:25:58,359 --> 00:26:00,000
What's his name?

643
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:03,119
Why is he not here yet?

644
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,280
Young Lady.

645
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:13,479
Come home with us.

646
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,359
The groom has waited an entire day for you

647
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:15,079
in the bridal room.

648
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:15,719
No.

649
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:18,439
I won't come with you.

650
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,680
I'll stay here and wait for my mister.

651
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,520
You don't even know the mister's name.

652
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,959
He definitely won't return.

653
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,479
I'll wait for him

654
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:28,760
even if it means I have to wait here forever.

655
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,520
You don't need to wait here forever.

656
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Have you always been on the tree?

657
00:26:58,839 --> 00:26:59,640
Yes, I have.

658
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,439
How long have you been there?

659
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,439
Since forever.

660
00:27:05,439 --> 00:27:06,040
Mister.

661
00:27:11,479 --> 00:27:12,959
You are fated to be mine.

662
00:27:19,239 --> 00:27:20,000
Mister.

663
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:20,880
Let's go.

664
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,680
Mister!

665
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:22,560
Let's go.

666
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,719
Mister.

00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,080
Bite it.

834
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,639
Go.

835
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:57,159
Bite it.

836
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,520
It's so stupid.

837
00:34:58,919 --> 00:34:59,360
Keep going.

838
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,479
If you don't want to talk
about serious matters,

839
00:35:03,919 --> 00:35:05,080
let's talk about something else.

840
00:35:05,959 --> 00:35:07,600
I know when to punish
and when to reward someone.

841
00:35:08,399 --> 00:35:09,639
Besides, I didn't get this result

842
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,719
all by myself.

843
00:35:13,639 --> 00:35:14,280
So...

844
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:16,800
You know

845
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:19,719
that I'm not very good with my words.

846
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:21,840
I'm thinking of getting you guys

847
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,280
something special.

848
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,639
-Thanks, Your Majesty.
-Thanks, Yunzhang.

849
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:29,560
Look at this jade pendant.

850
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,919
His Majesty obviously custom-made this
just for me.

851
00:35:32,199 --> 00:35:34,000
I know His Majesty loves me the most.

852
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,439
How shameless.

853
00:35:35,439 --> 00:35:36,399
Look at the pattern.

854
00:35:36,399 --> 00:35:37,959
This is obviously good stuff.

855
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,639
I didn't know His Majesty loves me this much.

856
00:35:40,919 --> 00:35:42,000
That's nothing compared to mine.

857
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,760
Look at my blood jade pendants.

858
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,560
They come in a pair.

859
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,159
This is the blood relationship
Yunzhang and I share.

860
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,199
The love between us

861
00:35:48,199 --> 00:35:49,120
is incomparable.

862
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,120
Thanks, Yunzhang.

863
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,320
Thanks, Your Majesty.

864
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:52,159
Thanks, Your Majesty.

865
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:53,040
We'll go and have fun.

866
00:35:53,639 --> 00:35:54,120
We'll get going.

867
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:54,719
Let's go.

868
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:55,959
-Thanks, Your Majesty.
-Thanks, Your Majesty.

869
00:35:56,439 --> 00:35:57,639
Go ahead.

870
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:04,879
Fine.

871
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,959
It's been half a day

872
00:36:29,959 --> 00:36:31,320
and he's still missing.

873
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,520
How ungrateful.

874
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,159
Your Majesty.

875
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,320
Am I doing it right?

876
00:36:34,879 --> 00:36:35,560
Yes.

877
00:36:35,879 --> 00:36:36,520
Your Majesty.

878
00:36:36,679 --> 00:36:38,520
Pink and purple,

879
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,040
which one do you think is better?

880
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,840
Pink.

881
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,479
Should I make a bow knot or a flower knot?

882
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,439
Bow knot.

883
00:36:49,639 --> 00:36:50,320
Your Majesty.

884
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,199
Sufang.

885
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:52,679
Can you stop talking to me?

886
00:36:52,679 --> 00:36:53,239
Your Majesty.

887
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:53,760
Your Majesty.

888
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,560
It wasn't me.

889
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,199
Your Majesty.

890
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:55,679
He's here.

891
00:36:55,679 --> 00:36:56,199
He's here?

892
00:36:57,639 --> 00:36:58,639
It's here.

893
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:02,320
I opened the door this morning

894
00:37:02,399 --> 00:37:04,360
and found this brocade box at the doorstep.

895
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,719
Look at the color and the craftsmanship.

896
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,719
The fragrance too.

897
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,639
I'm sure His Majesty sent this here.

898
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,080
(That's why he kept me waiting.)

899
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:14,320
(He was preparing a gift for me.)

900
00:37:14,719 --> 00:37:15,719
It's just a boring box.

901
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,959
Why are you making a fuss out of it?

902
00:37:17,399 --> 00:37:18,000
Your Majesty.

903
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:19,159
Why don't you open it?

904
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,220
[I'll see you under the peach tree.]

905
00:37:27,159 --> 00:37:28,040
(I'll see you)

906
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,560
(under the peach tree.)

907
00:37:31,879 --> 00:37:33,320
That's so cheesy.

908
00:37:33,639 --> 00:37:34,719
What a cliche.

909
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,399
It's so romantic that he wants to meet
under the peach tree.

910
00:37:59,639 --> 00:38:00,840
(It's just like what happened in the book.)

911
00:38:00,919 --> 00:38:02,399
(Let's just follow the plot.)

912
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,919
It's fine. You can get up now.

913
00:38:03,919 --> 00:38:04,959
Let's move on to the next chapter.

914
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,320
Attack.

915
00:38:07,959 --> 00:38:08,479
Tie her up.

916
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,159
This...

917
00:38:12,399 --> 00:38:14,040
This is not part of the story, right?

918
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,399
You got it wrong.

919
00:38:27,399 --> 00:38:28,159
Not the next chapter.

920
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:29,399
You should do the next scene.

921
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:30,919
Young Lady.

922
00:38:30,919 --> 00:38:32,320
I won't come with you.

923
00:38:32,439 --> 00:38:33,679
I'm waiting for...

924
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:34,879
I'm here.

925
00:38:47,879 --> 00:38:49,239
Why are you here?

926
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,959
Of course, it's me.

927
00:38:53,399 --> 00:38:54,600
Who else were you expecting?

928
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,600
That's enough. You're dismissed.

929
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,000
Thanks, Imperial Physician Yu.

930
00:38:58,639 --> 00:38:59,959
So you've been hiding in the tree?

931
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,280
How long have you been up there?

932
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:02,679
Since...

933
00:39:02,679 --> 00:39:03,159
Shut it.

934
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,360
I don't want to listen to it said by you.

935
00:39:04,879 --> 00:39:06,360
Why did you tie me up?

936
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,800
I'm afraid that you might forget our bet.

937
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:13,679
I'm here to remind you of that.

938
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,000
What are you doing?

939
00:39:16,239 --> 00:39:17,040
Don't come near me.

940
00:39:18,679 --> 00:39:19,840
Are you going to break your promise?

941
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:20,800
Of course, I am.

942
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,040
Who wants this to be done to them?

943
00:39:23,639 --> 00:39:24,280
Fine.

944
00:39:24,919 --> 00:39:26,760
I like you for who you are.

945
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,000
So can I not do this?

946
00:39:29,879 --> 00:39:30,520
Of course...

947
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:35,840
not.

948
00:39:40,439 --> 00:39:41,719
You didn't win the bet fairly either.

949
00:39:41,719 --> 00:39:42,320
Yunyan told me

950
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,439
that you submitted an empty paper deliberately.

951
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,919
Of course, I did that on purpose.

952
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:47,199
With my standard,

953
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:49,199
I can easily win the top three places.

954
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,159
So you...

955
00:39:51,159 --> 00:39:51,879
Don't worry.

956
00:39:52,919 --> 00:39:54,760
I won't do anything

957
00:39:55,199 --> 00:39:57,520
to your charming face

958
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,000
before I have a proper plan.

959
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,120
The tools I imported from Persia

960
00:40:02,439 --> 00:40:04,360
will arrive three days later.

961
00:40:04,399 --> 00:40:05,239
When they arrive,

962
00:40:05,919 --> 00:40:08,320
it'll be the best time to do the surgery.

963
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:10,040
Yu Changya.

964
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:12,360
Jinfeng.

965
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:13,560
Don't worry.

966
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:16,159
You are fated to be mine.

967
00:40:17,719 --> 00:40:18,360
