His Majesty has a message for you.

60
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:25,960
He would like...

61
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,600
No.

62
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,559
What he says matters no more.

63
00:03:28,839 --> 00:03:30,520
But His Majesty said

64
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,360
that you're no longer required in the palace.

65
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,399
What?

66
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,679
What does that mean?

67
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,240
He would like you
to leave the palace immediately...

68
00:03:39,399 --> 00:03:40,559
for good.

69
00:03:41,279 --> 00:03:42,000

70
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,119
Despicable Xuan.

71
00:03:44,679 --> 00:03:46,240
You're really despicable.

73

74
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:52,399
Yes.

76
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:55,000
are you worried about

77
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,639
meeting Liu Xie later in the morning assembly?

78
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,759
I've confronted him,

79
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,720
I don't know

80
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,399
what he might do.

81
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:02,800
Your Majesty,

82
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:04,520
I heard you ask someone

83
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,520
to request the Queen to leave the palace.

84
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,919
Are you really going to go against Liu Xie?

85
00:04:08,839 --> 00:04:10,320
Liu Xie did all he could

86
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,880
to marry his daughter into the palace.

87
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:14,279
He'll surely use it to his advantage.

88
00:04:14,559 --> 00:04:16,040
I have no feelings for the Queen.

89
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,239
But I can at least tell

90
00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:18,959
that she's not like her father.

91
00:04:19,119 --> 00:04:21,119
To say the least, she is not a bad and evil person.

92
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:24,119
What I did yesterday

93
00:04:24,559 --> 00:04:25,959
will inevitably lead Liu Xie and me

94
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:27,279
to stand against each other.

95
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,040
Keeping her in the palace

96
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,119
won't do her any good.

97
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,679
It's better for her to leave.

98
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,640
Your Majesty,

99
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:34,119
you are such a saint.

100
00:04:34,119 --> 00:04:34,920
A living Buddha.

101
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:36,679
Why do you have to

102
00:04:36,679 --> 00:04:38,239
come across someone like Scorpion Liu?

103
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,040
And it's even arranged by the father.

104
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,920
This is so sad and heart-wrenching.

105
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,640
Enough.

106
00:04:42,799 --> 00:04:44,160
What we should do now

107
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,559
is to think of a plan

108
00:04:45,559 --> 00:04:47,239
so that His Majesty could deal with Liu Xie.

109
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,079
What else can we do?

110
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,959
We'll have to give it our best.

111
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:51,760
Duan Yunzhang!

112
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,000
Move, both of you.

113
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:57,720
What insolence.

114
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,839
Why are you here?

115
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:00,000
Duan Yunzhang.

116
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,959
I can't believe you and Liu Xie
are bullying a mere woman.

117
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:02,880
What kind of a man are you?

118
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,359
Now you're trying to kick me out of the palace?

119
00:05:04,799 --> 00:05:06,200
You're an incompetent emperor

120
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:06,799
and he's a cunning official.

121
00:05:06,799 --> 00:05:07,720
Both of you are hopeless!

122
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,040
Let me tell you.

123
00:05:09,119 --> 00:05:10,640
I'm not someone who will just come and go

124
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,600
as you ordered.

125
00:05:11,799 --> 00:05:13,040
I'm the Queen now.

126
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,640
That means I won't ever leave the palace.

127
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:16,880
Why won't you leave, then?

128
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,440
I won't let anyone of you

129
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,839
underestimate me.

130
00:05:20,239 --> 00:05:21,359
Do you think you can bully me

131
00:05:21,359 --> 00:05:22,679
just because I've been meek?

132
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:25,320
I'm warning you. Watch your manners.

133
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,440
So what?

134
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,320
I might even burn down

135
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,200
the Xuanchen Hall!

136
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,079
How dare you?

137
00:05:29,359 --> 00:05:30,600
Liu Xie will pay for the damage anyway.

138
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:33,040
His Majesty just complimented her.

139
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,239
And now they are fighting.

140
00:05:34,359 --> 00:05:35,959
I can't catch up with these mood swings.

141
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,559
She's different now.

142
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,239
Do you think it's me?

143
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,040
It's him who changed his mind.

144
00:05:41,359 --> 00:05:41,679
Me?

145
00:05:41,679 --> 00:05:43,399
I'm always honest with my feelings.

146
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,200
Let me tell you.

147
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,040
I was blinded by love.

148
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,600
But I can see it now.

149
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,519
This is what you'll get from me.

150
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,440
Just wait and see.

151
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:53,760
She's acting differently now.

152
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:58,880
Move.

153
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:11,359
Long live Your Majesty.

154
00:06:14,799 --> 00:06:16,000
Where is the Grand Chancellor?

155
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:20,160
Your Majesty.

156
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,720
I was told that he has fallen sick,

157
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,000
so he is not attending today.

158
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,239
For how long?

159
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,920
He said that...

160
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,200
That...

161
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,399
he will attend the morning assembly
when he feels like it.

162
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,279
What?

163
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,480
If my memory serves me right,

164
00:06:38,559 --> 00:06:40,359
this is the first time

165
00:06:40,559 --> 00:06:41,359
the Grand Chancellor is absent.

166
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:42,000
That's right.

167
00:06:43,239 --> 00:06:44,559
What do we do?

168
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:46,279
I need his approval

00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:48,079
for the locust control plan.

170
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,640
My hunch tells me

171
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,320
that something big is brewing.

172
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:54,799
(What is that Scorpion Liu up to again?)

173
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:57,959
Read it.

174
00:06:58,959 --> 00:06:59,640
Read it.

175
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:00,959
Hurry up.

176
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,760
To all our fellow members of the palace,

177
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,000
(here's an announcement.)

178
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,839
[Announcement]
We were all once blinded in our youth.

179
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,799
Stop looking at me.

180
00:07:20,799 --> 00:07:21,679
Go on.

181
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,559

I...

197
00:07:58,079 --> 00:07:59,279
I can't do this anymore.

198
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:00,200
Stop putting me on the spot.

199
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:00,720
Do it yourself.

200
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,239
Wait.

201
00:08:04,559 --> 00:08:05,920
It's because Duan Yunzhang

202
00:08:06,239 --> 00:08:07,640
doesn't deserve it.

203
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,600
(Duan Yunzhang)

(how to be an emperor at all.)

209
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,320
(I urge everyone)

210
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,200
(to stop talking about us.)

211
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:24,000
Dismiss!

212
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,600
We see you off, Your Majesty.

213
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,400
She was just fine yesterday.

214
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,440
After a night,

215
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,200
she turned into this neurotic woman

216
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,760
like she has lost her mind.

217
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:46,400
The Grand Chancellor is also absent
from the morning assembly.

218
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,039
What exactly happened?

219
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:48,960
Your Majesty,

220
00:08:49,239 --> 00:08:50,559
something did happen.

221
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:55,760
Yesterday, the Queen found out

222
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,919
that His Majesty

223
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:58,200
does not fancy a woman like her

224
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,960
and that he had no choice

225
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,400
but to make her the Queen because of a betrothal.

226
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:03,159
She could not accept it,

227
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:04,119
so her love turned into hatred.

228
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,119
That's why she pulled these crazy acts.

229
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,559
Is that true?

230
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:11,119
But they were so intimate before this.

231
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:13,559
I thought they loved each other

232
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,799
and had a good relationship.

233
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,440
As for the Grand Chancellor's absence...

234
00:09:19,239 --> 00:09:20,080
Go on.

235
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,400
The Queen left the palace

236
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,359
and caused a ruckus
in the Grand Chancellor's Residence.

237
00:09:25,359 --> 00:09:26,000
What?

238
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,919
She made a scene
in the Grand Chancellor's Residence?

239
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,320
This is bad.

240
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,159
This is really bad.

241
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,280
My sister-in-law has finally
shown her true colors.

242
00:09:35,479 --> 00:09:37,479
I thought she was a kind lady.

243
00:09:38,359 --> 00:09:40,239
I was right.

244
00:09:40,359 --> 00:09:42,320
I knew something is wrong with her.

245
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,119
She even lied to me

246
00:09:43,119 --> 00:09:44,280
and wanted me to address her as sister-in-law.

247
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,359
Well,

248
00:09:45,359 --> 00:09:47,520
I think "Black Bear" suits her better.

249
00:09:47,719 --> 00:09:49,559
She is not worthy to be a queen after all.

250
00:09:50,239 --> 00:09:51,239
Not only she's unreasonable,

251
00:09:51,239 --> 00:09:52,400
but she has also caused trouble.

252
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,599
All these years, I tried so hard

253
00:09:54,599 --> 00:09:56,239
to make sure that the Emperor
and the Grand Chancellor are on good terms.

254
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,919
But she ruined it just like that.

255
00:09:58,159 --> 00:09:59,640
This is infuriating.

256
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:02,400
She needs to be punished.

257
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:03,799
Your Majesty.

258
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:04,760
You must not do that.

259
00:10:05,239 --> 00:10:06,239
Why not?

260
00:10:07,479 --> 00:10:09,000
Punishing the Queen

261
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,559
will only worsen the situation.

262
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,440
We would have to explain ourselves
to the Grand Chancellor.

263
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,159
What do you suggest, then?

264
00:10:16,359 --> 00:10:17,400
In my opinion,

265
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:18,400
we should

266
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,280
leave this matter to His Majesty.

267
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,719
His Majesty is wise.

268
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,080
He will handle it appropriately.

269
00:10:26,479 --> 00:10:27,239
Fine.

270
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,080
This is between them.

271
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,640
I'll leave it to Zhang, then.

272
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:34,400
Yes.

273
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,599
Your Majesty.

274
00:10:39,599 --> 00:10:40,479
Slowly.

275
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,400
I must teach her a lesson today.

276
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:49,760
Stop right there.

277
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,359
I'm telling you to stop.

278
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:53,840
Stop.

279
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,359
What? Let go of me.

280
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,400
Don't get physical.

281
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,880
How dare you?

282
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,200
You humiliated me in public.

283
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,400
Your insults

284
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,919
have defamed the imperial family.

285
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:02,960
Do you know you are in a serious offense?

286
00:11:03,239 --> 00:11:04,559
The Emperor has gotten mad.

287
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:05,760
I'm terrified.

288
00:11:06,119 --> 00:11:07,280
Go and behead me.

289
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,559
The past emperors were wise with their words.

290
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:10,039
What about you?

291
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:11,119
Nothing good comes out of your mouth.

292
00:11:11,119 --> 00:11:12,359
-Believe it or not, I can...
-Yes.

293
00:11:12,359 --> 00:11:13,599
You can kick me out of the palace now.

294
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,520
You are so afraid of Liu Xie.

295
00:11:15,599 --> 00:11:17,200
You're too scared to hit me or kill me.

296
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,799
So chasing me out is the only way
you could think of.

297
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:20,119
I'll say it again.

298
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,760
I'm not scared of Liu Xie.

299
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,239
So, you don't want to see me.

300
00:11:23,239 --> 00:11:24,559
Don't worry.

301
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:26,559
I've said it clearly in the broadcast.

302
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:27,679
We'll live our own lives.

303
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:28,880
We will not get in each other's way.

304
00:11:30,719 --> 00:11:33,119
So, please let go of me now.

305
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:35,080
Stop.

306
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:35,840
What?

307
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:40,679
It seems like you really don't want to leave.

308
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,880
What?

309
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,799
Are you deaf?

310
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:44,159
I said we'll go our separate ways.

311
00:11:44,359 --> 00:11:45,400
That won't do.

312
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,080
You're a living person.

313
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,719
I can't just pretend that you don't exist.

314
00:11:49,479 --> 00:11:50,119
(No.)

315
00:11:50,359 --> 00:11:51,359
(I can't leave the palace.)

316
00:11:51,359 --> 00:11:52,719
(Or I won't get to see my mother.)

317
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,559
Actually, after giving it some thought,

318
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:58,840
I think you can stay in the palace.

319
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,039
What do you mean?

320
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,559
You and I are married.

321
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,599
Then, we should act as husband and wife.

322
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,599
You can't call me names

323
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,080
while living in the palace

324
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,239
and eating the food
prepared by the Imperial Kitchen.

325
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,840
I actually don't mind.

326
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,239
But are you sure you can live with that?

327
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:16,760
What are you trying to say?

328
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,479
It's simple.

329
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,080
Laundry, clothes folding, and some chores.

330
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:20,799
You should know how to do them.

331
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,520
That's all?

332
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
That's easy.

333
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,159
Just wait and see.

334
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:26,719
I'll be waiting.

335
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:31,320
(I'll get rid of you this time.)

336
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,520
Young Lady, have some tea.

337

Thank you.

338
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:38,960
May I know

339
00:12:39,119 --> 00:12:40,599
when is the Queen returning?

340
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,840
I'm afraid I don't know.

341
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,119
Young Lady, do not fret.

342
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,320
From what I see,

343
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,679
Her Majesty was probably
just bickering with His Majesty.

344
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:55,599
She doesn't mean what she said.

345
00:12:56,119 --> 00:12:58,320
But Father insisted that I stay in the palace,

346
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,799
saying that there's a misunderstanding
between them.

347
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,200
It must be something serious.

348
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:04,400
In that case,

349
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,559
there must be a good reason why she is mad.

350
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,400
There are words that you can't say
no matter how mad you are.

351
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:12,239
I thought

352
00:13:12,239 --> 00:13:13,799
she was kind

353
00:13:14,119 --> 00:13:15,599
even though she was clueless.

354
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,919
But judging from this,

355
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,039
she's being unruly

356
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:20,159
and conceited.

357
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:22,960
Baiyu.

358
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:24,880
What brings you here?

359
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,440
Your Majesty.

360
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:30,440
Father made me come here to accompany you.

361
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,359
He wouldn't be that nice.

362
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:33,280
He was actually afraid that I'd run away.

363
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,440
That's why he asked you to keep an eye on me.

364
00:13:34,599 --> 00:13:36,359
Why would he? You're overthinking it.

365
00:13:36,359 --> 00:13:37,799
He didn't say anything.

366
00:13:39,359 --> 00:13:40,280
But what do you mean

367
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,400
in the broadcast?

368
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:43,760
I mean...

369
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,520
It's a long story.

370
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,719
I have work to do.

371
00:13:47,719 --> 00:13:49,080
Just treat yourself at home.

372
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:49,799
I have to go.

373
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,080

374
00:13:56,719 --> 00:13:57,359

375
00:13:57,719 --> 00:13:59,080
Go on and show us.

376
00:13:59,080 --> 00:13:59,960
Or you won't make it.

377
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,559
Why wouldn't I make it?

378
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:03,679
I work fast.

379
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:04,880
After I decided on the dishes,

380
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,320
I'll get them done in an hour.

381
00:14:06,719 --> 00:14:07,760
Twenty dishes

382
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,359
in an hour?

383
00:14:09,359 --> 00:14:10,400
Twenty dishes?

384
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,520
Duan Yunzhang is having 20 dishes?

385
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,159
Let me tell you, Your Majesty.

386
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:16,039
His Majesty has 90 dishes every day.

Forty dishes for lunch.

389

Twenty dishes for dinner.

390
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:19,840
His Majesty

391
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,280
only asked you to make 20 dishes.

392
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,760
It's considered very kind of him to do so.

393
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,400
Is he saying the truth?

394

Serve these dishes.

00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,060

She failed, didn't she?

514
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,740
She came out with all the dishes.

What?

516
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,620
She's done with the 20 dishes?

517
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:11,820
Yes.

518
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,060
Exactly 20 dishes.

519
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:15,940
Throw them away.

Wait.

524
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,260
How are the dishes?

525
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,340
They don't look the most appealing,

526
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,540
but they smell quite good.

527
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:33,940
The food on our plate

528
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,100
doesn't come easily.

529
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,380
It's shameful to be wasting food, isn't it?

530
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:37,900
That's right.

531
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,660
(It's not bad at all.)

532
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,900
(It's as good as Chai's cooking.)

533
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:06,540
Your Majesty.

534
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,380
You have never

535
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,340
enjoyed my food like how you are now.

536
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:12,460
I haven't?

537
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:13,380
You haven't.

538
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:14,380
I treat people and things

539
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,180
equally.

540
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:17,700
You and the Queen

541
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:18,980
are equally good at cooking.

542
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:21,860
Your Majesty.

543
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:22,820
Stop eating.

544
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,020
How dare you?

545
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:26,740
Your Majesty.

546
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:27,700
Have you forgotten

547
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,620
why you made her cook?

548
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,380
Is it to prove

549
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:31,980
that we are equally good?

550
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:32,740
Right.

551
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:36,700
I got careless.

552
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:40,580
I wanted to put her in a difficult spot

553
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:41,660
so that she couldn't take it

554
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:42,460
and leave the palace.

555
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,420
But I fell into her trap instead.

556
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:45,740
Get up.

557
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,220
I wanted to use this

558
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,620
against her

559
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:50,540
so that she quits

560
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,380
and gets out of here.

561
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:51,980
Yes.

562
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,220
But she got me instead.

563
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:55,820
Why don't we...

564
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:57,100
I'll take these away immediately

565
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:57,540
and serve other dishes.

566
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:58,540
Let's get her to do laundry.

567
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,340
Since cooking doesn't faze her,

568
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,700
we'll exhaust her with the laundry work

569
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:03,660
so that she has trouble sleeping.

570
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:11,220
Your Majesty.

571
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,180
What's wrong?

572
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:12,660
Your Majesty.

573
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:13,580
I don't feel good.

574
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,220
The food is unhygienic.

575
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:17,700
Go.

576
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:27,220
Your Majesty.

577
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,940
These are His Majesty's clothes.

578
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:30,260
Please wash them clean

579
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:31,420
by today.

580
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,500
Why do I have to wash his clothes?

581
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,780
We have the Palace Laundry Service here, don't we?

582
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:35,740
His Majesty has stated

583
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:38,380
that it is a wife's duty

584
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:39,900
to wash her husband's clothes.

585
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,140
Duty again?

586
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,500
He's trying to put me in a bind, isn't he?

587
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,780
I will take my leave, Your Majesty.

588
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:48,420
Fine.

589
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,460
Who does he take me for?

590
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,220
I won't give up that easily.

591
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,140
Sufang.

592
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,100
Go to the Palace Laundry Service

593
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,340
and borrow some laundry items.

594
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:05,260
Your Majesty.

595
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:07,380
These are exquisite silk from Huzhou.

596
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:07,980
I can't be bothered.

597
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,020
I'm running out of time.

598
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:09,940
I'm sorry for this.

599
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:10,980
Your Majesty.

600
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,980
This is quite inappropriate.

601
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,180
Forget it.

602
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:16,300
This is...

603
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,260
It's my duty to do the laundry, isn't it?

604
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,500
What laundry work.

605
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:26,540
Your Majesty.

606
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,060
Who did this?

607
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,460
Who else?

608
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,540
It's the Queen.

609
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:31,660
Not just this.

610
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:32,220
Well...

611
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:36,260
This is too much.

612
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:38,220
Your Majesty,

613
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,380
it's time to attend the assembly.

614
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,140
I'm not going.

615
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:41,620
No, that's...

616
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:42,500
I know you're mad,

617
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,660
but you still have to attend the assembly.

618
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:44,980
I'm not in the mood.

619
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:45,980
Leave.

620
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,020
Let's go.

621
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:55,660
Liu Jinfeng.

622
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,660
You have crossed the line.

623
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:01,380
Don't blame me for being ruthless.

624
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,620
What's with Duan Yunzhang again?

625
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:09,500
Please see for yourself, Your Majesty.

626
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,940
I can see it.

627
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:12,260
It's dirty here, isn't it?

628
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,660
Obviously.

629
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:16,220
When was the last time this stable was cleaned?

630
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,260
It stinks.

631
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:17,900
I know.

632
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:18,980
It hasn't been cleaned for three days.

633
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,060
They were waiting for you.

634
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,060
What?

635
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,140
Greetings, Your Majesty.

636
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:27,660
His Majesty has given his oral decree.

637
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,060
He believes

638
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:31,100
that the Queen is capable

639
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,220
and diligent.

640
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:35,020
She'll be able to clean the stable.

641
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,340
Please do a good job.

642
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:37,220
That's all to his statement.

643
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,420
He sounded as if he was complimenting me.

644
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,900
He's practically asking me to do labor work.

645
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:41,980
Let me tell you.

646
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:43,380
Horse manure is really useful.

647
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:45,180
It is highly valued back in Xianpa Village.

648
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:46,780
We use it to fertilize our plants.

649
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:49,500
I won't bother you any longer, then.

650
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,420
Take your time, Your Majesty.

651
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,420
-Go.
-You brat!

652
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:54,780
Go.

653
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:58,260
Your Majesty.

654
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,100
This place is filthy.

655
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,940
Are you really going to clean it yourself?

656
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,780
Nothing good comes out of Duan Yunzhang's mouth.

657
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:04,940
But he's right about one thing.

658
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,580
I am capable and diligent.

659
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,460
It's been cleaned thoroughly.

660
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,620
The bad smell is gone, too.

661
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,980
Is this all done by the Queen?

662
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:40,620
Your Majesty,

663
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,820
not only did she clean it herself,

664
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:44,300
but she also sent the horse manure

665
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:48,220
to the plantation in the palace for compost.

666
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:50,260
Not bad.

667
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,900
I gave her such difficult tasks.

668
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,940
Yet, she completed them

669
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,780
without a word of complaint.

670
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:59,460
Now she knows what I am capable of.

671
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,060
It must be daunting for her.

672
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,820
It's just that... She...

673
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:03,900
What's wrong with her?

674
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:05,660
She's fine.

675
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,580
It's Yinyun.

676
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,020
Yinyun?

677
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:19,180
Where is my beloved horse?

678
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,020
Where is it?

679
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,620
What happened to you, Yinyun?

680
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:33,780
What happened to its fur?

681
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,780
When Her Majesty
was cleaning the stable yesterday,

682
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:38,620
she noticed that Yinyun kept sneezing.

683
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:41,100
She thought that it couldn't stand the heat,

684
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,180
so...

685
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:44,140
she shaved its fur.

686
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:46,860
That woman.

687
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:50,580
Never mind that she messed
with my stomach and clothes,

688
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:53,580
but I can't believe she even messed with my horse.

689
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:55,500
Yinyun, it's okay.

690
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,660
I will revenge you.

691
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:01,060
How long does it take for the fur to grow?

692
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:05,700
It's all my fault

693
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,500
for failing to protect you

694
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,620
and putting you through such dishevelment.

695
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:12,660
I feel so remorseful for the last few days.

696
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:13,780
Why did I

697
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,780
serve the poisoned dishes that day?

698
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,620
You wouldn't have eaten it
if I hadn't served the food.

699
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:18,540
If you hadn't eaten it,

700
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:20,140
she wouldn't have to do the laundry.

701
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,420
If she hadn't done the laundry,

702
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:22,900
you wouldn't have let her clean the stable.

703
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:23,340
If she hadn't cleaned the stable...

704
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:23,860
Enough!

705
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:25,300
You're being annoying.

706
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,940
I don't care who her father is.

707
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,100
The fact is that she has made His Majesty

708
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:28,820
feel awful.

709
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:30,380
This won't do.

710
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,420
I will bring her here

711
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:32,300
and let Your Majesty punish her.

712
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:36,140
Jing.

713
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:38,100
What's with the rush?

714
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:39,980
To seize the Queen.

715
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,020
Seize the Queen?

716
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,380
Why?

717
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:51,700
Yunzhang.

718
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:55,180
What's with the long face?

719
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,260
Is it because she...

720
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,860
Don't bring her up.

721
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:05,260
My body feels numb when I hear her name.

722
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:07,420
That explains it.

723
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:10,860
After my investigation
during the last couple of days,

724
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:13,140
I found that the Queen is just like her father.

725
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,060
They both are not simple.

726
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:16,220
I'm all ears.

727
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:18,620
Jing.

728
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:20,220
Let me ask you.

729
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:23,060
How many bowls of rice do you eat for a meal?

730
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:23,900
Five bowls.

731
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:25,420
You lose.

732
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,860
You're a warrior,

733
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,420
but you can't even win a woman?

734
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,380
That's impossible.

735
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,500
Ever since that day

736
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:37,380
when my sister-in-law
humiliated Yunzhang as the despicable...

737
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:42,740
I was utterly shocked anyhow.

738
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:45,820
So, I got very curious about her.

739
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:47,820
I went to Xiangluo Hall

740
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,260
to talk to some of the servants there

741
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:54,060
and got some good information.

742
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,340
Yunzhang.

743
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,780
Have a look.

744
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:05,260
[The Queen eats at least five portions of rice every meal]
We've lost in food intake, let alone the others.

745
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,020
She eats five portions a meal.

746
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:08,940
Five portions?

747
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:17,860
I'm almost full now.

748
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:21,580
Let's go.

749
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,060
She hides her evil intention behind her smile

750
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:32,180
and is willing to make things
go her way at all costs.

751
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:37,020
Baiyu.

752
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:38,180
You have been reading for so long.

753
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:38,900
Are you not bored?

754
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:39,660
Not at all.

755
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:40,940
I've only read for an hour.

756
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,060
Your eyes must be tired.

757
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,060
Let me recite a tongue twister for you.

758
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:46,380
Betty Botter bought some butter.

759
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,140
But she said the butter's bitter.

760
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,460
If I put it in my batter,
it will make my batter bitter.

761
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,100
I've heard that one before.
Say something different.

762
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:51,940
You have?

763
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,180
I'll tell you a joke.

764
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:57,060
A fat man fell from somewhere high.

765
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,100
What do you think he has become?

766
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,660
A dead fat man.

767
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:09,980
It's not funny?

768
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,780
You must be thirsty.

769
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:15,780
I'll get you some water.

770
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:16,740
I'm good.

771
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:18,220
My book!

772
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:19,340
Look.

773
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:19,820
Oh, no.

774
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:21,460
Oh, no. Now you can't read anymore.

775
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:23,580
I'll tell you another joke.

776
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:24,940
What do you call an alligator

777
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,380
who solves mysteries?

778
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,580
An investigator!

779
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:38,820
Liu Baiyu

780
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:41,020
is such a proud woman.

781
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:43,100
But she is no match for my sister-in-law.

782
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:43,940
Serves her right.

783
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:46,780
What goes around comes around.

784
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:48,500
There will always be consequences.

785
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:49,420
Your Highness.

786
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:51,780
You seem to be more interested

787
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:52,700
in Liu Baiyu.

788
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,980
That's absurd.

789
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:59,100
I just find it suspicious that she doesn't seem

790
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:00,700
to want to leave the palace.

791
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:04,220
I'm just keeping an eye on her, too.

792
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:07,220
There are so many pages.

793
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:09,500
She had committed so many wrongdoings.

794
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:11,700
The servants might have exaggerated

795
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,420
when they were gossiping.

796
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:16,660
But there's one true thing.

797
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:17,780
What is it?

798
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,700
You're so cute, baby.

799
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,540
What an adorable creature.

800
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:34,100
Think about it.

801
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:37,500
Nobody has a spider as a pet.

802
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:40,740
She's just like the villain in the huabens.

803
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:41,620
Your Majesty.

804
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,300
You once said

805
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,100
that she is different from her father

806
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,500
and she's not evil.

807
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,900
I was deceived by her friendly

808
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:49,740
and innocent appearance.

809
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:51,700
It seems like

810
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,300
so long as she's in the palace,

811
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,860
I won't ever have peace.

812
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,180
I have to think of something

813
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:57,500
to chase her out.

814
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:58,500
Your Majesty.

815
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,380
The Queen is Liu Xie's daughter.

816
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,020
I'm afraid it's not that easy

817
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:03,420
to get rid of her.

818
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:06,620
That's why I want to make her leave on her own.

819
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:07,580
But it's just not working.

820
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:08,700
I don't need to hear that from you.

821
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:10,300
Your Majesty,

822
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:11,740
there's one thing

823
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:13,740
that I don't know if I should tell.

824
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:14,580
Tell me.

825
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:18,620
Your Majesty,

826
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,300
I heard a rumor

827
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,420
when I went to Xianpa Village.

828
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:25,180
Apparently, Xianpa Village is full of women
that bring misfortune to their husbands.

829
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,900
All the women from the village
bring bad luck to their husbands.

830
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,540
So, I'm thinking

831
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:32,580
she might be bad for you, too.

832
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:34,540
I didn't believe it at first,

833
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,340
but I do now.

834
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:36,140
No.

835
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:36,860
You're saying...

836
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:37,820
In that case...

837
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:38,940
How would she bring misfortune?

838
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:40,900
She might cause his death.

839
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,220
A few men have died in the village.

840
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,060
I...

841
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,060
It's such a big deal.
Why didn't you tell it sooner?

842
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:46,980
Ridiculous.

843
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,500
That's nonsense.

844
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:52,020
Even if it's true,

845
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,420
I'm the Emperor.

846
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,540
I'm not afraid.

847
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:55,820
Yunzhang.

848
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,020
Don't be scared.

849
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:57,860
I mean,

850
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,660
there's no harm

851
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,020
in believing these things.

852
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:03,620
We have to think of a plan.

853
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:04,780
What plan?

854
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:06,860
Liu Xie claimed to be sick at home

855
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:08,660
and I have so much work to do.

856
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:10,140
I don't have the time to deal with her.

857
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:12,500
I'll leave this to all of you.

858
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,060
It's...

859
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,740
We are in no place to do so.

860
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:17,260
I will do my best

861
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:18,020
to ensure your safety.

862
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:18,740
Very well.

863
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:20,180
Remember.

864
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,420
Devise a strategy

865
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:24,140
and make sure nothing goes wrong.

866
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:25,220
Don't go overboard.

867
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,300
She's still a woman after all.

868
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:26,740
I...

869
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:28,700
What?

870
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:34,060
Yes, Your Majesty.

871
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:46,580
This is an important mission from Yunzhang.

872
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:47,780
Who would like to talk?

873
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:50,460
Before that, I have a question.

874
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,500
His Majesty does not want us to go overboard.

875
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,780
What does he mean by that?

876
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,900
We can't use physical or verbal violence on her.

877
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,540
She's the Queen

878
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,660
and the Grand Chancellor's daughter.

879
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:01,220
We should think of a plan

880
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,540
to make her leave voluntarily.

881
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,020
That's what we are doing now.

882
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:06,100
Right.

883
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:08,500
I think I have an idea.

884
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,300
I can't even think of something.

885
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,500
What's your plan?

886
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:12,820
Now is not the time to bicker.

887
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:13,500
Go ahead.

888
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,220
Look.

889
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:15,980
When I went to Xianpa Village,

890
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:17,740
I heard that the Queen is afraid of nothing,

891
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,460
except for one thing.

892
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:20,260
What is it?

893
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:22,300
Plastic surgery.

894
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,340
Plastic surgery?

895
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:24,420
Plastic surgery?

896
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:35,660
Your Majesty.

897
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,860
The lunch for Duan Yunzhang is almost ready.

898
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:38,300
No.

899
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,300
His Majesty told me to inform you

900
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,300
that you don't have to cook anymore.

901
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:43,020
Not anymore?

902
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:44,740
Fine. I'll do the laundry then.

903
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:45,460
You don't have to do that either.

904
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:47,180
Not that too?

905
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:48,940
I'll clean the stable.

906
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:50,580
You don't have to do anything.

907
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,220
No?

908
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:54,900
What's going on?

909
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,180
The sun is out from the west?

910
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:57,740
No way.

911
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:00,340
Or Duan Yunzhang has admitted defeat?

912
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,700
It's only been a few days.

913
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,100
How weak.

914
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:06,380
But all right.

915
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,300
I'm perfectly fine with that.

916
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,020
Yes.

917
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,340
Please have some good rest, Your Majesty.

918
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:11,060
I'll inform His Majesty.

919
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:11,820
Go on.

920
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,580
But I've bought so many ingredients.

921
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:18,660
Sufang.

922
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,100
Yes, Your Majesty?

923
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,900
Ask Baiyu to wait at Yufang Garden.

924
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:23,700
We will have a celebration.

925
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:24,260
Sure.

926
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:25,340
I'll go now.

927
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,060
All right. Go on.

928
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:33,220
Let's go, Baiyu.

929
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,180
-Come on.
-Where are we going?

930
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:35,820
Hurry up.

931
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:38,100
-Where are we going?
-Stop asking.

932
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:39,300
Come on.

933
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,300
Have a seat, my beloved consort.

934
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:47,460
Consort?

935
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:50,380
Duan Yunzhang has officials that he favors.

936
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:52,180
Why can't I have my favorite consort?

937
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:53,820
Look at you.

938
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:56,620
You're kind, knowledgeable,

939
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:58,420
and beautiful inside out.

940
00:33:58,660 --> 00:33:59,860
There's no other place

941
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,940
where I could find such a rare beauty.

942
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:02,700
Come on.

943
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,900
We will view the flowers and have wine together.

944
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:05,980
Isn't that great?

945
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,180
I can't.

946
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,300
I'm feeling under the weather today.

947
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,260
I have no appetite,

948
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,540
so I'm afraid I have to refuse.

949
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:13,100
You're not feeling well?

950
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:14,900
What a shame.

951
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:15,580
There's a table of good food,

952
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:17,100
but I have no one to share it with.

953
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:20,220
Please enjoy, Your Majesty.

954
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:21,180
I shall take my leave.

955
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,980
You may excuse yourself.

956
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:28,740
I will take my leave.

957
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:47,420
Sister-in-law.

958
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:58,340
Here you go.

959
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:00,220
Here.

960
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:01,820
This is for you, Sister-in-law.

961
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,060
You must have had it hard.

962
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:04,220
For me?

963
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:05,100
Why?

964
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:06,060
I...

965
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:07,340
Your Majesty.

966
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:08,620
Actually,

967
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:10,780
we all think that His Majesty
was being unreasonable this time.

968
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:11,780
-Yes.
-Yes.

969
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,340
But we can't just tell him that.

970
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:13,980
Right.

971
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,580
That's why we came to apologize.

972
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:16,340
That's right.

973
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,980
-Really?
-Absolutely.

974
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:21,980
That's what I said.

975
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:23,300
Anyone with a sane mind

976
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,780
can tell who has been at fault.

977
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:25,220
That's right.

978
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:26,300
Here. Cheers.

979
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:26,940
Sure.

980
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,060
Here.

981
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:34,940
Good wine.

982
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:36,660
Let me help you with that.

983
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,700
You're in luck.

984
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,380
I made so many dishes.

985
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:41,860
You don't usually get to have these in the palace.

986
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:43,020
Here. Help yourself.

987
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:43,580
Don't be shy.

988
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:46,060
I'll bring it to you.

989
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,380
(Bad move.)

990
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:50,620
(She's ruthless.)

991
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:52,540
(His Majesty had diarrhea for two days)

992
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:53,940
(after just a few bites.)

993
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,580
This is my specialty.

994
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:58,940
(For the sake of His Majesty,)

995
00:35:58,940 --> 00:35:59,660
(I'll have to eat it.)

996
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:02,900
(Can I not?)

997
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:05,460
Help yourselves.

998
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,180
Go on.

999
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:12,420
All right.

1000
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:15,500
Hurry up.

1001
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:22,020
Your Majesty.

1002
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:24,100
I've already had lunch.

1003
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:24,620
How about this?

1004
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:25,660
I'll drink with you.

1005
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:29,660
Sure.

1006
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,020
Sister-in-law.

1007
