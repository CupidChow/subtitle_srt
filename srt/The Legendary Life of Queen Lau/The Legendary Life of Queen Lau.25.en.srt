24
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,839
Your Majesty. We've investigated it.

25
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,680
It doesn't appear anywhere else.

26
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,000
The source of the fire
comes from the canopy of the bed.

27
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:50,879
The canopy?

28
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:51,599
Yes.

29
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:53,000
I've asked the maidservants on duty.

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,040
As usual,

31
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,040
they replaced the candle

32
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,360
after Your Majesty had gone for the assembly.

33
00:01:56,559 --> 00:01:57,559
The candle was never lit.

34
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,040
So, this is definitely not an accident.

35
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,760
I certainly don't think so.

36
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,080
Come out.

37
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:34,559
In the eighth year of Shunchang,
the reign of the Late Emperor,

38
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,360
the Late Emperor went to battle himself

39
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:40,880
and dealt with all the border skirmishes.

40
00:02:41,399 --> 00:02:43,440
In order for Xiyue Empire that lost the battle

41
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:47,679
to establish a peace alliance
with Donghao Empire,

42
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,679
Xiyue Empire's king, King Li

43
00:02:51,399 --> 00:02:56,399
sent his eldest princess,
Li Yue, to the capital.

44
00:02:56,679 --> 00:03:01,080
The Late Emperor fell in love
with Princess Li Yue at first sight.

45
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,880
He bestowed her the title of Consort Li

46
00:03:04,119 --> 00:03:06,639
and granted Qiluo Hall to her.

47
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,880
Empress Dowager was jealous of Consort Li.

48
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,360
She wanted to get rid of this rival.

49
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,520
Unfortunately, their fates
are such a coincidence.

50
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,440
Empress Dowager and Consort Li
had the Late Emperor's child at the same time.

51
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,199
At the same time? What a coincidence.

52
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,279
Until one night, there was
a strange phenomenon in the sky.

53
00:03:27,399 --> 00:03:29,199
There were thunder and lightning.

54
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,880
A bolt of lightning
struck the pillar of Qiluo Hall.

55
00:03:33,679 --> 00:03:38,199
Empress Dowager used it as an excuse
and accused Consort Li of being a witch.

56
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:41,399
The Late Emperor believed it

57
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,801
and captured Consort Li.

58
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:47,919
What next?

59
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:48,800
Yes. What next?

60
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,679
Hurry up.

61
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,960
Empress Dowager saw Consort Li
fall into disfavor,

62
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,399
and was very happy.

63
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,759
However, she laughed too much

64
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,119
and had a miscarriage.

65
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,240
When Empress Dowager had the miscarriage,

66
00:04:05,399 --> 00:04:08,679
Consort Li was so happy.

67
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:10,960
Her joy begot sorrow.

68
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:13,639
She felt too happy

69
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:17,079
and thus had a premature birth.

70
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:21,679
Harming others will bring you
consequences in the end.

71
00:04:22,799 --> 00:04:25,959
Great!

72
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:26,559
Mister.

73
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,440
How's the faked story?

74
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,839
The start was not bad

75
00:04:30,119 --> 00:04:31,359
but isn't the end

76
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,600
a bit too much?

77
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,239
Mister, you know nothing.

78
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,640
Nowadays,

79
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,040
no one will listen

80
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,799
to the serious truth.

81
00:04:38,119 --> 00:04:39,640
But when you tell nonsense seriously,

82
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,959
they will believe it.

83
00:04:42,239 --> 00:04:43,279
It's reasonable.

84
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:43,839
Here you are.

85
00:04:44,679 --> 00:04:45,679
You're giving it all to me?

86
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,640
Don't you want it?

87
00:04:47,119 --> 00:04:47,959
I'll accept it then.

88
00:04:48,239 --> 00:04:49,079
Thank you, Mister.

89
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,200
Ask him to keep going

90
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,040
until

91
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:53,799
no one wants to listen anymore.

92
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:55,440
Mister, I...

93
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:56,839
You're still asking him to keep going?

94
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,079
He has been telling stories

95
00:04:58,079 --> 00:04:59,480
for a few days according to your order.

96
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:00,959
You know nothing.

97
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,119
A rumor

98
00:05:02,119 --> 00:05:03,440
has a higher possibility of becoming true

99
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,559
when it has been spread for a long time

100
00:05:04,559 --> 00:05:06,399
and to more people.

101
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,440
But this story of Consort Li

102
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,959
happened many years ago.

103
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,200
The story was old.

104
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,119
It's exactly because it was an old story

105
00:05:13,119 --> 00:05:14,119
so you need to tell it again.

106
00:05:14,119 --> 00:05:15,480
Otherwise, people will forget this person.

107
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,480
When everyone forgets her,

108
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,480
they will forget what she did.

109
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,160
When everyone remembers her,

110
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,079
I will be able to find what I want.

111
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:24,440
This girl married into Donghao Empire.

112
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,720
Enjoy. I'm leaving.

113
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,320
Please wait for the next chapter.

114
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:32,679
Great!

115
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:35,399
Your Majesty.

116
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,559
I've investigated Lingshu Academy thoroughly.

117
00:05:37,679 --> 00:05:38,480
Nothing is suspicious.

118
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,799
I've also inquired with
the maidservants of the Imperial Harem.

119
00:05:42,799 --> 00:05:44,679
It was the first day of the month.
Every first day of the month,

120
00:05:44,679 --> 00:05:46,200
Yu Changya will do some facial talks

121
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,920
at Lingshu Academy.

122
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,079
It's a talk in name only.

123
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:51,839
In truth,

124
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:54,279
he was trying to scam the maidservants
to buy his beauty products.

125
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,720
Also, Yunzhang.

126
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,720
Why did you suspect Yu Changya suddenly?

127
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,880
Perhaps I'm overthinking this.

128
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,279
Your Majesty.

129
00:06:03,119 --> 00:06:05,399
Is it possible that the maidservants
on night duty

130
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:06,679
forgot to change the candle

131
00:06:06,679 --> 00:06:08,440
and it was an accident right from the start?

132
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,679
Your Majesty.

133
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:14,239
What is it?

134
00:06:14,239 --> 00:06:15,399
It's almost time.

135
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:17,600
Her Majesty and the artist
have both arrived at Xuanchen Hall.

136
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:19,440
I almost forgot the important thing.

137
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,320
What do you think

138
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,440
about this drawing?

139
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,320
Pretty. It's really pretty.

140
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,320
They are a perfect match.

141
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,200
I finally found a combination

142
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,839
that's even better than tomatoes and eggs.

143
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,079
With this drawing,

144
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:42,119
I'll be the first to object

145
00:06:42,119 --> 00:06:43,119
if anyone says they are not a match.

146
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,640
If that's what Sister-in-law looks like,

147
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,720
it would be quite good.

148
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,079
How is it?

149
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:49,880
Can we move now?

150
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:50,959
Sister-in-law,

151
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:52,040
you may move now.

152
00:06:52,119 --> 00:06:53,720
There's not much to refer to on your side.

153
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,119
Let me take a look.

154
00:07:00,679 --> 00:07:01,519
Who is this?

155
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,760
Yunzhang, look, who this woman is?

156
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,600
What's wrong?

157
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,880
Didn't they say it's good?

158
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,640
Let me see.

159
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,600
Who did you draw?

160
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,119
That's...

161
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,279
Your Majesty.

162
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,959
I was drawing Her Majesty.

163
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,760
Is this Her Majesty?

164
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,480
You are bad at drawing
and you're trying to lie to me?

165
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:23,679
Your Majesty.

166
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,600
I dare not.

167
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,480
I did draw Her Majesty.

168
00:07:27,119 --> 00:07:28,279
If you don't believe me, see for yourself.

169
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,399
Look.

170
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:30,519
Her Majesty has slanted eyes.

171
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:32,399
I only made them slightly wider.

172
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,600
Look at Her Majesty's auspicious face.

173
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,279
I only tucked it in

174
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:37,760
a little bit.

175
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:39,880
Look at Her Majesty's small mouth.

176
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,040
I also slightly

177
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,200
raised it a little.

178
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,760
That's right.

179
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,040
There's nothing wrong with it.

180
00:07:45,559 --> 00:07:46,519
I only

181
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:48,320
did some appropriate art processing.

182
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:49,959
I understand.

183
00:07:50,119 --> 00:07:51,359
Adding sugar to a bitter gourd

184
00:07:51,359 --> 00:07:52,799
will turn it into a honeydew melon.

185
00:07:53,799 --> 00:07:54,880
Art processing?

186
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,959
This is plastic surgery, right?

187
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:56,519
Her Majesty.

188
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,079
There's a big difference.

189
00:07:58,239 --> 00:07:59,399
I only beautified the drawing.

190
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,760
It doesn't change who you are.

191
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,799
Nonsense.

192
00:08:01,799 --> 00:08:02,480
Exactly.

193
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,760
Do I even need plastic surgery?

194
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,799
My face will be ruined if I do that.

195
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,480
Exactly.

196
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,359
-She's right.
-Yes.

197
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,119
Draw it again.

198
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,679
I'm telling you.

199
00:08:15,799 --> 00:08:18,040
If you dare make Her Majesty
look different again,

200
00:08:18,359 --> 00:08:19,160
I will let Yu Changya

201
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,480
make your face into Her Majesty's face.

202
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:24,079
That's being nice to him.

203
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,200
Yes. That's being nice.

204
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,959
I'll make your face into His Highness' face.

205
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,000
Redraw it.

206
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:33,840
Seriously?

207
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,359
We need to sit for another six hours.

208
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:36,679
Just endure it and it'll be over.

209
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:38,039
You were the one who wanted it to be lifelike.

210
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:38,760
Let's go.

211
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,960
I didn't expect a drawing would be so torturing.

212
00:08:41,359 --> 00:08:42,479
Hurry up and redraw it.

213
00:08:44,359 --> 00:08:45,359
Draw it well this time.

214
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,840
Do you think Yunzhang has changed recently?

215
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,440
He has changed a bit.

216
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,400
But I don't know what it is.

217
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,080
That's right.

218
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,280
It feels weird.

219
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,239
Even if there's a change,
I can't figure out what has changed.

220
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,159
Has he become better looking?

221
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:06,520
What nonsense.

222
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,679
His Majesty has always been handsome.

223
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,760
He lost weight.

224
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,640
That's impossible.

225
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,760
I've been scheduling his diet reasonably.

226
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,880
Then he became...

227
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,919
He became stupid!

228
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,479
Right?

229
00:09:17,119 --> 00:09:18,159
Didn't you two notice?

230
00:09:18,719 --> 00:09:19,559
He actually said the artist's face

231
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,960
can be turned into my face.

232
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:21,880
How is that possible?

233
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,320
I'm born handsome.

234
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:29,960
I have some important things to do.

235
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,599
Let's talk later.

236
00:09:31,599 --> 00:09:32,119
Sure.

237
00:09:36,479 --> 00:09:37,599
Have you noticed

238
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:39,440
His Highness has also changed recently?

239
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,719
This is too obvious.

240
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:42,960
He has obviously become stupid.

241
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:43,840
Exactly.

242
00:09:44,479 --> 00:09:46,719
Does he actually think
he has something important to do?

243
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:48,559
Let's go.

244
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:56,559
Don't move!

245
00:09:57,679 --> 00:09:58,640
Your Highness.

246
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,960
What are you doing?

247
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:01,719
Can't you see?

248
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,159
I'm using a gun to point at your Young Lady.

249
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,440
Your Highness.

250
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,919
I'm not in the mood to play with you.

251
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:09,919
Fine. I won't play with you.

252
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,599
This gun is for you.

253
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,719
Why did you give me a gun?

254
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:14,960
Oh.

255
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,159
I can't give it to you officially.

256
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,799
You haven't answered my question yet.

257
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:19,799
What question?

258
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,799
Do you want to become the Queen

259
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:23,960
because you like Yunzhang

260
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,719
or do you want to become the Queen
because of your pride?

261
00:10:27,719 --> 00:10:28,559
Is there a difference?

262
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:29,599
What does it have to do with you?

263
00:10:29,599 --> 00:10:30,880
How does it have nothing to do with me?

264
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,840
Didn't I tell you?

265
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,280
Your matter is my matter.

266
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,719
Here. Take this gun.

267
00:10:34,719 --> 00:10:36,880
My matter has nothing to do with you.

268
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,799
-I don't want it.
-Just take it.

269
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:38,159
No.

270
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:38,599
Take it.

271
00:10:38,599 --> 00:10:39,200
No.

Your Highness!

275
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:50,520
Your Highness, are you all right?

276
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,280
Young Lady, what should we do?

277
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,359
I... I don't know.

278
00:10:53,359 --> 00:10:54,479
I didn't do it on purpose.

279

Baiyu.

280
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,520
Don't die!

281
00:10:58,119 --> 00:10:59,840
I knew you care for me.

282

Liu Baiyu.

283
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:03,280
You are softhearted.

284
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,640
This gun

285
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,000
has no bullet inside.

286
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,679
No, you...

287
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,599
Here. Hold this.

288
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:13,000
I have another one here.

289
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,039
One for you and one for me.

290
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,719
They are matching guns for a couple.

291
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:21,119
Duan Yunchong, you are so childish!

292
00:11:21,479 --> 00:11:23,239
What do you mean by couple?

293
00:11:26,599 --> 00:11:27,760
Aren't we a couple?

294
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,039
I understand.

295
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,119
That's easy.

296
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:34,679
One sentence and it'll be okay.

Sister-in-law.

298

Why are you here, Prince Longyue?

299
00:11:47,359 --> 00:11:48,000
Sit down.

00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:51,840
Yes.

303

Longyue.

304
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,039
Why did you suddenly stop

doing your romance broadcasts?

306
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:02,359
The imperial capital is too quiet.

307
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,520
I can't get used to it

308
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,799
when you stopped suddenly.

309
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:07,840
It's not that I stopped doing it.

310
00:12:08,119 --> 00:12:09,359
I dare not do it.

311
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,039
What's wrong?

312
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,359
Look at this.

313
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:20,039
The listeners

[To Prince Longyue]
have been asking about Consort Li recently.

315
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,559
There are many rumors about her.

316
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,599
There are many stories
inside and outside the palace.

317
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,520
Someone said she was a witch

318
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:29,599
and someone said she was a resentful woman.

319
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:31,280
There are all types of stories.

320
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:34,960
Does His Majesty

321

know about this?

322

we should do about this?

My mother

What's worse, she is also very picky.

374
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,400
The son of the Huang family is not bad.

375

He looks handsome and has a good background.

378

And the son of the Wu family.

379

Isn't he handsome and talented?

380

Handsome.

381

He's quite handsome.

382
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:27,880
Yes.

383
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,239
Look at his small face.

384
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,400
He has a likable face.

385
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,359
Yes.

386
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,479
Oh.

387
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,461
The son of the Feng family just became Juren.

388
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,559
Juren?

Madam Liu.

394
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,400
Three people are enough, right?

395
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,440
Who do you intend to pick for Heipang?

396
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:54,799
In terms of family background,
appearance, and behavior,

397
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:56,440
they are all the best of the best.

But to become my son-in-law,

399
00:16:01,479 --> 00:16:04,200
they are still lacking.

400
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:04,719
You...

401
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,880
Are you picking a son-in-law?

402

Can you even pick one?

403
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,599
Of course.

404
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,640
I believe a good son-in-law

405
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,599
will soon present himself.

406

How is it? I'm done.

407

My mother is scary, right?

408
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,220
Why don't I feel like you're complaining

409
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:23,610
but you're showing her love instead?

410
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,460
When did I complain about her?

411
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:26,900
Didn't you say she's scary?

412
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:30,420
It's scary how much she loves me.

413
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,020
Are you troubled

414
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,420
with the issue about Consort Li recently?

415
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:42,660

416

417

418
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:50,420
I haven't.

Why don't I bring you to see your mother?

420

Stop joking.

421

00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,020
The timing is just right.

503
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,900
Why do you want that drawing so badly?

504
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,210
Because there will be a birthday celebration.

505
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:11,180
I want to send my mother a better gift.

506
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:11,970
Birthday?

507
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:23,730
Are you sure the exit
of the secret passage is Manyu Tower?

508
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:24,580
Yes.

509
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,700
I followed the secret passage twice.

510
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,820
There is only one exit.

511
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,060
It's called Manyu Tower.

512
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,060
I see.

513
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,370
Interesting.

514
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:34,730
What is that place?

515
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:36,180
Consort Li's place.

516
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:39,180
Consort Li?

517
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,180
The Late Emperor loved Consort Li

518
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,700
and built Manyu Tower
at the southern end of the imperial capital

519
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:48,540
especially for Consort Li to gaze at the moon.

520
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,130
I didn't expect the Late Emperor
to be so romantic.

521
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,490
He built the tower

522
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:55,580
and even a secret passage from his own chambers

523
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:57,490
to visit Consort Li whenever he wanted.

524
00:20:58,660 --> 00:20:59,490
How is it?

525
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,540
Did you find the formula at Manyu Tower?

526
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:02,130
I didn't.

527
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:04,820
Really?

528
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:06,060
Yes.

529
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:08,180
Look. You don't trust me again.

530
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,130
Yu Changya.

531
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:12,940
Don't doubt me regarding this.

532
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:14,130
I have

533
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:16,210
never trusted you since the beginning.

534
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,250
The same goes for you.

535
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:21,580
Rumor has it,

536
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:23,180
Qianhuafu Formula

537
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:25,130
has always been in Consort Li's hands.

538
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:28,540
But there's no news about it
after Consort Li passed away.

539
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:32,940
If the formula isn't in Xuanchen Hall,

540
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,420
Manyu Tower,

541
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,020
or the young Emperor's hands,

542
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:37,250
where will it be?

543
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:40,060
I don't know.

544
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:43,420
You better find out soon.

545
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:46,780
Sure.

546
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:48,580
Since we've proven

547
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:50,210
that the formula isn't with the Emperor,

548
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:51,300
can Jinfeng

549
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,820
back out from this plan earlier?

550
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:53,940
It's not time yet.

551
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,730
When is the right time that you spoke about?

552
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:57,900
Don't forget.

553
00:21:57,970 --> 00:21:59,820
I am the one who set the rules of the game.

554
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:04,490
What do you want Jinfeng to do?

555
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,900
I want her to be the Queen.

556
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:07,490
No.

557
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,820
There's obviously a third party

558
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:10,730
hiding in the dark.

559
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:12,180
We don't know who they are.

560
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,660
We don't know when they will act

561
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:15,020
and we don't know

562
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:16,130
why they want the formula.

563
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,210
The Imperial Palace is a very dangerous place.

564
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,660
You sent Jinfeng into the palace

565
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:22,970
to get the formula.

566
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,420
In that case,

567
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:26,180
Jinfeng came to the palace for me.

568
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:30,730
So, I need to guarantee Jinfeng's safety.

569
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:33,900
Yu Changya, you are overthinking this.

570
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,900
Don't worry. She is very safe.

571
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:39,940
Not bad, Liu Xie.

572
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:41,060
I understand.

573
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:43,300
You just want your daughter to become the Queen.

574
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,820
Fine. I promise you.

575
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,900
As long as you let Jinfeng exit the palace,

576
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,180
she will become my queen

577
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,660
when I make it.

578
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,490
She is already the Queen.

579
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,540
Why should I wait for you to make her Queen?

580
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,130
Do you think being Duan Yunzhang's queen

581
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:56,970
and my queen is the same?

582
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:00,490
I win.

583
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:05,970
Liu Xie.

584
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,580
You are really evil.

585
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:10,820
Do you really want

586
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:12,450
to harm your own daughter?

587
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,300
What did he just say?

588
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:29,660
Say it again.

589
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:31,210
He said...

590
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,330
Enough. Madam Fu.

591
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:33,180
Don't worry.

592
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:35,130
No matter how evil this scorpion is

593
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:36,330
and how he wants to harm Jinfeng,

594
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:37,450
I will definitely

595
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:39,130
protect Jinfeng as long as I'm here.

596
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:40,970
How dare you.

597
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:42,130
Madam Fu, calm down.

598
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:42,820
Don't be angry.

599
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:44,250
How can I not be angry?

600
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:45,060
Look at you.

601
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,060
How can I not get angry

602
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,770
when you wrongly accused him?

603
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:51,700
No...

604
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,940
I didn't accuse him.

605
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,210
Tell me.

606
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:58,580
Why don't you act like an imperial physician

607
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:00,020
and come here instead

608
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:02,330
to play a game of chess with my Scorpion Liu?

609
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:05,660
Look at you.

610
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:08,420
You're only goofing around.

611
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:09,850
Gosh.

612
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,300
Fortunately,

613
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,580
I didn't marry Jinfeng to you.

614
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:13,820
Madam Fu, I...

615
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:14,580
What?

616
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,610
Shut up!

617
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:17,660
Listen to me.

618
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,940
Even if Scorpion Liu is a scorpion,

619
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:22,330
you should remember,

620
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:23,450
you ungrateful man.

621
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,900
There are only bad people in this world

622
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,060
and not bad fathers!

623
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:29,820
You can say anything you want about him

624
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:31,370
but how can you accuse him

625
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:33,300
of harming Jinfeng?

626
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:35,130
I'm so angry.

627
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:36,660
Get lost!

628
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,090
No. Madam Fu, I...

629
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:39,730
The chess board is flipped.

630
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:41,060
Aren't you going to leave?

631
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:44,090
I'll go.

632
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:46,820
Stand there!

633
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:57,020
Listen well.

634
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:00,450
I'm the only one who can call him Scorpion Liu.

635
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:02,700
If someone else says that again,

636
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,370
I dare them to try it.

637
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,490
I'm leaving.

638
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:19,330
Yongfu.

639
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,420
Didn't you say you were working?

640
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,250
Is this your work?

641
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:29,900
Great.

642
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:33,020
You are always lying to me.

643
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:37,210
Turns out you are always
doing these kinds of things!

644
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:39,970
Yongfu, I was wrong.

645
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:41,370
I won't play chess anymore.

646
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:42,490
I'll throw the board away.

647
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:43,090
Yongfu!

648
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:44,610
Yongfu.

649
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:51,330
Your Majesty,

650
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:52,780
this drawing is so pretty.

651
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:54,730
Are you going to give it to your mother today?

652
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:55,420
Of course.

653
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,900
It's a birthday gift. What's the purpose

654
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,090
if I don't send it today?

655
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:00,730
His Majesty is here!

656
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:02,060
Yunzhang.

657
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:03,060
Sit down.

658
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,490
Why are you here?

659
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:07,250
Have a look. How are they?

660
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:08,610
What are all these?

661
00:26:08,699 --> 00:26:09,739
Gifts for your mother.

662
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:10,450
Shuan.

663
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,180
Coral from the Eastern Ocean.

664
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:16,090
Two necklaces made from
pearls of the Southern Sea.

665
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,490
Three brocade handkerchiefs
from the Western Mountains.

666
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:21,180
Four snow lotuses from the Northern region.

667
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:25,300
I've got everything from all directions.

668
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,020
Isn't it considerate?

669
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:27,330
You are so considerate.

670
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:28,180
That's great.

671
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,540
My mother must be very happy.

672
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:30,730
Find someone

673
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:32,130
to send this drawing over as well.

674
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:33,780
Why should I?

675
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:35,060
Let's send them ourselves.

676
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:35,780
Really?

677
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:37,330
You're going to leave the palace
and visit my mother with me?

678
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:39,210
It's just visiting your parent.

679
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:40,370
Why are you so shocked?

680
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:44,850
Your Majesties.

Why are you here?

683
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:47,850
For a birthday celebration.

684
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:48,580
Where's my mother?

685
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:49,580
Yes. A celebration.

686
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:50,450
What a coincidence.

687
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:51,490
I just finished the arrangements.

688
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:53,250
I was preparing to invite His Majesty

689
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,540
and you are already here.

690
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,060
So fake.

691
00:26:58,490 --> 00:26:59,300
What are these?

692
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,730
Gifts for my mother.

693
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:01,450
I'll accept them for her.

694
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:02,180
No.

695
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,490
I'll send them over myself.

696
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,180
I was thinking about

697
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:09,420
why you missed the assembly recently,
Grand Chancellor.

698
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,660
Turns out you have been
preparing a birthday banquet.

699
00:27:12,223 --> 00:27:13,490
You are so considerate, Grand Chancellor.

700
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:14,970
As long as you

701
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:17,850
don't mind me skipping the assembly,
Your Majesty.

702
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:18,450
It's fine.

703
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,130
Even if you won't attend the assembly again,

704
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:22,370
I'll still allow it.

705
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:25,180
You're overthinking, Your Majesty.

706
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:29,970
I heard you have a jade chess board
in your residence.

707
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:32,490
Why don't you play a game or two with me later?

708
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:33,420
Chess?

709
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:34,820
No.

710
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:35,780
I won't play.

711
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:36,660
I won't play anymore.

712
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:37,820
Enough talking. Let's go inside.

713
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:38,580
Go inside.

714
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:42,490
Mother!

715
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:46,300
Son-in-law!

716
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:48,850
Well...

717
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,660
I heard you've been
going to beauty shops recently.

718
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:53,540
You look very refreshed

719
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,820
and your skin is glistening.

720
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:56,250
Really?

721
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:56,970
Yes.

722
00:27:57,130 --> 00:27:58,970
You spent so much money
at beauty shops every day.

723
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:00,370
How can you not have glistening skin?

724
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,180
What are these?

725
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:11,970
These are gifts for you.

726
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:13,020
I hope you like them.

727
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:17,020
Did you prepare this for me?

728
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:18,090
I prepared this.

729
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:19,180
It's the same.

730
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:22,580
A drawing?

731
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:25,300
I love drawings.

732
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:26,900
We have the same taste indeed.

733
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:27,850
That's great.

734
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:28,820
How is it, Mother?

735
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:31,130
Not bad.

736
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:35,580
My son-in-law is really great.

737
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:41,060
Where's your gift for your father?

738
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,820
Why should I give him gifts?

739
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:45,940
Look at you.

740
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,250
Why are you so rude?

741
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,020
Since you gave me a gift,

742
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,250
you should also give your father one.

743
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,210
Baiyu's mother

744
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:53,610
always says

745
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,690
what your father gave me
has to be given to her as well.

746
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:58,090
What did she say it's called?

747
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,490
Treating everyone equally.

748
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:03,450
You should treat your father
and me equally as well.

749
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:06,130
Fine.

750
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:07,450
This one.

751
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:08,490
Do you want it?

752
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:09,900
Yes.

753
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:11,490
See?

754
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,660
Isn't it great
to celebrate our daughter's birthday?

755
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,020
We all get gifts.

756
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:15,900
Yes.

757
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:21,420
Today is your birthday?

758
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,370
Why isn't he here yet?

759
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:30,850
What time is it already?

760
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:32,420
Your Highness!

761
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:34,060
Your Highness!

762
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,970
How is it? Did you get that thing?

763
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:38,540
I got it.

764
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:41,900
As expected from my sister-in-law.

765
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:42,700
She's bold.

766
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:45,580
What did Empress Dowager say?

767
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:46,940
Her Majesty said

768
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:48,090
Your Highness can read this out.

769
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:49,250
Don't miss out on a single word.

770
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:51,940
Don't miss out on a single word?

771
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:56,130
Go back and tell Her Majesty.

772
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:57,540
If I miss out half a word,

773
00:29:57,730 --> 00:30:00,300
she can come here
and demolish the Astronomical Observatory.

774
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:01,730
Go.

775
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:15,420
Why didn't you tell me it's your birthday today?

776
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:16,660
Didn't I tell you that day?

777
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:18,610
I need to prepare a gift for my mother
for the birthday celebration.

778
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:19,490
Why do you have to

779
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:20,940
give your mother a gift on your birthday?

780
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:21,580
Shouldn't you

781
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:23,330
do that on your birthday?

782
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:25,450
Who told you that?

783
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:26,730
My mother.

784
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,580
She said she suffered on the day I was born.

785
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:29,780
It was painful and torturing.

786
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:30,610
So, birthdays

787
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:32,420
are a reminder for us to be grateful.

788
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:33,580
Isn't giving gifts

789
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:34,700
the best way to be grateful?

790
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:37,370
Am I wrong?

791
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:38,370
No.

792
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:39,210
You are right.

793
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:40,820

your mother is a special woman.

I know.

798
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:48,900
Everyone in the village said so.

799
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,210
Even my father said that.

800
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,850
Do you know there's another rule
for celebrating your birthday

801
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:53,940
in the palace?

802

What rule is there?

803
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,250
What kind of rules can you have for a birthday?

804
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:57,970
Of course.

805
00:30:58,090 --> 00:30:59,370
The rule is

Your Majesty, are you joking?

909
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:47,100
Of course, I am joking.

You're so humorous, Your Majesty.

What is it?

920

The place is full of flowers
and it's very pretty.

How tacky.

All the officials will be here to greet us.

The scene will be very impressive.

It's so noisy.

925

There will be Braised Meatballs.

926

That's not bad. I don't mind going.

927
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:29,340
That's enough.

928
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:31,140
Everyone must be tired.

929
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:32,450
Go back and make preparations.

930
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,010
Sorry.

931
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:36,180
I'm late.

932
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:37,340
Do all of you

933
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,860
forget about one more important segment?

934
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:58,660
What is this?

935
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:00,690
Don't ask.

936
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:05,180
I invented these divination cards.

937
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:06,450
Longyue Tower Cards.

938
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:09,930
Today, we'll do the usual.

939
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:11,380
It's the national ceremony today.

940
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:12,690
I'll give you two divinations.

941
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:14,930
Longyue.

942
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:16,420
It's late now.

943
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:17,060
Why don't you...

944
00:38:18,026 --> 00:38:18,706
Got it.

945
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:20,290
Let's do it quickly.

946
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:21,660
You first.

947
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:24,620
Fine.

948
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:29,180
I'm done. Let's go.

949
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:30,290
Wait.

950
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:31,860
I haven't explained it.

951
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:36,580
This means Palace Gates and Jade Crumbling.

952
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:38,290
What do you mean?

953
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:40,490
I don't understand what you say.

954
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:42,580
That means you should stay in the palace.

955
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:44,060
Don't go anywhere.

956
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:46,100
If you simply walk around,

957
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:49,340
your body might crumble.

958
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:51,660
Longyue.

959
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:54,690
Do you know why I will crumble?

960
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:59,010
I'll crumble because of your bad mouth.

961
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:00,180
Let's go.

962
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:02,970
Forget it if you don't believe me.

963
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:04,420
Mother. Take care.

964
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:05,620
Your Majesty.

965
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:06,820
Here. It's your turn.

966
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:17,970
Explain it, Uncle Longyue.

967
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:20,100
This is easy.

968
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:22,060
This is called Having Fish Every Year.

969
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:25,140
Sounds auspicious.

970
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:25,970
No.

971
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:28,340
The fish is not a real fish.

972
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:30,340
It's demonic possession.

973
