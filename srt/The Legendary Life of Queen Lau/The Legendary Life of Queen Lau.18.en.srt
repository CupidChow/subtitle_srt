170
00:08:09,119 --> 00:08:09,720
He doesn't like me.

171
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,600
He likes me.

172
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,279
He doesn't like me.

173
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:13,559
He likes me.

174
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,799
He doesn't like me.

175
00:08:14,799 --> 00:08:15,559
He likes me.

176
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,399
Another half day has passed.

177
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,440
I can't take it anymore.

178
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,959
Your Majesty.

179
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,040
Your Majesty.

180
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:23,880
He is here.

181
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,720
His Majesty is here?

182
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:26,279
Grand Chancellor is here.

183
00:08:26,799 --> 00:08:28,119
What is he doing here?

184
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,920
I'm here to see you.

185
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,000
Are you that kind?

186
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,760
My daughter has made me proud

187
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,519
by not getting the last place
in the examination.

188
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,279
Of course it's worth me coming to see you.

189
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,839
I see.

190
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,359
Father.

191
00:08:42,359 --> 00:08:43,440
Didn't you promise

192
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,559
to let my mother come to the palace to see me

193
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:46,239
if I don't come last in the examination?

194
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,679
I think I said it.

195
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,919
I got it.

196
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:55,159
My father never kept his word.

197
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:57,640
So, my mother won't be able to
enter the palace again this time, right?

198
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,159
Only your mother

199
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:03,159
and you know me best.

200
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,400
It's a waste of effort.

201
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,679
That's not necessarily true.

202
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,960
Your mother can't come here but you can go out.

203
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,239
After His Majesty takes over the reins,

204
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,679
I will ask the Empress Dowager to grant you
permission to return to hometown for a visit.

205
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:18,320
Okay?

206
00:09:19,599 --> 00:09:21,239
Can I go to Xianpa Village then?

207
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:22,840
Sure.

208
00:09:24,119 --> 00:09:24,760
(No.)

209
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:27,320
(If Yu Changya stops me
in the middle of nowhere,)

210
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:28,559
(I'll lose more than I gain.)

211
00:09:29,239 --> 00:09:30,200
I have a request.

212
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,280
Say it.

213
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,359
I want Xuan to go back with me.

214
00:09:35,599 --> 00:09:36,599
All right.

215
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,880
It's all negotiable anyway.

216
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:41,359
Father,

217
00:09:41,359 --> 00:09:42,559
I was just about to ask you.

218
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,479
Is Xuan very busy these days?

219
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,919
Of course.

220
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,039
Do you think it's that easy

221
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:51,080
to be a dignified emperor?

222
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,039
Before taking over the reins,

223
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,760
His Majesty has had to go
through more than you can imagine.

224
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:58,119
What does he have to go through?

225
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,559
First of all,

226
00:10:03,359 --> 00:10:04,320
being beaten.

227
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:08,239
(When an emperor takes over the reins,)

228
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:11,599
(he must immerse himself in clear water
for three days and three nights)

229
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,799
(to cleanse his body and purify his soul.)

230
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,119
Shuan.

231
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:18,280
Your Majesty.

232
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,640
It's been three days.

233
00:10:21,119 --> 00:10:22,599
Are you hungry?

234
00:10:23,599 --> 00:10:24,520
I'm not.

235
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:41,000
This second step is to be "green".

236
00:10:42,719 --> 00:10:43,960
This so-called green

237
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,359
is to clear the inner part of the body.

238
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,000
(Before taking over the reins,)

239
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,760
(an emperor needs to
go vegetarian for seven days)

240
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,320
(in order to be completely
green from head to toe,)

241
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,919
(inside and out.)

242
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,000
Your Majesty,

243
00:10:57,119 --> 00:10:58,000
please enjoy your meal.

244
00:10:59,239 --> 00:11:00,799
Are there any other colors?

245
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:01,919
Your Majesty,

246
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:04,359
your lucky color for these days is green.

247
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,919
This third and final step

248
00:11:12,119 --> 00:11:13,679
is to be touched.

249
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,919
(The imperial robe for the ceremony)

250
00:11:18,359 --> 00:11:21,000
(must fit His Majesty's body perfectly,)

251
00:11:21,119 --> 00:11:23,239
(not one inch wider, not one inch longer.)

252
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:24,679
(These measurements)

253
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:28,119
(are determined by the hands of the servants.)

254
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,359
The waist measurement is about 83 centimeters.

255
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,359
The shoulder width...

256
00:11:39,612 --> 00:11:40,559
The shoulder width is about 43 centimeters.

257
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,200
No wonder His Majesty is so busy.

258
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:46,119
All right, it's getting late.

259
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,119
I should leave now.

260
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,119
This is my reward

261
00:11:52,119 --> 00:11:53,559
for your achievement in the examination.

262
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,080
Give it to His Majesty when you have time.

263
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,880
Why should I give him the gift you gave me?

264
00:12:00,479 --> 00:12:02,880
I'm giving you a chance to see him.

265
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:05,479
You've poisoned the box, haven't you?

266
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,000
You underestimate me.

267
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,599
I told you it's a gift.

268
00:12:10,599 --> 00:12:10,960
Inside it...

269
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,000
All right, I got it.

270
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,679
I have given it to you.

271
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,799
Don't blame me for anything.

272
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:17,719
I know.

273
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,520
Your Majesty.

274
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,880
If there's nothing else,

275
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,119
I'll go and deliver the flower candles.

276
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,479
What flower candles?

277
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:32,119
Last time when the Empress Dowager used them,

278
00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:33,239
she liked them very much

279
00:12:33,239 --> 00:12:35,599
and sent all the leftover
flower petals and tea leaves

280
00:12:35,599 --> 00:12:37,239
to Xiangluo Hall

281
00:12:37,239 --> 00:12:38,359
for us to make into flower candles

282
00:12:38,359 --> 00:12:39,640
and then distribute them to other palaces,

283
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,000
which is both useful and cost-effective.

284
00:12:41,239 --> 00:12:42,919
The Empress Dowager complimented
Your Majesty repeatedly,

285
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:45,719
saying that you're a good and virtuous Queen.

286
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,640
All right.

287
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,119
So where are you sending it this time?

288
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,119
Western Warm Palace.

289
00:12:50,359 --> 00:12:51,960
It's where Miss Baiyu lives.

290
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,840
Baiyu?

291
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,440
I'll go with you.

292
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:58,799
Let's go.

293
00:12:59,359 --> 00:13:00,039
All right.

294
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,760
Miss Baiyu.

295
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,320
These are exclusive cotton rose
candles prepared by Her Majesty.

296
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,119
The Empress Dowager ordered that it
should be used in all palaces from now on.

297
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,640
Just leave them there.

298
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:23,880
Is it necessary for Your Majesty
to come in person

299
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:25,960
for something as trivial as delivering candles?

300
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,599
Sufang, you may leave now.

301
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,200
What do you want?

302
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,119
You're not going to mention something about
helping me with my comeback again, are you?

303
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,479
Liu Baiyu.

304
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,440
I'm here today to tell you

305
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,880
that you're completely out of favor with me.

306
00:13:47,479 --> 00:13:49,239
What do you mean I'm out of favor?

307
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,719
I am not your beloved consort.

308
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,159
I don't care.

309
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,520
You don't care about me,

310
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,640
but you care about Xuan, right?

311
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,200
Didn't you already know that?

312
00:13:58,359 --> 00:13:59,359
But you know what?

313
00:13:59,359 --> 00:14:01,039
You said you love him,

314
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:02,520
but your love almost ruined him.

315
00:14:05,119 --> 00:14:06,039
What about you?

316
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,840
You keep saying you don't love His Majesty,

317
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,359
so why are you so angry

318
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,679
when I've dragged him into this?

319
00:14:14,359 --> 00:14:16,359
Obviously, you have fallen for His Majesty.

320
00:14:20,599 --> 00:14:22,239
You also think I have fallen for His Majesty?

321
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:24,840
Is it that obvious?

322
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:28,200
No, I was just blurting that out.

323
00:14:28,359 --> 00:14:29,080
Don't you know

324
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,840
whether you love him or not?

325
00:14:32,599 --> 00:14:33,840
That's right.

326
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,640
Looks like I'll have to admit it this time.

327
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,359
Is this the power of old love?

328
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,640
Women are so fickle.

329
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,520
You're so bold in front of Father,

330
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,520
why are you so coy with me?

331
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,159
Yes.

332
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,799
I, Liu Jinfeng, am always bold.

333
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,679
When did I start becoming coy?

334
00:14:57,119 --> 00:14:58,440
It's just love.

335
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,000
I'll get up from wherever I fall.

336
00:15:01,719 --> 00:15:02,520
Liu Baiyu,

337
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,840
thank you.

338
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,000
You're so smart.

339
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,200
I...

340
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,280
This...

341
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:12,320
She's weird.

342
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:18,359
Do you have any questions, Your Majesty?

343
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,239
I don't think

344
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,159
it's necessary to show the real heirloom seal

345
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,159
to the officials tomorrow.

346
00:15:25,479 --> 00:15:26,239
I don't think

347
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,400
we need to go through all the formalities.

348
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,919
That's right.

349
00:15:30,239 --> 00:15:32,320
It's very ostentatious
to show up with the heirloom seal.

350
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,400
What if someone wants to steal it?

351
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:34,960
Your Majesty,

352
00:15:35,119 --> 00:15:37,080
why don't I go to the kitchen
and carve one from the radish?

353
00:15:37,359 --> 00:15:38,000
Don't worry.

354
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,320
I will use fresh radish,

355
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,280
not a spoiled one.

356
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:42,719
Your Majesty,

357
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,320
this can't be allowed.

358
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:46,760
These are ancestral rules.

359
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,960
Rules are meant to be broken.

360
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,440
That's right.

361
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,520
Your Majesty, this...

362
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,520
All right, you may leave now.

363
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:54,280
Yes.

364
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,359
Your Majesty,

365
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,039
Scorpion Liu is clearly playing tricks.

366
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:01,159
He just doesn't want you
to take over the reins.

367
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:01,640
Yes.

368
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,359
Of course.

369
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,719
He must be playing tricks.

370
00:16:03,719 --> 00:16:05,359
The issue is how to solve this problem.

371
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,719
In my opinion,

372
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,679
it is best to carve one from a radish.

373
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,840
It's best? My foot!

374
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,119
You think Liu Xie is a fool?

375
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:14,919
(It's been so many days
since the gift was sent,)

376
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,840
(but I haven't heard a word back.)

377
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,679
(Doesn't she have any interest in me?)

378
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,080
Sufang, go and check it out again.

379
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:25,239
Your Majesty.

380
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,640
The lights in Xuanchen Hall

381
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,200
have been out for four hours.

382
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:28,960
Are you sure?

383
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,919
I've sent several groups of people to check it.

384
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:36,039
Your Majesty, let's not wait anymore.

385
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:38,039
His Majesty should not be coming today.

386
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,479
How heartless.

387
00:16:39,719 --> 00:16:41,760
It's been a few days
since the announcement of the result,

388
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,039
he hasn't even said thank you.

389
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,640
His Majesty is busy

390
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,599
and he may come tomorrow after the ceremony.

391
00:16:47,599 --> 00:16:50,440
Do you think I'll wait til he's in power?

392
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,479
Duan Yunzhang.

393
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:54,400
Don't think that just because I like you,

394
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,880
I can wait for you forever.

395
00:16:56,119 --> 00:16:57,400
You don't even know who I am.

396
00:16:57,719 --> 00:16:59,000
Your Majesty, calm down.

397
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,119
Don't be impulsive.

398
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:01,760
Just wait for one more day.

399
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,880
I can't wait any longer.

400
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,520
I can't wait for another day.

401
00:17:05,239 --> 00:17:06,400
If he doesn't come to me,

402
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,359
I can go to him.

403
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,559
I've made up my mind.

404
00:17:11,719 --> 00:17:13,000
I will take the initiative

405
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,119
and win his heart

406
00:17:15,479 --> 00:17:16,640
in the most

407
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,719
crucial moment of his life.

408
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:18,920
Sufang,

409
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,040
go and get the stationery.

410
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:21,520
All right.

411
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:28,719
How is it, Sufang?

412
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,199
Your drawing is too good, Your Majesty.

413
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:33,800
I'll find a box to put it in for you.

414
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,560
Okay.

415
00:17:43,199 --> 00:17:44,319
Sufang, I got a box.

416
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:45,680
I'll use this which is from my father.

417
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:53,820
[Warm Palace]

418
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:03,319
My daughter,

419
00:18:03,479 --> 00:18:04,400
you've been

420
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,400
really sloppy this time.

421
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,239
Did Father say anything?

422
00:18:09,079 --> 00:18:11,079
Your father didn't say a word.

423
00:18:11,239 --> 00:18:12,160
You know?

424
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:13,119
Father...

425
00:18:13,719 --> 00:18:15,640
Father won't abandon me, will he?

426
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:19,280
My dear, you must understand

427
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,680
that we are living

428
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,439
off others now.

429
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:24,800
If your father doesn't side with us,

430
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,280
we'll really be nothing.

431
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,959
I know.

432
00:18:30,479 --> 00:18:32,280
I didn't think it through this time.

433
00:18:33,439 --> 00:18:34,280
All right.

434
00:18:34,439 --> 00:18:35,839
Don't feel too bad.

435
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,959
I'll go back

436
00:18:37,959 --> 00:18:39,479
and plead with your father again.

437
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,479
What are you doing?

438
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,359
I...

439
00:19:03,719 --> 00:19:04,560
I was passing by

440
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:06,479
and stopped by for a visit.

441
00:19:07,439 --> 00:19:08,560
Stopped by for a visit?

442
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,280
You are here to make fun of me, aren't you?

443
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,160
No.

444
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,239
I really came to see you.

445
00:19:14,959 --> 00:19:16,119
I didn't expect that

446
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,479
to happen last time.

447
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,719
Prince Yunchong,

448
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,640
what else is there to say
after all that has happened?

449
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,400
I didn't think there was anything
to say either.

450
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,520
But after seeing you like that,

451
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,800
I think I need to

452
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,800
explain to you

453
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:31,560
so you don't feel so bad.

454
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:34,760
All right.

455
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,439
Go ahead.

456
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,560
Why did I ask you to turn yourself in?

457
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,280
It's for your own good.

458
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,359
Look.

459
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:43,800
You're a nice girl with bad intentions

460
00:19:43,959 --> 00:19:44,880
and bad ideas.

461
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:46,439
You have a beautiful appearance

462
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,439
but a bad heart.

463
00:19:47,439 --> 00:19:48,359
That's not good.

467
00:19:52,239 --> 00:19:53,479
from the cliff of doom.

468
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,520
Do you know what I mean?

469
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,880
So Your Highness, you think

470
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,719
you're right?

471
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,439
Yes, I do.

472
00:20:01,439 --> 00:20:03,199
You're wrong. You're very wrong.

473

Your Highness, you're not only wrong,

474
00:20:04,719 --> 00:20:05,959
but you're also terribly wrong.

475

It's wrong to be ill-educated,

it's wrong to be nosy,

477

479

Am I wrong?

481
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,280
Am I wrong?

482
00:20:33,479 --> 00:20:35,000
Duan Yunchong, just you wait.

483
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,199
Let's see how I write you in a way
that will make everyone loathe you.

[The Search for Love]

485
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,280
Am I wrong?

486
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,239
What did I do wrong?

487
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:12,959
Your Highness,

488
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,959
what do I know about such things?

489
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,199
I'm not talking about this.

490

I know even less about women.

493
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,920
It was obvious that she framed Yunzhang.

494

Why do I always feel like
I did something wrong?

495
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,040
What's wrong exactly?

When a man becomes successful,

his desire to control increases

to ward off misfortune.

always sing this song?

a woman can do to get a man's heart

756

is brainwashing.

757
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:21,180
You need to make him feel
that whatever you say or do

758

is right.

759

that in order to win a man's heart,

763
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:31,820
you must first satisfy his appetite.

Hurry up.

776
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,340
Take away all the dangerous stuff.

Your Majesty.

780
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,140
I have a favor to ask you.

781
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,260
How may I help you?

782
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:06,140
Teach me how to cook.

783
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:08,260
I'll make you anything you want to eat.

784
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,380
I want to cook for His Majesty.

785
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:10,260
That's easy.

786
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,660
I'll make it and send it to you

787
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:13,300
and you can send it to His Majesty.

788
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:15,900
I must cook for Xuan myself.

789
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,580
Think twice, Your Majesty.

790
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:18,580
I didn't just think twice,

791
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:19,580
I already thought four to five times.

792
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:20,500
It's decided.

793
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,300
Let's start now.

794
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:30,460
Your Majesty,

795
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:33,060
Official Chai would like to invite you
to the Imperial Kitchen for lunch.

796
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:34,700
What's going on?

797
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:37,180
Don't they usually bring the lunch over?

798
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:39,620
Perhaps Official Chai
would like to surprise you.

799
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:43,180
All right. Let's go then.

800
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:53,820
Isn't it just the same?

801
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:54,940
No.

802
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:56,180
I am the chef this time.

803
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:57,980
You?

804
00:36:58,340 --> 00:36:59,700
Yes, I cooked them all.

805
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:03,460
Why do these look like Chai's cooking?

806
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:04,500
I swear,

807
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,420
I'll be struck by lightning
if these are Chai's cooking.

808
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:07,900
You don't have to take such a serious oath.

809
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,380
Try it now.

810
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:10,860
All right.

811
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:13,700
You cooked it?

812
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:18,700
How is it?

813
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:19,700
Not bad.

814
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:20,980
I didn't expect you to have improved so much

815
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:22,140
in your cooking skills in the last few days.

816
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:30,180
I think your current cooking skills

817
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:31,180
are better

818
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:32,420
than Chai.

819
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:34,060
Do you want to

820
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:35,420
try my cooking every day?

821
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:37,340
That depends on whether you're willing
to cook for me every day.

822
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,500
Of course I'm willing.

823
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,180
Come on.

824
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:40,180
Try this.

825
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:43,940
Who is that?

826
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,140
Come out.

827
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:47,580
It's me.

828
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:55,220
What's wrong?

829
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:57,900
I can't stand it anymore, Your Majesty.

830
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:00,060
None of these were made by Her Majesty.

831
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:05,180
Your Majesty,

832
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:07,100
aren't you afraid of being struck by lightning?

833
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:08,700
I'm not.

834
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,180
It's not your cooking anyway.

835
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:10,700
I...

836
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:15,340
Your Majesty.

837
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:27,540
Shuan.

838
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:30,860
Shuan.

839
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:33,620
Your Majesty.

840
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:36,060
Your Majesty, what's wrong?

841
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:42,980
I would like to have grilled fish,
roast chicken and prawns.

842
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:46,180
What about calling Her Majesty over?

843
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:47,700
Will it be too late?

844
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:48,460
No.

845
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:49,900
Will there be too much trouble?

846
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:50,700
No.

847
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:52,460
What if Her Majesty comes

848
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:54,580
and asks why I want to eat?

849
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:56,460
Your Majesty, didn't you say

850
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:57,620
that your word is the decree?

851
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:58,180
We can only do it,

852
00:38:58,180 --> 00:38:59,100
we can't ask why.

853
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:01,420
When did I ever say such a thing?

854
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:03,180
Your Majesty, do you still want to eat?

855
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,300
No, forget it.

856
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:06,140
I'm not hungry.

857
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:06,540
This...

858
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:08,140
Why don't you want to eat, Your Majesty?

859
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,900
My word is the decree.

860
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,900
You just do it, don't ask questions.

861
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:14,300
Go to sleep.

862
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,020
Go to sleep.

863
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,700
Something doesn't feel right.

864
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:37,100
I also feel that something is not right.

865
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:39,980
Why didn't he react at all?

866
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:42,500
Maybe this is the right move.

867
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,100
Keep going and you'll see the results.

868
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:47,580
Keep going?

869
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:49,860
My mother's right.

870
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:51,980
You really have to work hard on this.

871
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,180
You can't hesitate

872
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:54,500
and it will work out in the end.

873
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:56,340
Work hard?

874
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:00,380
