25
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,080
You know me well.

26
00:01:48,639 --> 00:01:49,839
I won't be drinking the liquor.

the more I must remain clear-headed.

However, I'll change my strategy

from tomorrow onward.

31

What do Your Majesty plan to do?

32
00:02:01,199 --> 00:02:02,040
Think about it.

33
00:02:02,279 --> 00:02:04,239
Liu Xie went to the extreme

34
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:05,440
to plant Liu Jinfeng next to me.

35

Do you think he did that just to humiliate me?

36
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,119
I'm going to look into Liu Jinfeng

Your Majesty,

45
00:02:38,559 --> 00:02:40,000
my name is Sufang.

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'll be attending to you from now on.

47

Sufang?

48
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,199
Let me help you up, Your Majesty.

49
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,160
You're not that young to be calling me that.

50
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,759
I addressed you as "Your Majesty".

51
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,360
In the palace,

52
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,440
we address women here respectfully

53
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,679
as long as they're our masters.

54
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,919
For instance, the Empress Dowager,

55
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:57,039
the consort dowager,

56
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:58,720
and you're the Queen, Your Majesty.

57
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:00,160
I'm not used to it.

58
00:03:00,399 --> 00:03:00,960
But it's all right.

59
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,720
One should follow the custom of the place.

60
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,720
You can address me as it is.

61
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,479
Sufang,

62
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,000
have you seen Xuan?

63
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,279
Xuan?

64
00:03:08,399 --> 00:03:10,080
Do you mean His Majesty?

65
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,960
He's already waiting for you in the side hall.

66
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,520
After you've washed up and dressed up,

67
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,080
you'll pay your respect
to the Empress Dowager with him.

68
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:18,119
So His Majesty is Xuan?

69
00:03:18,119 --> 00:03:19,479
Is that how you address him here too?

70
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,639
Your Majesty, you're very clever.

71
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:24,839
So is the Empress Dowager

72
00:03:24,839 --> 00:03:26,199
Xuan's adoptive mother?

73
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,600
I deserved to be punished.

74
00:03:28,679 --> 00:03:29,360
I deserved to be punished.

75
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:29,839
What are...

76
00:03:29,839 --> 00:03:30,839
What are you doing?

77
00:03:30,839 --> 00:03:31,919
Why are you suddenly on your knees?

78
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:33,960
The empress dowager
treats His Majesty as her own son.

79
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,800
I must not utter nonsense.

80
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:37,600
I was only asking.

81
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,360
You don't have to tell me.

82
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,160
-Get up.
-Your Majesty, I...

83
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,320
Just get up.

84

Thank you, Your Majesty.

85
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:45,080
When you said to dress up,

86
00:03:45,279 --> 00:03:46,720
did you mean changing my clothes?

87
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,759
Yes, Your Majesty.

88
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:49,960
The empress dowager
and His Majesty are already waiting.

89
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,399
It's only changing my clothes.

90
00:03:51,399 --> 00:03:52,320
It won't take very long.

91
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:52,880
Let's get changed now.

92
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:56,520
Help Her Majesty dress up.

93
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,720

168
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,600
that the Grand Chancellor has two daughters?

169
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,200
I didn't know Liu Xie before that.

170
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:20,279
Since I was a child,

171
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:22,040
my mother has never
mentioned much about my father.

172
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,679
I only met him the night before yesterday.

173
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,160
Where did you live before this?

174
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,640
Xianpa Village.

175
00:06:29,239 --> 00:06:30,519
Didn't you already know?

176
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,959
Ah, yes.

177
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:32,799
Xianpa Village.

178
00:06:32,799 --> 00:06:33,760
Xianpa Village indeed.

179
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,559
(How dare you shove your illegitimate daughter)

180
00:06:36,559 --> 00:06:38,480
(from the countryside to me?)

181
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,959
(No wonder she behaves vulgarly.)

182
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,679
Your palace is too stingy.

183
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:44,160
Look at this.

184
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:45,640
See how small this bun is?

185
00:06:45,799 --> 00:06:47,160
It won't fill one's stomach at all.

186
00:06:47,679 --> 00:06:48,959
No wonder you're so thin.

187
00:06:49,799 --> 00:06:50,679
Rest assured.

188
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,040
With me around,

189
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,279
you'll fill your stomach.

190
00:06:53,559 --> 00:06:54,440
Eat this.

191
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,640
Your Majesty,

192
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,399
this...

193
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:57,559
His Majesty's meals are specially prepared

194
00:06:57,559 --> 00:06:59,000
by Imperial Chef Chai.

195
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,600
You're not following the rules like this.

196
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,799
Lad.

197
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,799
Why is a young person
like you keep talking about rules?

198
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:04,519
Xuan, ignore him.

199
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:05,019
Just eat it.

200
00:07:07,679 --> 00:07:09,040
I'll help myself.

201
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:17,559
Ivory chopsticks.

202
00:07:18,119 --> 00:07:20,160
It's the same as what you mentioned in your letter.

203
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,119
Biluochun tea.

204
00:07:30,359 --> 00:07:32,480
In your letter, you said
you have to drink this every day.

205
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,519
I got the right one for you, right?

206
00:07:41,679 --> 00:07:42,600
In your letter,

207
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,559
you said you must eat osmanthus cake every day.

208
00:07:44,799 --> 00:07:46,040
Don't you get tired of it?

209
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:52,920
It seems you know a lot about me.

210
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,119
Of course!

211
00:07:54,119 --> 00:07:55,559
We've been writing to each other
for five years now.

212
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:56,959
We were already soulmates.

213
00:07:57,119 --> 00:07:58,040
(Five years?)

214
00:07:58,799 --> 00:08:00,720
(What has this Scorpion Liu done?)

215
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,359
Jinfeng, are you done eating?

216
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,920
If you are, we should make a move now.

217
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,480
Are we leaving already?

218
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,480
Your Majesty,

219
00:08:07,799 --> 00:08:08,760
we should go along too.

220
00:08:09,119 --> 00:08:09,679
Come on.

221
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:12,279
We'll be late.

222
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,480
Hey, wait for a moment.

223
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,600
It's burning hot in the Imperial Palace.

224
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,320
Smart boy,

225
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,399
remember to cover Xuan with the umbrella.

226
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:22,279
Don't let Xuan walk under the sun.

227
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:27,200
I don't wish to use the umbrella today.

228
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:27,799
But Your Majesty...

229
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,840
He's shy even when he's an adult.

230
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,799
He's so adorable.

231
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:34,559
I like it.

232
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,760
Xuan, wait for me!

233
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,159
I didn't expect

234
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,679
everything would go so smoothly.

235
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:44,520
In just a day,

236
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,799
Zhang has become

237
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,039
a full-grown man.

238
00:08:48,239 --> 00:08:49,799
Look how excited you are.

239
00:08:51,119 --> 00:08:52,559
You're making

240
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:55,280
me itching

241
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,039
to find a consort

242
00:08:58,239 --> 00:08:59,520
for Chong.

243
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:01,679
I always heard so much

244
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:03,640
about how outstanding

245
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:05,200
the Grand Chancellor's daughter, Liu Baiyu is.

246
00:09:05,479 --> 00:09:07,159
I can't wait

247
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,799
to see what she looks like.

248
00:09:09,239 --> 00:09:11,440
I'm curious too.

249
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,239
But don't you think

250
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,919
the Queen is rather late?

251
00:09:16,239 --> 00:09:18,039
Even if she's the Grand Chancellor's daughter,

252
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:19,200
she belongs to the imperial family

253
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,159
after she's married to the Emperor

254
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,280
despite her previous status.

255
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,000
She shouldn't take you lightly.

256
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:27,799
Being late is a good thing.

257
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:28,559
How so?

258
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:30,479
If they're late,

259
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:34,960
it means my medicinal liquor is effective.

260
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,799
Medicinal liquor?

261
00:09:39,719 --> 00:09:41,200
You're wise indeed.

262
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,919
Enough.

263
00:09:46,359 --> 00:09:47,000
I, Yunchong.

264
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:47,719
And I, Yunyan.

265
00:09:47,719 --> 00:09:49,640
[Princess Duan Yunyan]
We are here to greet Your Majesty and Mother.

266
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,799
Why brings you two here?

267
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:54,280
Yunchong is curious about the new Queen.

268
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,679
He wanted to come himself.

269
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:57,000
But he was embarrassed.

270
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,479
So he insisted on dragging me along.

271
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,200
I never said that.

272
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,479
It was you who wanted to come.

273
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,200
Come here, Yunyan.

274
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:03,960
Come and sit beside me.

275
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:08,880
The Emperor and the Queen will be here soon.

276
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,479
Your Majesty,

277
00:10:10,479 --> 00:10:11,919
I will not accept

278
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:13,440
the new Queen

279
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:15,000
if she's not compatible with Yunzhang

280
00:10:15,119 --> 00:10:16,159
and beautiful as they say.

281
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,760
Don't be ridiculous.

282
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,239
Rest assured.

283
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,719
The Queen has a good reputation.

284
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:25,039
She will not disappoint us.

285
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:28,520
Your Majesty,

286
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,960
Liu Baiyu requests an audience.

287
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:32,039
Insolence!

288
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,359
You can't address the Queen by her name.

289
00:10:34,719 --> 00:10:37,119
Lead the Emperor and the Queen here now.

290
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,559
She doesn't seem to be the Queen.

291
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,799
Not the Queen?

292
00:10:42,239 --> 00:10:43,559
What nonsense is this?

293
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,799
Your Majesty,

294
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,280
that woman calls herself Liu Baiyu.

295
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,840
She also comes with the Grand Chancellor's badge.

296
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:03,080
I, Baiyu, am here to pay my respects
to Your Majesty and Your Highness.

297
00:11:03,239 --> 00:11:05,239
May Your Majesty and Your Highness be blessed
with happiness and peace.

298
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:07,799
You

299
00:11:09,119 --> 00:11:11,000
are Prime Minister Liu's daughter, Baiyu?

300
00:11:11,359 --> 00:11:13,400
It was Father who sent me into the palace

301
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,359
to pay respects to you, Your Majesty.

302
00:11:16,479 --> 00:11:17,479
If you're Baiyu,

303
00:11:18,599 --> 00:11:19,359
then who's...

304
00:11:20,239 --> 00:11:21,359
Who's the Queen?

305
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,559
Who's she?

306
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:24,679
The Emperor and the Queen have arrived.

307
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:34,599
I'm here to pay my respects
to Mother and Consort Dowager.

308
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,919
Greetings, Your Majesty and Your Highness.

309
00:11:53,359 --> 00:11:54,080
Zhang,

310
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:56,640
who is she?

311
00:11:58,599 --> 00:11:59,440
Mother,

312
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,799
she's the Queen I've taken in,

313
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,200
Liu Jinfeng.

314
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,080
Jinfeng?

315
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,840
Wasn't it supposed to be Baiyu?

316
00:12:11,479 --> 00:12:13,239
Why did

317
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,520
-she suddenly...
-Baiyu?

318
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,679
I will not accept this.

319
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:18,679
No, I won't.

320
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:19,760
I'll never accept her as the Queen.

321
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,960
Calm down, Your Majesty.

322
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,119
Don't be agitated.

323
00:12:23,719 --> 00:12:24,400
Your Majesty,

324
00:12:24,719 --> 00:12:26,119
explain this quickly.

325
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,400
What's going on here?

326
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,640
As you can see,

327
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,919
Prime Minister Liu
insisted on having Liu Jinfeng

328
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:33,760
as my wife

329
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,320
instead of Baiyu.

330
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,679
Everyone had mistaken, that's all.

331
00:12:38,479 --> 00:12:39,760
What misunderstanding?

332
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:42,880
Could it be that Baiyu is betrothed to you too?

333
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,039
It has always been you

334
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:47,080
who was betrothed to His Majesty.

335
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,280
I came to the palace

336
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,159
under Father's instruction

337
00:12:50,239 --> 00:12:51,320
to see if you're well.

338
00:12:52,599 --> 00:12:53,440
Also,

339
00:12:54,599 --> 00:12:55,760
Father said

340
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,400
he'll seek justice for you

341
00:12:57,599 --> 00:12:59,719
if you have a hard time.

342
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,280
I suppose

343
00:13:09,119 --> 00:13:10,000
your father

344
00:13:11,239 --> 00:13:12,719
is right about everything.

345
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:15,679
I didn't know what got into me.

346
00:13:16,719 --> 00:13:17,919
I guess my memory is deteriorating

347
00:13:18,239 --> 00:13:19,880
as I age.

348
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,320
Guards!

349
00:13:24,599 --> 00:13:27,440
I'm rewarding the Queen
with one hundred pieces of jewelry,

350
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,760
one hundred title deeds,

351
00:13:29,119 --> 00:13:30,479
and ten thousand gold taels.

352
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,640
That's too much.

353
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,599
Shut up.

354
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,479
Zhang,

355
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,239
you're still young.

356
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:38,640
You must learn from the Grand Chancellor.

357
00:13:39,359 --> 00:13:41,440
Stop learning all those strange things.

358
00:13:42,919 --> 00:13:44,200
I shall heed your advice.

359
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,000
Your Majesty,

360
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,000
it's already lonesome

361
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,440
for Xuan to stay in such a huge house.

362
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,719
As his adoptive mother,
don't criticize him all the time.

363
00:13:51,719 --> 00:13:53,280
You should care more about him.

364
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,159
With me around,

365
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:54,880
I'll protect you.

366
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,640
Insolence!

367
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,679
Mother,

368
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:00,359
she doesn't know the palace rules
as it's her first time here.

369
00:14:00,359 --> 00:14:01,479
I hope you don't take it to heart.

370
00:14:03,599 --> 00:14:05,320
It's all right.

371
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:07,840
She can take her time.

372
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:12,000
Didn't you say that in the letter yourself?

373
00:14:12,119 --> 00:14:14,280
Why are you denying it now?

374
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,719
Mother,

375
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,000
I have some state affairs to take care of.

376
00:14:20,119 --> 00:14:21,119
I shall take my leave first.

377
00:14:21,599 --> 00:14:22,599
-He did write that to me.
-Jinfeng, you're leaving too.

378
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,719
Aren't we going to stay longer to chat?

379
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:30,640
Your Majesty!

380
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:34,640
Here.

381
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,479
-Have some water.
-Are you all right, Your Majesty?

382
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,479
Have some water.

383
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:37,320
Here, Your Majesty.

384
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,320
-Have some water.
-Drink this.

385
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,159
Calm down.

386
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:45,320
Xuan,

387
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,679
I thought you said
you're not going to use the umbrella.

388
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:48,400
I changed my mind.

389
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,320
He's so adorable.

390
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,559
Did you see that, Sufang?

391
00:14:52,119 --> 00:14:52,719
Sufang,

392
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,520
send the Queen to Xiangluo Hall.

393
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:54,960
Yes, Your Majesty.

394
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,460
Wait!

395
00:14:55,599 --> 00:14:56,679
I have something to ask you.

396
00:14:56,919 --> 00:14:58,640
Didn't you say you were lonely in your letter?

397
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,760
Why did you deny it?

398
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:01,159
I was gravely ill back then,

399
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:02,159
which led to some confusion.

400
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:03,039
I don't remember anything now.

401
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:03,640
Just go back.

402
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:06,919
Poor soul.

403
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,280
I didn't even know.

404
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,479
Liu Xie didn't tell me either.

405
00:15:10,719 --> 00:15:11,679
You don't have to worry this time.

406
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:12,880
With me around,

407
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,679
you'll definitely remember.

408
00:15:15,479 --> 00:15:17,200
Liu Xie is unbelievable.

409
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,200
He's mean and unreliable.

410
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,559
I must go and scold him.

411
00:15:26,239 --> 00:15:27,880
How do you plan to scold him?

412
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,479
My mother told me

413
00:15:31,479 --> 00:15:32,799
she never mentioned Liu Xie

414
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:33,880
because she was afraid I might feel inferior

415
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,320
after knowing how mean my father is.

416
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,840
When I met him several days ago,

417
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,520
he was so...

418
00:15:39,719 --> 00:15:40,679
How should I put this?

419
00:15:41,239 --> 00:15:42,280
He's very mean.

420
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:45,520
I didn't know the Grand Chancellor was that mean.

421
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,960
So tell me how unreliable he is.

422
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,239
Think about it.

423
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:50,679
He arranged our betrothals
since we were children.

424
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:51,919
Yet he never let us meet.

425
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:53,320
When I met him several days ago,

426
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:53,799
he didn't tell me

427
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:55,599
about you losing your memories
because you were ill.

428
00:15:55,599 --> 00:15:56,640
Yet he told me you're the Emperor

429
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,760
and asked me if I dare to marry you.

430
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,960
Doesn't this tell you
that he didn't get the point?

431
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,520
I never cared who you are.

432
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,239
That's how unreliable he is.

433
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,000
What is she talking about?

434
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,840
Xuan,

435
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,159
it's the first time I've seen you smile.

436
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:12,159
You look so handsome.

437
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,520
What are you doing?

438
00:16:19,599 --> 00:16:20,840
Didn't you say you wanted

439
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,080
to kiss me on the face in your letter?

440
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:25,620
Oh, you don't remember.

441
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,660
But it's all right.
I'm giving you the permission now.

442
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,900

Let's put him aside for now.

that I couldn't even get to know you.

496

Now that we know each other,

497

All right. It's a deal.

499

00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:09,620
Oh, no.

503
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:10,460
Thank you, Your Majesty.

504
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,980
I mean, thank you, Jinfeng.

505
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,700
I don't need all these.

506
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,180
As the Queen,

507
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,980
you need these

508
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,140
to manage your household and servants.

509
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,500
You'll need to spend a lot
on many things at the palace.

510
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,700
So they are not all for me?

511
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:25,940
Do I have to use them to manage the servants?

512
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,500
Being the Queen sure is a difficult task.

513
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:30,500
It certainly is.

514
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:32,860
His Majesty is managing the empire.

515
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:33,900
As the Queen,

516
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,180
you should share his burden.

517
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,300
How do I do that?

518
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:42,500
First of all, you must be generous
and behave appropriately.

519
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,220
You have to manage the Imperial Harem well too.

520
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,500
Apart from these, you have to be a motherly model.

521
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,500
Someone who's not fixated on love

522
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,300
and set an example to all women in the empire.

523
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,340
Not fixated with love?

524
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,860
A motherly model?

525
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:04,620
Have some tea

526
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:05,420
to quench your thirst, Your Majesty.

527
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,060
I don't want any.

528
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,300
Take these away now.

529
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,300
Take them away.

530
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,300
How about some fruit?

531
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:13,620
It's really fresh.

532
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,180
I have no appetite.

533
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,740
Just take everything away.

534
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,540
Take them away.

535
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:21,860
If you ask me...

536
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,460
If you ask me,

537
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,740
the damage is already done.

538
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:31,700
So don't be so troubled about it.

539
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:32,780
You're right.

540
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,580
When I think

541
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,180
about Zhang's unparalleled
extraordinary appearance, character,

542
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,220
and amazing talents,

543
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,900
how did he marry such a vulgar

544
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,540
and not befitting Queen?

545
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,620
It's my fault.

546
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,220
I have no power to go up
against the Grand Chancellor.

547
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,460
When my time comes,

548
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:51,580
I'd be too ashamed to face the late Emperor.

549
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,300
Don't be too sad.

550
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,340
I have an idea.

551
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,940
If you look at Liu Baiyu,

552
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,300
she's dignified, decent, and beautiful.

553
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,620
She's indeed a rare beauty.

554
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,100
If nothing had gone wrong,

555
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:10,780
she and Zhang would have been a match.

556
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,060
My point exactly.

557
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:15,500
How can I not know that?

558
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,900
If Liu Baiyu was a little vulgar

559
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,180
or clumsy,

560
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,740
I wouldn't feel so regretful now.

561
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:23,620
I know.

562
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,500
I was saying

563
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,860
that we find an excuse

564
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,740
for Liu Baiyu to stay in the palace.

565
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,700
In the long run,

566
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,980
if Zhang likes her,

567
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,860
he can take her in as a consort.

568
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,980
She's also the Grand Chancellor's daughter.

569
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:42,020
I suppose the Grand Chancellor
wouldn't say much about it.

570
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:45,140
That's right.

571
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,100
That's great.

572
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,700
This is a good idea.

573
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:50,460
It's settled then.

574
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,700
Do you feel relieved now?

575
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:53,540
Yes.

576
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:54,980
Yes, I do.

577
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:58,940
Your Majesty,

578
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,780
Sufang informed us

579
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,620
that the Queen met Liu Baiyu.

580
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:03,700
What did they say?

581
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,260
Nothing much.

582
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,220
They just talked about family matters.

583
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,940
Tell Sufang to continue watching.

584
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,420
If the Queen made any slight movement,

585
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:11,300
report to me right away.

586
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,140
Yes, Your Majesty.

587
00:21:31,352 --> 00:21:34,825
[Xuanchen Hall]

588
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:46,500
Your Majesty,

589
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,220
look...

590
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,740
(Are you giving yourself away this quick?)

591
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,220
It's too obvious.

592
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,140
I should put this on the bed.

593
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,460
It's better to put it here.

594
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:20,340
When Xuan gets ready to sleep,
he'll be able to notice it right away.

595
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,060
What are you doing?

596
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:25,900
Nothing.

597
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:28,300
So are you missing me?

598
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,340
Just a little.

599
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:35,540
(Wait.)

600
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:36,300
(Baiyu said)

601
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,740
(I must not be fixated on love.)

602
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,500
(I must be a motherly model)

603
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,020
(for the women in the empire.)

604
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:41,660
No.

605
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:42,580
I don't miss you at all.

606
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,900
I was passing by. Farewell.

607
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:48,340
Shuan,

608
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,420
pass my order.

609
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:52,100
Do not let the Queen enter Xuanchen Hall at will.

610
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:53,100
Yes, Your Majesty.

611
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,660
"For Xuan,

612
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,020
work hard on regaining your memories

613
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:30,660
while I work on becoming a good Queen."

614
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,140
What exactly is she up to?

615
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,100
Your Majesty,

616
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,580
why did you suddenly want

617
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:41,860
to explore the Imperial Palace today?

618
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:43,820
Other than not being fixated on love,

619
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:44,980
Baiyu also said

620
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:46,020
I must manage the Imperial Harem properly

621
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,180
as the Queen.

622
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:48,780
So I'll just look around

623
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:49,820
so it'll be convenient for me to manage it.

624
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:53,380
I don't feel comfortable in these clothes.

625
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,020
-I'll just take them off.
-Your Majesty,

626
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:54,900
you must never take them off.

627
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,220
It's not a proper behavior of a Queen.

628
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:57,340
Behavior of a Queen?

629
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:58,500
What do you mean?

630
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:01,380
It's not something proper.

631
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:03,860
I see.

632
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,500
Then I'll lift the bottom of the dress.

633
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,060
Your Majesty,

634
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,940
that's not proper either.

635
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:09,300
This too?

636
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:11,580
But it's hard to walk in this dress.

637
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:12,700
Your Majesty,

638
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:13,900
see how

639
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,820
I take small steps when I walk?

640
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:17,740
Like this.

641
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:19,780
You'll get used to it as you walk.

642
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,020
If I walk the way you do,

643
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,900
it'll take three days
to explore the Imperial Palace.

644
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:24,940
How about this?

645
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:25,740
We'll do what I say today.

646
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:26,620
Tomorrow, we'll do what you say.

647
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:27,420
Let's go.

648
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,420
Your Majesty,

649
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,300
wait for me!

650
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,260
Your Majesty, not too fast!

651
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:33,820
Wait for me!

652
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,300
Your Majesty!

653
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:45,740
I, Chai Tiezhou,

654
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:48,100
will make several delicious dishes

655
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:50,220
to comfort His Majesty.

656
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:53,060
The Queen has arrived!

657
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:54,300
This place is huge.

658
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,020
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

659
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:57,820
It's all right.

660
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:59,220
Get back to work.

661
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,100
Your Majesty.

662
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,260
Cook,

663
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:02,420
what are you making?

664
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:03,780
I saw you carving flowers over there.

665
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,820
Cook?

666
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:06,540
His Majesty

667
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,220
personally bestowed me

668
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:11,340
as the Golden Cleaver
Imperial Chef Chai Tiezhou.

669
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,580
Oh, Chai Tiezhou.

670
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,220
Tie?

671
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:16,780
You must be Tie!

672
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:18,620
Xuan mentioned you in his letters.

673
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:20,100
He said you cook for him.

674
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:20,740
Really?

675
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:21,420
Yes.

676
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:22,500
What else did he say about me?

677
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,820
He said your cooking was delicious.

678
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,620
It's just that it distressed him

679
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:26,860
when you made some creative dishes

680
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:27,740
with strange taste

681
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:28,460
when you were ahead of yourself.

682
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,980
Did I distress him?

683
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:33,460
Did he not like my creative dishes?

684
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,140
Not at all.

685
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:36,140
Just sometimes.

686
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:38,100
He found several dishes delicious.

687
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,580
I made so many dishes for him.

688
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:41,820
Yet he only found several dishes delicious...

689
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,060
Oh, no.

690
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,100
Please don't cry.

691
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,500
How about I tell you Xuan's favorite dishes?

692
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,420
And you make them for him?

693
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:49,900
Stir-fried cured ham.

694
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:51,300
I don't know how to make that.

695
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,660
Yes, stir fry cured ham is a lot of work.

696
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:56,100
How about native dishes?

697
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:57,540
I never heard of those.

698
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:58,860
Not this either.

699
00:25:58,860 --> 00:25:59,780
How about Stewed Bacon with Tofu and Turnip?

700
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:01,100
I don't know that either.

701

It's all right.

702

We'll do something simple, then.

703
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:04,820
Fish mint salad.

704
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:07,380
What is that?

705
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:09,700
I've never heard of it before.

706
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:10,220
I...

707
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:12,300
I don't even know how
to make these dishes as a chef.

708
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:14,180
I should just die.

709

-Please don't cry.
-What's that smell?

710
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:17,660
There's no need to go that far.

711
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:19,620
It's burning!

712
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:20,780
A fire broke out!

713

714
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:22,620

that you can't put out a fire with water
when the wok is on fire?

724
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,140
I didn't know that.

What do you think, Your Majesty?

731
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:58,300
I hope this martial arts drill
doesn't disappoint you.

732
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,340
Wonderful.

733
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,660
It's too wonderful.

734

I never expect someone as thin as Xuan

735
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,660
to have such strong imperial bodyguards.

736
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,780
I no longer have to worry
when I have you protecting him.

737
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:08,060
Of course.

738
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,980
It's our duty to protect His Majesty.

739

Your Majesty,

748
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:33,620
Prince Yunchong especially designed that.

749
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:34,740
It's called Return Flying Disc.

750
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,500
It can strengthen our soldiers' arms

751

and eyes.

752
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:38,740

Oh, no.

I'm so sorry.

I'm sorry. I'll get going first.

760
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:24,940
I won't be in your way now.

761

I'm sorry.

this is the essential oil extractor
invented by me.

Rest assured, Your Majesty.
