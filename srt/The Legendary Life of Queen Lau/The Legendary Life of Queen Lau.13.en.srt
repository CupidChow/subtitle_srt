00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,000
with a graceful movement.

169
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,920
Why can't I learn it?

170
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,600
Would it kill you if you didn't talk?

171
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:17,959
Yes, I'd die of boredom.

172
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,359
Go ahead then.

173
00:08:19,359 --> 00:08:21,000
Anyway, you're not worth much more

174
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,239
than being His Majesty's henchman.

175
00:08:23,679 --> 00:08:24,320
Is that so?

176
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,279
If it weren't for me,

177
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:28,480
someone would have been
flayed alive by her admirer today.

178
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,359
But that person

179
00:08:30,359 --> 00:08:31,799
hasn't said thank you so far.

180
00:08:32,079 --> 00:08:34,760
No wonder my brother
doesn't care about her at all.

181
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:37,720
Do you think I can't tell?

182
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,720
You deliberately embarrassed me

183
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,200
in front of His Majesty before

184
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:41,239
and you dragged me away afterward

185
00:08:41,239 --> 00:08:43,160
to keep me away from His Majesty.

186
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,519
That's not true.

187
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,200
What's that for, then?

188
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,040
Because you're worried about me?

189
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,519
I'm worried about you?

190
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:50,559
Impossible.

191
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:51,799
You're right.

192
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,640
As long as I, Duan Yunchong, am here,

193
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,320
you won't get a step closer to my brother.

194
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:55,959
You...

195
00:09:00,119 --> 00:09:00,880
Where are you going?

196
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,760
Are you sending the prize money to the sickhouse?

197
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,920
None of your business. Don't follow me.

198
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,400
If you keep following, I'll break your legs.

199
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,200
I am under orders.

200
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,000
My injury will be a work-related injury.

201
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,599
Do I have to be afraid of you?

202
00:09:14,599 --> 00:09:15,400
I'll keep following you.

203

204
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,479
You've performed well today.

205
00:09:18,479 --> 00:09:19,479
Just so-so.

206
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:21,799
Your Highness,

207
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,880
what's wrong with you?

208
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,640
What's wrong with your foot?

209
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,320
I just fell down by accident.

210
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,080
Are you okay?

211
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,960
I'm fine.

212
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,039
That looks pretty serious.

213
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:28,679
I'm really fine.

214
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:29,159
You sure?

215
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:30,039
Yes.

216
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,840
What happened?

217
00:09:34,119 --> 00:09:35,440
Nothing, I fell down by accident.

218
00:09:35,599 --> 00:09:36,119
It's okay.

219
00:09:36,119 --> 00:09:37,440
I'll make soup for him when I get back.

220

Why hasn't Her Majesty come yet?

221
00:09:40,359 --> 00:09:41,679
She's not lost, is she?

222
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,799
Her Majesty is here.

223

Why are you late?

226
00:10:02,119 --> 00:10:03,599
Didn't you tell me to do good deeds?

227
00:10:03,599 --> 00:10:04,760
I carried a bag of rice for someone

228
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,159
and walked ten streets to get back.

229
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:14,520
All right, it's getting late.

230
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,119
Let's go back.

231

Your Majesty, you're back.

Did you have a good time today?

233
00:10:31,119 --> 00:10:32,280
Get me something to eat first

234
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,159
and we'll talk afterward.

235
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,119
All right.

did you get anything out of your trip

241

with His Majesty today?

242

I'm full.

Did you get it done?

253

Don't worry, sir.

254
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,359
Just now, I personally sent
Yu Changya to the palace.

255
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:50,919
Very good.

That's great.

I'll take it as a dog bite.

00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:41,799
-Be careful.
-It seems...

337
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:43,559
It seems to be the case.

338
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:44,799
It's thanks to His Majesty

339
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,960
that he found a great physician

340
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,400
to wake you up.

341
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,919
Why do I feel a little pain
in my stomach if I choked?

342
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:51,840
Stomach pain?

343
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:53,840
Well...

344
00:16:58,039 --> 00:16:59,880
Your Majesty, are you all right?

345
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,239
I'm fine now, Baiyu.

346
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:02,479
That's good then.

347
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,919
I have something to tell you.

348
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:05,880
Go ahead.

349
00:17:08,239 --> 00:17:09,520
From today onward,

350
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,679
I will court His Majesty on my own

351
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,280
without your help.

352
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,359
But why, Baiyu?

353
00:17:16,719 --> 00:17:18,119
Do you think I didn't plan well enough?

354
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:19,359
It's okay, I have another plan.

355
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:19,919
No.

356
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:20,599
I...

357
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:23,159
I have heard what His Majesty

358
00:17:23,159 --> 00:17:24,280
said to you this morning.

359
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,119
He told you not to match us up again.

360
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,559
It's obvious that your plan
is not only ineffective

361
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:31,880
but has been exposed.

362
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,119
Baiyu,

363
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:34,239
give me another chance.

364
00:17:34,239 --> 00:17:34,799
Next time...

365
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:35,320
No.

366
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:36,200
Well...

367
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:41,000
I came to tell you

368
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:44,160
that I'm splitting up with you.

369
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:45,239
Your Majesty,

370
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,479
please have a good rest.

371
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:49,680
I shall take my leave now.

372
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,520
No. Baiyu.

373
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,560
Who do you think

374
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,079
leaked this out?

375
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:02,680
Your Majesty.

376
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,959
Miss Baiyu

377
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:05,160
is so ungrateful.

378
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,719
Don't worry about her.

379
00:18:06,959 --> 00:18:08,280
Your health is more important.

380
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,439
I'll ask the great physician
to check on you later.

381
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:11,920
Great physician?

382
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:17,040
Yu Changya?

383
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,119
I...

384
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:20,839
I removed

385
00:18:21,439 --> 00:18:23,920
the piece of apple that Her Majesty had choked on

386
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,359
with one punch.

387
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:26,959
You're so capable.

388
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,199
Greetings, Your Majesty.

389
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,199
Yu Changya.

390
00:18:38,439 --> 00:18:39,760
It's really you.

391
00:18:43,439 --> 00:18:44,400
You guys shall leave first.

392
00:18:48,479 --> 00:18:50,040
Why are you in the palace?

393
00:18:50,439 --> 00:18:51,640
You saved me just now, didn't you?

394
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,959
Look at this outfit.

395
00:18:53,959 --> 00:18:54,920
You have become an imperial physician.

396
00:18:57,239 --> 00:18:59,199
It's a long story about
how I ended up in the palace.

397
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,719
First, let's talk about you and Xuan.

398
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:03,560
I've heard from others
that you two have a tense relationship.

399
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,400
That's not just tense.

400
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,319
That's incompatible.

401
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,199
You know that Xuan is the Emperor?

402
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,599
I just asked around.

403
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,880
You're the Queen now, aren't you?

404
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,119
I guessed it.

405
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:21,000
You wouldn't guess
that my years of correspondence

406
00:19:21,199 --> 00:19:23,520
with Xuan were a sham.

407
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,760
The person I corresponded with
was not Xuan at all.

408
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,160
Why aren't you surprised?

409
00:19:30,239 --> 00:19:31,079
I'm surprised.

410
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:32,239
I'm so surprised.

411
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,760
Is there such a thing?

412
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:34,920
That's ridiculous.

413
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,920
Exactly!

414
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,319
So, it wasn't Xuan I fell in love with

415
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:38,719
all these years

416
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,680
but the fake Xuan who corresponded with me.

417
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:44,000
You don't like him?

418
00:19:45,439 --> 00:19:46,079
I mean His Majesty.

419
00:19:47,239 --> 00:19:49,239
His Majesty is nothing like

420
00:19:49,239 --> 00:19:50,760
the Xuan who wrote the letters.

421
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,199
Have you ever wondered

422
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:57,479
who the real Xuan was

423
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,719
who wrote to you?

424
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,160
Who else could it be?

425
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,760
Liu Xie found a random person to write it.

426
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,520
It can't be Liu Xie himself, can it?

427
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,520
It's me.

428
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,640
What?

429
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,839
It was me. I mean I wrote the letter.

430
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,839
Don't joke about it.

431
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:15,239
It's not like I can't recognize your handwriting.

432
00:20:16,959 --> 00:20:17,920
I wrote it with my left hand.

433
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Don't joke about it.

434
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
It's not funny at all.

435
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:24,520
I'm very serious.

436
00:20:24,719 --> 00:20:25,959
I always took your father's instructions

437
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:26,880
and wrote a letter

438
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,520
while I was at the stage station to get the goods

439
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,439
and sent it to you as if it was from

440
00:20:30,439 --> 00:20:31,199
Xuan.

441
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,520
Didn't you ask me to send

442
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,760
all your letters to Xuan

443
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,760
to the stage station?

444
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,920
I gave them to your father directly.

445
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,920
So

446
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,760
you've read all the letters I've written to Xuan?

447
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,719
What's the problem with that?

448
00:20:44,719 --> 00:20:46,880
I even grabbed and read them
while you were writing.

449
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,239
That's different.

450
00:20:48,439 --> 00:20:50,000
So, what's the difference?

451
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,880
I taught you how to write
whatever you don't know how to write.

452
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,520
You thought I didn't know

453
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,239
what you were writing in your letter?

454
00:20:53,239 --> 00:20:54,439
In your letters, you and your Xuan...

455
00:20:54,439 --> 00:20:56,079
Stop it, stop it. It's so annoying.

456
00:20:56,359 --> 00:20:57,239
How could you do that?

457
00:20:57,239 --> 00:20:57,680
No, no.

458
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,239
How can you work with Liu Xie?

459
00:20:59,239 --> 00:21:01,000
How could you do such a thing?

460
00:21:01,479 --> 00:21:02,959
Why? I had fun.

461
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,319
You had fun?

462
00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:06,400
How dare you have fun by fooling me?

463
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,959
You even had fun?

464
00:21:07,959 --> 00:21:08,640
Did you already know

465
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,599
that Liu Xie's my father?

466
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,439
Yes, I did.

467
00:21:11,719 --> 00:21:12,719
Madam Fu knew about it too.

468
00:21:12,959 --> 00:21:14,040
We didn't hide it from you.

469
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,119
It's you who wouldn't believe us.

470
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,920
The point is wrong,

471
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,319
the point is you lied to me.

472
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,760
Your point is wrong.

473
00:21:20,959 --> 00:21:22,239
The point now

474
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:24,359
is that the person
who wrote to you, the one you like,

475
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:25,520
that Xuan

476
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,000
is none other than

477
00:21:27,239 --> 00:21:28,680
me.

478
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,880
I wrote those letters

479
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,920
very seriously.

480
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,680
My foot!

481
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:34,719
I like you? My foot!

482
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:36,599
I was so wrong about you.

483
00:21:36,719 --> 00:21:38,160
You and Xuan are both bad people.

484
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,839
I even consider you a friend.

485
00:21:40,199 --> 00:21:41,199
Let's cut off our friendship.

486
00:21:41,719 --> 00:21:42,640
Jinfeng.

487
00:21:43,239 --> 00:21:44,119
All right.

488
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,599
I admit that I didn't think this through.

489
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:47,400
I apologize.

490
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,119
I'm sorry.

491
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,520
Yu Changya.

492
00:21:52,239 --> 00:21:53,000
Something is wrong.

493
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,719
Something is wrong with you.

494
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,439
What's wrong with me?

495
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:56,319
Something is so wrong with you.

496
00:21:57,239 --> 00:21:59,000
Tell me, why are you here at the palace?

497
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,599
I...

498
00:22:01,719 --> 00:22:02,880
I came to the palace...

499
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:04,520
I came to the palace because...

500
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:08,760
I couldn't find another girl
who would make me so satisfied

501
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,000
that I would like to swap faces.

502
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:14,760
I just can't forget this face of yours.

503
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,400
Yu Changya, don't even think about it.

504
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,640
You can't have my face!

505
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,199
Go away.

506
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:21,400
It's so annoying.

507
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,319
Your Majesty.

508
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:42,119
Sufang has reported

509
00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:43,319
that the Queen is awake

510
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:44,640
and should be fine.

511
00:22:44,719 --> 00:22:45,880
Who is the Queen?

512
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:47,760
Is there such a person in the palace?

513
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,680
I am not acquainted with her,

514
00:22:50,239 --> 00:22:51,239
let alone know her.

515
00:22:51,719 --> 00:22:53,199
What did you say, Your Majesty?

516
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,400
The imperial examination is around the corner.

517
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,520
I can't have anything else in my heart.

518
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,199
Don't mention anything
not related to the examination

519
00:23:01,199 --> 00:23:02,199
in the future.

520
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,359
You may leave now.

521
00:23:04,239 --> 00:23:04,920
Yes.

522
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,920
It's peach blossom season.

523
00:23:23,719 --> 00:23:24,719
It's so beautiful.

524
00:23:25,439 --> 00:23:26,959
Your Majesty, why are you
eating cherry tomatoes here

525
00:23:26,959 --> 00:23:28,719
instead of appreciating the flowers?

526
00:23:29,959 --> 00:23:31,920
Who is in the mood for flowers

527
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,160
like you?

528
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,760
Did you get Yu Changya in?

529
00:23:36,239 --> 00:23:37,359
Why do you blame me

530
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:38,760
for your love affairs?

531
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,640
What love affairs?

532
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,640
Don't talk nonsense.

533
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,359
You think I'm living
a comfortable life in the palace

534
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:43,599
and you have to give me some trouble.

535
00:23:44,239 --> 00:23:45,119
What's wrong?

536
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,880
You are now the Queen.

537
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:49,239
You can't even handle an imperial physician?

538
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,319
I can handle him even if I'm not the Queen.

539
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,520
Tell me, why did you come to see me?

540
00:23:54,959 --> 00:23:55,760
Your mother

541
00:23:56,239 --> 00:23:57,640
has been chattering in my ear all day

542
00:23:58,319 --> 00:23:59,520
that she misses you

543
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:00,920
and is afraid you will suffer in the palace

544
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:02,160
and asked me to come and see you.

545
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:05,000
I met the Empress Dowager just now,

546
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:07,239
so I mentioned it to her in passing

547
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,079
and she gave her consent.

548
00:24:09,199 --> 00:24:11,479
She agreed to let your mother come to
the palace to meet you for a little while.

549
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,239
Really?

550
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:13,359
Can Mother really come?

551
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:15,640
When did I ever lie to you?

552
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,520
(You're Liu Xie indeed.)

553
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,880
(You are so good at telling lies outrageously.)

554
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,520
(Like father, like daughter.)

555
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:23,640
(Telling lies, right?)

556
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,959
(I'm not afraid at all.)

557
00:24:26,439 --> 00:24:27,079
Yes.

558
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:28,640
When did you ever lie to me?

559
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:30,160
When will my mother come?

560
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,359
Today? Tomorrow?

561
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:32,719
Don't rush it.

562
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,119
She can definitely come,

563
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:37,319
but there is one little request.

564
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,760
You won't let me leave the palace

565
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,760
and you want me to go to the Imperial Academy.

566
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,000
What else do you want?

567
00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:44,239
Do you know about the examination
at the Imperial Academy?

568
00:24:49,479 --> 00:24:50,560
His Majesty has not bothered

569
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,040
to make fun of the Queen lately.

570
00:24:52,239 --> 00:24:54,079
It does seem to be a serious matter.

571
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:55,640
I've asked around.

572
00:24:56,239 --> 00:24:58,119
The Chief Examining Officer
for this examination

573
00:24:58,119 --> 00:24:59,680
is Minister Wang of Rites.

574
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,040
Minister Wang is an alcoholic.

575
00:25:02,439 --> 00:25:03,319
I've sent someone to get a top-quality,

576
00:25:03,319 --> 00:25:05,640
thousand-year-old liquor from abroad.

577
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,359
It's a guaranteed hit

578
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,520
to bribe the old man.

579
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:11,680
What is it?

580
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,400
Don't be silly.

581
00:25:12,959 --> 00:25:15,079
Do you know to whom Minister Wang's daughter

582
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:15,920
was married?

583
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,400
Who?

584
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,160
I know.

585
00:25:17,479 --> 00:25:19,000
Bai Mao, Commander of the Jingji Battalion.

586
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,479
Bai Mao

587
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,920
is the nephew of Liu Xie's cousin's aunt.

588
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,160
And Minister Wang's daughter is pregnant.

589
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:30,280
Will he let His Majesty pass the exam?

590
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,680
It's not that much trouble.

591
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,760
When the questions are out,
I'll take some of my brothers

592
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,959
into the secret chamber of the examination hall
and get the questions out, and that's it!

593
00:25:36,199 --> 00:25:37,359
Isn't that stealing?

594
00:25:37,959 --> 00:25:39,160
Don't be silly.

595
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:40,719
The empire belongs to His Majesty,

596
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,520
and if His Majesty takes a piece
of paper from it, is that stealing?

597
00:25:45,319 --> 00:25:46,800
Yeah, it makes sense.

598
00:25:49,239 --> 00:25:51,000
What makes sense? What's the reasoning?

599
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:51,839
Tell me.

600
00:25:52,479 --> 00:25:53,119
Your Majesty.

601
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,680
It's just an examination.

602
00:25:57,319 --> 00:25:58,920
Do you need to be so serious?

603
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,520
Who would really dare to test His Majesty?

604
00:26:01,439 --> 00:26:02,800
The Late Emperor, obviously.

605
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,760
The Late Emperor decreed

606
00:26:05,239 --> 00:26:07,839
that His Majesty must sit for
the imperial examination at the Imperial Academy

607
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,040
and rank first before he could
rule the country by himself.

608
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:11,119
What?

609
00:26:11,439 --> 00:26:13,280
The Emperor must also rank first place?

610
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,680
This is too high a threshold.

611
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:16,920
The Late Emperor's decree

612
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,760
can't be questioned.

613
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:19,239
All right.

614
00:26:19,239 --> 00:26:20,000
Then, tell me,

615
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,520
what does this examination have to do with me?

616
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,599
You have to sit this examination too.

617
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,160
Me? Sit the examination?

618
00:26:26,839 --> 00:26:28,160
Don't tell me I have to
pass the examination and rank first

619
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,400
before I can meet my mother?

620
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,280
Can you even do it?

621
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:32,959
Of course not.

622
00:26:34,239 --> 00:26:35,560
I won't ask you to rank first.

623
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,800
So, what should I get?

624
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,439
Just don't get last place.

625
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,359
That's it?

626
00:26:41,239 --> 00:26:42,280
You're pretty confident.

627
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,119
I just have to come second to last, right?

628
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:47,000
It's just all of us
from the Imperial Academy, right?

629
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,160
Yes,

630
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,959
plus Yu Changya.

631
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:51,920
Plus him?

632
00:26:52,439 --> 00:26:54,400
He's a lot better than us.

633
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,119
We are no match for him.

634
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,359
There's something wrong.

635
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:02,800
You're looking cunning.

636
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,160
Are you trying

637
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,199
to pick on someone again?

638
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,439
Who do you mean?

639
00:27:09,239 --> 00:27:10,079
I don't care.

640
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:10,920
However,

641
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,520
I don't want to get involved in any of this mess.

642
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,680
I won't join this time.

643
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,160
But your mother

644
00:27:17,439 --> 00:27:18,959
misses you so much that she's lost weight.

645
00:27:23,319 --> 00:27:25,479
You're so uncreative and so boring.

646
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,880
Second to last, right?

647
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,439
All right.

648
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,760
Don't you dare break your promise again.

649
00:27:38,439 --> 00:27:39,880
These peach blossoms are in full bloom.

650
00:27:42,199 --> 00:27:44,280
This is the initial plan.

651
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,359
Don't even think about it.

652
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,920
A great achievement

653
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:48,079
cannot be fooled with.

654
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,520
(Persuade His Majesty now.)

655
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,800
(There is nothing to worry about
if we have the test questions in hand.)

656
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,680
(I'm not good at persuasion.)

657
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,040
(You first.)

658
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,520
(Do unto others
as you would have them do unto you.)

659
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,719
(Stop looking at me.)

660
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,800
(Useless.)

661
00:28:07,479 --> 00:28:08,000
Your Majesty.

662
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,280
I didn't think it through enough.

663
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:20,760
Your Majesty.

664
00:28:23,239 --> 00:28:24,920
I didn't think well enough

665
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,400
to help you.

666
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,400
Yunzhang.

667
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:41,359
It is true that there is no precedent

668
00:28:41,719 --> 00:28:42,680
for an emperor

669
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,280
to take part in the imperial examination
since ancient times.

670
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,959
But was Father's decree

671
00:28:46,359 --> 00:28:48,680
intended to test you?

672
00:28:48,951 --> 00:28:49,839
That's right.

673
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,199
You're right.

674
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,079
Throughout history,

675
00:28:53,079 --> 00:28:55,319
no emperor has ever taken part
in the imperial examination.

676
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,800
But the fact that Father wanted
me to accomplish this feat

677
00:28:58,927 --> 00:29:00,000
means that Father

678
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:03,439
wanted me to be the greatest emperor of all time.

679
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:08,640
Is that what it means?

680
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,599
Yunchong,

681
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,239
you are so sensible.

682
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:15,400
I must not fail the Late Emperor's wish.

683
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,319
Do you think so?

684
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,719
Yes.

685
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,599
It's a good intention.

686
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,479
Your Majesty,

687
00:29:52,199 --> 00:29:53,560
what are you doing?

688
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,760
Developing a strategy.

689
00:29:56,079 --> 00:29:57,359
What strategy?

690
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,000
Have you ever been to the wild woods?

691
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,000
You must listen carefully then.

692
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,439
When I was a kid, I often went to the wild woods.

693
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,719
There were black bears in there.

694
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,640
Black bears?

695
00:30:11,439 --> 00:30:13,000
One time, when I was picking wild fruits

696
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,040
in the mountains with my neighbor,
Magu, we came across a black bear.

697
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,959
Guess what?

698
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,719
You fought 300 rounds with the black bear?

699
00:30:20,239 --> 00:30:21,439
I immediately took a pair of straw shoes

700
00:30:21,439 --> 00:30:23,119
out of my back basket and put them on.

701
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:24,479
Why did you put on shoes?

702
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,239
Magu asked the same question as you.

703
00:30:26,239 --> 00:30:27,920
She said, "Why are you wearing shoes?

704
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,680
Can you outrun a black bear with shoes on?"

705
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,400
I told her in a very calm way.

706
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:31,920
"No.

707
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,239
I don't need to outrun the black bear.

708
00:30:33,239 --> 00:30:34,920
I just need to outrun you."

709
00:30:35,479 --> 00:30:39,119
So Magu was eaten by the black bear?

710
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:40,479
Is that the point?

711
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:43,000
The point is I don't need to come first

712
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,319
in this examination.

713
00:30:44,479 --> 00:30:47,160
I just need to not come last.

714
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,439
So I'm figuring out

715
00:30:48,719 --> 00:30:50,839
who's likely to come in last.

716
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,560
You think it is Prince Yunchong?

717
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,199
I'm hesitant too.

718
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:59,400
Who do you think is more useless,
Chai Tiezhou or Yunchong?

719
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:00,880
Neither of them.

720
00:31:01,239 --> 00:31:02,640
You know who will come last? Who?

721
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:04,920
I wouldn't dare to tell you.

722
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,800
I'd be beheaded if I told you.

723
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,959
Stop talking about beheading.

724
00:31:07,959 --> 00:31:09,560
This is Xiangluo Hall, not a food market.

725
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,239
Moreover,

726
00:31:10,239 --> 00:31:11,280
am I the kind of person who would behead someone?

727
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:11,959
Just tell me.

728
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:16,839
I should have guessed that.

729
00:31:17,719 --> 00:31:19,439
He's so well built that I'm confused.

730
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,479
No, no.

731
00:31:20,479 --> 00:31:22,119
He won't even sit the examination.

732
00:31:22,719 --> 00:31:23,400
It's...

733
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,760
His Majesty?

734

How could His Majesty come last?

735
00:31:31,719 --> 00:31:32,920
It's Yunzhang indeed.

736

Sister-in-law,

737

do you want to hear
the most popular gossip in the capital?

738
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,199
When Yunzhang was ten years old...

739
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,680
I should say

740
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,599
your brother was quite handsome
when he was ten years old.

Sister-in-law, do you still
want to hear the story?

Go ahead.

743
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:01,160
When he was ten years old,

744
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,839
he was copying Qu Yuan's Li Sao in the Imperial Study,
(*a Chinese poem from the anthology Chuci)

745
00:32:05,479 --> 00:32:06,760
but at that moment,

746
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:08,880
he had a cramping pain in his stomach.

747
00:32:10,599 --> 00:32:11,680
Logically,

748
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,640
he could have put down
his pen and gone to relieve himself.

749
00:32:14,479 --> 00:32:15,439
What does it mean?

750
00:32:16,719 --> 00:32:17,680
It means to go to the toilet.

751
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,760
It's all about taking a dump.
What's with relieving himself?

752
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,880
Sister-in-law, do you still want to hear the story?

753
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,640
Go ahead.

754
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:25,319
But according to his usual serious attitude,

755
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:26,719
he would never leave the desk

756
00:32:26,719 --> 00:32:28,560
until he had finished the last sentence.

757
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,000
Finally, he finished his copy.

758
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:35,520
But at that very moment,

759
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,000
suddenly...

760
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,160
Sister-in-law, stop laughing.

761
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,599
I can't. It's too funny.

762
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:58,599
How did he grow up to be so good at pretending?

763
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:00,839
And then?

764
00:33:00,839 --> 00:33:02,760
And then he got dumb

765
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,520
because of his poop, or whatever that was?

766
00:33:05,959 --> 00:33:06,800
No.

767
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:09,000
Because he had offended
God of Culture and Literature,

He is...

773
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,319
He is funnier than Niubao in my village.

774
