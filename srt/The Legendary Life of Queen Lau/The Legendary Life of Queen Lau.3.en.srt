00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,720
-You mustn't touch it!
-It's so dirty!

169
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,559
It's filled with dirt!

170
00:06:42,799 --> 00:06:43,359
Let go of me!

171
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:48,959
We're done for.

172
00:06:49,119 --> 00:06:49,839
We're done for!

173
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:51,519
Your Majesty, are you all right?

174
00:06:51,679 --> 00:06:52,239
I'm fine.

175
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,160
Where is Uncle Longyue going?

176
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:55,519
I don't know.

177
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:57,600
His Highness is acting strange today.

178
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,359
Did the bell just ring?

179
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:08,480
Why does it sound different from the usual bell?

180
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,640
I think I've never heard it before.

181
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,399
I don't know.

182
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:10,920
I...

183
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,000
I remember now.

184
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:14,920
That sound...

185
00:07:15,239 --> 00:07:17,399
I heard it 50 years ago.

186
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,040
It's the Earthquake Bell!

187
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,600
-The Earthquake Bell!
-The Earthquake Bell?

188
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,679
What is the Earthquake Bell?

189
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,600
That means an earthquake is coming!

190
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,799
An earthquake is coming?

191
00:07:24,799 --> 00:07:26,079
Run!

192
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,279
Run!

193
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,559
Hurry!

194
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,679
What's the matter?

195
00:07:30,679 --> 00:07:31,559
Why are you guys panicking?

196
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:32,679
Your Highness, this is bad!

197
00:07:32,679 --> 00:07:34,079
The Earthquake Bell was rung!
An earthquake is coming!

198
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:34,920
An earthquake?

199
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,279
Are you serious?

200
00:07:36,559 --> 00:07:37,640
Yes!

201
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:38,799
All right.

202
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,119
Don't panic for now.

203
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:41,160
The bells from the Astronomical Observatory

204
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,720
can only be heard around this area.

205
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,839
You guys should head to other palaces,

206
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:45,959
notify them of the earthquake,

207
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:46,799
and evacuate together.

208
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,559
Go now.

209
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,200
Let's go!

210
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,160
My friends in the palace,

211
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,279
please don't panic.

212
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:01,000
Don't panic.

213
00:08:01,239 --> 00:08:02,279
The Earthquake Bell

214
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:03,239
was just rung by accident.

215
00:08:03,239 --> 00:08:04,160
It was an accident.

216
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:14,559
This is bad.

217
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,559
Baiyu,

218
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,959
the more I look at you, the more I like you.

219
00:08:19,119 --> 00:08:20,440
If you're willing,

220
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,160
why don't you

221
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,839
move into the palace?

222
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:25,160
That's right.

223
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,519
We don't have many women
in the palace in the first place.

224
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,839
It's livelier when you're here.

225
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:30,480
Are you sure about that?

226
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,119
The only things that the palace
doesn't lack right now are women.

227
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:33,880
You...

228
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,119
Why am I wrong in everything

229
00:08:35,119 --> 00:08:36,200
while you're right in them?

230
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,239
What did I say?

231
00:08:37,239 --> 00:08:38,000
I said nothing...

232
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,200
Will you stop?

233
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,239
Enough.

234
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,520
Why are you guys arguing again?

235
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,080
You guys are embarrassing yourselves.

236
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,359
Your Majesty,

237
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,239
regarding moving into the palace,

238
00:08:47,239 --> 00:08:49,440
I can only decide
after I have asked my father about it.

239
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,119
Right.

240
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,280
Yes.

241
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,640
I was being muddle-headed.

242
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,880
You're right.

243
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,080
Baiyu, you're so sensible.

244
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,599
Your Majesty! Mother!

245
00:08:58,599 --> 00:08:59,559
This is bad!

246
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:00,400
Your Majesty! Mother!

247
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,640
Chong, why are you panicking?

248
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,559
An earthquake is coming!

249
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:05,080
Let's evacuate to Yufang Garden!

250
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,080
An earthquake?

251
00:09:07,119 --> 00:09:08,159
Are you sure about that?

252
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:08,760
Yes.

253
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,760
The Earthquake Bell was rung.

254
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:11,599
This is bad.

255
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:12,960
Longyue has never been wrong

256
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,919
in his weather forecast.

257
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:14,880
Seems like it's true.

258
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,039
Where's His Majesty?

259
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:17,640
Does His Majesty know about this?

260
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,280
That's right.

261
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:19,719
I have to find Yunzhang right now.

262
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:20,640
Chong!

263
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:22,039
We have so many servants here.

264
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:23,159
You don't need to join them.

265
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,479
Are you dumb?

266
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:25,239
Mother,

267
00:09:25,239 --> 00:09:26,159
what are you saying?

268
00:09:26,239 --> 00:09:27,799
I'm both his younger brother and loyal subject.

269
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,799
How could I

270
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:30,440
leave Yunzhang alone at this critical moment?

271
00:09:30,599 --> 00:09:31,919
You guys should leave first. Forget about me.

272
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:33,280
Let's go!

273
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,159
-Be careful!
-Mother!

274
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:34,799
Let's go!

275
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:35,679
Let's go!

276
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:36,119
Hurry!

277
00:09:36,119 --> 00:09:36,719
Where should we go?

278
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:37,440
You can do it!

279
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,000
Your Majesty, you can do it!

280
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,479
Nice!

281
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,119
You can do it!

282
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:46,559
You can do it!

283
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:48,919
Amazing!

284
00:09:49,599 --> 00:09:50,440
His Majesty won!

285
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,679
Your Majesty is amazing!

286
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:53,400
Beat him up!

287
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,880
Your Majesty, you can do it!

288
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,520
You can do it!

289
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,400
Your Majesty, you can do it!

290
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,159
Nice!

291
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,719
-Watch out!
-Beat him up!

292
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,440
Amazing!

293
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,280
Your Majesty!

294
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:06,960
Nice!

295
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:10,320
Again.

296
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,119
I can't feel my legs.

297
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,280
It took 400 steps to ascend

298
00:10:14,479 --> 00:10:15,799
and descend the Astronomical Observatory.

299
00:10:16,119 --> 00:10:17,760
Your queen here is so exhausted.

300
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:20,479
What are you laughing at?

301
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:21,559
Your Majesty, this is my first time

302
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:23,159
hearing you referring to yourself as the Queen.

303
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,640
I wanted to say "this frigging lady",

304
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,799
but I was afraid it might sound uncivilized.

305
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:28,119
That's why I'm borrowing your terms.

306
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,159
Your Majesty,

307
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,440
we should head back and rest

308
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,200
if you're exhausted.

309
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:34,200
That's a good idea.

310
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,679
Your Majesty, you can do it!

311
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:38,520
(This is bad.)

312
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:40,359
Did someone shout "Your Majesty" just now?

313
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,440
Is that so?

314
00:10:41,719 --> 00:10:43,880
I heard nothing.

315
00:10:44,119 --> 00:10:45,640
Your Majesty, I'm sure you were mistaken.

316
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,799
Let's hurry back.

317
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,880
Your Majesty, you can do it!

318
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,719
Listen!

319
00:10:49,239 --> 00:10:50,599
Someone was indeed shouting "Your Majesty".

320
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,479
Let's go and take a look.

321
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:53,840
Your Majesty!

322
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,599
I'm extremely exhausted.

323
00:10:55,599 --> 00:10:57,320
I can't even take one more step.

324
00:10:58,559 --> 00:10:59,320
Fine, then.

325
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,559
You can rest here for now.

326
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:01,320
I'll head there myself.

327
00:11:01,719 --> 00:11:02,359
Your Majesty!

328
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,840
The Queen has arrived!

329
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,000
Your Majesty, you can do it!

330
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:08,599
The Queen is here!

331
00:11:08,599 --> 00:11:10,280
Hurry!

332
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,440
Your Majesty!

333
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,840
Your Majesty!

334
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:21,000
Nice!

335
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,200
Xuan?

336
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,200
You're really here.

337

00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:32,320
Xuan, you're here!

339
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,599
I knew someone was shouting
"Your Majesty" just now.

340
00:11:34,599 --> 00:11:36,119
Sufang said she heard nothing.

341
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,159
Langyin Pavilion is quite isolated.

342
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,320
Jinfeng, I'm sure you're exhausted

343
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,320
from all the traveling.

344
00:11:41,599 --> 00:11:42,880
I was initially.

345
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,000
But strangely,

346
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,479
I feel revitalized when I see you!

347
00:11:50,599 --> 00:11:52,400
Jinfeng, you shouldn't force yourself
when you're exhausted.

348
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,719
You should head back and rest.

349
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,400
I'm not exhausted at all.

350
00:11:56,239 --> 00:11:57,280
What are

351
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,280
these acrobats doing here?

352
00:11:59,080 --> 00:11:59,719
Your Majesty,

353
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,320
we and His Majesty

354
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,159
are learning acrobatics from them.

355
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:04,440
Acrobatics?

356
00:12:05,239 --> 00:12:07,119
Why didn't you invite me
when you were having so much fun?

357
00:12:07,119 --> 00:12:08,119
I wish to learn acrobatics too.

358
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,000
Your Majesty,

359
00:12:09,239 --> 00:12:11,039
you've already seen His Majesty.

360
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:12,719
I think we should head back and rest.

361
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:14,559
Sufang, you know nothing.

362
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,000
Even Xuan is learning acrobatics.

363
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,840
Of course I have to learn it too.

364
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,200
This is what you call follow the man you marry,

365
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,640
be he a cock or dog.

366
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,880
Jinfeng, you're actually sweating

367
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,400
from the cool weather of spring.

368
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,400
And you said you aren't exhausted?

369
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,359
If you tire yourself out,

370
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:34,640
I'll be heartbroken.

371
00:12:35,719 --> 00:12:37,000
Xuan,

372
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,400
don't try to tempt me with your beauty.

373
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,200
It doesn't work on me.

374
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,679
I want you to be heartbroken!

375
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,880
Your Majesty, please be careful.

376
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:53,520
Your Majesty, please be careful!

377
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,640
Aren't I doing a good job right now?

378
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,159
It's not that difficult.

379
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,559
Okay.

380
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,440
It's very easy.

381
00:13:03,599 --> 00:13:05,640
This is a piece of cake.

382
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,000
Your Majesty, please be careful!

383
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,039
Xuan will be heartbroken

384
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:10,719
if you fall down!

385
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,440
She already said
that she'll follow the man she married,

386
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,640
be he a cock or dog.

387
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,080
She said she wants Xuan to be heartbroken.

388
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:19,280
You guys should help her out

389
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,400
if you're so concerned about her.

390
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:22,719
Go now.

391
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,919
(Did she find Langyin Pavilion
by pure coincidence?)

392
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,280
(Or is she testing me on Liu Xie's behalf)

393
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,640
(by pretending to be ignorant?)

394
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,039
Yunzhang!

395
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:52,719
Yunzhang!

396
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,919
I finally found you!

397
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:54,760
Let's go!

398
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,520
An earthquake is coming!

399
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,359
An earthquake?

400
00:13:57,719 --> 00:13:58,440
An earthquake?

401
00:14:00,719 --> 00:14:01,320
Mother!

402
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:02,280
Let's go!

403
00:14:09,359 --> 00:14:09,960
Your Majesty!

404
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,640
Sufang!

405
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,239
Your Majesty,

406
00:14:12,239 --> 00:14:13,119
I'm here!

407
00:14:13,239 --> 00:14:14,280
-Are you okay?
-Wait, it didn't hurt?

408
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,080
Your Majesty!

409
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:16,559
Tang! Tie!

410
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,880
Are you guys okay?

411
00:14:18,119 --> 00:14:18,799
-We're fine!
-Your Majesty.

412
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:19,559
You scared me!

413
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:20,719
-Your Majesty, are you okay?
-My back!

414
00:14:20,719 --> 00:14:21,400
I'm fine!

415
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,000
Your Majesty.

416
00:14:22,359 --> 00:14:22,840
Thank you so much.

417
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,440
Your Majesty, get up.

418
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,359
Pull me up!

419
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,599
Chai,

420
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,919
go and maintain order within the Imperial Harem.

421
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:33,000
Ask everyone to evacuate to the empty grounds.

422
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,880
Yes, Your Majesty.

423
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,559
Tang,

424
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:35,679
get the imperial bodyguards

425
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,840
and ask them to be on standby.

426
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,479
Yes, Your Majesty.

427
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:39,119
Shen Ao, head to Lingshu Academy
and prepare some medicines.

428
00:14:39,119 --> 00:14:39,960
Yes, Your Majesty.

429
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:40,719
Yunchong,

430
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,239
join me and search for Mother.

431
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:42,799
All right.

432
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:43,239
Xuan,

433
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,000
what about me?

434
00:14:44,719 --> 00:14:45,440
Jinfeng, you can do whatever you want.

435
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,000
Your Majesty!

436
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,599
Sister-in-law,

437
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:51,159
are you okay?

438
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:51,919
I'm fine.

439
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,080
You are...?

440
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,200
I'm Yunchong, His Majesty's younger brother.

441
00:14:56,039 --> 00:14:57,159
So, you're my brother-in-law?

442
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:59,239
That means you're a good guy just like Yunzhang.

443
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,400
Come on.

444
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,280
I think I sprained my ankle.

445
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,000
Your Majesty,

446
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,239
does it hurt?

447
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:06,520
Let me support you then.

448
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,400
Let's evacuate slowly.

449
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,159
Slowly.

450
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:09,520
Slow down.

451
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,440
Over here!

452
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,320
Don't you guys feel that something's off?

453
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:13,559
What do you mean?

454
00:15:13,719 --> 00:15:15,080
An earthquake is coming, right?

455
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,440
Shouldn't the earth shake violently?

456
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:18,719
How could it be an earthquake
when the ground isn't even shaking?

457
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:22,200
Maybe this was an early warning.

458
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,359
What does that mean?

459
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,280
Maybe it's telling us

460
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,080
that an earthquake will hit
the imperial capital soon.

461
00:15:27,239 --> 00:15:28,200
Soon?

462
00:15:29,719 --> 00:15:30,200
Your Majesty!

463
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,000
Sister-in-law, where are you going?

464
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I'm going after Xuan!

465
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,799
Who shall protect him
when the earthquake hits later?

466
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,960
Let me support you then.

467
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,520
Slow down!

468
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,280
Run!

469
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,679
The Earthquake Bell was rung!

470
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,599
Hurry!

471
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,640
Hurry!

472
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:46,719
Over here!

473
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:52,679
Her Highness?

474
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:00,520
Consort Dowager?

475
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:02,880
Get out of the way!

476
00:16:59,020 --> 00:16:59,700
Liu Baiyu!

477
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,580
How dare you do that in broad daylight?

478
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,260
Your Majesty, thank you for saving me.

479
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,180
Have you seen Mother and Consort Dowager?

480
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,300
We got separated.

481
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,100
Go and search for them then.

482
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,740
She's still pretending to be delicate!

483
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:23,700
I knew it.

484
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,420
She was just pretending

485
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,220
to be a noble lady all along.

486
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:27,540
Sister-in-law, listen,

487
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,460
you must never...

488
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:30,980
Sister-in-law?

489
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,140
He's so cool.

490
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,940
Xuan looks so cool.

491
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,260
Wait!

492
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,060
Aren't you angry at him for doing that?

493
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:43,860
Why should I be angry at him?

494
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,380
It surely happened for a reason.

495
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,180
You're holding my arm too, aren't you?

496
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:47,700
Wait!

497
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:48,660
We...

498
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,820
How could this be the same?

499
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,900
That was so indecent of her!

500
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:56,820
Fine. Since you're not angry,

501
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:57,860
I won't be angry either.

502
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,260
Actually, I was just saying.

503
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:02,660
I have to find Mother and Her Majesty now.

504
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:03,220
Sufang,

505
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,300
take care of my sister-in-law.

506
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,060
Watch out for any danger.

507
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:08,940
Your Majesty, we're done.

508
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,740
Have you guys seen
the Consort Dowager and my mother?

509
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:11,940
No.

510
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:12,620
Go and look for them then!

511
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:13,540
Yes, Your Majesty!

512
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,220
Stop running!

513
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,900
It was an accident!

514
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,260
There's no earthquake!

515
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,260
Everyone, don't panic!

516
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,380
There's no earthquake!

517
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,020
It was an accident?

518
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,620
Yes, it was an accident.

519
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,220
An accident?

520
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:24,700
I...

521
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:26,620
-Yunzhang...
-Your Majesty.

522
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:27,340
Your Majesty,

523
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,700
I'm truly sorry about this.

524
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,060
It was a misunderstanding.

525
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,580
There's no earthquake. It was just an accident.

526
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:32,980
An accident?

527
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,460
So, you guys panicked

528
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,500
and ran like headless chickens

529
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,540
because of an accident like this?

530
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,060
All of you behaved like disowned dogs.

531
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:42,820
All of you will be punished!

532
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:54,620
Where's Mother?

533
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,180
Where's the Empress Dowager?

534
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,180
You can stop the search.

535
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,300
I'm over here.

536
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,020
Me too.

537
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,580
Zhang.

538
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:20,060
Mother.

539
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:20,500
This is...

540
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,020
Your Majesty, are you all right?

541
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,220
I was so worried.

542
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,620
Prince Longyue!

543
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:25,580
How could you commit

544
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:26,740
such a blunder?

545
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,260
Her Majesty was frightened because of you.

546
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,060
This is a long story.

547
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:30,740
It...

548
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,060
It wasn't me who rang the bell.

549
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,460
Who was it then?

550
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:34,500
Who was it?

551
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:48,580
Me?

552
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,660
That's what happened.

553
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,420
Her Majesty didn't know
that it was the Earthquake Bell.

554
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,660
I don't think

555
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,260
she caused the panic on purpose.

556
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,020
So, Your Majesty,

557
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,020
please spare her.

558
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:07,300
Zhang,

559
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:10,060
actually,

560
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,540
this isn't that big of a deal.

561
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:15,060
However, it isn't something we can ignore.

562
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:16,620
Your Majesty,

563
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:19,340
did you forget how frightened you were just now?

564
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:22,460
If we just leave it like this,

565
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,940
the palace will be in chaos in the future.

566
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,940
I didn't say I wasn't going to punish the Queen.

567
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:31,620
I think I will leave this matter

568
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,780
to Zhang.

569
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:35,860
(That's great.)

570
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,260
(I'm sure Xuan would protect me)

571
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,460
(since he knew I didn't do it on purpose.)

572
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,860
(Just like how I protected him.)

573
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:41,340
Mother,

574
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:44,500
in my opinion, although Jinfeng

575
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:45,980
didn't commit the mistake on purpose,

576
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:49,540
she had committed many mistakes
out of ignorance.

577
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,220
That's why we cannot spare her
from the punishments.

578
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,740
Xuan, are you going to punish me?

579
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,260
Nothing can be accomplished
without norms or standards.

580
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:02,260
You will be grounded in Xiangluo Hall

581
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,380
for you to study the palace rules thoroughly.

582
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,020
Xuan,

583
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,660
I just didn't know
that it was the Earthquake Bell.

584
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,300
However, I do know some rules.

585
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:08,900
What?

586
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,300
Do you think you know the rules here?

587
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,580
You burned down the Imperial Kitchen,

588
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,020
disrupted the training ground,

589
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,540
destroyed Lingshu Academy,

590
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:18,380
caused the entire Imperial Palace to panic,

591
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,860
and caused Mother
and the Consort Dowager to be in danger.

592
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,860
And you say you know the rules here?

593
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:25,540
Your Majesty,

594
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:28,100
I think Her Majesty didn't do them on purpose.

595
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,580
Uncle Longyue, say no more.

596
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:32,580
No one shall speak up for her today.

597
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,660
Why are you so mean to me?

598
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,420
Do you think you're a big deal
just because you're the Emperor?

599
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,260
You just want to punish me

600
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,860
because you don't want to see me, don't you?

601
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,020
Why are you relating it to the palace rules?

602
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,900
And now, you're not letting
other people speak up for me.

603
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:48,300
So, Jinfeng, you think I did it out of rage?

604
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:49,460
Zhang,

605
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,140
what are you doing?

606
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:52,540
What about this?

607
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:56,020
Jinfeng, you shall apologize to my mother
and the Consort Dowager in an official way.

608
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,620
I shall spare you from punishment

609
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:58,740
if you do everything right.

610
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,500
Fine. I'll do it.

611
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:10,700
What's wrong?

612
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,340
Why are you still standing there?

613
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:14,500
Yunyan,

614
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,300
demonstrate it to the Queen.

615
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,300
Yes, Yunzhang.

616
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:39,900
Please.

617
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:54,260
This doesn't count. I have a sprained ankle.

618
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,260
You did the wrong thing.

619
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,180
Stop trying to find excuses.

620
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,180
I'm not trying to find excuses.

621
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,340
My foot does hurt.

622
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,540
The palace is filled with rites and rituals.

623
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:04,900
Jinfeng,

624
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,020
how could you face our relatives
in the relative banquet

625
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,020
that would be held in ten days

626
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,580
if you can't even complete such a simple ritual?

627
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,020
A relative banquet?

628
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:16,900
What is that?

629
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,700
You don't even know that?

630
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:20,980
A relative banquet

631
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,540
is a banquet held by the Emperor and the Queen

632
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:24,420
to express gratitude to the relatives
of the imperial family.

633
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:25,780
You want to be the Queen

634
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,180
when you're this ignorant?

635
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:28,700
It's just another rule, isn't it?

636
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,660
Fine, I'll learn them.

637
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,740
You should've told me
about the relative banquet earlier.

638
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,180
You do make it sound easy.

639
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:35,380
You better don't complain
about your sprained ankle by then.

640
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:37,020
What if I pass the test?

641
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,100
If so, I'll acknowledge you as my sister-in-law.

642
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,300
All right. It's a deal.

643
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,100
It's in ten days, right?

644
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:44,540
Mother,

645
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,500
it was my fault today.

646
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,140
I've frightened you

647
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,180
and the others.

648
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,260
I'm sorry about this.

649
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:50,620
I will admit my mistake.

650
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,500
Please send someone to teach me
about the etiquette and rules here.

651
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:53,900
I will wait in Xiangluo Hall.

652
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:54,700
All right.

653
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,180
I will arrange for that.

654
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:58,060
Jinfeng, you should head back and rest.

655
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,300
Thank you, Mother.

656
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:09,140
Get out of the way.

657
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,700
(She did sprain her ankle.)

658
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,220
This is so infuriating!

659
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,380
Mother was right.

660
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,940
Men do change after they get married!

661
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,620
All men are scums!

662
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:39,140
My foot!

663
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:39,620
Your Majesty!

664
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:40,420
What's wrong?

665
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:41,980
Is your foot hurting again?

666
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,140
My foot!

667
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,100
I'll get some water

668
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,340
to clean your wound for you.

669
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:49,500
My foot!

670
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:52,460
I feel terrible!

671
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,900
My heart is in pieces!

672
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:01,980
Goodness! How could he change all of a sudden?

673
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:05,340
His Majesty said

674
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,460
that he suspected the Queen

675
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:08,100
of being Scorpion Liu's spy.

676
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,500
If so, I'm sure the Queen

677
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,220
caused the panic on purpose.

678
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:12,460
I guess

679
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,660
His Majesty grounded her
and forced her to learn the palace rules

680
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:15,940
to keep an eye on her

681
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,260
so that she couldn't create trouble for him.

682
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,780
I don't think that's His Majesty's will.

683
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:21,500
It's just your stupid prediction.

684
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,980
Hey, watch your mouth.

685
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:23,580
Shen Ao!

686
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,100
You understand His Majesty the best.

687
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,500
Do you agree with me?

688
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,380
Her Majesty almost found out

689
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,700
about His Majesty's wrestling team today.

690
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,380
It's natural for His Majesty
to be on guard against her.

691
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,380
I'm afraid His Majesty mentioned

692
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,500
the relative banquet in public

693
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,180
so that Her His Majesty could
make a fool of herself at the banquet.

694
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,900
After that, using the palace rules as his excuse,

695
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:43,220
His Majesty would continue grounding her.

696
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:44,420
So,

697
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:45,940
His Majesty just pretended to be angry

698
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,020
in front of everyone?

699
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:48,860
His act was pretty convincing.

700
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,580
Not necessarily.

701
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,260
What do you mean?

702
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:56,540
I heard

703
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:59,300
that Consort Li, His Majesty's birth mother,

704
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,540
fell into the pond

705
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:03,620
and drowned during a fire

706
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:04,780
in the palace.

707
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,500
That's why His Majesty is afraid
that the same incident

708
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,340
might happen again.

709
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:11,780
I actually know about this incident.

710
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:13,660
However, it didn't occur to me.

711
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,380
What are you guys chatting about
in the middle of the night?

712
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:17,620
Your Majesty.

713
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,220
It was nothing serious.

714
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,060
Your Majesty, why have you come

715
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:22,140
to Lingshu Academy?

716
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:24,340
I'm here to borrow something.

717
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:29,980
Your Majesty,

718
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:31,380
you should've let me

719
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:33,900
clean your wound after we came back.

720
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:35,780
Look.

721
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,780
Your ankle is quite swollen.

722
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,460
It's fine.

723
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,620
It was necessary for me to cry out loud.

724
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,820
Now, I have the energy to be angry again.

725
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,060
Your Majesty,

726
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,100
are you still angry at His Majesty?

727
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:49,820
Wouldn't you be angry if you were in my shoes?

728
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,460
He just wants me to learn
the etiquette and rules of the palace.

729
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:52,820
Why can't he put it in a nice way?

730
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,820
Why don't I get the imperial physician

731
00:26:58,820 --> 00:26:59,980
to examine your wound for you?

732
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:00,820
No need for that.

733
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,940
It's just a minor wound.
There's no need to trouble them.

734
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:04,820
I think I'll be fine after applying some ointment.

735
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:05,580
Your Majesty,

736
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:06,620
Prince Yunchong

737
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:08,580
sent you some ointment
when you were crying just now.

738
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:09,500
I'll go get it.

739
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,220
Give me a moment.

740
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:15,780
Even Yunchong is sending me some ointment.

741
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,580
That fool

742
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,180
is so cold and heartless.

743
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,860
He turned hostile toward me in just a second.

744
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,300
He's happy one moment, but angry the next.

745
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:26,740
No wonder Mother said he had an eccentric temper.

746
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:30,140
He was a sweet man
when he wrote to me in the past!

747
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:33,100
Now, it seems like
he was just pretending to be nice.

748
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:38,620
Sufang,

749
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:40,020
the ointment feels great.

750
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:42,020
You still treat me the best.

751
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,580
Unlike that person.

752
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,380
I even wanted to protect him.

753
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,460
I never want to see him again!

754
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,740
Fine, I'll make a move first.

755
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:57,380
Xuan?

756
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:01,260
Remember to apply this ointment twice per day.

757
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,380
Apply two layers for each session.

758
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,220
Your ankle will heal within three days.

759
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,860
Why are you here when you have grounded me?

760
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:08,140
You're being grounded,

761
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:09,140
not me.

762
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:10,780
I can go anywhere I want to.

763
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,820
If so, are you here to visit me?

764
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,260
(So, he punished me)

765
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:20,460
(not because he didn't want to see me.)

766
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,660
When did you sprain your ankle?

767
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:26,180
I sprained it
when I was going after you this afternoon.

768
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:27,700
It's just a minor injury. Don't worry.

769
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,500
I was flustered this afternoon.

770
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:36,300
The words I've said in Qianluo Hall,

771
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,140
they were...

772
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,380
They were... Don't move.

773
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:43,900
You went too far this afternoon.

774
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:46,180
Why is it so hard for you to apologize to me?

775
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,700
What I wanted to say is

776
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:52,460
that when we were in Qianluo Hall this afternoon,

777
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:54,820
I was flustered, therefore, my words

778
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,660
weren't complete.

779
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,180
I'm forcing you to learn the palace rules

780
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:02,300
not just because of the relative banquet.

781
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,940
I hope that you will use this opportunity

782
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:07,340
and remember all of the rules by heart.

783
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:09,060
You have plenty of banquets to attend

784
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:10,060
in the future.

785
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:12,060
You'll be in for a bad time.

786
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:17,220
So, Xuan, you're punishing me for my own good?

787
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:19,340
You should've told me earlier.

788
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,420
I even misunderstood your intention.

789
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,060
I'm really narrow-minded.

790
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:27,340
I guess that's another way of understanding it.

791
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:30,460
Anyway, Jinfeng,
you better remember the words you said.

792
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:32,620
What did I say?

793
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,660
You said that you would become a good queen

794
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,780
and follow the man you married.

795
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,260
I did say that.

796
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:41,860
You still remember them.

797
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,660
Xuan, don't worry.

798
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,660
This time, I will give it my all

799
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:47,540
to learn the palace rules.

800
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:49,580
I won't leave Xiangluo Hall until I'm done.

801
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:50,140
All right.

802
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,300
Jinfeng, you may continue resting.

803
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,220
I shall make a move now.

804
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:54,100
Wait!

805
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:58,980
Actually, my left foot is...

806
00:29:58,980 --> 00:29:59,500
That's enough.

807
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:03,580
I think this task is more appropriate for Sufang.

808
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:04,500
Sufang.

809
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:06,500
Your Majesty.

810
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:07,700
Greetings, Your Majesty.

811
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:08,540
Apply ointment for the Queen.

812
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,100
Do a thorough job.

813
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:09,740
Yes, Your Majesty.

814
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:10,500
I was just planning to...

815
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:14,820
Your Majesty,

816
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,260
why did His Majesty suddenly...

817
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,020
Sufang,

818
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:20,340
His Majesty is clearly still in love with me.

819
00:30:23,875 --> 00:30:27,300
[Grand Chancellor's Residence]

820
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:32,580
Young Lady,

821
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:33,860
you're finally back.

822
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,500
Second Madam has been
waiting here the entire day

823
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:41,420
to hear from you about your stay in the palace.

824
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:42,980
She just left not long ago.

825
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:45,900
Luckily, Mother has left.

826
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,860
She'll definitely rake up the past

827
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:49,260
if she knows Father hasn't agreed to it.

828
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:50,860
What do you mean?

829
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:54,420
My biological father passed away
when I was young.

830
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,420
Father adopted me to fulfill
the marriage proposal

831
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:57,660
made between him and the Late Emperor.

832
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:00,620
Initially, he wanted
to marry me off to the Emperor.

833
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:02,780
However, out of nowhere,

834
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,100
Father actually got himself

835
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,420
another daughter outside.

836
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,420
And that's the end of the story.

837
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:09,820
Actually, in my opinion,

838
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:12,900
Father always does things for a reason.

839
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:15,500
Why must Mother

840
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:17,220
be overly anxious about it?

841
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:18,700
Young Lady,

842
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,700
actually, I don't understand something.

843
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:23,260
Why do you always listen to Master's words?

844
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:26,060
It's because Father is amazing.

845
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,180
Haven't you heard about him before?

846
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:31,740
When the Late Emperor was still the Crown Prince,

847
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:34,380
he once visited famous mountains
and lived in the forest as a recluse.

848
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:37,260
He and Father felt like old friends
during their first meeting.

849
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:38,660
They talked about the past and the present.

850
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:41,500
It's as if the story of Yu Boya and Zhong Ziqi.
(*close friends who can understand each other)

851
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:43,460
They had so much in common that they regretted
not meeting each other sooner.

852
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,140
Young Lady,

853
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:46,180
are you sure about that?

854
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,100
Anyway, it sounds true to me.

855
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:50,260
All right. Let's drop the chat.

856
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:51,300
You should rest early.

857
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,700
By the way, Young Lady,

858
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:54,780
I almost forgot.

859
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,860
Your publisher, Mr. Bai,
came again this afternoon.

860
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,140
He's urging you to write a new book.

861
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:58,980
He said

862
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:01,860
if their author,
Lovely Breeze and Bright Moonlight,

863
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:02,740
stopped writing,

864
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:04,500
his publishing house will be out of business.

865
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,700
All right, I got it.

866
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:09,540
What about this?

867
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:11,460
Head to the publishing house and tell him

868
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,780
that I will definitely write a new book.

869
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:15,260
However, tell him not to
visit the residence again.

870
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:18,220
We'll be done for if Father knows

871
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,700
that I'm writing stories.

872
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,820
All right. I shall head there immediately.

873
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:13,060
Your Majesty, why are you sighing?

874
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,660
Does it feel comfortable or not?

875
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:16,300
Life is so tough.

876
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:18,740
Zhang wants me

877
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:21,940
to find someone who can teach the Queen
about the palace rules.

878
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,020
Who should I find?

879
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:27,940
Isn't this easy?

880
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,900
There are plenty of old maids in the palace.

881
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:32,620
But you saw her yourself.

882
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,740
Where can I get an old maid

883
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:36,860
who's capable enough to turn the Queen

884
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:38,260
into a noble lady in ten days

885
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:41,020
when her standards are as such?

886
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:44,740
I do have a candidate in mind.

887
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:46,340
Who is it? Tell me.

888
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,780
Three Heads and Six Arms
of the Imperial Ceremonial Service.

889
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,780
Three Heads and Six Arms?

890
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:52,900
The Three Heads and Six Arms
Imperial Ceremonial Team.

891
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:55,340
The team is made up of a young triplet.

892
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,660
They joined the palace
when they were one month old.

893
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,820
They had gone through harsh training

894
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:01,340
and given harsh training to others.

895
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:03,780
They're famous for their swift, ruthless,

896
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:05,180
and accurate means.

897
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,660
As long as the Three Heads and Six Arms
make their appearance,

898
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:10,180
I'm sure the Queen

899
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:13,300
will turn into a meek cat.

900
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:16,980
That's what we shall do.

901
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:28,700
You guys

902
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,100
shouldn't teach the Queen

903
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,060
the correct ways.

904
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:32,900
Teach her something
that could turn her into a joke.

905
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,740
Like this, this,

906
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:35,860
and this.

907
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:37,820
Understood?

908
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:39,900
-Yes, Your Highness.
-Yes, Your Highness.

909
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:06,540
Sufang!

910
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:07,980
Your Majesty!

911
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:08,940
I'm here!

912
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:09,900
Who are they?

913
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:12,500
I'm Wu Qing of the Imperial Ceremonial Service.
(*ruthless)

914
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,980
I'm Wu Yi of the Imperial Ceremonial Service.
(*careless)

915
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,380
I'm Wu Xin of the Imperial Ceremonial Service.
(*heartless)

916
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:20,420
We were tasked by the Empress Dowager

917
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:22,860
to teach Your Majesty about
the etiquette and rules in the palace.

918
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:25,900
So, you are my etiquette mentors?

919
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:26,980
You scared me for a second there.

920
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:27,660
Your Majesty,

921
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:29,580
why don't we begin now?

922
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,660
I want to sleep for a little longer.

923
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:32,580
Your Majesty,

924
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:33,580
you cannot sleep.

925
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:35,220
We've made arrangements for you.

926
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:36,260
Your Majesty,

927
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:37,780
you're new here,
and you have a huge mission to accomplish.

928
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:39,300
We mustn't waste any time here.

929
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:41,140
I don't care!

930
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:47,260
In total, there are 36 kinds of palace rules.

931
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:48,860
There are ten kinds of nodding rules,

932
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:50,140
eleven kinds of bowing rules,

933
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:51,540
and 15 kinds of kneeling rules.

934
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:54,020
Your Majesty, first,
you need to learn the nodding rules.

935
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,620
You need to nod when you see the Empress Dowager.

936
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,180
You need to nod when you see the Consort Dowager.

937
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:59,140
All the more you need to nod
when you see His Majesty.

938
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:00,740
If you're in trouble, nod to the left.

939
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:03,300
If you're fine, nod to the right.

940
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:06,980
If you're free, nod to the middle.

941
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:11,540
Anyway, nodding is the most basic etiquette
we have in the palace.

942
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:13,940
Besides etiquette,

943
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:16,420
the most important thing is your posture.

944
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:18,700
You should sit properly

945
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:20,020
and stand properly.

946
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:23,180
When an emperor walks,
he should walk like an emperor.

947
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:24,540
When a queen walks,

948
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,380
she should walk like a queen.

949
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:29,700
Only then, you'll be able to show people
how dignified you are.

950
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,180
Your butt is swaying at the wrong angle.

951
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:54,300
In the palace, makeup
is the most important thing for us women.

952
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,140
Your Majesty, you're the role model for all women.

953
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:58,420
That's why it's a given for you

954
00:36:58,420 --> 00:36:59,580
to put on thick makeup every day.

955
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:03,340
I'm doing pretty well today, right?

956
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,100
After going through
our systematic learning system,

957
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,180
Your Majesty, your movements look dignified.

958
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:09,900
You've already started
to exhibit the flair of a motherly model.

959
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,580
I'm already a motherly model?

960
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,900
If so, can I go out and take a breather?

961
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:14,660
Your Majesty,

962
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:15,860
you're still being grounded.

963
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:16,540
Therefore, no.

964
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:18,540
I'll just head out for a second.

965
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:19,540
I've been stuck here for several days.

966
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:20,580
I'm going to turn moldy.

967
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:21,940
No.

968
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:23,460
Your Majesty,

969
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:25,180
you better learn how to do your makeup.
