Not only do you look dumb,

Don't follow us into the Imperial Palace.

How could I do so without any money?

So, you were chased out

Did you really think that I was slow?

167
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,200
I did so on purpose.

168
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,520
I didn't want to enter the Imperial Palace.

169
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,880
What happened after that?

170
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:42,919
After that,

171
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,919
my mother and grandmother heard

172
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:48,679
that I became one of their contacts.

173
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,679
They panicked and searched for me.

174
00:10:51,599 --> 00:10:54,559
In the end, they found me
outside Xianpa Village.

175
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:56,719
My mother said

176
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:58,559
it was too troublesome to return home.

177
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:00,239
What if they wanted me
to be their contact again?

178
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:02,119
They would rather live there.

179
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:04,960
Thus, the three of us lived there
for many years.

180
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,840
It was great, wasn't it?

181
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,119
So, what happened after that?

182
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,679
After that,

183
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,960
I saved an idiot

184
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:21,080
after he got injured in the war.

185
00:11:21,359 --> 00:11:22,239
After that,

186
00:11:22,359 --> 00:11:25,440
he fell for me by accident.

187
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:27,239
He tried his best to court me.

188
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,880
Who do you think he is?

189
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,119
Yongfu,

190
00:11:35,119 --> 00:11:35,719
here.

191
00:11:40,239 --> 00:11:42,000
You have to understand me.

192
00:11:42,479 --> 00:11:44,919
For the prosperity of the Donghao Empire,

193
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,960
the people on the list

194
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:48,919
need to be placed under our control.

195
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,960
Don't blame me for this.

196
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,359
I think you should be patient for now.

197
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,880
Although they are important,

198
00:11:57,239 --> 00:11:59,359
there's another message which is more important.

199
00:12:00,359 --> 00:12:01,000
What message?

200
00:12:07,119 --> 00:12:08,919
Did you see the fireworks they released

201
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:09,719
in the capital last night?

202
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,119
Is there any problem with that?

203
00:12:13,479 --> 00:12:15,719
That was the hidden code
for every spy of the Xiyue Empire

204
00:12:15,719 --> 00:12:17,559
who is hiding inside the palace.

205
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,359
When the green smoke arises,

206
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,679
the Xiyue Empire will attack the Imperial Palace

207
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:24,200
at midnight on the 15th of the month.

208
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,000
By then, they'll work in collusion
and crush the Imperial Palace together.

209
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,119
Is that true?

210
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,799
My goodness.

211
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,960
All these years, I only knew

212
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,559
that there was a name list of the spies
hidden within the formula.

213
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:41,760
I have to act immediately.

214
00:12:42,359 --> 00:12:44,799
However, many years had passed since then.

215
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:46,039
I don't know

216
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,440
how many people they have right now.

217
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:49,239
You don't know

218
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,119
how many underlings they have either.

219
00:12:50,119 --> 00:12:51,039
How can you act?

220
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,280
Yongfu, you're right.

221
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,239
We need to arrest all of them.

222
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,559
Please protect our daughter

223
00:12:58,679 --> 00:12:59,960
when you do so.

224
00:13:00,599 --> 00:13:01,679
Yongfu, you don't need to worry.

225
00:13:04,359 --> 00:13:05,840
Today is the 15th!

226
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:27,919
According to His Majesty's intellect,

227
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:30,679
he'll be able to predict
that you're in my residence soon.

228
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,479
Grand Chancellor Liu,
are you trying to chase your guest away?

229
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:39,000
That's a given.

230
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,760
However, before I do so,

231
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:46,359
I have a gift for you.

232
00:13:57,390 --> 00:14:02,434
[According to the posthumous edict,
Crown Prince Ya will inherit the throne.]

233
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:08,239
Where did you get this?

234
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:10,320
You don't need to know.

235
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:11,840
Anyway, it will help you out.

236
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,359
Currently, Li Yuan is at the valley checkpoint.

237
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,919
He's still planning his plot.

238
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,239
This is your best time to strike.

239
00:14:21,119 --> 00:14:23,359
I've assigned 20,000 troops
of the Jingji Battalion to you.

240
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:25,520
You have to depend on yourself for the rest.

241
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,440
You don't need to be too touched.

242
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,159
I didn't do all of them for your sake.

243
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,559
I know.

244
00:14:44,359 --> 00:14:45,599
You did it for the sake of the Donghao Empire

245
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,440
and the young Emperor.

246
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,599
Seems like Li's son is pretty smart.

247
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,840
What about Jinfeng?

248
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,599
After all, she's the Queen
of the Donghao Empire.

249
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:09,200
I just wish to see her one last time

250
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,239
before I leave.

251
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,159
Commander Sun, you'll be fully in charge

252
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:18,559
of the operation within the Imperial Palace.

253
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:20,239
I only have one request.

254
00:15:20,479 --> 00:15:21,960
Do not let anyone escape.

255
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:23,559
Yes, Grand Chancellor.

256
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:24,960
Vice Commander Yang,

257
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:27,200
you shall escort Yu Changya
back to the Xiyue Empire.

258
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:29,479
You must listen to his orders.
Do not disobey him.

259
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,760
Yes, Grand Chancellor.

260
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,760
Remember,

261
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:34,840
keep tonight's operation a secret.

262
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:36,359
If something happens,

263
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,599
I'll hold you two accountable for it.

264
00:15:38,359 --> 00:15:39,359
Exit through the backdoor.

265
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:40,840
Yes, Grand Chancellor.

266
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:56,239
What are they doing over there?

267
00:15:56,599 --> 00:15:57,440
Where's Yu Changya?

268
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:03,640
Mother!

269
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,400
You two...

270
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,159
What exactly happened between you two?

271
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:07,119
Stop asking.

272
00:16:07,719 --> 00:16:09,119
Yu Changya has something to tell you.

273
00:16:09,119 --> 00:16:10,400
You two can have a chat.

274
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,280
I'll go and take a walk.

275
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,239
Just go.

276
00:16:15,479 --> 00:16:17,400
What are you doing here?

277
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,159
Jinfeng,

278
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,540
I'll be leaving the Donghao Empire by tonight.

279
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:23,860
You're only leaving by tonight?

280
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,420
My mother finally saved you with so much effort.

281
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,020
Why didn't you leave last night?

282
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:39,220
Do you know something?

283
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:41,780
This is how it usually goes
inside the plot of a huaben, the story book.

284
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,460
Right before men go to war,

285
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:46,460
they will tell a woman
about their honest feelings.

286
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:48,730
Usually, the woman

287
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:50,610
will tell them to go without any worries

288
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,460
and that they will wait for their men's return.

289
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:54,490
Or, they will say

290
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:56,660
that they will join them on the battlefield

291
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:01,420
and that they will follow their men
no matter where they go.

292
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:05,610
But why is it different

293
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,300
when it comes to you?

294
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:10,250
It's because I'm not the female lead
inside a huaben.

295
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:12,180
You're not the male lead either.

296
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,780
You should escape.

297
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,210
Is there anything else you want to say?

298
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:20,450
Take good care of yourself.

299
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:25,180
I believe our next encounter

300
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:28,180
will be the national banquet
between our empires.

301
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:29,580
National banquet?

302
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:30,660
What do you mean?

303
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,060
Jinfeng, do you still remember

304
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:34,370
I told you

305
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:37,370
that I could make you a queen too?

306
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:40,780
I think you did say that.

307
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:44,020
I'm from the Xiyue Empire.

308
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:45,820
You're from the Xiyue Empire too?

309
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,370
How many of you are there?

310
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:53,090
And, I'm their Crown Prince.

311
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:55,780
Crown Prince?

312
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:58,660
They don't even do that in huabens.

313
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:02,580
I'm not lying.

314
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,370
I didn't lie to you in the past,

315
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:06,660
and I won't lie to you in the future.

316
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:12,490
I don't expect you to follow me.

317
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:15,540
However,

318
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:17,540
one day,

319
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:20,580
if Duan Yunzhang bullies you,

320
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:23,940
remember to come to me in the Xiyue Empire.

321
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:26,820
If you're willing,

322
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:30,780
I can make you the Queen
of the Xiyue Empire too.

323
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:33,660
Don't worry.

324
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:34,970
That day will never arrive.

325
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:39,660
Okay.

326
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,820
I still have things to attend to.

327
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:51,020
Jinfeng.

328
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:57,660
Farewell.

329
00:18:58,580 --> 00:18:59,660
Just go already.

330
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,180
Tang.

331
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:41,820
Commander Sun and Vice-Commander Yang, huh?

332
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:42,900
Are you sure you weren't mistaken?

333
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,580
I'm sure of it, Your Majesty.

334
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:47,300
It's reasonable for them

335
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,300
to appear in Liu Xie's residence.

336
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,700
However, why did they exit through the backdoor?

337
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,580
Sun and Yang were both pupils
of Liu Xie in the past.

338
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,210
Liu Xie was the one

339
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,940
who brought them into the Jingji Battalion.

340
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:00,180
Those two only listen to Liu Xie's orders.

341
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:03,820
I wonder what Liu Xie is up to.

342
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:07,820
Forget about that for now.

343
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:08,900
Tang,

344
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,060
recall all of our men.

345
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,540
Forget about Yu Changya for now.

346
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,700
Find someone to monitor Sun and Yang.

347
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,180
Yes, Your Majesty.

348
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:22,450
Your Majesty,

349
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,700
why are you staring at me?

350
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:27,820
I'm hungry.

351
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,370
Make something for me.

352
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:31,370
Yes, Your Majesty.

353
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,250
Yunzhang, don't worry.

354
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,060
I shall protect you with my life.

355
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:39,900
Let's wait for Tang's news for now.

356
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,820
If our prediction was correct,

357
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,730
the Imperial Palace would be in turmoil.

358
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,250
Sir,

359
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,660
I don't understand something.

360
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:56,420
Speak.

361
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,780
Sir, why didn't you tell His Majesty about this?

362
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:02,420
That way, we can work together
to defend against our invaders.

363
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:04,180
Why are you doing this alone?

364
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:09,730
His Majesty is young and impulsive.

365
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:11,700
I'm afraid that he can't retain his composure

366
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:12,900
and ruin my plan.

367
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:17,130
Moreover, Li Yuan has plenty of spies
within the palace.

368
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:18,730
I might alert him to our plan by accident

369
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:20,820
if I tell His Majesty about it.

370
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,970
If something does happen,

371
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,730
I shall bear the responsibility for him.

372
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,540
I understand.

373
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:30,210
I hope His Majesty

374
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:32,130
can understand your efforts one day.

375
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:40,250
Your Majesty,

376
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:41,250
Scorpion Liu did dispatch his troops

377
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:42,250
from the Jingji Battalion.

378
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,450
I heard that they would act by tonight.

379
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:44,700
Is the source of news reliable?

380
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:46,420
I have a hometown friend.

381
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,180
He and I became imperial bodyguards
through the examination at the same time.

382
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:49,820
After that, he was transferred
to the Jingji Battalion.

383
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:51,250
I don't think he would lie to me.

384
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,060
Scorpion Liu, how dare you?

385
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:54,540
He's actually plotting a rebellion?

386
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:55,210
Your Majesty,

387
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,700
please give us your order.

388
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:57,660
We will obey you.

389
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,020
Tang,

390
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:01,450
gather every imperial bodyguard you can find.

391
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:02,490
Tell them to be on standby.

392
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,130
Yes, Your Majesty.

393
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:06,700
Chai,

394
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,210
as for you...

395
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:09,250
Your Majesty,

396
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,940
the Imperial Kitchen can fight too.

397
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:13,540
We're no inferior to the imperial bodyguards!

398
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:15,420
All right.

399
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,490
Round up your men as well.

400
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:18,180
Yes, Your Majesty.

401
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:25,250
Yunzhang.

402
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:27,210
Go ahead.

403
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:28,940
Yunchong,

404
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:30,780
take the Consort Dowager and Baiyu with you

405
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,020
and move to the mansion outside of the palace.

406
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:33,900
Is that all?

407
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:34,900
That is all.

408
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,250
Understood, Yunzhang.

409
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,780
They have to pass by the road outside the city

410
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,450
if they wish to enter the palace
from the encampment of Jingji Battalion.

411
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:43,660
That is where my mansion is located at.

412
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:45,660
Yunzhang, you want me to ambush them, right?

413
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:47,180
I'm smart, aren't I?

414
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,490
Of course not.

415
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,300
After you guys reach there,

416
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,580
shut the doors.

417
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:54,250
Do not come out for the time being.

418
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,490
We'll know the result by tomorrow.

419
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,180
If I win,

420
00:22:58,370 --> 00:22:59,450
I will bring you guys back to the palace.

421
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,130
Even if I lose,

422
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,940
Scorpion Liu shouldn't
make things difficult for you guys.

423
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,490
Yunzhang, you mustn't do this!

424
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:06,820
I need to stand by you

425
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:08,490
no matter what happens!

426
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:09,250
Yunchong,

427
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:11,420
between you and I,

428
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,730
one of us has to live.

429
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:15,780
Where there's life, there's hope.

430
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,300
Yunzhang,

431
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,580
I can send Mother and Baiyu to my mansion.

432
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:22,250
However, I will never act like a coward.

433
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:24,130
So what if I'm alive after the war?

434
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:25,130
I'll be a laughing stock anyway.

435
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:25,940
Yunchong...

436
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:26,900
Yunzhang, say no more.

437
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,060
I've made up my mind.

438
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:29,450
I will make the preparations now.

439
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:44,060
Baiyu!

440
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,610
Hurry and leave with me!

441
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:46,700
What's the matter?

442
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:48,450
Is the new mansion ready?

443
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:49,420
There's no time for that!

444
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:50,090
What's wrong?

445
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:51,450
It's nothing.

446
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:52,210
Just leave with me.

447
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:52,970
I won't leave until you tell me why.

448
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:53,610
Are you leaving or not?

449
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:55,370
No. I haven't finished my work yet.

450
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:01,730
Baiyu, I'm sorry.

451
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:03,250
I'm doing this for your sake.

452
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:14,660
Baiyu,

453
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:16,370
don't worry.

454
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:18,490
Since I said I would marry you,

455
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:20,020
I would definitely do so.

456
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:22,300
Wait for me.

457
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:43,610
Zhuang,

458
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:45,250
take her somewhere safe.

459
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:01,850
Where's Jinfeng?

460
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:03,970
I haven't seen her since afternoon.

461
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:06,780
Could it be that she left together with him?

462
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:07,700
Your Majesty,

463
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:09,820
I've already sent someone
to stand guard at the palace entrance.

464
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:11,660
I will notify Your Majesty immediately
as soon as Her Majesty returns.

465
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:12,300
Sufang,

466
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:14,060
go and stand guard at the palace entrance.

467
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,660
Do not let Jinfeng come back.

468
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:16,900
Go now!

469
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:20,900
Her Majesty has returned.

470
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:21,660
Your Majesty.

471
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,130
Yunzhang, were you waiting for me?

472
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:25,370
Great timing. I have something to tell you too.

473
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:27,730
I was wrong for what I did last night.

474
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:28,610
You finally admitted it?

475
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:32,940
I didn't consider your feelings.

476
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:34,180
That's why I'm apologizing to you.

477
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:36,300
However, you were at fault too.

478
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:37,330
Nonsense!

479
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,180
Why did you shout at me?

480
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,700
I'm the ruler of the nation.

481
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:43,780
I will never be wrong.

482
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:44,700
Someone!

483
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:45,850
Yes, Your Majesty.

484
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:50,300
The Queen, Liu, had released Yu Changya.

485
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,300
Her sin is unpardonable.

486
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,900
From now on, she'll be demoted
to the rank of a commoner

487
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:56,060
and be expelled from the palace.

488
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,370
Duan Yunzhang, are you out of your mind?

489
00:25:58,940 --> 00:25:59,700
Your Majesty,

490
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:01,130
His Majesty has already made up his mind.

491
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:02,970
Why don't I see you off?

492
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:03,780
I won't leave.

493
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:05,610
I have to come when you summon me,

494
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:06,850
and now, I have to leave when you want me to?

495
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:08,020
Who do you take me for?

496
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:14,970
You were a spouse force-fed to me
