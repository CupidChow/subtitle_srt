00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,570
♪And miss your hug♪

171
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:19,570
♪That's why I fuss over♪

172
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,830
♪The minute troubles with you♪

173
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,320
Stop drinking, Your Highness.

174
00:09:27,479 --> 00:09:28,719
It will look bad for you

175
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:30,440
if someone finds you drinking during the day.

176
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:31,799
So what if they do?

177
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,559
I would expose everything if they saw me.

178
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,039
I've had enough.

179
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,119
Your Highness.

180
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,599
Don't say that.

181
00:09:39,599 --> 00:09:41,239
You'll be able to go home

182
00:09:41,239 --> 00:09:42,679
if you found that formula.

183
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:43,919
The rest can go for it if they want.

184
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:44,880
Not me.

185
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,760
They are all going after it.

186
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,200
What are my chances?

187
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,080
Your Highness.

188
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:52,520
Please stop drinking.

189
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:54,119
Being drunk makes you blunder
and lose self-control.

190
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,719
Imagine how bad you will look

191
00:09:55,719 --> 00:09:56,679
if the Empress Dowager sees you.

192
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:58,400
I don't care.

193
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,320
I have nothing to lose.

194
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,200
I'm not scared of her.

195
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,599
Here comes the Empress Dowager.

196
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:06,799
Here. Drink it.

197
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:07,559
Come on.

198
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:10,119
This...

199
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,080
Hurry!

200
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:15,320
How many times have I told you?

201
00:10:15,599 --> 00:10:16,000
Being drunk makes you blunder
and lose self-control.

202
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,719
Dear Xu.

203
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,080
Why don't you ever listen?

204
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,320
My dear Xu.

205
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,239
Your Majesty.

206
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,919
What's going on?

207
00:10:22,599 --> 00:10:23,840
It reeks of alcohol here.

208
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,479
I'm sorry.

209
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,640
I caught her drinking

210
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,840
during the day.

211
00:10:29,359 --> 00:10:30,520
This is outrageous.

212
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,119
She needs to be punished.

213
00:10:31,359 --> 00:10:31,960
Yes.

214
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,119
She deserves it.

215
00:10:33,479 --> 00:10:34,359
I'll punish her right now.

216
00:10:35,359 --> 00:10:36,520
You... You shall...

217
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:37,599
All right.

218
00:10:37,599 --> 00:10:38,960
That can wait.

219
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,520
Why don't you go somewhere with me?

220
00:10:42,239 --> 00:10:43,080
Where?

221
00:10:44,119 --> 00:10:44,919
I heard

222
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:47,200
that Liu Xie's wife is staying in the palace
for some reason.

223
00:10:47,359 --> 00:10:49,119
Liu Xie is trying all he can

224
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,000
to persuade her to return.

225
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:52,320
A lot is going on.

226
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,119
Really?

227
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,440
We have to take a look.

228
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,599
Let's go.

229
00:11:09,719 --> 00:11:11,880
The hair cleanser from the palace
is indeed different.

230
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,960
It smells great.

231
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,799
If you like it,

232
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:15,320
you may bring some back with you.

233
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,000
Thank you.

234
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,479
The Empress Dowager has arrived.

235
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,919
Your Majesty, Your Highness.

236
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:27,359
I didn't know you are here.

237
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,960
I heard that the Grand Chancellor
is very worried

238
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,479
about your stay in the palace.

239
00:11:33,719 --> 00:11:35,840
That he often sends things over to you

240
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,440
worrying that you are not used to staying here.

241
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:39,760
I didn't know

242
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,840
the inexpressive Grand Chancellor

243
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,239
is actually a sweet husband.

244
00:11:43,359 --> 00:11:44,559
He's so thoughtful.

245
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:47,520
More like he worries too much.

246
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,280
The things in the palace are exquisite.

247
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,359
Just like that hair cleanser.

248
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,760
It's much better than what we have.

249
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:57,840
You...

250
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,520
What's wrong?

251
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I'm not allowed to use it?

252
00:12:00,239 --> 00:12:00,840
No.

253
00:12:01,119 --> 00:12:02,760
She even said I can bring some of them home.

254
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,159
Your hairdo...

255
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,880
It looks old-fashioned?

256
00:12:08,599 --> 00:12:09,359
No.

257
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:12,080
It's unique and beautiful.

258
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:12,919
Really?

259
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:16,239
What do you call this hairdo?

260
00:12:16,239 --> 00:12:17,719
I thought of it myself.

261
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:19,640
Scholar Yang from our village named it.

262
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,200
It's called Wuman hairdo.

263
00:12:21,359 --> 00:12:22,359
It's very easy.

264
00:12:22,359 --> 00:12:23,760
You can even do it yourself.

265
00:12:24,239 --> 00:12:25,000
What do you think?

266
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:25,919
Really?

267
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:28,760
Will it be trouble

268
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,239
if I wear that hairstyle?

269
00:12:30,479 --> 00:12:31,479
Of course not.

270
00:12:31,599 --> 00:12:32,679
It will look gorgeous.

271
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:33,640
I'll do it for you.

272
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:35,280
Very well then.

273
00:12:36,239 --> 00:12:36,840
Jinfeng.

274
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,559
I get along so well with your mother.

275
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:40,679
Do you mind if she stays in Qianluo Hall

276
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:41,799
for a couple of days?

277
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:43,440
Mother,

278
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,479
what do you say?

279
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:47,679
Let's go.

280
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:48,719
Sure.

281
00:12:48,719 --> 00:12:49,359
Let's go.

282
00:12:51,119 --> 00:12:51,559
Mother.

283
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:53,200
You can stay longer. No worries.

284
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,039
All right.

285
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:58,900
I heard that she is the new top scorer
of the imperial martial examination.

286
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,340
from Xiyue Empire,

287
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:01,500
the female general, Zhu Tan.

288
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,820
So, she's Zhu Tan

289
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,850
who made her name at the borderland.

290
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:08,650
I heard she is Xiyue Empire's
first female martial scholar

291
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:10,530
for the last 20 years.

292
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:18,060
Where's Grand Chancellor Liu?

293
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:21,420
Your Majesty,

294
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,210
Grand Chancellor Liu is to welcome

295
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:26,570
Xiyue Empire's emissaries
into the capital today.

296
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:29,420
They should be at the palace entrance now.

297
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,130
Why are they not here yet?

298
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:32,250
Your Majesty.

299
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,450
The emissaries are...

300
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:34,650
Are they here? Where are they?

301
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:35,500
They did arrive,

302
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:36,330
but...

303
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:37,300
But what?

304
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,060
But they went to
the Grand Chancellor's Residence.

305
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:41,130
What?

306
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:46,620
General.

307
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:47,980
Official Liu,

308
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:49,420
here are the gifts
from the Emperor of Xiyue Empire.

309
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,690
We hope you like it.

310
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:54,690
It's so kind of him.

311
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,380
This way, please.

312
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:01,300
Here.

313
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:19,060
Xiyue Empire practices equality
among men and women.

314
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,500
Not only men can take part in
the imperial martial examination,

315
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:22,810
women can, too.

316
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,740
General Zhu is the martial scholar this year.

317
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:26,980
The martial scholar.

318
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,060
It sounds terrific.

319
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,250
Not only that,

320
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,620
I heard that on the second day
she became the martial scholar,

321
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,620
she led an army

322
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:34,450
and wiped out the rebels.

323
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,890
She rose to fame with that battle
and now everyone knows her name.

324
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:40,810
She came to the capital this time

325
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:43,100
because of His Majesty.

326
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:43,980
For His Majesty?

327
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:44,860
What for?

328
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,540
Nothing.

329
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,860
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

330
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:52,650
It is a tradition of Xiyue Empire
for their generals

331
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:54,210
to visit the capital.

332
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,210
Don't worry.

333
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:58,690
The last female general who visited the capital

334
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,860
seemed to be 20 years ago.

335
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,210
And who was that?

336
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:04,450
It's Consort Li.

337
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:06,690
She married the Late Emperor not long after.

338
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:09,100
Your Majesty.

339
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,420
And you're asking me not to worry?

340
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:11,570
Your Majesty.

341
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,180
That's not what I meant.

342
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,690
You have nothing to worry about.

343
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:17,060
From what I know,

344
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:21,010
that scholar has a round face

345
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,890
and eyes with single eyelids.

346
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:25,250
As for her figure,

347
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:26,890
she's really built.

348
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,330
Oh, my goodness.

349
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:29,940
Your Majesty!

350
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:31,570
Where are you going?

351
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:32,500
Where else?

352
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,860
I have to go or it will be too late!

353
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:35,380
Your Majesty!

354
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:36,500
Wait for me!

355
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:37,570
Yunzhang.

356
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,250
I've seen her with my eyes.

357
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:42,100
Zhu Tan is robust.

358
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:43,250
She's tanned and stout.

359
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:44,250
I bet

360
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,060
that you've never seen a woman like her.

361
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:47,300
Come to think of it,

362
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,180
I think I've seen someone like her somewhere.

363
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:51,620
The point is not how she looks.

364
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,330
The point is

365
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:55,250
she has no respect for you at all.

366
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,380
She brought her entourage

367
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:59,520
to Liu Xie's residence.

368
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,650
What's more important is that

369
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:02,040
Liu Xie didn't refuse either.

370
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,840
He welcomed her with open arms.

371
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,680
Not only that,

372
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,210
Xiyue Empire has paid tribute to us
with so much jewelry,

373
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:09,840
but it all went into Liu Xie's possession.

374
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,090
The most important part is,

375
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,090
I heard that Liu Xie

376
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:16,210
is arranging a banquet
bigger than the national banquet

377
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:18,010
to welcome her.

378
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,360
What did Liu Xie say?

379
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,410
Your Majesty.

380
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:21,920
I did as you told

381
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,240
and asked him in his residence.

382
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,240
I asked, "Grand Chancellor,

383
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:27,840
the emissaries from Xiyue Empire
came all the way to Donghao Empire.

384
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:29,040
But they visited your residence first

385
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,410
instead of the palace.

386
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:31,800
Do you think that's appropriate?"

387
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,450
This is what he answered,

388
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:35,920
"What's wrong?

389
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:37,800
Did I invite them?

390
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,010
They were the ones
who wanted to visit my residence.

391
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,320
Do you expect me to chase them out?"

392
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:44,080
This is infuriating.

393
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:46,320
Yunzhang.

394
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,290
I think this is good timing.

395
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:49,810
Think about it.

396
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,690
Meeting an emissary
from another nation in private

397
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:52,810
is a capital offense.

398
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,770
Let's get rid of him right there.

399
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:55,650
Settle it

400
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,690
once and for all.

401
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,170
Do you think it's easy

402
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,080
to get rid of Liu Xie?

403
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:02,050
You made it sound so easy.

404
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:02,890
That's right.

405
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:04,930
His Majesty is a cautious man.

406
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,130
Go.

407
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,360
Where are you going, Yunzhang?

408
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,290
To Liu's Residence.

409
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:15,480
We are leaving the palace?

410
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:24,530
Where are you going?

411
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:25,290
You're leaving the palace?

412
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,130
How do you know?

413
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:26,930
To my father's place?

414
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,240
How did you know that too?

415
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:29,650
To meet General Zhu?

416
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,890
How do you know everything?

417
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:31,960
How dare you?

418
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,050
What about it?

419
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:33,930
Don't worry.

420
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:35,050
They can't do anything to me.

421
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:42,480
I will do something to you.

422
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,930
Our two guests have traveled so far

423
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:34,890
and brought me so many gifts.

424
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:36,480
I have nothing to repay

425
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,770
but some liquor to express my gratitude.

426
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:40,690
Here.

427
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,050
Official Liu,

428
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:50,480
we do things differently than you people.

429
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,130
We don't beat around the bush.

430
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:55,170
Yes, you are a straightforward person.

431
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:57,560
What are your requests?

432
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,240
Our Lord has given a decree.

433
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,930
Marriage alliance, cession,

434
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,770
and the name list.

435
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:04,530
If you can fulfill all of these,

436
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:05,810
he will assist you

437
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:07,080
in achieving what you want.

438
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:08,480
Well...

439
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:10,320
You are a wise man.

440
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,410
Our Lord has also said

441
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,530
that you both have worked together
for many years.

442
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:13,890
You know each other very well.

443
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,770
With your power,

444
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:18,080
you should be able to fulfill our requests.

445
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,240
That's true.

446
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,410
But...

447
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,050
What is holding you back?

448
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,410
What if I don't want to?

449
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:31,170
He knew you would say that.

450
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:31,930
Therefore...

451
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:32,690
General.

452
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:34,320
That was merely a joke.

453
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,480
Please don't take it seriously.

454
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:37,560
He got it wrong.

455
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,410
Why would I say no?

456
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:40,410
Don't worry.

457
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:42,770
I intend to do so and I have the capability.

458
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,050
Why don't you also tell me

459
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:46,600
what you intend to do, Grand Chancellor?

460
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:48,890
You're here, Your Majesty.

461
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,650
Allow me to introduce.

462
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,530
This is the Emperor of Donghao Empire.

463
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:53,290
Please give your regards.

464
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:02,240
The emissaries attended the banquet here

465
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,600
instead of entering the palace.

466
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:06,890
Perhaps the food served here

467
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:08,480
is better than the Imperial Palace's.

468
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,600
The chef in Liu Residence is my disciple.

469
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:16,240
You have misunderstood, Your Majesty.

470
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,560
We don't mean that.

471
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,320
It was late when we arrived in the capital.

472
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,530
We were afraid of interrupting,

473
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,560
so we decided to enter the palace tomorrow.

474
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:24,560
I hope you understand our concern.

475
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:25,410
Is that so?

476
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:28,080
General Zhu, I heard that you

477
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:30,080
brought abundant gifts on this trip,

478
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,410
and you also brought with you 3,000 warriors
from Xiyue Empire.

479
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:34,810
Are you thinking that the guards in our palace

480
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:35,810
are weak,

481
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:37,480
so you would like to fight them?

482
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,080
That's delusional!

483
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,050
Bring it on.

484
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:42,410
The warriors were to transport

485
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:43,840
the gifts, Your Majesty.

486
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:45,170
You worry too much.

487
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:48,050
All right.

488
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,050
I believe we have cleared the misunderstanding.

489
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:52,530
Everyone should be happy now.

490
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,530
General Zhu is not only physically strong,

491
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:59,770
but she is also good at talking.

492
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:02,010
She got away from such trouble

493
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,050
with just a few words.

494
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:06,290
What do you

495
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:07,480
take Donghao Empire and me for?

496
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:10,530
Jing.

497
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:11,810
That female general

498
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:13,010
looks like a familiar face.

499
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:15,810
Your Majesty.

500
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,410
Are you asking me?

501
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:19,690
Who are you?

502
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,170
I am Zhu Tan.

503
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:22,690
Your Majesty.

504
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:25,690
You are Zhu Tan?

505
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,290
That's right, Your Majesty.

506
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,130
I am indeed Zhu Tan.

507
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:32,810
Who are you?

508
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:35,130
I am the General of Vanguard, Li Liang.

509
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:39,360
If Your Majesty is unhappy about
what happened today,

510
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,890
it's our fault

511
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:42,010
for not knowing better.

512
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,170
It's late now.

513
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:46,810
Please return and get some rest, Your Majesty.

514
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,410
Tomorrow morning,

515
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:51,010
we will meet you in the palace

516
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:52,360
and apologize for our wrongdoing.

517
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:53,930
I beg for your forgiveness.

518
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:55,530
Yunzhang.

519
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:56,770
I think she has a point.

520
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:57,890
What are you saying?

521
00:21:58,170 --> 00:21:58,840
Your Majesty,

522
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,600
I think General Zhu is right.

523
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:04,410
That's all for today's banquet.

524
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:06,360
We shall take our leave.

525
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:10,010
Wait.

526
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,480
Wait for what?

527
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,360
It's late.

528
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,050
You may go.

529
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:21,890
What's the meaning of this, Grand Chancellor?

530
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,080
What do you mean?

531
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,810
I don't want you to embarrass yourself here.

532
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:28,170
The Emperor is trying to punish an emissary

533
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:29,890
at the Grand Chancellor's Residence?

534
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:31,560
Have you thought about

535
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:34,480
who will be benefited

536
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,770
and who will be embarrassed by this?

537
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,650
You are worried about my authority?

538
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,930
If I am not,

539
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:42,410
I would have sent someone to chase you out.

540
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,410
How insolent.

541
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:44,410
Right back at you.

542
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:48,050
Don't forget.

543
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:51,170
Who do the courtiers listen to?

544
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:54,480
Who does the army listen to?

545
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:58,170
Liu Xie.

546
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,240
I thought

547
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:04,050
my father has his reason
for leaving me with you.

548
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:06,410
But I understand now.

549
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:09,720
Your ambition is obvious.

550
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:13,290
You taught me to be a good man and a good ruler.

551
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,200
But you don't actually mean it.

552
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,440
Am I right?

553
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:20,290
You are right

554
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,720
but also wrong.

555
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:24,360
If I do intend to rebel,

556
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:26,410
what can you do about it?

557
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,810
But I meant what I taught you.

558
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:35,960
That's because I don't like to suppress the weak

559
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,130
as the stronger one.

560
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,410
I want to beat

561
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:41,290
the Emperor who has matured
into a fully capable ruler,

562
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:42,840
instead of a child emperor

563
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,810
who knows nothing.

564
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,530
It's late and he's not back yet.

565
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:01,840
This is nerve-wracking.

566
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:06,320
Is he really going to ignore me?

567
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,530
Your Majesty.

568
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:09,690
It's late.

569
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:11,200
We can wait until tomorrow.

570
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:11,770
No.

571
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:12,650
What if

572
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:13,960
he got seduced by Zhu?

573
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,010
Where are you going?

574
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:19,840
I have to show him who the real general is.

575
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:31,410
What is that sound?

576
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:32,770
Whatever.

577
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:33,930
I have more important things to do tonight.

578
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:30,810
Why are you sitting there with a dagger?

579
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:35,720
-You...
-You...

580
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:37,890
You first.

581
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:39,890
You say it first.

582
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:42,010
Why were you sitting there

583
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:42,770
holding a dagger?

584
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:44,050
It's because of you.

585
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:45,290
You think someone is trying to kill you?

586
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,290
Do you really think Liu Xie
might send someone to kill you?

587
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,810
I have to be cautious.

588
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,440
I don't think he will.

589
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:55,720
Why?

590
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:57,720
Since I was little, my mother has been saying

591
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,930
that my father is a good man.

592
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,650
Let me ask you.

593
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:04,320
One day,

594
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,290
if I decide to stand up against your father,

595
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,530
who will you side with?

596
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:11,170
I'll see how it goes.

597
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:12,720
I will side with the one who is good to me.

598
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:14,320
I'm being serious.

599
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,560
I'm here to ask you something serious, too.

600
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:20,170
What do you mean?

601
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,890
You had a long meeting with General Zhu.

602
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:23,840
What did you two talk about?

603
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,130
Nothing.

604
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,440
Nothing?

605
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,320
You both talked for so long.

606
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,410
There must be something.

607
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:30,530
There was really nothing.

608
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:32,010
No way. You have to tell me.

609
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:34,930
I said there was nothing.

610
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:36,530
You're being suspicious.

611
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:38,770
Whatever you think.

612
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:39,240
I'm going to bed.

613
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,240
I have to attend the assembly tomorrow.

614
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,690
No.

615
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:42,960
You have to tell me.

616
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:43,890
Spit it out.

617
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:44,320
About what?

618
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,480
Get up.

619
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:47,080
I will hit you with the pillow if you don't.

620
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,200
-Tell me!
-I...

621
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,050
Are you telling me or not?

622
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:50,240
Say it!

623
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:31,290
My lord.

624
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,840
You'll have to call me "Your Highness"

625
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,010
after these two hours.

626
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:39,960
Yes, Your Highness.

627
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:48,890
If you listen to me,

628
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,130
I will grant you

629
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,410
anything you want.

630
00:28:00,875 --> 00:28:05,450
We hope you accept our tribute.

631
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:08,775
[Hanyuan Hall]
We hope you accept our tribute.

632
00:28:08,775 --> 00:28:09,900
[Hanyuan Hall]

633
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:13,810
You may rise, General.

634
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:15,600
Your Majesty.

635
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,530
On the orders of our Lord,

636
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:19,170
we have brought a hundred fine horses,

637
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:20,130
a thousand cows and goats,

638
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,440
and ten thousand gold.

639
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:25,290
Your Majesty,

640
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:26,810
our Lord has also said

641
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,600
that the gifts this time

642
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:30,170
are not just a form of paying tribute,

643
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,010
but it is also a dowry.

644
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:34,480
Dowry?

645
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,240
Donghao and Xiyue have had
good relations for generations.

646
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:39,720
Marriage alliances were arranged many times.

647
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:43,690
Twenty years ago,
General Li married into the palace.

648
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:45,130
She married the Late Emperor

649
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,890
and gave birth to a successor.

650
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:48,200
But for the last 20 years,

651
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,720
this tradition seems to have been to a halt.

652
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:52,650
We find it regretful.

653
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,290
Thus, for our diplomatic relations,

654
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,930
I hope you accept the dowry.

655
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,810
And this dowry belongs to?

656
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,240
It's for me.

657
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,170
A marriage alliance?

658
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:13,440
I propose to marry Your Majesty as your consort

659
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:16,290
to maintain our diplomatic relations.

660
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,080
Your Majesty.

661
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,170
Your Majesty!

662
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,440
Your Majesty...

663
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,650
Bad news, Your Majesty!

664
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,690
What is it?

665
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,010
She's here, Your Majesty.

666
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:31,960
Who is?

667
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,360
The... The general is here.

668
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:34,530
The general?

669
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:38,200
Your Majesty,

670
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:42,240
it was our tradition
to have a marriage alliance.

671
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,770
But the Late Emperor had established a rule.

672
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,320
That Consort Li

673
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,600
will be the last consort from Xiyue Empire.

674
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:51,770
You must not take another wife.

675
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:52,320
Yes.

676
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:54,960
I still remember the rule by the Late Emperor.

677
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:56,290
Your Majesty.

678
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:56,840
Yes.

679
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:57,930
We have a report from outside the city.

680
00:29:57,930 --> 00:29:59,320
The 5,000 warriors from Xiyue Empire

681
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,840
refused to return after transporting the gifts.

682
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:02,530
They even built a base camp

683
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:04,200
and practiced martial art every day.
They can be heard even from far away.

684
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,050
They are clearly provoking us.

685
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:06,600
Your Majesty.

686
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:07,720
I think

687
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:10,440
we can't just follow the past rules blindly.

688
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,480
Xiyue Empire's army is getting stronger.

689
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:13,840
It's bad timing

690
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,690
to go on a war with them now.

691
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:18,010
A mere army with 5,000 warriors

692
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,480
is enough to frighten you this much.

693
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,360
I suggest you quit the Minister of War.

694
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,440
Yunzhang.

695
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,530
We have an urgent report from the frontline.

696
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,290
It just arrived.

697
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:31,890
Read it.

698
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:38,840
Xiyue's army of 300,000 warriors
is marching toward the border of West Mountain.

699
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,440
They have been marching for more than 10 days.

700
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:42,960
We only have 30,000 soldiers on our side.

701
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,410
We are outnumbered.

702
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:45,600
We need your order, Your Majesty.

703
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:47,170
When will the backup arrive?

704
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:50,010
Do we go to war or not?

705
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,290
Your Majesty.

706
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:57,360
Do you have something to say?

707
00:30:58,650 --> 00:30:59,360
I think...

708
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,930
Your Majesty...

709
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:02,200
Bad news!

710
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:03,720
Say it.

711
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:05,560
It has begun.

712
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,130
What?

713
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,290
It has started!

714
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:16,530
Who exactly are you?

715
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:17,600
Why do you care?

716
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,930
I'm here for General Zhu.

717
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:20,930
I thought Donghao Empire
was a nation of etiquette.

718
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:21,930
I didn't know

719
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:23,600
there was a savage in the palace.

720
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,480
Savage?

721
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,440
You stole my husband
and you expect me to be nice?

722
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,170
I...

723
00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:28,050
What?

724
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:28,840
Ask Zhu Tan to come out.

725
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,010
Or I'll make you a cripple.

726
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,720
Go for it, Your Majesty!

727
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:41,770
Be careful, Your Majesty.

728
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:51,600
Go for it!

729
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:56,200
You can do it, Your Majesty.

730
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,560
General Zhu.

731
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,990
How long more do you plan to fight her?

732
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,390
You're General Zhu?

733
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:40,960
Your Majesty?

734
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,720
I can't hold it any longer.

735
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:48,230
Jinfeng!

736
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:14,840
Are you okay?

737
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:16,040
I'm okay.

738
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:21,840
Are you hurt?

739
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,320
I'm fine.

740
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:31,200
General Zhu,

741
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:33,230
the Queen is quick-tempered.

742
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,750
Please forgive her.

743
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,960
I wouldn't have fought you
if I had known earlier.

744
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,560
Sufang gave me the wrong information.

745
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:40,920
You look so different.

746
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,040
What did you imagine I look like?

747
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:46,200
Never mind.

748
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,590
This is fine. This is okay.

749
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,390
Your Majesty.

750
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:50,830
It's a pleasure meeting the Queen.

751
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,110
Don't you worry.

752
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,830
We will get along in the palace.

753
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:55,790
I won't put you on the spot.

754
00:33:57,790 --> 00:33:59,030
Sure, no problem.

755
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:00,960
What did you say?

756
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,960
Your Majesty has accepted the dowry,

757
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:04,240
I shall take my leave

758
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,870
and wait for the decree of the marriage.

759
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:05,240
Tighten your fist and swing it swiftly.

760
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:06,920
Like this.

761
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,160
Go.

762
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:16,070
Firm up your posture.

763
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,630
Your foundation is terrible.

764
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:19,000
I'm not like you.

765
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,870
You have a mentor and the time to practice.

766
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,720
I have to learn this in secret.

767
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:25,960
Or my father would scold me if he knew.

768
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,440
Master Zhu will be surprised

769
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:30,520
if his family of literary scholars

770
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:32,590
has a daughter like you.

771
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,720
You hate studying
and only want to learn martial arts.

772
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:36,280
There's no fun studying.

773
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,240
I want to be a martial scholar when I grow up.

774
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:10,790
You did well.

775
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,200
Thank you, Your Majesty.

776
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:14,110
It's about time.

777
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:16,280
I would like to see

778
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,390
what that young Emperor can do.

779
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,280
Everything is ready outside the city.

780
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,790
We will return to the camp.

781
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:22,200
What about...

782
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:24,070
Don't cross the line.

783
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:25,200
Yes.

784
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,200
I'm just worried that
if we don't return to the inn,

785
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:30,280
the young Emperor will get suspicious.

786
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:31,630
Let him be.

787
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,920
I can't wait for him to lead an army now.

788
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,590
I would like to see

789
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:37,830
if that old fox, Liu Xie

790
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:39,390
would overthrow the Emperor or not.

791
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:51,550
Your Majesty.

792
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:53,200
His Majesty is outside the hall.

793
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,760
Would you like to see him?

794
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:55,790
No.

795
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:58,760
The dessert is outside the hall, too.

796
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,790
Would you like to have some?

797
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:00,790
No.

798
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:04,280
Stop talking and stop being annoying.

799
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:17,720
Your Majesty, why don't just leave for now?

800
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:19,550
You can explain to her

801
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:20,960
after she calmed down a bit.

802
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:22,960
Your Majesty.

803
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:27,520
[Xiangluo Hall]

804
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,760
You're still here, Grand Chancellor.

805
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,480
My daughter is unhappy.

806
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:32,110
Of course

807
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,280
I'd have to come and have a look.

808
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,520
Do you have any good plans in mind?

809
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:43,390
You said

810
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:45,960
that you want to beat me
when I've become fully capable.

811
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,390
Let me tell you today.

812
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,790
You will regret this decision one day.

813
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:52,520
Because I will win.

814
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,160
Let's focus on our tasks today.

815
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:57,440
We haven't sorted out the main issue.

816
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,000
So let's not talk about other matters.

817
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,760
You want to persuade Jinfeng

818
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,110
to agree to the marriage, right?

819
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,070
It's impossible, Grand Chancellor.

820
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,480
Even if Jinfeng agrees,

821
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,760
I will not.

822
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:11,030
General Zhu is a rare beauty.

823
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,920
It's a good thing

824
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:14,630
if she gets into the harem as your consort.

825
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,440
Xiyue Empire has been sending so many women

826
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,390
into the capital for so many years.

827
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,520
They either work in the palace

828
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,550
or marry the officials.

829
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:24,440
Do you think I don't know

830
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,790
what's on their mind?

831
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,000
And now,

832
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:30,480
you want someone to watch me by my side.

833
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:34,440
Do you think I'll allow that?

834
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:38,000
You're not such a fool after all.

835
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,000
Grand Chancellor.

836
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,550
If you want to fight me,

837
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:45,830
please understand that

838
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,680
I'm no longer the naive child

839
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,590
from ten years ago.

840
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:52,440
You are absolutely right.

841
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:56,030
First, understand your enemy
before fighting them.

842
00:38:56,790 --> 00:38:57,520
