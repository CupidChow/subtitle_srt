It's no doubt she's Scorpion Liu's daughter.

that Her Majesty cares for Your Majesty a lot.

142

00:06:42,119 --> 00:06:43,160
It's my fault.

168
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,720
I've let you down.

169
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,399
It's fine.

170
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:48,279
Don't beat yourself up.

171
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:49,959
I'm sure you didn't mean it.

172
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:51,720
I can cook you

173
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,839
a whole pot of this, Your Majesty.

174
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:54,239
This is nothing.

175
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:55,920
I'm just sad that we have to waste the soup.

176
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:58,600
I'm sure you'll feel much better
after drinking this.

177
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,279
(I might die here.)

178
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:02,359
(How can this make me feel better?)

179
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,279
(She actually said these malicious words)

180
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:05,959
(so nonchalantly.)

181
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:07,880
(How brutal.)

182
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,399
I'm feeling much better now.

183
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:12,399
I appreciate what you did for me.

184
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:13,640
There will be plenty of chances in the future,

185
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,399
so I'll try your cooking next time.

186
00:07:16,799 --> 00:07:17,720
There is some soup left.

187
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,000
Why don't you finish them?

188
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,640
Why don't you drink it?

189
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,799
We're husband and wife.

190
00:07:21,799 --> 00:07:23,279
You can drink it on my behalf.

191
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:24,480
No, I don't need it.

192
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,399
I'm very healthy.

193
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:26,200
This is for you.

194
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,519
How dare you?

195
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,040
What's the matter?

196
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,079
You said I needed this.

197
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:33,720
Do you take me as a dead man?

198
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,640
I think you need some vitality water.

199
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,399
I got this from Xianpa Village.

200
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:41,600
Vitality water?

201
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,399
Vitality water is Xianpa Village's specialty.

202
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:45,079
It's made with the spring water
on Xianpa Mountain

203
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:46,720
and herbal extracts.

204
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,399
Drinking it can vitalize your body.

205
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:50,160
My mother got this for me.

206
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:53,839
Extend my gratitude to your mother.

207
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:54,959
Of course.

208
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:56,279
So why are you so upset?

209
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:01,559
I've never liked

210
00:08:01,559 --> 00:08:02,959
others calling me weak.

211
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:04,720
It makes me look bad.

212
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:07,399
So this is why you're upset.

213
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:08,679
You need to maintain your image
in front of others,

214
00:08:08,679 --> 00:08:09,839
but you need to take care of your health too.

215
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:11,000
Drink it.

216
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,440
Why are you drinking it?

217
00:08:19,239 --> 00:08:21,040
It's getting cold.

218
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,200
It's not easy to heat this up.

219
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,359
I can't waste the good stuff.

220
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,559
But it's fine.

221
00:08:25,559 --> 00:08:26,399
Luckily, my mother is smart enough

222
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:27,559
and get me an extra bottle.

223
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:32,119
It's been a while since I last saw my mother.

224
00:08:32,119 --> 00:08:33,479
I wonder how she's doing.

225
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,880
Is she eating well?

226
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,159
Is she sleeping well?

227
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,080
Has she caught the chicken thief?

228
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,520
You miss your mother?

229
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,039
This is the longest
I have been without my mother by my side.

230
00:08:44,719 --> 00:08:46,440
My mother only wanted the best for me

231
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,440
when she kicked me out of the village
and sent me to my father.

232
00:08:48,599 --> 00:08:50,039
However, she didn't manage to attend my wedding.

233
00:08:51,359 --> 00:08:53,440
It seems like you have a very good relationship
with your mother.

234
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:55,400
She's my mother.

235
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,280
Of course, we have a good relationship.

236
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,080
I don't know how that feels.

237
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,679
My mother passed away at a young age,

238
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,640
but my father was very fond of me
when I was little.

239
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,679
I remember how my father always brought me
out of the palace

240
00:09:09,239 --> 00:09:11,640
for the sunset on the nearby Qingcheng Mountain.

241
00:09:12,599 --> 00:09:13,840
The sun goes down,

242
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:15,799
and the moon rises.

243
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,119
The sunlight is scattered

244
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,359
over the beautiful clouds.

245
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,719
Let's go to Qingcheng Mountain tomorrow

246
00:09:20,719 --> 00:09:21,599
for the sunset.

247
00:09:21,719 --> 00:09:23,039
It can also be a chance for you to exercise

248
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:24,479
and get some fresh air.

249
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,640
It's for your good.

250
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,760
Hiking?

251
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,080
Are you trying to slack off?

252
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:29,080
I'm not.

253
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,359
I can practice the palace rules and etiquette

254
00:09:30,359 --> 00:09:31,239
as we hike.

255
00:09:32,119 --> 00:09:35,000
(Is she trying to lure me out of the palace)

256
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,559
(because she finds it difficult to hurt me
when we're in the palace?)

257
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,119
(Indeed.)

258
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,080
(She'll easily get discovered
if she tries to poison me in the palace,)

259
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,239
(but it's easy to plant assassins
outside the palace.)

260
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,520
Sure. I'll think about it.

261
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,840
But I have something to do later.

262
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,599
I'll get going.

263
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,520
Enjoy the soup.

264
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:02,119
I wonder how my mother is doing.

265
00:10:04,689 --> 00:10:09,919
[Xuanchen Hall]

266
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:10,559
Your Majesty.

267
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,200
Did Her Majesty do anything suspicious today?

268
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:13,520
Not really.

269
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,760
Tang.

270
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,159
I have a task for you.

271
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:17,000
Sure, Your Majesty.

272
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,280
Your Majesty.

273
00:10:23,479 --> 00:10:24,280
Can I ask for your permission

274
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,039
to delegate this task to someone else?

275
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:27,840
I would like to protect you personally

276
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:29,440
when you leave the palace tomorrow, Your Majesty.

277
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,239
No.

278
00:10:31,239 --> 00:10:32,400
I don't trust anyone else but you

279
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,599
regarding this matter.

280
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,599
I got it.

281
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,119
Your Majesty.

282
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,359
Have some tea.

283
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,520
Your Majesty.

284
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,320
This jade bottle looks really delicate.

285
00:10:56,599 --> 00:10:58,039
What's in here?

286
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,559
This is the medicine
from Imperial Physician Shen.

287
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:01,239
It's to cure His Majesty's asthma.

288
00:11:02,719 --> 00:11:04,479
Is this what you added to the soup

289
00:11:04,479 --> 00:11:05,760
you cooked for His Majesty?

290
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,159
No. It was something else.

291
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,599
How did you know

292
00:11:10,599 --> 00:11:12,200
that I added something to the soup?

293
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,159
I saw it by accident.

294
00:11:15,359 --> 00:11:16,599
If you didn't add this to the soup,

295
00:11:16,599 --> 00:11:18,000
what did you add?

296
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,039
Vitality water?

297
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,719
If there was this medicine, why didn't you use it?

298
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,440
I was going to use it.

299
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,000
But I decided not to on second thought.

300
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,159
His Majesty didn't want to drink it.

301
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:50,799
I worry that he might feel burdened
after drinking it.

302
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:52,479
That's why I decided
not to feed it to him discreetly.

303
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:53,919
I should respect his choice.

304
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,200
Respect his choice?

305
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,640
Your Majesty.

306
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,960
According to Her Majesty,

307
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,440
she wanted to respect your choice.

308
00:12:14,119 --> 00:12:15,320
Is that really what she said?

309
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:30,559
Your Majesty.

310
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:31,799
It's time to wake up, Your Majesty.

311
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:35,760
It's still early. Let me stay in.

312
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,320
Wake up, Your Majesty.

313
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,359
His Majesty is waiting for you outside the hall.

314
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:40,919
He's bringing you to the mountain.

315
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,760
It's too early for the mountain.

316
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,880
It's sinful to disturb others' sleep.

317
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:46,919
Fine.

318
00:12:47,119 --> 00:12:49,440
His Majesty
is going to Qingcheng Mountain by himself.

319
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,479
Go ahead.

320
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:52,200
What's so special about Qingcheng Mountain?

321
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,080
Did you just say His Majesty
is bringing me to Qingcheng Mountain?

322
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,760
Yes.

323
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,760
Are you going or not, Your Majesty?

324
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,400
Of course, I am.

325
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,440
Hurry up.

326
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,599
Get me my dress, Sufang.

327
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,559
Xuan.

328
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,760
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

329
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:10,799
I didn't expect you

330
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:12,359
to take our casual conversation to heart.

331
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:14,679
It was decided on a whim.

332
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,200
In fact, I've been planning to do this
for a long time.

333
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,960
I've always wanted to go somewhere with you.

334
00:13:20,239 --> 00:13:22,359
Where are Shuan and Su Jingtang?

335
00:13:22,359 --> 00:13:23,760
Aren't they always with you?

336
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,159
I allow them a day off.

337
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,200
What a coincidence.

338
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,679
I gave Sufang a day off too.

339
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,280
Great minds think alike.

340
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,400
What?

341
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,640
We get to spend time alone now.

342
00:13:38,164 --> 00:13:40,325
[Grand Chancellor's Residence]

343
00:13:42,359 --> 00:13:43,039
Sir.

344
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,080
An hour ago,

345
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,080
His Majesty and Her Majesty

346
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,359
set off to the Qingcheng Mountain.

347
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,080
Qingcheng Mountain?

348
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:48,719
Yes.

349
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,880
Bring a few men there with you.

350
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,440
Sure.

351
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,159
Qingcheng Mountain?

352
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,760
Xuan.

353
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,479
I didn't know we could do this.

354
00:14:28,479 --> 00:14:29,679
The horses are doing the walking on our behalves.

355
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,840
The Emperor does know how to enjoy life.

356
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,320
I guess this is new to you.

357
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,799
Going up the mountain in a horse carriage

358
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:36,559
and walking down the mountain after the sunset.

359
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:38,520
That's the best way to travel.

360
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:41,320
You do know how to enjoy life.

361
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,919
You're dismissed.

362
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:03,679
Don't disturb us.

363
00:15:08,479 --> 00:15:10,239
Now I know why
your father always brought you here.

364
00:15:10,239 --> 00:15:11,239
It's so beautiful here.

365
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:15,320
(Xuan,)

366
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,520
(I was right.)

367
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,520
(Xuan wanted to spend time alone with me.)

368
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,440
(How romantic.)

369
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,159
(Handsome guy, beautiful scenery, and nice music.)

370
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,520
(I'm so happy. It's too romantic.)

371
00:16:11,239 --> 00:16:13,239
(It's been two hours.)

372
00:16:13,479 --> 00:16:15,919
(How long more is he going to keep playing?)

373
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,840
(The music is nice, but this is too much.)

374
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,100
(I can't stand this any longer.)

375
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,540
(It's been more than an hour.)

376
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,020
(Why hasn't she taken any action yet?)

377
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,740
(What is she waiting for?)

378
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,100
The sunset is charming,

379
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,260
only that it's near dusk.

380
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,660
The mountain air is fresh day and night.

381
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,580
Together the birds return in flight.

382
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,860
Are you reading a poem, Xuan?

383
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,860
Picking the mulberry leaves

384
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,060
as I walk on the green path.

385
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:00,180
Good one.

386
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,340
The east wind is getting stronger,
while the sun is setting.

387
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:12,020
The flowers on the peach tree
blossom one after another.

388
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:14,020
It's a pity that flowers have fallen.

389
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:14,740
I wonder...

390
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,340
I wonder which house the moonlight will shine on.

391
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:18,460
How did you know about this poem?

392
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:20,460
You wrote it in the letter you sent me.

393
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:22,500
Oh, right.

394
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,780
I wrote it to you.

395
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,020
Not only can I recite the poem,

396
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,500
but I also know its meaning.

397
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,700
Every time I saw a poem that I didn't understand

398
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,820
in the letters you wrote me,

399
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:30,500
I would ask

400
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,340
a very smart friend of mine.

401
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,500
Take this poem for example.

402
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,260
The east wind is getting stronger
while the sun is setting.

403
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,580
It means

404
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,220
the sun is rising from the east.

405
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:38,860
That's enough.

406
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,340
If you're this smart,

407
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,580
let me ask you another question.

408
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,100
Let's see if you can tell me

409
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,220
what this sentence means.

410
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:45,940
Sure. Try me.

411
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,100
I'm very confident.

412
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:49,100
Rosy clouds fly with lone mallards side by side.

413
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,580
Autumn waters blend into the hues of the vast sky.

414
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,820
Autumn waters blend into the hues of the vast sky.

415
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,420
Get ready.

416
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,260
Watch for His Majesty's gesture.

417
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,300
Wait...

418
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:05,460
We don't know what bandits look like.

419
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,420
His Majesty told us

420
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,660
to make it look real.

421
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:09,740
I guess

422
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:11,580
we should just act like perverts.

423
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,100
Here.

424
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,660
You never wrote that in any letters you gave me.

425
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:21,820
Didn't I?

426
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,260
I remember I did.

427
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,460
You remember?

428
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,340
Didn't I return to you

429
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,340
all the letters you gave me?

430
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,340
Didn't you go through them?

431
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:32,020
I did.

432
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,340
What about the letters I wrote you?

433
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:34,260
Aren't they with you?

434
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,220
Where did you keep them?

435
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,100
I kept them...

436
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:39,500
Where?

437
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,540
Where?

438
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,220
I kept them there.

439
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,460
Right there.

440
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,180
Stay still.

441
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:49,100
Stay still.

442
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:49,780
All right.

443
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:50,460
Give me your money.

444
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:54,500
Stay still.

445
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:55,780
Let's see how things go.

446
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,540
Give me all your money.

447
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:58,620
Otherwise,

448
00:18:59,100 --> 00:18:59,780
I'll kill your lover.

449
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:00,900
Sure. It's just money.

450
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:01,620
I'll give you all I have.

451
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:02,820
Money is just a piece of paper.

452
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,860
I didn't bring any with me when I came out.

453
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:06,660
What about this?

454
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:07,980
My accessories are all made of silver.

455
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,260
You can take all you want.

456
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:10,500
You can take all of them.

457
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,060
Take off your clothes.

458
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:18,620
Now.

459
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,780
Or I'll kill your lover.

460
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,300
Bah! Never!

461
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,220
(I'm right.)

462
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,500
(She wants to kill me.)

463
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,100
Do it.

464
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:36,660
I'm a young and beautiful lady.

465
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,180
Now, you want me

466
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,380
to get naked before my husband.

467
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,460
I will never do that.

468
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:42,020
I'd rather you kill me now.

469
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:00,580
Put down your knife.

470
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,420
Don't come after me.

471
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:05,700
Yu Changya?

472
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,340
Let me go.

473
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,300
Let me go now!

474
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,620
Help!

475
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:16,020
Let me go.

476
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,380
Xuan.

477
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,500
That's enough. Stop looking at them.

478
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,100
You don't know any martial arts. Let's go.

479
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,100
Hurry up!

480
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,420
Run!

481
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,380
Stop looking back. Run!

482
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,020
Hurry up! This way.

483
00:20:58,660 --> 00:20:59,420
Quick.

484
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,100
Here.

485
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:24,700
Xuan.

486
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,660
How did you manage to escape from the bandits?

487
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:27,900
We're fine now.

488
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,620
I'm moved by the fact that you tried to save me.

489
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,420
Xuan.

490
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,540
Xuan, what's the matter?

491
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:34,900
You hurt your hand.

492
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,460
Are you having an asthma attack?

493
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,460
Did I run too fast?

494
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:42,740
It has nothing to do with you.

495
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,060
Get up.

496
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,100
Get up now.

497
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,220
What do we do now?

498
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:47,260
Xuan.

499
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:48,700
Xuan.

500
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,500
What do I do now?

501
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,340
Help!

502
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,660
Anyone, please.

503
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:54,940
What do I do now, Xuan?

504
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:59,180
Help! Hang in there, Xuan.

505
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:03,220
Help.

506
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:12,540
Xuan.

507
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,100
Hang in there.

508
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,380
Where am I?

509
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:58,220
Jinfeng.

510
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,380
Jinfeng.

511
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:02,300
Jinfeng.

512
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,380
Coming.

513
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,140
Coming.

514
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:05,780
You're finally awake.

515
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:08,180
I found you some wild fruits.

516
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,100
I thought you might be hungry.

517
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:09,580
Here.

518
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,780
How's your asthma?

519
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:12,860
I'm feeling much better now.

520
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:15,460
Stay still.

521
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:20,300
What are you doing?

522
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,340
What are you doing?

523
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:23,620
I'm chewing the herbs for you.

524
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:25,580
Are you trying to...

525
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:26,580
No.

526
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:29,580
Please don't.

527
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:30,380
It's fine.

528
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,060
I'm fine.

529
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:35,060
These herbs can stop bleeding
and help with your bruises.

530
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:37,020
Apply this and your wound will heal very soon.

531
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:39,340
It's full of your filthy saliva.

532
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:39,980
Stay still.

533
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,020
Here.

534
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:52,900
Wrap it up.

535
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:53,860
Then, you won't see it.

536
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:54,860
Out of sight, out of mind.

537
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,060
Have some wild fruits.

538
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,420
I'll get you some food.

539
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:01,500
What fruits are these?

540
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,620
Are they poisonous?

541
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,340
Have you washed them?

542
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,580
Just eat it. It's fine.

543
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:09,860
Great.

544
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,900
It's said that there is a famous lady

545
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:14,580
in Baihua Brothel.

546
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:16,060
Her name is Hua Mudan.

547
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:16,780
Mr. Yu.

548
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,540
If you ever let your emotions get in the way

549
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,540
and act recklessly again,

550
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,460
the Grand Chancellor
might not want to keep working with you.

551
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:28,540
When I was in Qingcheng Mountain this morning,

552
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:30,380
I helped Heipang

553
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,780
because I saw that she was in danger.

554
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:33,460
However,

555
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:35,980
if you're talking about the alliance,

556
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:39,340
please relay my words to the Grand Chancellor.

557
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:41,580
It's better he brings me to the palace soon,

558
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,620
or I'll force my way in.

559
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:46,660
You're too willful to be allowed into the palace.

560
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:47,540
I think...

561
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:50,860
I'm not interested in what you think.

562
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,420
Tell the Grand Chancellor

563
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,620
that I need him a lot,

564
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:57,660
but similarly, he needs me a lot too.

565
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:58,940
Mr. Zhang...

566
00:24:58,940 --> 00:24:59,540
You...

567
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:02,260
He spent all his assets,

568
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:05,220
just so he could take a glance at the beauty.

569
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:08,220
Nice one.

570
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,980
Unfortunately, the brothel keeper
was standing in their way.

571
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,340
She refused to let the two meet up.

572
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:17,300
This made Hua Mudan really anxious.

573
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,540
Not only can I recite the poem,

574
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:19,900
but I also know its meaning.

575
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,140
Every time I saw a poem that I didn't understand

576
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,260
in the letters you wrote me,

577
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,060
I would ask

578
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,900
a very smart friend of mine.

579
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,060
Take this poem for example.

580
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,980
The east wind is getting stronger,
while the sun is setting.

581
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,540
The east wind is getting stronger,

582
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,860
and the sun is setting in the west.

583
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:38,140
I wonder which house the moonlight will shine on.

584
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:46,060
Do you not know what this means too?

585
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:51,980
The author has no idea where the petals will fall,

586
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:53,900
and where the moonlight will shine on.

587
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:12,020
Where will the petals fall,

588
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:16,340
and which house will the moonlight shine on?

589
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,220
I have a very hot temper, so I'm not cold.

590
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,460
You're weaker, so you should keep this.

591
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:01,460
Be careful not to catch a cold.

592
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:02,300
Wear this.

593
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,220
Let me help you with it.

594
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,500
Is it too tight?

595
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:07,300
I'll loosen it up.

596
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:13,020
You're not upset anymore.

597
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:13,940
You're even smiling.

598
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:16,660
It's nothing.

599
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,420
I suddenly recall

600
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:23,060
how my father used to help me with my cloak
when I was little,

601
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,060
like what you just did.

602
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:25,780
He tied it really tightly,

603
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:27,820
as he was afraid that I might catch a cold.

604
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:33,180
My father would give me

605
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,860
everything I liked,

606
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:38,940
and he didn't even really punish me
when I made mischief.

607
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:41,300
You were cosseted by your father.

608
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,820
You don't look like you would make mischief.

609
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:46,260
You're so good with the palace rules.

610
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:48,820
I owe that to your father.

611
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,580
My father?

612
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,060
If wasn't for him
who forced me to learn those rules,

613
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:55,180
I wouldn't have learned them properly.

614
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:58,420
Are you saying that my father forced you
to learn the rules?

615
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,340
But my father sent Baiyu to tell me

616
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,820
not to take palace rules so seriously.

617
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:03,980
He said I should just treat it as casual learning.

618
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,260
Perhaps,

619
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,220
he thinks that the Emperor is different.

620
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:10,380
It's either that, or he was deliberately
making things difficult for me.

621
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:14,060
Just like what I expected,
Scorpion Liu has been bullying you.

622
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,100
Don't worry, Xuan.

623
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,380
You have my support
if you want to stand up against him.

624
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,340
If it wasn't for the Grand Chancellor

625
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,980
who insisted that you are his daughter,

626
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:25,980
I wouldn't have believed it.

627
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,340
How could you side with an outsider?

628
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,020
You're Xuan,

629
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,140
also my husband.

630
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,500
You're not an outsider.

631
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,540
Moreover,

632
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:35,140
it's always Scorpion Liu's fault.

633
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,220
I'll stand up for anyone

634
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,500
who gets bullied by him.

635
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,700
Stop acting tough.

636
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:46,660
Here.

637
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:48,460
Let's share it.

638
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:51,180
This can keep me warm.

639
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,420
It's warmer to stay together

640
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,060
than to be alone.

641
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:56,940
You're really knowledgeable.

642
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:00,740
I hope no one will find us.

643
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,580
Then, we'll get to spend another day together.

644
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:04,420
We can skip the relative banquet
the day after tomorrow too.

645
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:07,420
(It seems like
she isn't working with Scorpion Liu.)

646
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,860
(Otherwise, she would've tried to hurt me by now.)

647
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,860
(She has been rather genuine when she's with me.)

648
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:13,820
(It doesn't seem like
she's hiding anything from me.)

649
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:15,900
Indeed.

650
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:18,060
We don't need to attend
the relative banquet anymore.

651
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,940
We don't need to meet relatives either.

652
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:22,820
However, your mother
might get a little disappointed.

653
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:24,700
How so?

654
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,980
She comes all the way here
for the relative banquet,

655
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,740
but she doesn't get to meet her daughter.

656
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:29,660
Of course, she'll be disappointed.

657
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,340
My mother is attending the relative banquet?

658
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:34,740
If everything goes as planned,

659
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,380
I think Tang is now at Xianpa Village

660
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:37,340
picking up your mother.

661
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:40,180
Then, I must attend the banquet.

662
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:41,980
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

663
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,740
Were you trying to give me a surprise?

664
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,940
(Now that you're no longer a suspect,)

665
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,860
(I'll just do this for you.)

666
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:50,780
(Just take it as a token of appreciation
for what you've done for me today.)

667
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,980
Xuan, you're too nice.

668
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,020
Thank you.

669
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,540
I need to start working now.

670
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:59,220
What are you up to now?

671
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:00,940
I'm going to learn the palace rules.

672
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:02,500
I am not going to let my mother down.

673
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:05,780
I'm tired.

674
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:06,900
We'll continue tomorrow.

675
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:08,540
No.

676
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:10,500
You're my teacher, so you have to supervise me.

677
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,420
Watch me.

678
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:14,260
You're really something.

679
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,620
I've never seen you this keen before.

680
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:19,420
Chin up, chest out.

681
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:20,580
Take small steps forward.

682
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:25,420
Greet.

683
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:27,980
Walk.

684
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:29,340
What about this?

685
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,500
Is this the right pace?

686
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:36,740
Your Majesty.

687
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:37,660
Your Majesty.

688
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:39,180
Your Majesty.

689
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,460
Your Majesty.

690
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:41,660
Your Majesty!

691
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:42,900
Your Majesty!

692
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:47,580
Wake them up.

693
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,020
Your Majesty, time to wake up!

694
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:52,220
It's morning again.

695
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:56,380
Let's go back to the palace.

696
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:13,700
Your Majesty.

697
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:16,420
You started working on this decree
the moment you came back.

698
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:17,540
Did something happen out there?

699
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:18,180
No.

700
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:20,180
I think

701
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:21,700
I can't give up so easily.

702
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:23,620
I'm going to deliver this decree

703
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:24,820
and tell the Censorate to carry out
a thorough investigation

704
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:26,060
regarding Xie Jun's case.

705
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:27,940
Your Majesty.

706
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:29,300
Your Majesty.

707
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,900
The Censorate just submitted this memorial.

708
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:32,660
Give it to me.

709
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:40,900
It's from Censor Zhang.

710
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:42,940
Censor Zhang is indeed a loyal man.

711
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:44,340
I haven't even sent out the decree yet,

712
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:45,420
but he sent a memorial...

713
00:31:47,891 --> 00:31:51,475
[Your Majesty, please allow me
to resign from my position as the Censor.]

714
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:54,940
"I volunteer to guard the border of the nation."

715
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:55,940
Your Majesty.

716
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:59,940
Censor Zhang has left the imperial city
with his entire family.

717
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,220
He has left the imperial city?

718
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:04,420
Liu Xie.

719
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:06,740
It must be Liu Xie's doing!

720
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,380
Your Majesty.

721
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:12,660
It's time to attend the assembly.

722
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:13,700
I don't care about the assembly.

723
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:18,140
Your Majesty.

724
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:21,700
Let's attend the assembly.

725
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,260
Sufang.

726
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:32,940
My mother will be here tomorrow.

727
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:34,420
What should I get her?

728
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,620
Should I bring all of these?

729
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:38,620
But how is she supposed to carry everything home?

730
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:40,940
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

731
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:42,180
We can always use a carriage

732
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:44,340
if there is too much stuff.

733
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:46,420
Yes. We can send a carriage there.

734
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,460
Like what Xuan did.

735
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:49,260
He doesn't go up the mountain with his own legs,
but with horses.

736
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:50,460
I should've learned it sooner.

737
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,460
Too bad.

738
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:54,180
I'll get them to pack everything up.

739
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,460
Sure. Pack all of them.

740
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:02,300
Sufang.

741
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:03,980
I have something to ask you.

742
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:04,660
What nice food and fun stuff

743
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:05,860
can I get in the palace?

744
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:06,660
When my mother is here tomorrow,

745
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:07,860
I want to show her around.

746
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:09,420
Nice food?

747
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:12,260
Imperial Chef Chai
is one of the best cooks in the world.

748
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:14,620
Maybe he can cook for your mother.

749
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,580
His cooking lacks flavor.

750
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:17,820
I'm sure my mother won't like it.

751
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,860
Then, maybe Your Majesty can bring Madam
to Yufang Garden.

752
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,380
The flowers have just blossomed,

753
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:23,260
and they make the place really beautiful.

754
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:24,940
What's so nice about Yufang Garden?

755
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:25,740
It's too small.

756
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,980
I should bring you to Xianpa Village one day.

757
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:29,660
It's the harvest season for rapeseed.

758
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:30,660
The view is spectacular.

759
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:33,460
What about the Astronomical Observatory?

760
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:34,980
You can overlook the entire palace from there,

761
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,100
and at the same time,
enjoy the view of the back mountain.

762
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,780
It takes more than 200 steps to reach the top.

763
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:39,660
Are you trying to tire my mother out?

764
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:41,260
Sorry, Your Majesty.

765
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,900
That is all I could think of.

766
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:43,860
Forget it.

767
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,420
I'll ask Xuan later.

768
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,380
Why is Xuan not back yet?

769
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:48,580
The court assembly should've ended by now.

770
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:50,180
I think His Majesty will be here soon.

771
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:51,460
Your Majesty,

772
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:53,780
while we're waiting for His Majesty's return,

773
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:55,700
let's practice for tomorrow's relative banquet.

774
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:57,660
There's no need for any practice.

775
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:58,980
Thanks

776
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:00,820
to Xuan's guidance,

777
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,820
I have already memorized the palace rules

778
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,820
and mastered the etiquette.

779
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,980
All I have to do now is to get as much rest

780
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:07,580
as I can.

781
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:08,660
Really?

782
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,900
Then, I can rest assured.

783
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:13,420
Look at how confident you are, Your Majesty,

784
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,780
I'm sure you've memorized
the names of all the imperial family members.

785
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:17,620
Imperial family?

786
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,460
It's just a few names.

787
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:21,660
I can memorize them tomorrow morning.

788
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:22,580
It's going to be fine.

789
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:23,820
Your Majesty.

790
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,540
I think it will be too late by then.

791
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:27,620
How many family members does he have?

792
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:30,460
There are tens of them.

793
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:36,700
Long live Your Majesty.

794
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,220
Official Wang.

795
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,660
Introduce yourself to His Majesty.

796
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:51,340
I'm the newly-appointed censor, Wang Qian.

797
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:54,500
Wang Qian.

798
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:57,260
Your Majesty.

799
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:58,340
Out of all the officials,

800
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:01,540
I appointed Official Wang

801
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:04,500
as the former censor, Official Zhang's successor.

802
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:08,260
Please do a good job, Official Wang.

803
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:10,940
Don't let the Grand Chancellor down.

804
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,620
Yes, Your Majesty.

805
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:21,540
(Liu Xie has started to get rid of my right-hand men.)

806
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:24,220
(It looks like I have to take action too.)

807
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:31,100
Yunchong.

808
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:31,900
Yunzhang.

809
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:33,340
Have you got me what I wanted?

810
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:35,860
You're talking about...

811
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:37,580
Eagle hunting.

812
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:40,380
Come with me.

813
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:43,940
Yunzhang.

814
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:46,020
It's here.

815
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:47,380
Here.

816
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:48,620
Interesting.

817
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:51,660
What do you think about it?

818
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:54,100
This is nice.

819
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,260
The arrow has been fixed on the bow,

820
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,420
and it's time to release it.
