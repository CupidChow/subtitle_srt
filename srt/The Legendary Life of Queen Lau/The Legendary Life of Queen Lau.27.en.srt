00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:34,910
Grand Chancellor Liu, your love
for Madam Yongfu is admirable.

335
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,790
I'll gift this formula to you then.

336
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:39,310
Consider it a favor from me.

337
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:01,460
What do you want?

338
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:02,670
Liu Baiyu.

339
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:05,380
I've figured something out lately.

340
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:08,380
What is it?

341
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:10,740
I, Duan Yunchong, cannot allow myself

342
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:12,380
to be partitioned by others at will.

343
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:14,100
I can't wed you just like that.

344
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:16,590
You mean

345
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,670
you're rejecting the betrothal?

346
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:19,710
Absolutely.

347
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:20,980
I...

348
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:23,220
You...

349
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:24,380
You said you would marry me,

350
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,590
and now you've changed your mind?

351
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:27,340
What do you take me for?

352
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:27,860
No, no.

353
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:28,860
That's not what I meant.

354
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,030
I'm not saying yes to the betrothal,

355
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:31,460
but that doesn't mean I won't marry you.

356
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:33,620
What I'm saying is,

357
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,670
I won't use the betrothal

358
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:37,220
to get you.

359
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,340
I will win your heart

360
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:40,790
with my charm and determination.

361
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,830
What do you think? Are you touched?

362
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,190
Well, don't be so quick to be moved by me.

363
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:46,830
I've got more in store for you.

364
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:50,340
Look at this.

365
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,460
What is it this time?

366
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:54,260
Come with me.

367
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:57,980
Here.

368
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:00,460
Press this.

369
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:06,220
No. Turn it that way.

370
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:09,500
This is odd.

371
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,070
It worked fine last time.

372
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:12,500
What's going on?

373
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:30,740
I... I didn't mean to do that...

374
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:33,460
Duan Yunchong!

375
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:35,950
I...

376
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:36,980
-I didn't do that on purpose...
-Get back here!

377
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:38,950
-Stop!
-Help!

378
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:39,910
Get back here!

379
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:44,670
I've found something.

380
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:45,710
It is as Your Majesty expected.

381
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:46,830
They were acquainted?

382
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:47,710
Yes.

383
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:48,830
According to my findings,

384
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:50,550
Yu Changya came from Xianpa Village as well.

385
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:52,710
They call him Overlord of Xianpa Village.

386
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:54,740
He is three years older than the Queen.

387
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:56,310
The two of them have known each other
since they were children.

388
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:57,980
There are even rumors...

389
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:00,740
Speak.

390
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:03,460
There are rumors claiming that they were

391
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,310
childhood sweethearts.

392
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:05,310
Not only had they confessed their love
to one another,

393
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:06,500
but they were even betrothed.

394
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,430
It was only due to the Grand Chancellor's doing

395
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,030
in marrying Her Majesty into the palace

396
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:13,430
that the couple was broken apart.

397
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:14,220
Are you finished?

398
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,260
Your Majesty!

399
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:19,260
I've found what you asked me to find out.

400
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:22,140
According to the reports
from the spies in the city,

401
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:23,830
the emissaries from the Xiyue Empire

402
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:25,430
have been wandering the city

403
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:26,590
in search of someone.

404
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:27,670
Who?

405
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:29,220
A mysterious man.

406
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:30,190
What do you mean?

407
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:31,950
It means he didn't find anything.

408
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:33,070
Did I tell you to speak?

409
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:35,430
Carry on.

410
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:36,460
Your Majesty.

411
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,830
There are all sorts of stories

412
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:40,670
about this mysterious man in the city.

413
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:41,500
Some say

414
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,310
he is the former Crown Prince
of the Xiyue Empire.

415
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:45,590
Others say

416
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:46,740
he is a long-lost illegitimate child

417
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,590
of the Emperor of Xiyue.

418
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,430
What's even more interesting is

419
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:52,310
there are rumors about the Emperor of Xiyue

420
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:54,030
having a falling-out with his queen.

421
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:56,590
The one that caused the falling-out
was said to be one of his trusted aides.

422
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,310
It's said that his aide

423
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:01,310
was very good-looking.

424
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,830
That he had a beguiling appearance!

425
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:03,740
Don't talk nonsense.

426
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:06,310
What?

427
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:07,830
Get out.

428
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:08,950
Your Majesty,

429
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:09,950
I'm not finished yet.

430
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:10,830
-I...
-Get out!

431
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:12,670
-Go on.
-Shoo.

432
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:13,740
-Hurry up.
-What's the matter?

433
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:14,430
Go on.

434
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:18,980
Yu Changya...

435
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:25,590
What has gotten into His Majesty lately?

436
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,550
Did I do something wrong?

437
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:31,220
Tie,

438
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:32,830
what is this?

439
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:34,380
A branch.

440
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:37,070
What's on the branch?

441
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:38,710
Leaves.

442
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:40,550
What color are they?

443
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:41,310
Green.

444
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:43,380
That's right. Remember this.

445
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:46,550
This is His Majesty's
most despised color right now.

446
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:47,500
Why?

447
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,550
In any case, just remember

448
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:51,910
to avoid serving something green

449
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:52,790
to His Majesty for the time being.

450
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:54,140
If you aren't careful,

451
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,910
you might lose your head.

452
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:57,950
What happened?

453
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:01,140
You... Why are you smirking?

454
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:03,220
Was I?

455
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,670
Yes. You were grinning.

456
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,710
Oh, Tie, you don't know.

457
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:10,190
It won't be long
before His Majesty comes to realize

458
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:13,380
that we are the ones who truly love him.

459
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,220
What does that mean?

460
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:20,030
Wait! What do you mean?

461
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,300
[Crown Prince]

462
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:54,070
Have you delivered it?

463
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:54,590
Yes.

464
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,910
But I don't understand.

465
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,310
Why would you let him know

466
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:00,070
that we are aware of his identity,
Your Highness?

467
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:03,380
Shouldn't we inform the Xiyue Empire first?

468
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:05,140
I don't know either.

469
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:08,460
It can't hurt

470
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,670
to leave a way out for myself.

471
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,710
We found a lot of mushrooms today, Mother.

472
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:21,190
Look.

473
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:23,380
I'll make you chicken mushroom stew tonight.

474
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:24,590
It'll be delicious.

475
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:28,030
Did you hear something, Mother?

476
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:29,910
So what?

477
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:32,070
We're not the only ones who can come here.

478
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:36,790
It's not a wolf, is it?

479
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,340
It is a wolf!

480
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,430
Mother! Run!

481
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:50,670
Run! Mother!

482
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:51,740
Mother!

483
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,550
Why aren't you running?

484
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,310
My legs are weak.

485
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:57,070
I can't run...

486
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,340
Yunzhang!

487
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,950
Save us, Yunzhang!

488
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:02,860
Son-in-law!

489
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:04,030
-Yunzhang!
-Son-in-law!

490
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:05,340
Save us!

491
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,070
-Hurry!
-Son-in-law!

492
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:09,910
Mother!

493
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:17,590
Mother!

494
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:42,620
Mother...

495
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:55,590
The Grand Chancellor is
getting bolder and bolder.

496
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:57,500
Not only did he not greet Your Majesty,

497
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:58,860
but he actually carried a sword into the palace.

498
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:04,910
-Grand Chancellor.
-Grand Chancellor.

499
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:06,430
Grand Chancellor.

500
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:07,310
Yu Changya!

501
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:09,950
Grand Chancellor.

502
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:16,790
Liu Xie...

503
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:20,220
Give her to me.

504
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:21,830
What?

505
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:24,500
Give her to me, and you'll live!

506
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:26,070
Who are you talking about?

507
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:43,950
Your Majesty,

508
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:46,620
I don't think it'll be easy
to get out like this.

509
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:47,670
You're right.

510
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:48,980
But don't worry. I have an idea.

511
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:50,500
What is it?

512
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:54,790
No way.

513
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:56,070
Don't worry. It'll work.

514
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:57,380
I can't do it, Your Majesty.

515
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:59,220
Well, you have to do it either way.

516
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:06,620
What's the matter, Miss Sufang?

517
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,910
I feel lightheaded all of a sudden.

518
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:10,100
Could you help me

519
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,670
get over there?

520
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:12,860
All right.

521
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:16,380
What's the matter?

522
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,030
I'm a little thirsty.

523
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:19,550
Do you have any water?

524
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,380
Get some water for her.

525
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:22,140
All right.

526
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,100
Your Majesty!

527
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:36,380
I think something big happened!

528
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:37,910
If something happened, then something happened.

529
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:39,220
If nothing happened, then nothing happened.

530
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,830
What do you mean by something big happened?

531
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:42,860
Well, it's hard to explain.

532
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:43,670
This morning,

533
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:45,950
Grand Chancellor Liu mobilized
half of the Jingji Battalion.

534
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:49,860
You call that nothing big?

535
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:51,100
Let me finish, Your Majesty.

536
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:53,380
He did mobilize all those troops.

537
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:54,500
But he didn't do anything.

538
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:55,670
He just had them

539
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:57,590
comb the capital over for something.

540
00:26:58,980 --> 00:26:59,910
For what?

541
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,220
I don't know.

542
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:02,340
But I heard

543
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:04,740
he seemed to have lost something important.

544
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:05,460
Your Majesty.

545
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,670
What do you think it is?

546
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:08,860
Why would he need all those people?

547
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:10,620
Half of a battalion.

548
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,310
That's enough to attempt a coup,

549
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:13,190
isn't it?

550
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,620
Well, maybe not that far.

551
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,380
After all, we still have

552
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,740
a thousand imperial bodyguards.

553
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:25,380
Something important...

554
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:30,140
Be extra careful when you serve him.

555
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,310
Your master's temper

556
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:32,380
is no joke.

557
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:33,310
Yes, Madam.

558
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:34,220
Have them

559
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,460
clean her room.

560
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,260
Yes, Madam.

561
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:38,310
Who do you think

562
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:39,980
took her away?

563
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,590
I told you to watch your mouth.

564
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:44,070
What if someone overheard you?

565
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:47,340
Come on.

566
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:48,100
Yes.

567
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:50,030
Mother...

568
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:51,790
Where did you go?

569
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:03,020
[Zhuque Gate]

570
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:49,500
Drink this.

571
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,620
You'll feel better.

572
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:51,710
Here.

573
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:52,950
Be careful. It's hot.

574
00:28:58,910 --> 00:28:59,790
It still hurts.

575
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,620
Where else does it hurt?

576
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:03,980
My heart.

577
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:06,910
Leave us.

578
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:12,790
What exactly happened?

579
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:15,910
My mother is missing.

580
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,380
Your mother is missing?

581
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:22,380
They say she was taken by bad guys.

582
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,830
Why would they take her away?

583
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,670
Apart from Mr. Wang,

584
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:28,740
Madam Zhang,

585
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,030
Madam Wu, and Mr. Li in our village,

586
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:31,500
and

587
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,670
Madam Cai and Madam Bao
from the village next to ours,

588
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:34,380
and the poultry seller and fishmongers,

589
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,070
she doesn't have any other enemies.

590
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:39,500
Did she make that many enemies?

591
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:41,260
Shut up.

592
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:43,790
Calm down.

593
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:47,710
She is the wife
of the Grand Chancellor, after all.

594
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:48,910
Who would dare to lay a hand on her?

595
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:50,590
What are you talking about?

596
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:51,500
She is my mother!

597
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,070
She is missing! Of course, I would be worried!

598
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:58,460
You're the Emperor.

599
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:00,190
You can find her, right?

600
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:00,790
Yes.

601
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,190
But

602
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:03,710
this might be more complicated than you think.

603
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:04,790
Think about it.

604
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,590
Someone dared to take your mother away.

605
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:08,430
It can't be personal.

606
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:10,460
It must have to do with state affairs.

607
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:12,070
I can't act recklessly.

608
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:14,830
To you, she is Liu Xie's wife.

609
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:17,030
To me, she is my mother.

610
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:19,260
I know.

611
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:21,740
I'm trying to figure it out now, aren't I?

612
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:29,620
That's the face.

613
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:31,550
That's the exact face

614
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:33,030
I saw it in my dream.

615
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:33,590
What...

616
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:35,500
What... What face?

617
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:37,830
Leave. Get out.

618
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:38,550
What's wrong?

619
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:40,260
If you won't save her, I'll save her myself.

620
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:41,830
Wait... What dream?

621
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:42,860
I didn't say I wasn't going to save her.

622
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:43,550
Leave!

623
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:45,710
If you won't save her, I'll save her myself!

624
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:50,950
What dream?

625
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:52,550
What a temper.

626
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:07,590
Are you telling the truth?

627
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:10,190
I swear by Xiyue

628
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:12,740
that I didn't lay a finger on Madam Fu.

629
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:15,740
Think about it.

630
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:17,380
What good would that do me?

631
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:18,710
I would have to have a death wish

632
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,380
to do such a foolish thing.

633
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:21,030
One day.

634
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:23,310
I'll give you a day's time

635
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:24,740
to find her.

636
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:27,070
If not, I'll hold you responsible!

637
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:29,430
You're being unreasonable!

638
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:31,190
Yes, I am!

639
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,140
So what?

640
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:45,340
Master.

641
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:46,980
Find someone for me.

642
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,260
As you wish.

643
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:54,590
Liu Xie's wife is missing.

644
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:56,590
Find out where she is.

645
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:57,830
Understood.

646
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:58,500
Also,

647
00:31:59,030 --> 00:31:59,790
find out

648
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:02,140
who did it.

649
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,460
I want to know which idiot

650
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:06,220
dared to do such a thing under our noses.

651
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:08,190
You...

652
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:10,430
You...

653
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,310
Go on.

654
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,590
I'm finished, Master.

655
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:17,590
Master,

656
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:18,950
I mean...

657
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:21,340
You are that idiot.

658
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:24,710
What?

659
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:26,980
You captured Yongfu.

660
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,070
Me?

661
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:32,380
When did I do that?

662
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:33,710
Why would I do that?

663
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:35,740
Didn't you have them send me a message

664
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:38,220
telling me to capture her
so that we can force Liu Xie

665
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:39,860
to free Muyan Palace?

666
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:45,230
We've been set up.

667
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:46,420
Where is she right now?

668
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,750
Inside Muyan Palace's secret room.

669
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:51,950
I'll let her go right now.

670
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:52,900
Hold on.

671
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:55,900
Do not harm her.

672
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:00,260
But don't let her go yet.

673
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,900
Since we have her,

674
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:06,020
we might as well make use of her.

675
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:31,140
You won't lock me up, but you won't let me go.

676
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,350
What is the meaning of this?

677
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:37,500
And you're ignoring me again.

678
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:48,070
What are you guys talking about?

679

Let me join the conversation.

680

Where are you guys from?

681
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,540
Given your age...

682
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:02,420
Are you married yet?

683
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:03,780
Do you have kids?

684
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:09,110
You don't look like someone who has had kids.

685
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:13,020
But not you.

686
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,780
You have a wide hip and thick legs.

687
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:15,940
You must've given birth before.

688

You...

689

What... What's wrong with you?

690

You are...

One... one of us...

693
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:49,070
We are one!

My dears!

695
00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:54,700
Wait.

696

Wait, wait.

697
00:34:58,910 --> 00:34:59,980
All these years...

698
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,540
I can finally put these to use now.

699

Where are your cards?

707
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:23,350
What cards?

708
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:26,070
Those tower cards of yours.

709
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:29,110
Why... Why do you need those cards?

710

Read another fortune for me.

711
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,220
I told you.

712
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:32,260
I can only use them three times a year.

713
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:33,430
It won't be effective
if I use it any more than that.

714
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:34,110
Oh, please.

715
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:35,020
Please read another fortune for me.

-Enough.

Don't do this.

Please!

719
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,150
Fine. All right.

720
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:43,260
I'll do it.

721
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:45,910
Pick a card.

722
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,700
Are you going to pick a card or not?

723
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:54,700
If you aren't, I'm putting the cards away.

724
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,070
Don't.

725

What does that mean?

Don't you get it? It's simple.

730
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:17,020
You should focus

731
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:19,940
on taking care of your face.

732
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:22,070
That can't be right.

733
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:23,350
I don't think it's accurate.

734
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:24,830
Well, now you're being unreasonable.

735
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:26,980
I told you these cards
could only be used three times a year.

736

You insisted.

737
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:32,500
I really don't think that's what it means.

738
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:34,630
All right. That's enough.

739
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:35,670
Enough.

Nothing.
