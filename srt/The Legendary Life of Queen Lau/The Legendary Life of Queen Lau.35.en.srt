Yes, you are.

117
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,320
But I can tell straight away

118

that your methods will not work.

119
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,519
Then, why did you call us here?

120
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,920
I'm eliminating the wrong options here.

121

00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:53,359
What are you cooking?

169
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,880
Wuyu Grass.

170
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,720
A specialty of Xianpa Village.

171
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,640
It's a great addition

172
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:00,040
to lamb stew.

173
00:08:11,559 --> 00:08:12,160
Don't touch it.

174
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,359
What are you doing?

175
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,200
Aren't you cooking this for me?

176
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,760
Can't I just taste it first?

177
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:19,920
You can't.

178
00:08:20,119 --> 00:08:21,519
Who said it's for you?

179
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,959
It's not for me?

180
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:25,000
Who is it for?

181
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:26,040
Male or female? What is his name?

182
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,799
Where does he live?

183
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,679
You're so annoying.

184
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:30,839
Of course, it's a man.

185
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:32,000
It's too hot for women

186
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,400
to eat this.

187
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,239
Men aren't afraid to get hot?

188
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,000
For men, higher body heat is better.

189
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,119
Stupid.

190
00:08:45,119 --> 00:08:46,359
It is not for me.

191
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,000
Higher body heat is better for men?

192
00:08:53,119 --> 00:08:54,359
Assemble!

193
00:08:54,479 --> 00:08:55,599
Village meeting!

194
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:56,640
Village meeting!

195
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,239
Hurry.

196
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,280
Coming.

197
00:08:58,919 --> 00:08:59,520
Village Head,

198
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,359
everyone is here.

199
00:09:00,359 --> 00:09:01,200
You may start now.

200
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,159
Village Head, go ahead.

201
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:04,000
Today,

202
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,919
an important person is coming to our village.

203
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,799
Everyone knows this, right?

204
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:10,799
-Yes.
-Yes.

205
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:12,000
It is thanks to this man

206
00:09:12,359 --> 00:09:13,640
that our village

207
00:09:14,119 --> 00:09:15,000
has become

208
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,679
what it is today.

209
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,799
When he comes,

210
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,400
you know what to do, right?

211
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,880
-We do.
-Yes.

212
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,799
-All right.
-Yes.

213
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:23,599
He asked us

214
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,159
to serve him well.

215
00:09:26,719 --> 00:09:29,359
He's here to do something big!

216
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:30,960
(Okay.)

217
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,239
(I'll see what you will do.)

218
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,640
(If you don't do something great,)

219
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,799
(I won't go back with you easily.)

220
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,239
Now that everyone is clear,

221
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,799
let's split up and get ready

222
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,000
according to the tasks we've been assigned.

223
00:09:44,599 --> 00:09:44,960
Let's go.

224
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,159
-All right.
-Let's go.

225
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:46,559
Let's get ready.

226
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:47,239
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

227
00:09:47,239 --> 00:09:47,679
Get ready.

228
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:48,400
Yes.

229
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,200
That way.

230
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,479
Jinfeng.

231
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,080
Why are you here?

232
00:09:59,320 --> 00:09:59,840
I...

233
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,080
What are you doing here?

234
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,599
If you have nothing to do, just go and take a nap.

235
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,520
Do I really have nothing to do?

236
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,159
Look at my poor memory.

237
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,640
We have arranged a task for Yongfu's family too.

238
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,320
I thought you two were away.

239
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,359
I almost forgot about it.

240
00:10:13,359 --> 00:10:14,640
What is the task?

241
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:15,640
Your family's task

242
00:10:16,239 --> 00:10:17,080
is to go up the mountain to carry branches.

243
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:17,679
Yes.

244
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,359
Go up the mountain to carry branches?

245
00:10:21,239 --> 00:10:22,320
What for?

246
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,799
Don't worry about that.

247
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:24,679
I have my own arrangements.

248
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:25,359
Go.

249
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,000
Don't.

250
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,719
Village Head.

251
00:10:27,239 --> 00:10:28,520
I'm his wife.

252
00:10:29,719 --> 00:10:30,479
Whose wife are you?

253
00:10:31,119 --> 00:10:31,719
No.

254
00:10:31,719 --> 00:10:32,960
I'm the Emperor's wife.

255
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:33,760
Think about it.

256
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,359
Should I still carry the branches?

257
00:10:37,239 --> 00:10:38,159
Of course, you should.

258
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:38,840
Yes.

259
00:10:39,119 --> 00:10:40,000
Isn't the Emperor's wife

260
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,200
also a member of Xianpa Village?

261
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:41,760
That's right.

262
00:10:42,119 --> 00:10:43,520
So the Emperor's wife

263
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,919
can be lazy and not work?

264
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,840
Where did you learn to behave like that?

265
00:10:47,359 --> 00:10:48,000
Seriously.

266
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,880
Their acting skills are not bad.

267
00:10:54,119 --> 00:10:55,520
Xuan is really

268
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,080
getting more romantic than ever.

269
00:11:00,239 --> 00:11:02,320
Where's the surprise?

270
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,239
What surprise?

271
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:19,000
That's more like it.

272
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,320
What a surprise.

273
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,159
What's going on?

274
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,880
Xuan, stop it.

275
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,679
This is not fun at all.

276
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:28,599
I'll get angry if you continue to do this.

277
00:11:28,599 --> 00:11:29,479
Let go of me now!

278
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,479
This...

279
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:32,880
Who told you to hit her?

280
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,559
Master said to act in secret.

281
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:35,679
She's screaming so loud,

282
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:36,640
how can this be a secret?

283
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:39,440
It makes sense.

284
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,000
Quick.

285
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,080
Don't keep Master waiting.

286
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:56,910
[Xianpa Village]

287
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:02,239
They're coming.

288
00:12:02,719 --> 00:12:03,880
I guess so.

289
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,520
They've arrived.

290
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:10,440
Who are they?

291
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,520
I think they're the villagers.

292
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:15,840
Jinfeng must have known that I was coming here

293
00:12:16,119 --> 00:12:18,239
and arranged for these villagers to welcome me.

294
00:12:18,599 --> 00:12:20,960
Jinfeng really knows me the best.

295
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,080
In my opinion,

296
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,599
it's because Your Majesty's mighty presence

297
00:12:23,599 --> 00:12:25,080
can be felt from thousands of miles away.

298
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,640
That's why they came out to welcome you.

299
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,239
Shuan,

300
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,080
you know I don't like

301
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,919
to listen to such flattery.

302
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:32,000
But today,

303
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,320
I can take it.

304
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,559
They're coming over.

305
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,520
There's no one else here,

306
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,520
so what are you looking at?

307
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:45,479
Is there really no one else?

308
00:12:45,719 --> 00:12:47,039
There's no one. Just the two of us.

309
00:12:52,359 --> 00:12:53,760
How dare you come alone?

310
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:54,840
She...

311
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,559
I think it's Jinfeng testing me.

312
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:01,159
It's okay.

313
00:13:01,479 --> 00:13:02,719
I have nothing

314
00:13:02,719 --> 00:13:03,679
but sincerity to offer today.

315
00:13:04,719 --> 00:13:06,440
May I know your name?

316
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,440
I have never changed my name,

317
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:10,200
I'm the Village Head of Xianpa Village,

318
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,640
Niu Dali!

319
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,280
You are what your name says you are.

320
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,359
Nice to meet you.

321
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,679
Tell me, how is this going to be resolved?

322
00:13:18,599 --> 00:13:19,520
What's the problem?

323
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:20,520
I don't know.

324
00:13:21,599 --> 00:13:22,440
We'll solve it.

325
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,760
That's why we are here.

326
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:26,039
Don't try to fool us.

327
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,200
The villagers of Xianpa

328
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,799
won't be so easily fooled.

329
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:30,719
I am here to solve the problem sincerely.

330
00:13:30,719 --> 00:13:31,200
Yes.

331
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,840
If you give me the person I want,

332
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:35,359
I'll make sure it is resolved properly for you.

333
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,479
Person?

334
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,200
Who do you want us to give you?

335
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:40,919
She really likes to joke.

336
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:42,400
Who else could I possibly want?

So you're the one playing a trick on me.

But I'm not playing a trick on you.

was it decorated for?

394
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:29,599
I don't have time for riddles.

Of course, it's mine.

should call himself the Emperor.

00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,980
Are you not afraid that your people
will laugh at you if they find this out?

503
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:42,310
Here, have a piece of apple.

504
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:43,380
Stay safe and sound

505
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,310
and come to fruition soon.

506
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:45,590
I won't eat it.

507
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:52,190
You got it?

508
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:53,310
No.

509
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:56,950
Here.

510
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:00,140
A match made by the God of Marriage,

511
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,310
forever and ever with you.

512
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,830
What are you doing, Yu Changya?

513
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,790
Why don't you get it?

514
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:09,030
Are you crazy?

515
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:10,460
Jinfeng,

516
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:12,910
today is your big day.

517
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:14,830
What big day?

518
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:17,830
Your Majesty,

519
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:18,790
it's the auspicious time.

520
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:19,380
All right.

521
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:20,710
Just in time.

522
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:24,430
Are you crazy, Yu Changya?

523
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:25,590
Let go of me now!

524
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:31,740
Yu Changya, listen.

525
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:32,790
Even if you forced me
to go through the wedding ritual,

526
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:33,830
it wouldn't make it count.

527
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:35,310
Besides, I'm already married.

528
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:37,710
You're married,

529
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,380
but you were forced to marry

530
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:41,260
by decree, right?

531
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:42,310
What's the difference from now?

532
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:43,550
That's different.

533
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,220
We have true feelings now.

534
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,260
Why did he throw you out of the palace

535
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,030
at the critical moment

536
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:49,070
if he really had true feelings for you?

537
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:51,260
If he had true feelings for you,

538
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,590
why didn't he tell you the truth

539
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:54,740
and stick with you through thick and thin?

540
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:56,190
If he had true feelings for you...

541
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:57,030
You're right.

542
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,980
Duan Yunzhang is always opinionated.

543
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:01,830
He threw me out

544
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:02,910
without even asking me anything.

545
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,310
Does he respect me?

546
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:05,790
Does he love me?

547
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:07,380
He thought that this was espousal love?

548
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:08,190
My foot!

549
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:10,950
A real couple should, as you say,

550
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:12,590
stick...

551
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:14,550
Stick together through thick and thin.

552
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:15,590
That's right.

553
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:18,260
Why is he always so opinionated?

554
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,260
Does he think he's the hero of a huaben?
[* A Chinese short- or medium-length story]

555
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,140
He thinks all women in the world

556
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,830
love such cheesy tricks, huh?

557
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:24,590
If I hadn't been smart,

558
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:25,500
I would have left a long time ago.

559
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,710
Who would care about him?

560
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,670
When I see him,

561
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:30,190
I'll teach him how to be a husband

562
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:31,070
and how to be a man.

563
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:33,980
I'm so pissed off.

564
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:38,460
All right.

565
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:40,460
No need to wait until then.

566
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,380
[Double Happiness]
He's right there now.

567
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:45,430
Where?

568
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:47,590
Where?

569
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,140
Duan Yunzhang.

570
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,220
All right, that's enough.

571
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,500
Stop acting and come out.

572
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,260
What's going on?

573
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:00,740
I don't know.

574
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:03,070
I told him I'd come early and be ready

575
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:04,070
to cheer you up.

576
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:05,670
But I didn't see him coming

577
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:06,830
so I wanted to tease you.

578
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:07,460
You...

579
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:10,190
The main point is to let him know
what he did wrong.

580
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:15,190
But why didn't he come?

581
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:18,310
Duan Yunzhang.

582
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:19,910
Where is he?

583
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:21,140
Where is he?

584
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:25,980
Your Majesty, something bad happened.

585
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:26,670
What happened?

586
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:29,070
The Emperor of the Donghao Empire
did not come up the mountain.

587
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:29,830
Where is he?

588
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:32,070
He's trapped in the village.

589
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:33,740
Yunzhang.

590
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:35,710
He's trapped?

591
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,220
Look.

592
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:38,950
Yes.

593
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:43,460
He can't even pull the plow.

594
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:46,070
This won't work.

595
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:51,710
Look, it won't move.

596
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,140
He's so weak.

597
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:02,790
Look at his silly face.

598
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:03,590
What is this?

599
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:18,830
What are you doing? Hurry up!

600
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:27,500
He fell into the water.

601
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:29,740
Shuan.

602
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,070
Are you all right?

603
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:37,980
Your Majesty.

604
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,100
Are you all right, Your Majesty?

605
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:42,910
-Why are you here?
-Why are you here?

606
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:47,190
-Why are you here?
-Why are you here?

607
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:57,710
Eat meat.

608
00:23:58,620 --> 00:23:59,310
Eat meat.

609
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,310
Why are you looking at me?

610
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:07,100
If I don't look at you, then who should I look at?

611
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,790
Look at whoever you offended.

612
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:11,310
I'm afraid.

613
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:13,500
You were so bold just now, weren't you?

614
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:18,070
Your Majesty.

615
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,140
Are you really the Emperor?

616
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,670
Don't I look like one?

617
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:22,550
To be honest,

618
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:23,910
you really don't look like one.

619
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:25,430
After Jinfeng got married,

620
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:27,670
she did bring a portrait of her husband
to show to the girls in the village,

621
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:29,340
but it was not like you.

622
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:32,070
Then, what should I look like?

623
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,140
Let me think.

624
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:37,260
Tall, muscular,

625
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:39,460
wearing armor and wielding a large blade.

626
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:40,550
Very handsome.

627
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:41,070
I...

628
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:42,620
Am I not handsome?

629
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,310
Compared to that portrait,

630
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:45,460
you're not so handsome.

631
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:46,980
Nonsense.

632
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,100
That's too late.

633
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:57,670
Your Majesty,

634
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:01,380
why don't you be merciful

635
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:03,100
and forget about

636
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,950
what happened today?

637
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,260
Today?

638
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,980
Oh no, I forgot something important.

639
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:13,380
Your Majesty,

640
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:16,590
there are hundreds of people in Xianpa Village.

641
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:17,670
Why don't you

642
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:20,260
punish me alone?

643
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,910
You mustn't get them involved.

644
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,460
All right, let go of me first.

645
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:25,670
No.

646
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:28,340
My family of ten

647
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:29,380
depends on me alone.

648
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:30,670
Please spare my life

649
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:31,910
for the sake of my family.

650
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,140
Niu Dali,

651
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,460
why are you asking for so much?

652
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,790
All right. Ignorance can be forgiven.

653
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:37,670
Let go of me first.

654
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,140
Your Majesty, you're a forthright person.

655
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:44,980
May I ask you

656
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,430
to issue a decree

657
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:47,220
to stop the landlord, Mr. Chang,

658
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,860
from giving us any more trouble,

659
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:49,740
please?

660
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:50,790
Well...

661
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:51,590
No way!

662
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:53,830
Jinfeng.

663
00:25:57,670 --> 00:25:58,740
Her Majesty is back.

664
00:25:58,740 --> 00:25:59,430
-Your Majesty.
-Her Majesty is back.

665
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:00,030
Jinfeng.

666
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:01,830
What's going on? Are you okay?

667
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:02,620
I'm fine.

668
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:03,670
I'm here to see you.

669
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,950
Why is it different from what we agreed on?

670
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,140
I said I'd wear this outfit,

671
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:09,070
why are you wearing it?

672
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:10,100
You've stolen my thunder.

673
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:11,620
I helped you coax your wife,

674
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:13,190
why do you care what I wear?

675
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:15,950
Are you still trying to steal my wife

676
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:17,590
with this outfit on?

677
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:19,030
You just don't get it, do you?

678
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:20,310
I'm called the best man.

679
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,190
What best man?

680
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:22,950
It's a custom in the Xiyue Empire.

681
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:24,790
A wedding doesn't only involve a bride and groom,

682
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:25,790
it also involves a best man.

683
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:27,980
If you don't treat the bride well,

684
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,430
the bride will go with the best man.

685
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:30,740
I...

686
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:32,860
Are you two going to argue until the sun sets?

687
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:35,100
-The sun is setting?
-The sun is setting?

688
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:36,710
Take it off!

689
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:37,500
Take it.

690
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,550
I'll give it to you now.

691
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:39,190
Take it off quickly.

692
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:40,790
Otherwise, my lamb stew would be wasted.

693
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:44,550
Your Majesty,

694
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:45,380
could you issue a decree?

695
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:46,380
What decree?

696
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:47,260
No way.

697
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:09,950
Why did you bring me here in such a hurry?

698
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:10,460
Look.

699
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,460
It's sunset.

700
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:16,380
So beautiful.

701
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:17,590
We've got here in time.

702
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:19,550
So that's what you brought me here to see?

703
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:20,590
Yes.

704
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:22,100
The rules of Xianpa Village say

705
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:24,070
that the newlyweds

706
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:25,340
must go up to the mountain and live in a hut

707
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:27,980
to watch the sunrise and sunset
for everlasting love.

708
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:32,070
Yu Changya is quite reliable.

709
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:34,430
So you prepared all this?

710
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:36,140
I was supposed to,

711
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,550
but he insisted on helping

712
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:38,980
and I couldn't refuse.

713
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:42,140
So why did you prepare all this?

714
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,340
To apologize to you.

715
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:48,980
So tell me, what mistake did you make?

716
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:53,550
I was wrong to throw you out of the palace,

717
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:55,710
to say those harsh words to you

718
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:56,590
and make you sad.

719
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:57,910
What else?

720
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:00,380
And your father

721
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,140
really isn't a bad guy.

722
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:03,860
What else?

723
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:05,670
What else is there?

724
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:07,590
You're missing the point here.

725
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:11,430
So how about a hint?

726
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,460
Why did you throw me out of the palace?

727
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:16,340
I was afraid you would be in danger.

728
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:19,030
Why did you have to throw me out of the palace

729
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:19,910
instead of keeping me there

730
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:21,710
if you feared I would be in danger?

731
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:24,380
Did you ask my opinion

732
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:25,590
before you did this?

733
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,100
Or is it that my opinion doesn't matter at all?

734
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:30,980
We're a couple.

735
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,140
A couple should be considerate of each other

736
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:34,590
and respect each other.

737
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,460
And why are you so full of yourself?

738
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:40,070
How did you know I would stay at the palace

739
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:41,220
once I knew there was danger?

740
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,790
I might have run away even faster.

741
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:43,910
As the saying goes,

742
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:45,070
husband and wife are birds of the same forest,

743
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:46,460
but each flies away
at the sight of great disasters.

744
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:47,740
This is too...

745
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:48,950
I'm just kidding.

746
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,910
Even if I fly, I have to be around you.

747
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,100
I'll let you go this time.

748
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,710
If there's danger next time,

749
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:57,790
if there's a rebellion,

750
00:28:57,790 --> 00:28:59,140
you can't throw me out of the palace.

751
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:00,710
Okay.

752
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,260
Who wants to rebel?

753
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:05,100
I'm just giving an example.

754
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:06,620
And what's so unusual about a rebellion?

755
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:07,670
If you failed to become a good emperor,

756
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:08,950
there would be many people who would rebel.

757
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:10,030
It makes sense.

758
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,310
One more thing.

759
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:15,380
Why didn't you let me issue a decree

760
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,740
to help the people of Xianpa Village?

761
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:18,590
You don't even understand that?

762
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,140
Not really.

763
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,950
How can you be a good emperor
if you don't understand this?

764
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,140
Let me ask you.

765
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:26,860
If you stop the landlord,
Mr. Chang, from bullying us,

766
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:28,670
will there be no other landlords
such as Mr. Wang, Mr. Zhang, and Mr. Liu

767
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:30,100
to bully us?

768
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:30,790
Besides,

769
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:31,910
if you stop Mr. Chang from bullying us,

770
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:33,710
won't he bully the others?

771
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:35,910
And even if Mr. Chang doesn't bully us,

772
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:37,310
can't he bully others?

773
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:39,500
Understand?

774
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,140
Yes.

775
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:42,260
So,

776
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,740
since your decree is so useful,

777
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,340
you must use it right.

778
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:47,740
You should decree
that all landlords in the world

779
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:48,950
should stop bullying their tenants.

780
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,500
That would be most effective.

781
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:53,790
As I said,

782
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,860
you are a unique queen indeed.

783
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:58,740
I've told you before

784
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,380

00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:22,110
Jinfeng.

837
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:22,900
What has happened?

838
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,350
Whose chickens have been stolen again?

839
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:26,420
It's the curse.

840
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,540
The curse is back.

841
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:28,630
What curse?

842
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,070
The Curse of the Mountain God.

843
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,500
Curse on the husbands.

844
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:34,500
Yu'er's family, Maosan's family...

845
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:36,660
In short, many of the men in our village

846
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:37,750
got affected.

847
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:39,500
I thought you're married to the Emperor,

848
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,230
and the aura of the Emperor

849
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:41,780
would be able to suppress this evil.

850
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:42,750
I didn't expect...

851
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:46,020
Go and check on His Majesty now.

852
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:47,180
Don't let anything happen to His Majesty.

853
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:49,180
No wonder he's not awake yet.

854
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,140
Go inside and have a look.

855
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:52,870
Hurry up.

856
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:54,380
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

857
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:56,300
Xuan!

858
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:58,140
Xuan!

859
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:59,140
Xuan.

860
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:02,300
-Xuan.
-His Majesty is really not awake?

861
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,350
His Majesty is not really affected, is he?

862
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:05,590
It can't be.

863
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:07,500
If His Majesty
were to fall into a coma in our village,

864
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,980
we'd all be in trouble!

865
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,260
My husband is still lying in bed.

866
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,220
Stop talking that nonsense.

867
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:13,110
Xuan, wake up. Xuan.

868
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:13,980
Xuan.

869
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:18,980
Why are you calling me this early in the morning?

870
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:19,830
You're awake.

871
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:21,700
Why did you bring such a bunch...

872
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:23,350
Such a bunch of people here?

873
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:24,700
Jinfeng.

874
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:26,070
You and His Majesty

875
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:26,740
can talk first.

876
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:28,070
We'll wait outside while you talk.

877
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:28,830
Let's go out.

878
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:29,630
Let's go out now.

879
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:31,300
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

880
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:35,500
-What...
-You scared me to death.

881
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,980
Why didn't you get up when I called you?

882
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:38,190
You scared me to death.

883
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:39,870
Why did you bring such a bunch
of people over to watch me?

884
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:43,460
Didn't I have a drink last night?

885
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:44,430
I was up all night too

886
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:45,590
so I slept a little longer.

887
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:47,980
I am not as energetic or strong as you.

888
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:52,020
You should get up and get dressed now.

889
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:53,390
Why?

890
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:54,020
Something serious happened.

891
00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:55,870
Sleeping is also a serious matter.

892
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:56,940
Something serious happened.

893
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:07,350
It's really comfortable to sleep in my own home.

894
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:49,350
You mean all the men

895
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:51,830
fell unconscious in one night?

896
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:53,460
Except for the children,

897
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,070
all the men in the village passed out.

898
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:57,630
According to  our ancestral village chronicles,

899
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:59,460
I'm afraid they won't survive
for more than seven days.

900
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:01,670
You know about this too?

901
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:02,910
I know.

902
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:03,870
Who doesn't know that the women of Xianpa Village

903
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,540
bring bad luck to their husbands?

904
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:08,980
How ridiculous.

905
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:12,390
Blaming your wife for your own problems?

906
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:13,870
Such ridiculous statements

907
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:16,500
are not allowed on our land.

908
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:18,020
Look.

909
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:19,700
I've long told you that there is no such thing
as bringing bad luck to husbands.

910
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:20,540
It's all superstition.

911
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:22,460
Why don't you say you bring bad luck
to your chicken when your chicken dies?

912
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:23,190
You...

913
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:25,190
Jinfeng.

914
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:27,190
Let's go down the mountain later and check it out.

915
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:28,500
Don't, Your Majesty.

916
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:30,590
Now that all the men
in the village are unconscious,

917
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:32,190
I'm really afraid that it will infect you.

918
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:33,980
I'm the Emperor.

919
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:35,700
I would like to see

920
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,830
if it can infect me or not.

921
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:38,700
Jinfeng,

922
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:41,150
let's go down the mountain together later.

923
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:55,070
Sir.

924
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:56,020
I've finished it.

925
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:13,300
[No entry]

926
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:13,910
Mother,

927
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:15,110
Yu Changya told us about the outbreak

928
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:17,350
of an unidentified plague in the village.

929
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:19,070
The best way to prevent others
from being infected

930
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:22,070
is for everyone to stay out.

931
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:24,700
Your Majesties,

932
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:26,700
we can't leave our children.

933
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:29,020
We can't stay out of this village either.

934
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:29,940
I beg you.

935
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:30,870
Please think of a solution.

936
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,020
Let me stay here.

937
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:34,430
Let me replace you.

938
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:35,980
Let me catch the plague.

939
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:36,700
Get up now, Yu'er.

940
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:37,910
We can't leave the children here like this.

941
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:38,700
Get up.

942
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:40,190
Your Majesty,

943
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:41,300
we can't let this go on.

944
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,350
Think of a solution quickly.

945
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:43,910
Yes, Your Majesty.

946
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:44,540
Please think of a solution.

947
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:45,980
-Your Majesty, please think of a solution.
-Please think of something.

948
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:47,830
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

949
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:49,110
Jinfeng, Yunzhang.

950
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:50,460
Who asked you to come?

951
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:51,300
Go back now.

952
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:53,700
I don't think sealing
the village off like this is appropriate.

953
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:56,190
I think it's appropriate.

954
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:57,700
What if the plague spreads

955
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,190
before we know the cause?

956
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:00,500
For the moment, this is the only way.

957
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:02,300
Seal the village off, quarantine.

958
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:03,700
Yu Changya.

959
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:06,110
How can you do that
when you don't even have anyone competent

960
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:07,110
to help you?

961
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:08,150
You ask these children to stop others,

962
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:09,190
how can they manage?

963
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:10,910
And have you thought about the fact

964
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:13,070
that they all came out
of Xianpa Village in the morning?

965
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:15,110
If there was anything to be caught,
it would have been caught already.

966
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:16,630
And their husbands
and children are all in the village.

967
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:17,630
-Yes.
-Yes.

968
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:19,390
How could you let them leave alone?

969
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:21,110
You have to ask their opinion first.

970
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:22,940
-Yes/
-We want to go back.

971
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:24,150
Shut up.

972
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:25,700
Listen to Yu Changya.

973
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:30,020
You have a point there.

974
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:32,190
Let me be straightforward now.

975
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:33,870
I was a physician.

976
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:35,350
The plague

977
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:37,020
is still being investigated.

978
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:38,870
Now, there is no guarantee

979
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:41,020
that the plague will only infect men.

980
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,110
You may be able to get away with it

981
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:44,500
if you don't go in.

982
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,830
But if you go in,

983
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:49,390
I can't guarantee that everyone will be healthy.

984
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:52,300
Village Head.

985
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:53,910
Discuss

986
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:55,910
this matter with the villagers.

987
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:57,940
It's up to you to decide whether to stay or go.

988
00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:00,070
Make your own decision.

989
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:01,190
Okay.

990
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:04,590
What do you think?

991
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:06,870
Stay outside or go in there?

992
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:10,940
You two as well.

993
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:11,940
Don't stay here.

994
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:12,940
Go back to the palace immediately.

995
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:14,910
What is this?

996
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:16,190
When the plague broke out in the village,

997
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:18,460
I could only make these potions in a hurry.

998
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:20,430
If you haven't caught the infection by now,

999
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:21,670
you can sprinkle the potion on your body

1000
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,150
