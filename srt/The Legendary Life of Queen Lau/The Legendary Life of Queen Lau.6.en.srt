Jade Ruyi Roll.

337
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,280
This looks pretty.

338
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:03,359
I'll pick this.

339
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,280
Prepare 30 servings for me.

340
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:05,880
What?

341
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,840
Why do you need that many?

342
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,679
I'm giving you a chance to show your talent

343
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:11,239
in front of the imperial family.

344
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,679
No one will know about your talent

345
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,000
if you only prepare food for Xuan.

346
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,039
Are you serious?

347
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,359
Chai,

348
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:20,400
the time to show your talent is here.

349
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:21,919
Thank you for thinking highly of me, Your Majesty.

350
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:23,520
I'll prepare the dishes right away.

351
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,119
Go.

352
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,479
Your Majesty,

353
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:31,239
didn't you say

354
00:13:31,239 --> 00:13:33,679
Imperial Chef Chai's dishes are tasteless?

355
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:34,960
As long as we have food.

356
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,159
The taste doesn't matter.

357
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:37,119
You'll know in a while.

358
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,719
(A matchmaker's mole.)

359
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,479
Greetings, Prince Yan.

360
00:13:49,479 --> 00:13:50,119
Sufang.

361
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,719
I've prepared this Jade Ruyi Roll

362
00:13:52,719 --> 00:13:53,760
for you.

363
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,840
It's refreshing and good for the spleen.

364
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,840
When the banquet starts,

365
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,119
please try it.

366
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,840
Thank you, Your Majesty.

367
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,239
You recognized me?

368
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,280
I've long heard

369
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,640
you're good at calligraphy.

370
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,599
Everyone in Donghao knows that.

371
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,760
You're flattering me, Your Majesty.

372
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,880
If I'm not mistaken,

373
00:14:14,239 --> 00:14:16,520
you've never met me before.

374
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,799
Prince Yan,

375
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,479
I may be the Queen.

376
00:14:20,479 --> 00:14:21,760
But I'm still a junior, after all.

377
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,880
Isn't it right to recognize my elders?

378
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:25,559
I dare not act arrogant.

379
00:14:28,239 --> 00:14:30,200
I had too much drink just now.

380
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,640
So I spoke carelessly just now.

381
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:33,200
I hope you can forgive me.

382
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:34,960
Prince Yan,

383
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:36,039
we're family.

384
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:36,880
No need for the formalities.

385
00:14:43,479 --> 00:14:45,679
I didn't expect the Queen to do so well today.

386
00:14:46,479 --> 00:14:47,919
The Grand Chancellor's daughter

387
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,760
is really something.

388
00:14:51,239 --> 00:14:52,960
It's too early to tell.

389
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,679
It's only starting.

390
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:55,840
Let's wait and see.

391
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,080
(Almost eight meters tall.)

392
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:07,440
Greetings, Lord Defender.

393
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,359
Nice to meet you.

394
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:15,760
Princess Pingning.

395
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,760
(Who is this?)

396
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,039
(She's not in Xuan's portrait album.)

397
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:31,320
The Queen can't take any compliments at all.

398
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,599
She lost it after being praised.

399
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:34,039
It looks like she hasn't prepared enough.

400
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:34,359
I can't believe it.

401
00:15:34,359 --> 00:15:35,400
Why did she lose the momentum

402
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,599
at a critical time like this?

403
00:15:37,359 --> 00:15:37,799
This is...

404
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:38,880
I can't believe her.

405
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,880
Greetings, Your Majesty.

406
00:15:47,119 --> 00:15:48,159
Consort Mu, please rise.

407
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:50,960
Consort Mu,

408
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,880
the Jade Ruyi Roll is palatable.

409
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,400
Try it

410
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,359
and see if you like it.

411
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,599
Take your seats.

412
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,159
That scared me to death.

413
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:16,359
Luckily, you came in time.

414
00:16:16,359 --> 00:16:17,640
Or else, I'd be dead.

415
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:20,039
You only forgot one.

416
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:20,880
So it's all right.

417
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:23,919
I didn't recognize Consort Mu.

418
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,119
But I remember her name.

419
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,559
I thought she had asymmetrical eyes.

420
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:30,039
She...

421
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,039
I think she fixed them.

422
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:33,520
I never noticed.

423
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,200
I didn't know
fixing one's appearance is popular here too.

424
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,340
I thought it was only popular in my village.

425
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,100
Where's my mother?

426
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,460
Did Su Jingtang bring her here or not?

427
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,020
(If I tell her the truth,)

428
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,220
(she would worry sick.)

429
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,300
(Never mind, I'll send some men to look for her first.)

430
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,280
(I'll tell her after we find her mother.)

431
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:58,080
She said she didn't want to see your father.

432
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:58,880
She said he annoys her.

433
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,880
So she won't be coming.

434
00:17:00,239 --> 00:17:01,479
I can't believe her.

435
00:17:01,599 --> 00:17:02,520
She doesn't even want to see her daughter

436
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,599
because of a man.

437
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,239
I could only marry once,

438
00:17:05,239 --> 00:17:06,760
and she doesn't even want
to attend this relative banquet.

439
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:08,359
I can accept it if I don't attract her that much.

440
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:09,839
But even her son-in-law can't attract her here.

441
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,660
Is her son-in-law less important than Liu Xie?

442
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:19,220
Liu Xie isn't here either?

443
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,260
It's normal.

444
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,860
Your father likes everyone to wait for him.

445
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:25,980
We'll just wait for a little longer.

446
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:28,060
Moreover, it's a relative banquet today.

447
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,220
As the Emperor's father-in-law,

448
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,460
he'll definitely come.

449
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:34,620
Your Majesty the Empress Dowager.

450
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,020
Your Majesty the Emperor.

451
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,540
Since Her Majesty is seated,

452
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,260
let's start the banquet.

453
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,940
Marquis Beijing, please calm down

454
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,540
and wait for a while.

455
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:46,100
We'll start the banquet
after the Grand Chancellor arrives.

456
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,940
We're fine waiting for him.

457
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:51,180
Is he going to let His Majesty wait for him too?

458
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,900
(Liu Xie deliberately poses for everyone to see.)

459
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,820
(No wonder so many people hate him.)

460
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,540
(Being his daughter is hard.)

461
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:04,580
All of you can drink and chat here

462
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:07,020
because the Grand Chancellor is busy worrying

463
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,140
about the country.

464
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,460
Isn't it right for us to wait for him?

465
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,020
The Grand Chancellor has arrived!

466
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,860
Since when does the Grand Chancellor's Residence
have such a woman?

467
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,660
I've never seen her all these years.

468
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,860
Could she be the Queen's...

469
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,540
I think it's very likely.

470
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,500
Mother.

471
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,180
Mother?

472
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:16,380
Stay put.

473
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:16,660
Stay seated.

474
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:17,180
Okay.

475
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,580
Greetings, Your Majesties.

476
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,100
Greetings.

477
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:26,860
What are you doing?

478
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,020
Don't touch me.

479
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:33,540
Your Majesty,

480
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,100
this is my wife, Yongfu.

481
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,300
The Queen's birth mother.

482
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:38,700
So I brought her

483
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,980
to enjoy herself at today's relative banquet.

484
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,700
She's so beautiful.

485
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,020
Yongfu,

486
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,860
pay your respects to the Empress Dowager.

487
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,780
That's not right.

488
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:58,780
What's not right?

489
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,540
In the play,

490
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,780
the common folks must kneel
when they see the Empress Dowager.

491
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,340
But she's now

492
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,900
my in-law.

493
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,100
No one would kneel to their in-laws, right?

494
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,060
So there's no need to kneel.

495
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:10,940
Yes, you're right.

496
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:11,660
Yes.

497
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:12,860
You're right.

498
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:13,980
Madam, you're right.

499
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,620
Yes, we're family.

500
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,380
No need for the formalities.

501
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:16,860
Yes, Madam.

502
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:17,220
Good.

503
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,340
There's no need for formalities.

504
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:19,940
My dear in-law,

505
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,340
you're too courteous.

506
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,660
No offense.

507
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,180
But don't call me Madam.

508
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,460
You can just call me Yongfu.

509
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:28,460
No need to be so courteous.

510
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,020
I came here mainly

511
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:32,340
to see my son-in-law

512
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,500
and my daughter while at it.

513
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,300
Of course.

514
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:36,780
Zhang.

515
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:37,940
Jinfeng.

516
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,420
Don't just stay there.

517
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:41,420
Jinfeng,

518
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:44,340
what should I call myself according to the play?

519
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,420
Just "I"?

520
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:47,660
Don't worry.

521
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:48,740
My mother is very friendly.

522
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,180
Mother.

523
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:53,860
How have you been?

524
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,260
Your son-in-law

525
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:00,740
greets Grand Chancellor Liu

526
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,500
and his mother-in-law.

527
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,220
My dear son-in-law,

528
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:08,900
you're so sweet.

529
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:10,500
Did you hear that?

530
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,620
Your mother becomes a grown-up

531
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,860
in an instant.

532
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,060
Mother-in-law.

533
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:19,540
Yes, my dear son-in-law?

534
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:20,820
Did you call for me?

535
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,180
I promised the Queen that I would go with her

536
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,620
to Qingchi Palace to soak in the hot spring

537
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,620
after the banquet today.

538
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:29,180
I wonder if you'll be interested in joining us.

539
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,380
There's a hot spring in the palace?

540
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:31,940
Yes.

541
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,180
I heard hot spring

542
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,260
is a good thing.

543
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:36,900
I'll definitely go.

544
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:40,700
Grand Chancellor works hard for the country

545
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,700
and only rests a few days all year.

546
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,740
I'm afraid your old injuries may relapse,

547
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:45,940
and you may feel exhausted.

548
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,180
But I heard

549
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,420
soaking in a hot spring
can help relieve all these.

550
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:50,580
Would you like to join us?

551
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,540
Thank you for your concern, Your Majesty.

552
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,260
I still have some things to take care of
at the Grand Council.

553
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,500
So I'll have to decline.

554
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,580
Stop giving so many excuses.

555
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,300
Your son-in-law has invited you.

556
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,060
Stop putting on airs

557
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:05,260
and come with us.

558
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:06,620
Yongfu,

559
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,700
there's something that you don't know.

560
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,980
What is it that I don't know?

561
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,260
Grand Chancellor,

562
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,180
how about this?

563
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,420
You can take care of your affairs first.

564
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,380
I'll show Madam

565
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,420
around the palace.

566
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,660
After you're done taking care of your affairs,

567
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:27,260
it won't be too late to go

568
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,140
to the hot spring together.

569
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:29,620
This evening,

570
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:33,060
I've prepared a feast at Qianluo Hall.

571
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:35,180
So we can spend time

572
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:35,980
and get together.

573
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,380
Do you think this is a good arrangement?

574
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:38,340
Yes, it's good.

575
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:39,820
It's very good.

576
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:50,460
I shall obey your orders.

577
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:51,500
Me too.

578
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,380
(I need to thank my mother-in-law
for making it work.)

579
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:09,300
Father,

580
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,300
I know you trusted in Liu Xie.

581
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,740
That's why you entrusted me to him.

582
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,940
But since Liu Xie was appointed
as the Grand Chancellor,

583
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,540
he's been abusing his power,

584
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:22,700
deceiving and mocking the Emperor,

585
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:25,540
and he intends to rebel.

586
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:28,940
He's no longer

587
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,620
General Liu you admired.

588
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:36,260
I came here begging you to forgive me

589
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:39,940
for disobeying your will

590
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,940
and eliminating Liu Xie.

591
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,220
Father, if you're up there,

592
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:54,980
please protect me

593
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,820
so I will succeed today.

594
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,940
I'm going to the Grand Council
to discuss something in the afternoon.

595
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,380
So I won't have time for that.

596
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,500
We must arrange this matter carefully.

597
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,300
Do you plan to let Yu Changya

598
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,540
deal with such an important matter?

599
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,340
Didn't he keep pestering me
to let him enter the palace?

600
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:24,260
So let him do it.

601
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:25,340
Yes, sir.

602
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:29,980
I wanted to ask you just now.

603
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:31,460
Didn't you say you didn't want to come

604
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:32,220
and see Father?

605
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,580
Why did you suddenly come?

606
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:34,220
Yes,

607
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:36,180
I don't want to see Liu Xie.

608
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,980
But I want to meet my son-in-law.

609
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,580
The thought of meeting him

610
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:42,740
makes me excited.

611
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,980
Sure enough, your son-in-law
is more important than your daughter.

612
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:46,820
I never said that.

613
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,620
My daughter is the most important.

614
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:51,620
I wanted to see if you're doing well here.

615
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,900
But Xuan

616
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,620
treats you quite well.

617
00:24:58,540 --> 00:24:59,660
Your father finally did

618
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:01,940
a good deed

619
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,980
by choosing a good husband for you.

620
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,140
I can tell you

621
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:08,580
that I'm very satisfied with him.

622
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,740
Why are you looking at me like that?

623
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:14,980
Mother,

624
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,780
is there anything going on
between you and Father?

625
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:20,260
He doesn't treat you like what you said.

626
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,300
That's because you don't know him.

627
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:24,660
He's only putting up an act.

628
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:25,740
Is that so?

629
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,220
Your Majesty!

630
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,420
His Majesty said

631
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:36,900
you did well during the relative banquet.

632
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,180
Your restriction has been lifted.

633
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:40,180
He ordered me to pack the things

634
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:42,260
and move them back from Xuanchen Hall.

635
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,460
Doesn't that mean

636
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,940
I won't be staying with him anymore?

637
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,740
The Queen and the Emperor don't stay

638
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,380
in the same hall in the first place.

639
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,700
If His Majesty misses you,

640
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,740
he'll come and visit you at Xiangluo Hall.

641
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:53,900
That makes sense.

642
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,300
Otherwise, why would there be
so many rooms in the Imperial Palace?

643
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,260
What's the point of having them
when no one stays in them?

644
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,100
Your Majesty.

645
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:02,940
Madam Yongfu.

646
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,540
Empress Dowager invites you to the turret.

647
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:05,820
Turret?

648
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:06,420
Why?

649
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:07,380
Your Majesty,

650
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,180
Her Majesty wants

651
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:10,820
to show Madam Yongfu around the Imperial Palace.

652
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,420
She's really

653
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:14,980
a friendly person.

654
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:16,340
Can you check

655
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,420
if my hair is a mess?

656
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:18,060
Let me see.

657
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:19,380
It's not messy.

658
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,020
Is that so?

659
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,780
-All right, let's go.
-Let's go.

660
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:23,900
[Taihe Hall]
Look at this huge hall.

661
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,820
Doesn't it expand one's horizon?

662
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:29,020
Every day when the sun goes down,

663
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:31,180
we can enjoy the sunset from the high ground.

664
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:34,260
We can see the rainbow after the rain stops.

665
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,860
It's such beautiful weather.

666
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,660
Let me show you around my Yufang Garden.

667
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:41,700
Please look around.

668
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:44,620
I designed this courtyard

669
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:46,020
and this pond myself.

670
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:47,940
Yufang garden

671
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,260
is my favorite work.

672
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,700
I designed

673
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:54,980
this courtyard and pond

674
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:56,860
with plants myself.

675
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,500
Madam, please enjoy.

676
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:12,340
Madam,

677
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:14,500
what do you think about this tea?

678
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:15,420
Not bad.

679
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:16,580
It's not bitter.

680
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,020
But when we entertained
our guests in Xianpa Village,

681
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:22,820
we used a huge tea mug filled with tea leaves.

682
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:24,140
The cup of the Imperial Palace

683
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:24,940
is a little small.

684
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:25,620
It's too small.

685
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:29,380
So

686
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:32,540
what do you think about the environment

687
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:33,980
after I showed you around the palace?

688
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:37,100
Especially when you look down from the turret,

689
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:38,300
you can see magnificent palaces.

690
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,260
What do you think about it?

691
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:42,660
Your Majesty,

692
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,900
you're being too modest.

693
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:46,780
Our palaces are naturally a magnificent

694
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:47,660
and majestic sight.

695
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:48,660
Madam Liu,

696
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:49,540
am I right?

697
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,980
Xianpa Village doesn't have turrets.

698
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:55,900
But we have Xianpa Mountain in Xianpa Village.

699
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:58,420
When we looked into the distance
from the peak of the mountain,

700
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:02,300
we can see the endless borderline.

701
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:05,020
Then is Xianpa Village as big,

702
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,740
or has as many rooms,

703
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:07,980
or as many palace gates

704
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:09,140
as the Imperial Palace?

705
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:10,860
Well, no.

706
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:13,020
But why do all the rooms

707
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:15,100
in the palace look the same?

708
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,580
The building structures
and paths all look similar.

709
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,420
Aren't you afraid of getting lost?

710
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,180
Let me tell you this.

711
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,780
Xianpa Village is otherwise.

712
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:23,820
Our houses may not be

713
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,420
as magnificent as your palace.

714
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:26,060
But

715
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:28,020
every house has its characteristics.

716
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:30,380
They were all built
based on personal preferences.

717
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:32,060
How so?

718
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:33,300
For instance,

719
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,380
Erniu's colorful house at the village entrance.

720
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:37,580
We called it Rainbow House.

721
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:38,380
Not forgetting our village head's house.

722
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:39,180
Rainbow House?

723
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:41,740
The village head built
a row of single-story houses

724
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:43,940
of different heights, but pleasing to the eyes.

725
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,380
That's why Scholar Yang

726
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:46,580
named it...

727
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:49,420
-"Endless Wave."
-Yes, "Endless Wave".

728
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:50,260
Doesn't it sound nice?

729
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,980
Can I visit Xianpa Village one day?

730
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,380
-Sure, Your Highness.
-No, you can't.

731
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:57,260
Why?

732
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:59,180
Why not?

733
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,860
It's because we're not related to each other.

734
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:02,900
But of course,

735
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,500
I can take you there

736
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,820
if you acknowledge me as your sister-in-law.

737
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:09,420
Why?

738
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:11,060
We had a deal.

739
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:13,260
If I manage to run
the relative banquet successfully,

740
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:14,620
you'll have to acknowledge me
as your sister-in-law.

741
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,300
You must keep your word.

742
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:16,940
I'm waiting.

743
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:17,980
Call me "sister-in-law".

744
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:25,460
Sister-in-law.

745
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:26,820
What? I can't hear you.

746
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:28,380
Sister-in-law!

747
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,100
Good girl.

748
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,700
I'll take you to Xianpa Village next time.

749
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,220
-Your Highness, we want to go too.
-Your Majesty, we want to go too.

750
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:34,260
All right.

751
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,140
Everyone can join.

752
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:35,860
Let's all go.

753
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,620
[Orchid Courtyard]
Greetings, Your Majesty!

754
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:43,740
Please rise.

-Thank you, Your Majesty!
-Thank you, Your Majesty!

among the common folks.

758
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:52,660
A little training should pay off.

759
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:53,220
Today

760
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,540
is the day you'll be tested.

761
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:56,900
Remember.

762
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,220
A tall and ferocious man

763
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,820
will come here to drink

764

(with me later.)

765
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:02,900

(I'll drink normally.)

768
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:07,620
The second time,

769
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,620
I'll pretend to drop the cup.

770
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:10,660
(Take that as a signal)

771
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:13,460
and use whatever means to take him down.

772
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:16,260
The archers I've arranged to lie in ambush

773
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:18,740
will assist you to reduce
his fighting capabilities.

774
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:21,700
If this mission is a success,

775
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,220
I shall reward all of you

776
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:24,700
handsomely.

777
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:28,100
But if you fail,

778
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,420
just like you,

779
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:31,180
it will not end well for me.

His Majesty has already gone to Qingchi Palace.

He sent me to invite you over.

785
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:48,580
His Majesty is so thoughtful.

786
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:51,580
Is he afraid I might not know
the way to Qingchi Palace?

787
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:53,940
Grand Chancellor, please.

788

Grand Chancellor, please come inside.

789

Grand Chancellor, how about you get changed?

790
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:29,140
I shall be waiting outside.

my apologies for being late.

794

You came just in time.

795
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:18,380
I've prepared liquor and some dishes.

796
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,500
It's a pity that no one is drinking with me.

797
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,460
And the Queen is not here yet.

798

We can drink while watching the mock fight.

799

I've long heard

800
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:31,060
you're keeping an acrobatic troupe in the palace.

801
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:32,900
I didn't believe it.

802
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:35,300
Now that I've seen it, it turns out to be true.

you're the Emperor.

805

Don't you find it preposterous

806
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,020
for you to be so fond of having fun?

807
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:44,820
You're taking it too seriously.

808
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:46,900
I only hire this acrobatic troupe

809
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,020
to relieve myself from boredom.

810

811

I don't have to worry about a thing.

Moreover,

814
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:59,260
I didn't hire this acrobatic troupe

815

for myself.
