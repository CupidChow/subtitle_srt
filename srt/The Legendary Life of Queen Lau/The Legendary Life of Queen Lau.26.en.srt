Your Majesty.

169
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:36,880
Cui, you may leave.

170
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,150
Your Majesty.

171
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,080
What's up with all the sneakiness

172
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,030
and secrecy?

173
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:51,710
How about I take you somewhere,

174
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,760
somewhere you've never been?

175
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:55,440
Xu,

176
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:57,030
I entered the palace at the age of fourteen,

177
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:59,880
and I even know the number of
bricks and tiles in this palace.

178
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,440
Are there places I haven't been to?

179
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,470
I didn't say it was in the palace.

180
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:04,960
Where are we going then?

181
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:10,200
A place that will make you stun the crowd

182
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:13,000
at the national banquet.

183
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:16,470
Is there such a place?

184
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,580
[East Wing]

185
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,140
Is it all marked?

186
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,380
I've been searching for a few days,

187
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:31,420
and here they are.

188
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,660
Three of the female dogs are pregnant,

189
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,100
and two are in the postpartum period.

190
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:36,580
Sufang,

191
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,060
capture all these dogs

192
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,820
whether they are male or female, big or small,

193
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:40,900
pregnant or in the postpartum period

194
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:41,940
tomorrow.

195
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,060
Then, you know what to do.

196
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:45,540
Your Majesty,

197
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,980
actually, Prince Longyue

198
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:52,460
is a bit of a mystic at times.

199
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,540
You don't have to believe everything he says.

200
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:57,820
As the saying goes, better safe than sorry.

201
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,300
There are so many dogs.

202
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,940
It's all lives.

203
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,540
It would be cruel

204
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,020
to bury them all.

205
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,380
Who asked you to bury them?

206
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,020
I want you to capture them all,

207
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:07,940
put them in one place,

208
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,820
serve them well,

209
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,180
and release them after the national ceremony.

210
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:12,820
Your Majesty,

211
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,180
you scared me to death.

212
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,100
It should be safe now.

213
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,300
That's a great technique.

214
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,140
So comfortable.

215
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,780
What do you think, sis?

216
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,980
This mud doesn't smell

217
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,460
like those from Donghao Empire.

218
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,220
You have a good nose.

219
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,660
This is volcanic mud,
a specialty of Xiyue Empire.

220
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,460
You can't even get such goodies

221
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,460
in the Imperial Palace.

222
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,260
Muyan Palace is great indeed.

223
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,700
You can even get your hands on Xiyue Empire.

224
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:00,820
Where is your boss?

225
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,100
Let us meet your boss.

226
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,100
What do you want to meet the boss for?

227
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,780
You just don't get it, sis.

228
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,700
You can only get a discount
if you meet the boss.

229
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:10,820
Madam,

230
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,500
it's not that I won't let you meet our boss.

231
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,900
It's just that even we

232
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,700
have never met the boss ourselves.

233
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:18,940
So mysterious.

234
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:19,980
Madam,

235
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,340
Ms. Jian here said

236
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,140
we don't need to care who the boss is

237
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,820
as long as we are paid.

238
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,220
Yes.

239
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:28,780
This is true.

240
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:29,620
Madam,

241
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:30,540
don't laugh.

242
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,540
If you smile, it will cause wrinkles.

243
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:51,820
Why are you here?

244
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:53,620
Master,

245
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,820
something will happen at Muyan Palace.

246
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,220
A warm kennel.

247
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:03,900
Madam Fu.

248
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,100
Why are you here?

249
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,340
Grand Chancellor Liu instructed me

250
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,700
to give you this gift.

251
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:15,740
It's here?

252
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,580
I asked for a puppy,

253
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,140
why is it a pig?

254
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,060
Madam Fu, you don't know

255
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:28,340
that the dogs are gone
from the Imperial Palace these days.

256
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:29,900
Not a single stray dog to be found.

257
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:31,940
But Grand Chancellor Liu said

258
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,580
you like pigs too.

259
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:34,660
Is that so?

260
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,260
Open it.

261
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,740
Don't scare it.

262
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,140
Don't be afraid.

263
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,500
Be good.

264
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,140
It's so cute.

265
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,660
I really like it.

266
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,060
I've noticed

267
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,460
you've been spending a lot of time
with Scorpion Liu lately.

268
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,340
You're not doing it for Jinfeng, are you?

269
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:14,060
There is a limit to how much you like something,

270
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,580
like having a pet,

271
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,220
over pampering may not be a good thing.

272
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:21,060
It's bad for it and bad for us.

273
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:23,500
Look.

274
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,660
I just said that and it kicked me.

275
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:27,460
They

276
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,260
must stay in their own place.

277
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,140
Go it.

278
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,420
Stay at your place.

279
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,740
It's good to stay at our own place.

280
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,740
What do you think?

281
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,060
I agree.

282
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,540
I got you.

283
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,780
Donghao Empire thrives,
Your Majesty is handsome.

284
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:57,620
Your Majesty,

285
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,860
you are a truly handsome man in the world.

286
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,300
That is the most brilliant
flattery I have ever heard.

287
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:02,900
Shuan.

288
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,180
Give this

289
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,180
and the thing

290
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,300
I asked you to prepare a few days ago

291
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,500
to the Queen.

292
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:11,300
Yunzhang.

293
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,620
Emissaries from 21 countries,

294
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,980
including Xiyue Empire,
Cangwu Empire, and Danyi Empire

295
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,620
have arrived outside Taihe Hall

296
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:20,780
to await Your Majesty's summons.

297
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,300
Good job, Yunchong.

298
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,980
At last, you're acting like

299
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,140
a prince today.

300
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,940
Come to the Imperial Court with me later.

301
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:27,940
Yes, Yunzhang.

302
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,820
Come on, get me dressed.

303
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:36,980
Your Majesty, breathe in.

304
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,060
-Breathe in.
-I'm breathing in.

305
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,100
Hold your stomach in.

306
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,620
I'm holding it in.

307
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:44,700
Your Majesty,

308
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,420
you shouldn't eat the pork knuckle for lunch.

309
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,620
Why would I eat so much of that pork knuckle

310
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,060
if it was not tasty?

311
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:54,580
Your Majesty.

312
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,020
What to do?

313
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:58,220
Your Majesty.

314
00:14:58,900 --> 00:14:59,740
Why are you here?

315
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:02,380
I have been ordered to deliver
two good things to Your Majesty.

316
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,020
What are they?

317
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,500
This is a custom-made dress
prepared by His Majesty himself

318
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,300
for you.

319
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,140
His Majesty said,

320
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,140
"Jinfeng won't feel comfortable

321
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,660
in those clothes
from the Royal Clothing Directorate,

322
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,140
so let her change into this one."

323
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,220
This is what His Majesty said.

324
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,260
Perfect fit.

325
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,540
You look great, Your Majesty.

326
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,300
Yes.

327
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:27,740
It's gorgeous!

328
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,180
Didn't you just say you had two goodies?

329
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,540
There's also a pouch.

330
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:35,940
What is this?

331
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:36,540
Well,

332
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:37,980
His Majesty didn't say what it is.

333
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,260
I'm Jiang Yue'er from Lord Qi's Residence.

334
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:04,060
[Yufang Garden]
Greetings, Empress Dowager, Consort Dowager,

335
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,740

Why haven't you found the Queen?

501
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,340
Go and find her now.

502
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:43,420
Have you found the Queen?

503
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,220
Not yet.

504
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:44,980
Keep looking for her.

505
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:46,540
I have sent someone to find her.

506
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:49,700
Why hasn't Liu Xie come yet?

507
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,300
The Ministry of Rites has just informed us

508
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,780
that Grand Chancellor Liu
has important business today

509
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,300
and will not be attending this national banquet.

510
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,260
How dare he!

511
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,540
What's more important than the national banquet?

512
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:58,900
That's right.

513
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,580
Yu Changya?

514
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,860
Why did you bring me here?

515
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:25,700
No.

516
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,140
It's not me.

517
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:28,380
Did you do it for the formula?

518
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,780
No, you don't have the formula.

519
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:30,940
Why would I drag you here?

520
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:32,460
That's true.

521
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:54,500
(Jinfeng!)

522
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,180
(Help! Let me out of here!)

523
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:56,660
(Jinfeng!)

524
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:57,500
(Let me out of here!)

525
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,420
(Jinfeng, come here!)

526
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,140
Where is the Queen?

527
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,780
We've searched the entire Imperial Palace

528
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:26,260
but still can't find the Queen.

529
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:48,940
Yunzhang,

530
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,700
this is a gift specially prepared

531
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:52,700
by me and Baiyu for the national banquet,

532
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:53,740
Nine Dragons Spitting Pearls.

533
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:58,020
Yunchong's hands

534
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,660
are getting more skillful.

535
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:01,860
It looks like he's changed
since he's granted a marriage.

536
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:03,380
Longyue.

537
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:06,180
Why don't I also grant you a marriage

538
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,900
to change your temperament?

539
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,020
Please don't, Sister-in-law.

540
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,900
I've had my fortune told.

541
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,540
I can't marry

542
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:13,980
until I'm 40 years old.

543
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,100
Yunchong,

544
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,380
Nine Dragons Spitting Pearls?

545
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:19,220
You're not only crafty,

546
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:20,660
but you're also literate now.

547
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:23,780
Yunzhang,

548
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:26,220
I would like to invite you to twist the button

549
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:28,500
of this Nine Dragons Spitting Pearls in person.

550
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,780
The idea may be my own,

551
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:33,260
but the dragon's head was processed by Baiyu.

552
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:35,420
Why don't you just twist this button

553
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:37,260
to find out what surprise
I have prepared for you?

554
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:39,860
Thank you, Yunchong.

555
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:40,940
Your Majesty!

556
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,260
Your Majesty, something bad has happened!

557
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,140
Something bad has happened!

558
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:43,740
Don't be rude!

559
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,140
Why are you in such a panic?

560
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:45,980
What's going on?

561
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:46,900
Your Majesty,

562
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:47,740
the Queen...

563
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,380
Something has happened to the Queen.

564
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:00,980
Your Majesty, this is the place.

565
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:02,660
What is this place?

566
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:03,940
I don't know.

567
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,900
Just now, when I passed by here,

568
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:08,020
I heard the Queen's cry.

569
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,540
But I'm not sure.

570
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:10,500
It seems that there are also...

571
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,780
What else? Tell me now.

572
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:15,500
There seems to be another man's voice.

573
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:17,820
This...

574
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:19,340
Your Majesty.

575
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,300
What nonsense are you talking about?

576
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:32,740
So many dogs!

577
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:35,300
Be careful! This...

578
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,540
They're dead?

579
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,220
I... Not me.

580
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:09,740
Pass this in.

581
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:10,420
Okay.

582
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:13,100
Here comes the water.

583
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:14,780
Sufang.

584
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:17,980
Quick.

585
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:33,460
How's it?

586
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,620
Don't just shake your head. Say something!

587
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:37,740
Reporting to Your Majesty,

588
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:39,340
I shook my head because the Queen...

589
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,380
The Queen is fine.

590
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:43,300
What?

591
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,980
Her Majesty's pulse is strong

592
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:46,980
and her breath is even.

593
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:47,820
Your Majesty,

594
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,860
look how flushed Her Majesty's face is.

595
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,300
She doesn't look sick.

596
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:54,980
Then why hasn't she woken up yet?

597
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,140
Perhaps it was because

598
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:58,940
the dogs offended Her Majesty,

599
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,340
and she was scared out of her wits,

600
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,460
which caused her to have a high fever

601
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:03,900
and be unconscious.

602
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,220
So how should she be treated?

603
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:08,140
As soon as the negative energy in
Her Majesty's body recedes,

604
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:11,180
Her Majesty will be as healthy as ever.

605
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:16,540
Your Majesty.

606
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,820
I'll explain what happened today to you later.

607
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,060
I don't care what your relationship is.

608
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,660
She is the only one I care about.

609
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:00,540
Look at this.

610
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:01,300
His Majesty arrives.

611
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:03,180
Your Majesty.

612
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,060
Imperial Physician Yu,

613
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:29,620
Her Majesty's pulse is strong, right?

614
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,340
Yu Changya,

615
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,220
what's wrong with her?

616
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,660
Exactly as what I thought.

617
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,980
What illness does Jinfeng have?

618
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:45,140
She is not ill.

619
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:48,820
Just the same as before.

620
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:52,580
What do you mean by the same as before?

621
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,020
I mean,

622
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:01,540
Her Majesty's condition
is like some previous cases.

623
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:03,820
She had a panic attack.

624
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:06,580
It requires her own special psychological senses

625
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:07,620
to heal.

626
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,300
Psychological senses?

627
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,340
To put it simply,

628
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:15,460
whatever disease requires
the suitable treatment.

629
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:21,460
Jinfeng.

630
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,100
Is she cold?

631
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:39,740
Sufang.

632
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:00,940
Your Majesty.

633
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,300
I know how to cure

634
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,460
Her Majesty's illness.

635
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,140
Say it.

636
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:09,940
Rumor has it that in Xianpa Village,

637
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:13,180
there is a type of garment
called the Patchwork Robe.

638
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:15,660
It should be able to cure Her Majesty's illness.

639
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,220
Patchwork Robe?

640
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,220
Yongfu.

641
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,660
What are you doing?

642
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,340
You are so annoying!

643
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:37,700
Why didn't you

644
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,220
attend the national banquet?

645
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:40,740
You got our daughter into trouble, didn't you?

646
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:42,060
What does this have to do with me?

647
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:42,660
Step aside.

648
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:44,740
I don't have time for you right now.

649
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,220
I'll get back to you later.

650
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,180
This can be used.

651
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:58,340
Yongfu.

652
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:00,940
Okay.

653
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:06,100
Yongfu, what are you mad about?

654
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:07,820
I have nothing to do with Jinfeng's illness.

655
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:10,220
Why are you taking out your anger on my clothes?

656
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:12,140
Scorpion Liu,

657
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:14,380
is Jinfeng your daughter?

658
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:17,260
What's wrong with you sacrificing a few clothes

659
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,140
for your daughter?

660
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,140
Let me ask you.

661
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,940
Is there news from the palace

662
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:25,940
that Jinfeng has a persistent high temperature?

663
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:29,940
Did the doctor say that her pulse's strong

664
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:31,700
but she's just unconscious?

665
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:34,700
And most importantly,

666
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,340
she trembles

667
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,380
in the second half of the night.

668
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:39,940
No.

669
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:40,900
I haven't heard of this.

670
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,340
In all probability, it cannot be wrong.

671
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:45,060
Here it comes again.

672
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,380
What do you mean?

673
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:53,580
That's a long story.

674
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:57,340
Physician,

675
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:58,860
how is she?

676
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:03,060
Strange, really strange.

677
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,060
Is Jinfeng

678
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,860
really suffering from some strange disease?

679
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:08,860
In all my decades of medical practice,

680
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,140
I have never seen such a...

681
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:13,820
Doctor,

682
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:15,700
I beg you.

683
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,300
Please save my daughter.

684
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:19,060
Poor kid.

685
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:19,940
Don't worry.

686
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:22,900
I mean, I've been practicing
medicine for decades

687
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:25,220
and I've never seen such a strong person.

688
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:29,740
What do you mean?

689
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:32,380
Your daughter's pulse is so strong

690
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:35,260
that it doesn't look like she's sick.

691
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:35,940
No.

692
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:37,340
No, physician.

693
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:39,180
She's been asleep

694
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:41,460
since she was chased by the bull next door

695
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,460
this morning

696
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:44,580
and she hasn't woken up yet.

697
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:47,260
That's right.

698
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:50,180
Looks like we'll have to use that thing.

699
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,180
What is it?

700
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:55,900
What exactly is the Patchwork Robe?

701
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,460
You don't even know about the Patchwork Robe?

702
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:00,700
Patchwork Robe is a new garment

703
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,900
made from a hundred pieces
of cloth sewn together

704
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,380
from other people's clothes.

705
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:06,780
Listen.

706
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,460
This Patchwork Robe is really amazing.

707
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,700
Once you drape it over Jinfeng,

708
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:13,380
it will cure her illness, you know?

709
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:17,140
This... This rag is a cure?

710
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:18,580
Of course.

711
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:26,380
Yongfu, stop it.

712
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:27,740
What's wrong with you?

713
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:30,740
Yongfu, you don't have to do it.

714
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,940
Someone will make this for Jinfeng.

715
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:34,580
Who?

716
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:36,940
You'll know when Jinfeng is well.
