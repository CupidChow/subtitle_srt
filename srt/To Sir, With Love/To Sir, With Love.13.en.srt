1
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
But don't worry about me. 

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Jiu is a good man. He won't harm me. 

3
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:19,000
Jiu is deceiving you.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Jiu is a subordinate of …

5
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,000
Tian, let's go. 

6
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,000
Pin, please give it to Yang.

7
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:24,600
Let's go.

8
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:25,200
Tian, listen to me first. 

9
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,000
Sorry, Madam. / Tian!

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Yang, Tian gave me a letter.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I just realize now when you said

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Tian would never be able to love me. 

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
If this secret is revealed, 

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Mr. Ma will use this as an excuse to inherit the title of the Five Dragons Association's head. 

15
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,000
That's why he sent Jiu to deceive Tian. 

16
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:47,000
About finding Jiu's hiding place, now we know where the two of them are.

17
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,000
Take me there right now.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Tian, are you back?

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Bua, please meet me at the shrine next to the market tomorrow night.

20
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,000
Don't let anyone know.

21
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,000
Mr. Tian's letter.

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Bua and Yang discussed something?

23
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,000
Yes, Madam. Should we call Bua to ask?

24
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Bua, 

25
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Yang didn’t come with you?

26
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Mother.

27
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
How did you get here?

28
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
How about Bua and Yang?

29
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Jia has anesthetized them. 

30
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
They should be asleep now.

31
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Bua, do you smell anything?

32
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
What smell?

33
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Bua.

34
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Bua.

35
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Tian. 

36
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Mother.

37
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
How could you do this?

38
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
If I didn't do this, how would I know what you were thinking?

39
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:29,000
When something happened, you cried for Bua and your brother Yang to help you.

40
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Have you ever thought how would I feel?

41
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And if I ask you to help me, 

42
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
will you help me?

43
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Then I ask you.

44
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Can you me go to live with Jiu?

45
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,000
No. 

46
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Knowing that her child is walking on the path to hell, 

47
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,000
no mother still let him go.

48
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Even if it's hell, I still want to go.

49
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I want to be with the person I love.

50
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I love him.

51
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I love him, Mother.

52
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Mother, did you hear that? I love him.

53
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Mother.

54
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Mother.

55
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I really love him.

56
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I never thought before that in this life, 

57
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I would meet someone I love and he loves me as well. 

58
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Please let me go to be with the one I love.

59
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Let us go, please.

60
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Please, I beg you. 

61
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Please.

62
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Do you really think that this guy really loves you?

63
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You don't even realize that you're being deceived.

64
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
What do you mean?

65
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
He is Mr. Ma's subordinate?

66
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Ma teams up with Chan to send him to find out your secret.

67
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
The whole thing that happened was their plan.

68
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
He doesn't really love you. 

69
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
That's not true.

70
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Not true.

71
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
You're lying. 

72
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Everything I said is true.

73
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
No one in this world will love someone like you.

74
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Everyone comes to deceive you for benefit.

75
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
There is only me who loves you. 

76
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
This mother who you hate so much and want to run away.

77
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
That's not true.

78
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It's not true. I don't believe it.

79
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Jiu must not be someone like that.

80
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Come home with me, Tian. Okay?

81
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Come home with me.

82
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Jiu is not that kind of guy, Mother.

83
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,000
Tian. 

84
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,000
Jiu is not that kind of guy.

85
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,000
Tian, go home with me.

86
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I don't believe you. You're lying.

87
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,000
Tian. 

88
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,000
You lie to me. No way. 

89
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,000
Tian. 

90
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Tian. 

91
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Tian, are you back?

92
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Mr. Ma. 

93
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Where is Tian?

94
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
He's not here. I am alone.

95
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You're lying. 

96
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
You just called him now.

97
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Sir. 

98
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
You sent me to the Song family to find out Tian's secret

99
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
so that you can expose that secret and take up the position instead and that's it, right?

100
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
If that's all, don't worry.

101
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'm going to pick up my siblings and leave this place along with Tian as soon as possible.

102
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
What do you mean?

103
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
We're almost there, Sir. 

104
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Listen carefully.

105
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Today we have to bring Tian back home.

106
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:33,000
If anyone interferes, whether it's Jiu or Ma, 

107
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
kill them. 

108
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
You didn't fool me

109
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
that Tian wouldn't come back and interfere with the Association again, right?

110
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Tian and I have already talked, Sir. 

111
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Don't worry.

112
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
He might just say that to buy the time

113
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
or find a way out to get away. 

114
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Don't believe him. 

115
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I believe you, 

116
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
but I don't trust Tian.

117
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
There's no guarantee that he won't change his mind.

118
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
In the past, you did everything well.

119
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
But from now on, don't get in my way anymore.

120
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Gui.

121
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
You wait for Tian to come back

122
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
and finish this.

123
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Yes, Sir. 

124
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Tian, dodge.

125
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Didn't we agree that I'll take Tian with me and leave here?

126
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Why are you doing this?

127
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:07,000
And what is the reason for him to give up everything and run away with you?

128
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,000
You couldn't tell me Tian's secret.

129
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I will kill him myself.

130
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Tian's secret

131
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
is that…

132
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
He doesn't like women.

133
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
What do you say?

134
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
He doesn't like women.

135
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Like Zhang?

136
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Then how did you know that?

137
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Don't tell me that…

138
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Now he must be very fond of you that he is brave enough to run away with you. 

139
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,000
No matter what you say, he will believe you, right?

140
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
You're really awesome.

141
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,000
I will triple your money.

142
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
He doesn't like women.

143
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Tian, if you don't want to go home now, 

144
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
we can stay here for the time being.

145
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I'll sell candy sugar sculpture again, 

146
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
or find something for sale. 

147
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Once we get some money, we can move to another place.

148
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Is it hard to be with me?

149
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,000
I'm sorry that I can't take good care of you.

150
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I promise I'll try to take better care of you.

151
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Don't leave me, okay?

152
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Dad, Mom. 

153
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Today I bring my lover to pay respects to you. 

154
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Tian is a member of our family now.

155
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Now I don't have to be alone.

156
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
He is taking care of me.

157
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
His hut is over there, Sir. 

158
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Get ready.

159
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Get Tian out of that. 

160
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Stop!

161
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Father.

162
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Tian. 

163
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Tian. 

164
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Tian. 

165
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Tian, Tian, Tian.

166
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
What did Jiu do?

167
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Did he hurt you? Tell me.

168
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Hey, get Jiu.

169
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,000
Yes, Sir. 

170
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
No, please. No. Don't hurt Jiu.

171
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,000
Don't hurt him. 

172
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Father, please take me home.

173
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Tian. 

174
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Tian. 

175
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Tian, Tian.

176
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Tian. 

177
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
If Mr. Yang doesn't go out, he will probably stay at Bua's house.

178
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Bua, is my son with you?

179
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Bua, Yang. 

180
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Why is it so quiet?

181
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,000
I don't know either. 

182
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Bua, Yang. 

183
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Yang.

184
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Why does it unlock?

185
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Yang.

186
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Yang, my son.

187
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Yang, Yang.

188
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
What happened?

189
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,000
Yang.

190
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,665
Is he dead?

191
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Nuan, bitch. Are you cursing my child?

192
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Yang, Yang.

193
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:52,000
No, he's not dead yet. No. 

194
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
You check Bua. Hurry.

195
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,000
Yes, Madam. 

196
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,000
Yang, Yang. 

197
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,000
Yang.

198
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I was shocked. She's fine.

199
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,000
Just sleeping. If she's sleepy, why doesn't she go to bed properly?

200
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,000
You bitch.

201
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:13,000
I scream so loud but they haven't woken up yet. Do you think they're asleep?

202
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Get a damp cloth quickly.

203
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,000
Yes, Madam. 

204
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,000
Yang, baby. 

205
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Yang, Yang. 

206
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Yang. 

207
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Yang, Yang. 

208
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,000
Wake up.

209
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,000
Yang, Yang. 

210
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,000
Bua.

211
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Are you alright?

212
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Mom.

213
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
How are you?

214
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Bua. Take care of her. 

215
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
What happened?

216
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,000
Why are you sleeping like this?

217
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Mr. Yang, you'd better wait outside. I'll close them myself.

218
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
It's okay. I'll help you.

219
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
What's that smell? Can you smell it?

220
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
What smell?

221
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Bua.

222
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Bua.

223
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
You smelled something strange and then fainted?

224
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Jia. 

225
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Madam. 

226
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
How was it going?

227
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
And where is Mr. Tian?

228
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Jia. 

229
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
You're here. You gave my child anesthesia, didn't you?

230
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,000
Right?

231
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
What are you talking about? I don't know.

232
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,000
Don't pretend you don't know. 

233
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,000
What evil plan are you up to?

234
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Or because Tian is gone, so you're afraid that my Yang will replace him?

235
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Mom, calm down.

236
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:41,800
I can't. 

237
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:42,400
Mom. 

238
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:46,000
If I didn't find you there, you and Bua must have been killed by now. 

239
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Right?

240
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Right?

241
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Li. 

242
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,000
Tian. 

243
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,000
Li. 

244
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,000
Tian. 

245
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Tian. 

246
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,000
I brought our son back. / Tian.

247
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,000
How are you?

248
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Tian. 

249
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,000
Li. 

250
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:15,000
Tian. Let's take him to his room first. Let's discuss about others later.

251
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,000
Go. Hurry up. Go. 

252
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,000
Tian. 

253
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Mr. Tian is back. What should we do?

254
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,000
I thought that Jiu murdered him in the forest already. 

255
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Why did he let him go?

256
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Tian. 

257
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Where are you? Why haven't you come back yet?

258
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Tian. 

259
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,000
Tian. 

260
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Tian. 

261
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Tian. 

262
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Tian. 

263
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Tian. 

264
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Tian. 

265
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Should we expose about Tian today?

266
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,000
Not yet. 

267
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
We won't expose that Tian is homosexual right now.

268
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Because Big Brother will distort the fact to let his son get away with it. 

269
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
In the next five days, 

270
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
the Five Dragons Association will have a general meeting.

271
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:53,000
We'll expose on that day that his son was a homosexual pervert just like Zhang.

272
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Tian probably couldn't stand it.

273
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:00,000
He'll be ashamed and slit his throat to end his life like him that day. 

274
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
The Song family must be disgraced. 

275
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,000
and everything must belong to me. 

276
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,000
You're really smart.

277
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
We'll need to keep Jiu close to us

278
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:16,000
so that he could be our witness to expose Tian.

279
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:19,000
But if he doesn't agree, will use his siblings to threaten him.

280
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
He will obey us for sure.

281
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Yes, Sir. 

282
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Doctor, how is Tian?

283
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
He has pneumonia， 

284
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,000
respiratory tract infection, and high fever.

285
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,000
Quite critical. 

286
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Is it serious?

287
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
This is war time, the medicines are hard to find.

288
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,000
Mr. Tian's health is not very healthy.

289
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
We must be careful to avoid complications.

290
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
He need a lot of rest as well. 

291
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Jia, send the doctor off. 

292
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Tian. 

293
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
How are you?

294
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Don't be afraid anymore.

295
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Jiu can't harm you. 

296
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
You are like this because of him, right?

297
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Father. 

298
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
What did he do?

299
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I'm tired.

300
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Then get some rest. Don't say anything yet.

301
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Have a lot of sleep. 

302
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Tian. 

303
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Father. 

304
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I'm tired of hiding everything.

305
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
In fact...

306
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Tian. 

307
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Tian, don't talk anymore.

308
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Have a rest. 

309
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Li. 

310
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Tian is about to tell me the truth.

311
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
There is no such truth.

312
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:30,000
He is sick, so he may say something funny. Please stop forcing him to say a thing. 

313
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
I didn't force him. 

314
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
He is telling me something important. Why did you intervene?

315
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
And is it the right time?

316
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
He is sick. The doctor had just warned us to let him take a lot of rest.

317
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Please don't bother him.

318
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Tian. 

319
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Tian. 

320
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Bao, where is Tian?

321
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Did you guys capture Tian? Return him to me. 

322
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
If Jiu isn't willing to be our witness that Tian is a homosexual, 

323
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
we use his sister to threaten him.

324
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
But the girl who had escaped might already be dead, Sir. 

325
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
But we still have another brother.

326
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Or does Big Brother already know about it?

327
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
So he sent Bao to kill Jiu. 

328
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Put the scissors down. 

329
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
I told you to put down the scissors.

330
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Quickly. 

331
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Get him. 

332
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
You die.

333
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
What?

334
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Jiu. 

335
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Follow him.

336
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:50,000
Jiu. 

337
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Where did he go?

338
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Hey, over there.

339
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Mr. Song sent people to kill for me like this. 

340
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Tian must have been captured.

341
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
I think it was really Aunt Jia who anesthetized us.

342
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
But why did she do it?

343
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Maybe Madam Li knew about Tian's letter.

344
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
I think we should wait to ask Tian. He might know about it. 

345
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
But, I'm wondering about one thing. 

346
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
What's the matter?

347
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Jiu took Tian away for several days, but he didn't harm him.

348
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
The relationship between these two is strange.

349
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Do you know why?

350
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Yang.

351
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
If you know anything, tell me. So I can help you.

352
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
So what happened actually?

353
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Yang, you know about it, right?

354
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
It's about Tian's secret, right?

355
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
I know about it. 

356
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
But I can't speak.

357
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,000
Yang.

358
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Bua.

359
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
But don't worry. 

360
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Tian's secret is not about good or bad.

361
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
He is still our original good guy. 

362
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
But can you not pay attention to this matter?

363
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Please.

364
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Did Yang know about Tian and Jiu?

365
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
He said that he did, Madam. 

366
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
We have to kill him. We can't just let him go.

367
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Jia. 

368
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
But that's Yang.

369
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Although he is Chan's son, 

370
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,000
he loves Tian and is nice to Tian since they were young.

371
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,000
At first, I thought that I would kill only Dong.

372
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
But later, there were more people dying. 

373
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Doctor Qi as well. 

374
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Do we have to do that to Yang too?

375
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
The two of us have gone too deep.

376
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
I'm scared. 

377
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Madam. 

378
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Oh, I'm not afraid of being caught.

379
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,000
But I'm afraid that my karma will get back to my son instead.

380
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
The other day, Mr. Song brought Mr. Tian back home, madam.

381
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
But he was very ill and became delirious due to fever.

382
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
So I still don't know what was going on. 

383
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Mad, find a place to hide.

384
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
What happened?

385
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Nothing. 

386
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Gui is angry in place me.

387
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Thinking that you have passed the news to Big Brother

388
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
and encourage him to misunderstand me. 

389
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Did you do it?

390
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Ma.

391
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,000
I have to take care of the teahouse business to survive each day.

392
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
I don't have time to do other things.

393
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
If you didn't do it, that's good.

394
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,000
But next time, if you're going to do anything, think about it thoroughly. 

395
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Listen to me. 

396
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
The head title of the Five Dragons Association

397
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
is not tied to the Song family forever.

398
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
What do you mean?

399
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
You'll know.

400
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:25,000
Let's just say this time, I will give you a chance.

401
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Your people have eyes and ears around. 

402
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Go find out where Jiu is. 

403
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Find him before the association meeting day and report to me.

404
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Big Brother can't know about this.

405
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Otherwise, your teahouse will be nothing but ashes left. 

406
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Yes.

407
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Madam. 

408
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Why is Mr. Ma searching for Jiu?

409
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
I don't know. 

410
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Ma is protecting his subordinate?

411
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Probably not.

412
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
A guy like him has never shown kindness to anyone.

413
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
He must have a plan.

414
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
I think Jiu is not normal.

415
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Mr. Song is also searching for Jiu right now.

416
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
If he finds Jiu first, I'll you immediately.

417
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Both Big Brother and Ma want Jiu. 

418
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
If we get Jiu before everyone, 

419
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
he must be useful to us, Mud. 

420
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Yes, Madam. 

421
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Do you really think that this guy really loves you?

422
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
You don't even realize that you're being deceived.

423
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
What do you mean?

424
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
He is Mr. Ma's subordinate?

425
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
He doesn't like women.

426
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
He doesn't like women.

427
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Like Zhang?

428
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
I will triple your money.

429
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
How are you, Tian?

430
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
You need to get well soon.

431
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Do you know when you're not at home?

432
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
I don't have anyone to talk to.

433
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Don't you want to know where I have been?

434
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Or what happened?

435
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Just forget it. 

436
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Now I got my brother back.

437
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,000
I'm so happy now.

438
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Do you want something to eat?

439
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Okay, I'll tell Bua to make your favorite dish. 

440
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
So you'll get well soon.

441
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
I'll be right back. 

442
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Yang, why did you come back so fast?

443
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Tian. 

444
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,000
Jiu.

445
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
How are you?

446
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
What happened to you that night?

447
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Why did your father bring you back?

448
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,000
We better run away from here. Someone will see us. Let's go. 

449
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Tian. 

450
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
What's wrong?

451
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
I know the truth. 

452
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
You are Mr. Ma's subordinate.

453
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Tian, I'm sorry.

454
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
I'm sorry I didn't tell you. 

455
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:53,000
Let me explain, Tian. 

456
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Tian. 

457
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Tian. 

458
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Tian. 

459
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:04,200
Jiu.

460
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Jiu, come here.

461
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Tian. 

462
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Do you dare to trespass to hurt Tian at home?

463
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Anyone here, come catch him.

464
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Yang.

465
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Let's hurry up. / Tian.

466
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Yang. / Tian. 

467
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:30,000
Are you alright, Yang? / Get out. 

468
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Tian, let's go. 

469
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Jiu.

470
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
What are you doing?

471
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Tian, we don't have time.

472
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:49,000
Let me explain everything to you.

473
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Let me go. 

474
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
I already know.

475
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,000
A scum like you do everything for money.

476
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
For your own benefit.

477
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
No, it's not. 

478
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:08,000
Tian, listen to me first.

479
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Tian. 

480
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Go away. 

481
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Jiu.

482
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
You're liar.

483
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Don't let me see your face again.

484
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
No, Tian, come with me.

485
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:27,000
Go.

486
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Let's go, Tian. 

487
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,000
Let him go. What are you doing?

488
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
There's no time. / Just go. 

489
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Don't hurt Mr. Tian. / Tian. 

490
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:37,000
Go, go!

491
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Stop!

492
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Stop!

493
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Hey, I said stop.

494
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Hey, catch him. 

495
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Hurry up and catch him. 

496
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Stop. Follow him.

497
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Don't run away.

498
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Hey, stop!

499
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Follow him quickly. 

500
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Stop!

501
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Hurry. 

502
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:50,000
Get him. 

503
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:50,900
Don't run away.

504
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Sir, Jiu get in here.

505
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Stop, Jiu. 

506
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Jiu got in to see Mr. Tian. The workers are now chasing him.

507
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:28,000
If they get him, Mr. Tian's secret must be revealed.

508
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:29,000
We have to kill him first. 

509
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
I've prepared everything, Madam. 

510
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Kill Jiu before he spills Tian's secret.

511
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Tian's secret?

512
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Are they going to kill Jiu to cover up?

513
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Look around.

514
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Go over there.

515
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Who are you?

516
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
What are they doing?

517
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:35,000
And what is that little box?

518
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
I'm with you now. How am I supposed to know?

519
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
What kind of powder is that, or...

520
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Is it poison?

521
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Poison.

522
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Or is this the thing that killed Dong?

523
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
They're going to kill Jiu soon, Madam.

524
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:50,000
If he dies, no one will expose Tian.

525
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
What shall we do?

526
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Sir, Sir. 

527
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
This way.

528
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Be careful.

529
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Sir. 

530
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Who are you?

531
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Li. 

532
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Hey!

533
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Jiu.

534
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Madam Li and Jia were killing Jiu. I saw it with my own eyes.

535
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Is it true?

536
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:50,000
I didn't kill anyone.

537
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,000
I've heard that Jiu got in here.

538
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:55,000
So I'm going to help catch him.

539
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Then why did you dress like this?

540
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:02,000
Right. 

541
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Not only dressing weirdly, 

542
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
but you also covered yourself.

543
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:12,000
If you aren't killing someone, why do you cover your body like you're afraid other people will see you?

544
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Catching a culprit, if I wear what I wear at home, 

545
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,000
how can I run after him?

546
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Don't believe her, Sir. She's lying.

547
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Before going to kill Jiu, 

548
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
I overheard Madam talking to Jia.

549
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:33,000
She said Jiu knew about Tian's secret, so she needed to kill him to hide the truth.

550
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:34,000
Right, Nuan?

551
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:35,000
Yes, Sir. 

552
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:39,400
And I also saw that Madam Li and Jia threw a kind of powder to Jiu.
Nonsense, liar.

553
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:41,000
When it touched Jiu, he cried out.

554
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:50,000
This powder must be the powder that was used to kill Dong. 

555
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:55,000
Jia and I were going to catch Jiu.

556
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
But you, Chan, you stopped us from catching him.

557
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Why did you do that?

558
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Don't change the topic. 

559
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:08,000
Why did I help him?

560
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:10,000
Because he's Mr. Ma's subordinate.

561
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:14,000
You're afraid that if Jiu was caught, he would expose you. 

562
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:15,000
That's not true!

563
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Our people have been searching for Jiu everywhere, but didn't find him. 

564
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,000
We have a lot of people. 

565
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:56,000
But we can't even find him. 

566
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,000
That upsets me.

567
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
And who do you believe?

568
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Madam Li or Madam Chan. 

569
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,000
I don't believe both.

570
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,000
What should I do?

571
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:16,000
How can I know what happened exactly?

572
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
What is Tian's secret?

573
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
I will hurry to find Jiu. 

574
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,000
If we catch him, things will become clearer.

575
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Yang.

576
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,000
How is Jiu?

577
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,000
He could run away. 

578
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,000
I'm sorry, Yang. 

579
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,000
I got you into trouble again.

580
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,000
I'm fine.

581
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Really. Get some rest.

582
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:21,100
Yang.

583
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Actually…

584
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Jiu and I…

585
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
We are…

586
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:35,000
I know that/ 

587
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Don't say anything.

588
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Do you know about it?

589
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Do you think…

590
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Do you think I'm stupid?

591
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,000
I'm like a fool

592
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
for thinking that someone would love me

593
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,000
even though...

594
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
I don't deserve real love.

595
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Tian. 

596
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Listen to me. 

597
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Don't think like that.

598
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Don't blame yourself.

599
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Everything that happened wasn't your fault.

600
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:54,000
You're just unlucky that you fell in love with the wrong guy. 

601
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Loving someone who deceived you for benefits.

602
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
He's bad.

603
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
It's not that you're not worthy of a good love.

604
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Tian. 

605
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,000
For me,

606
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,000
you are a very good brother.

607
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,000
You're considerate.

608
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
And most importantly, you are the person I love

609
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:28,000
and I want my loved one to be the happiest.

610
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
If you think that no one loves you, 

611
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,000
I want you to know that

612
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,000
I love you.

613
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
And I will always be beside you, brother. 

614
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,000
Madam. 

615
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Chan saw us using the orchid.

616
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:17,000
Yang also know about Mr. Tian's secret.

617
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:21,000
If we leave them, they must be a threat to us in the future.

618
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,000
What should we do?

619
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Mr. Song is watching us now. 

620
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:29,000
If Yang or Chan is dead or disappears, 

621
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Mr. Song definitely won't let this matter quiet. 

622
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:34,000
But anyway, we have to find a way to kill them. 

623
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Tonight, 

624
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
you lure Yang to the back of the house.

625
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Then use the orchid to kill him.

626
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,000
How about Madam Chan?

627
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
When Yang disappears, 

628
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,000
she will probably look for him.

629
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
We will kill her by then.

630
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,000
And when the other two are gone, 

631
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:26,000
we will claim that they run away because of guilt

632
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,000
siding with Mr. Ma.

633
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Aunt Jia.

634
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
Didn't you say that Tian want to talk to me?

635
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,000
And where is him?

636
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Wait a minute, Mr. Tian is coming.

637
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,000
The wind direction is just right.

638
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Aunt Jia, what is this?

639
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
I think I'd better meet him at his room.

640
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Mr. Yang.

641
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Mr. Tian.

642
01:06:55,300 --> 01:06:56,000
Tian. 

643
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Tian. 

644
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,000
What are you doing?

645
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:04,000
Come here.

646
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:05,000
Tian. 

647
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:06,000
Go wash your hands. / Tian.

648
01:07:06,300 --> 01:07:07,000
Tian. 

649
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:08,000
Get out.

650
01:07:08,300 --> 01:07:09,000
No.

651
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:10,000
Wash your hands.

652
01:07:10,300 --> 01:07:12,000
Hurry up, Madam. / Right now.

653
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:13,000
What are you doing? Huh?

654
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:53,000
How is it? Is it in time?

655
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,000
Yes. 

656
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:57,000
Fortunately, Mr. Tian did not inhale the dust. 

657
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,000
What did you do?

658
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,000
You ordered Aunt Jia to kill Yang?

659
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,000
This is too much, Mother. 

660
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,000
I need to do it. Yang knew all. 

661
01:08:09,300 --> 01:08:10,000
If anything happens to Yang. 

662
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
you prepare a funeral for me. 

663
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:14,000
Tian. 

664
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Don't say that. 

665
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:17,100
Madam didn't want to do it.

666
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,000
She herself was very sad.

667
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:24,000
You knew why she had to do it.

668
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:25,000
I know. 

669
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
But couldn't you do that?

670
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Can you stop this? I beg you.

671
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Yes. 

672
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,000
So,

673
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:45,000
on the association meeting day, you have to announce your marriage.

674
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:46,100
I will find you a woman.

675
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Get married and take the position of the leader. 

676
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
It's too late, Mother. 

677
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,000
Jiu told Mr. Ma already.

678
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
That I am a homosexual.

679
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,000
What?

680
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:08,000
You still insist that I should announce the marriage?

681
01:10:08,300 --> 01:10:12,000
If you do everything as I said, everyone will be safe.

682
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Look at this first. 

683
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Sir. 

684
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:18,000
Sir. 

685
01:10:18,300 --> 01:10:20,000
Tian's secret.

686
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,000
Catch him.
