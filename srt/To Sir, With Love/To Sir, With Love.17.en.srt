1
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:20,856
Herbal tonic to restore your strength to fight with Mr. Ma's gang.

2
00:00:20,864 --> 00:00:24,872
Jiu, drink it. Madam Li has carefully boiled it for you.

3
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,500
I may not be a good woman,

4
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,500
but I am not bad enough to support an evil man like Ma.

5
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,592
What should we do?

6
00:00:38,592 --> 00:00:41,688
About that, leave it to me.

7
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,500
What's the matter?

8
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,500
It's my teahouse account.

9
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:49,500
I brought the liquor to celebrate together.

10
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,500
The Japanese soldiers are all at the party.

11
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,500
There are only Mr. Ma's subordinates in the house.

12
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,500
You can follow the plan, Madam.

13
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,200
The Japs are having fun, drinking alcohol with the women.

14
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:01,104
There are only us patrolling here.

15
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,304
This is not fair.

16
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,700
Mud will take Yang and Jiu to help the people inside.

17
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,000
You guys wait for them in the forest at the back of the house.

18
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,200
Waiting to pick them up according to the plan.

19
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:18,700
Okay.

20
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,700
What about you?

21
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,700
I will stay here and make sure that Mud can take them in.

22
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,700
I'll stay here with you.

23
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,700
Go, Bua. Hurry up. / Let's go.

24
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:37,700
Lady.

25
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,700
Stop, what's that chest?

26
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,700
Mr. Ma ordered me to bring more alcohol.

27
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,700
Really?

28
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,700
Of course.

29
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,700
You saw this morning that I was with Madam Xiaotong.

30
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,700
And the chest contains alcohol only.

31
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,700
Please get out of the way.

32
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:19,700
If the alcohol is not enough, Mr. Ma will get angry.

33
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,700
Open it first to see what's inside.

34
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,700
Take it easy.

35
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,700
If you want to open it, open here.

36
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:39,700
What would you like?

37
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:52,700
Shall we go to the back of the house?

38
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,700
Let's hurry.

39
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,700
Stop!

40
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,700
Where are you heading?

41
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,700
Did you open it to see what's inside?

42
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,700
Brother.

43
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,700
What should we do?

44
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,700
Wait here.

45
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,700
What are you doing?

46
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,700
Wait right here, I'll be right back.

47
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,700
Where are you going?

48
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,000
Madam.

49
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:58,700
Open it.
Quickly.

50
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,700
Hey, brother.

51
00:06:05,088 --> 00:06:07,016
The liquor inside is expensive.

52
00:06:07,016 --> 00:06:10,296
If you open it and the and inside it is damaged, what should I do?

53
00:06:10,296 --> 00:06:12,192
Say something, retreat

54
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,040
Madam Li.

55
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,700
Go.

56
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,700
Go stop her from over there.

57
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,776
So I'll go in.

58
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,880
Let's go, girls.

59
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,700
Stop.

60
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,700
Open it.

61
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,700
If you don't open it, I'll be in trouble.

62
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,700
Hey, there's nothing inside.

63
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,700
Hide his body somewhere.

64
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,700
Everyone, follow me.

65
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:26,700
Let's go.

66
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,700
Where are you going?

67
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,400
Chan.

68
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,300
Madam.

69
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,700
Chan.

70
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,700
Madam, don't.

71
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,700
Father.

72
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,700
I've actually seen them imprisoned here last time.

73
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,700
I'm sure that Mr. Ma locks them up somewhere else instead.

74
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,700
Let's find them. Go.

75
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,700
Mr. Yang. / Jiu.

76
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,700
Bao, where are Father and Tian?

77
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,700
I couldn't find them at the firewood shed.

78
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:30,700
I was locked up separately.

79
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:32,700
The last time I saw them was at the wood shed.

80
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,700
Let everyone escape first.

81
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:37,700
Mud, take everyone out to the back.

82
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,700
Madam Li is waiting there. Go.

83
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,700
Okay. Let's go.

84
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,700
Hurry. Hurry up.

85
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,700
Hurry.

86
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:44,700
Let's go.

87
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,700
Go, go.

88
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:47,700
Let's go, Yang.

89
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:53,700
Bao, Mud.

90
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,700
Lady, take the workers to hide at your house first.

91
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,700
Mud, Bao and I will wait for the rest here.

92
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,700
Please hurry out of here.

93
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,700
Yes. Everyone, follow me this way.

94
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:10,700
You two, run away quickly.

95
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,700
Sir.

96
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,700
Stop!

97
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:43,700
I caught them at the front of the house.

98
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,700
How about others?

99
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,700
There's no one else.

100
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,700
I'm just bringing you an antidote.

101
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,700
But I met your subordinates,

102
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,700
I have to deal with them.

103
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,700
Where is the antidote?

104
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:05,700
And where is my husband and son?

105
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,700
You have no right to negotiate with me.

106
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,700
Give me the antidote.

107
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,700
If I am better,

108
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:14,700
I will let go of Big Brother.

109
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,700
So annoying.

110
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,700
Hurry and kill them. I want more party.

111
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,700
What is this?

112
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,700
Bitch.

113
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,700
Kill her.

114
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,700
Zun, quickly.

115
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:16,700
Sir.

116
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:17,700
Madam.

117
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,700
Watch out.

118
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,700
Run, everyone.

119
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,700
Go, go.

120
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,700
Quickly. Hurry.

121
00:12:29,928 --> 00:12:31,936
This must be your plan

122
00:12:31,936 --> 00:12:33,928
sending people to cause chaos.

123
00:12:33,944 --> 00:12:36,760
Then let Chan's son to help the hostages.

124
00:12:36,784 --> 00:12:39,240
Do you think you can save everyone?

125
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Mr. Song.

126
00:13:05,008 --> 00:13:06,096
Tian.

127
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Xiaotong.

128
00:13:21,328 --> 00:13:22,584
Madam.

129
00:13:22,584 --> 00:13:24,784
Xiaotong, how is it inside?

130
00:13:24,784 --> 00:13:27,368
Madam Li and Chan are still inside with Ma.

131
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:29,320
Oh, no. We didn't see Mr. Song.

132
00:13:29,328 --> 00:13:32,000
And Madam Li and others are also captured by Ma?

133
00:13:38,672 --> 00:13:40,552
Don't hurt them.

134
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:42,750
Don't worry.

135
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:44,750
They're not dead yet.

136
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,750
Zun, wake them up.

137
00:13:59,904 --> 00:14:00,750
Yes, Sir.

138
00:14:21,064 --> 00:14:22,450
Mother.

139
00:14:22,856 --> 00:14:24,192
Aunt Chan.

140
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:27,056
Tian, your mother and I are here to help you.

141
00:14:27,056 --> 00:14:28,560
Don't be afraid.

142
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,632
Li, Chan.

143
00:14:30,632 --> 00:14:32,184
Run away. Quickly.

144
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:34,496
- Damn.
- Sir!

145
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,944
Put the gun down.

146
00:14:38,592 --> 00:14:39,848
Now!

147
00:14:45,864 --> 00:14:47,256
Put it down!

148
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:00,450
Give me the antidote.

149
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,128
Give it to me.

150
00:15:04,728 --> 00:15:06,360
Release Mr. Song and Tian.

151
00:15:07,016 --> 00:15:08,800
If you don't let them go,

152
00:15:09,144 --> 00:15:11,320
I will burn this antidote.

153
00:15:11,592 --> 00:15:14,450
If you don't have it, you'll die.

154
00:15:15,168 --> 00:15:17,288
You have no right to negotiate with me.

155
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,016
Stop.

156
00:15:20,384 --> 00:15:22,472
Otherwise, I'll burn it for real.

157
00:15:24,824 --> 00:15:26,192
Alright.

158
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:42,450
Sir!

159
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:46,450
Father!

160
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:48,450
Father, are you okay?

161
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:49,450
Father.

162
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:50,450
Tian.

163
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,450
Are you alright?

164
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:53,450
I am fine.

165
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:55,450
Father, hang in there.

166
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,450
You must be fine, Father.

167
00:15:58,450 --> 00:15:59,450
Good.

168
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:04,450
Father!

169
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:08,450
Wake up, Father. Wake up.

170
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:13,750
Hey, please wake up and talk to me. Father.
Sir.

171
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:15,450
Father!

172
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,450
Father, wake up.

173
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:23,450
I give up. I give up.

174
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:25,450
Take this antidote.

175
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:29,450
Madam, Madam.

176
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:32,450
Don't give it to him, or he'll kill us all.

177
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,450
Zun, get the medicine.

178
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:36,450
Yes, Sir.

179
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:54,450
You're the first to die.

180
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:55,450
Tian.

181
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:13,450
Jiu.

182
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,450
Tian.

183
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:18,450
Jiu.

184
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:20,450
Mom.

185
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:32,450
Tian.

186
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:36,450
Tian.

187
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:38,450
Let go of my brother.

188
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:42,450
We have more people. You have no way to escape any way.

189
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:49,864
Zun, let's go.

190
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,632
Tian.

191
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,450
Tian.

192
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,568
Tian.

193
00:17:59,384 --> 00:18:00,504
Father.

194
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:01,776
-Father!
- Mr. Song.

195
00:18:01,776 --> 00:18:03,664
- Sir!
- Father!

196
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:08,450
Wake up, Father. Wake up.

197
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,864
Wake up. Father!

198
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:15,872
What happened?

199
00:18:15,872 --> 00:18:18,080
What happened? Sir.

200
00:18:18,552 --> 00:18:19,520
Mr. Song.

201
00:18:20,736 --> 00:18:21,976
Father.

202
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,544
Save Tian.

203
00:18:26,144 --> 00:18:28,088
Quickly.

204
00:18:28,992 --> 00:18:30,520
Help him.

205
00:18:37,064 --> 00:18:38,736
Madam! Madam!
Madam Li.

206
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,056
Madam!

207
00:18:40,968 --> 00:18:43,096
Bua, take Father to the doctor.

208
00:18:43,096 --> 00:18:44,576
I'm going to help Tian.

209
00:18:44,576 --> 00:18:46,760
Okay, be careful.

210
00:18:46,768 --> 00:18:50,248
- Bua, please take care of him.
- Yes, Madam. Please be careful.

211
00:18:52,432 --> 00:18:55,624
Mr. Song? Sir.

212
00:18:55,736 --> 00:18:56,696
Tian

213
00:19:02,824 --> 00:19:03,912
Tian.

214
00:19:10,104 --> 00:19:12,704
Come here. Zun.

215
00:19:14,584 --> 00:19:17,512
Come here.

216
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,344
Come here. You pansy.

217
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:43,520
At the end, you'll never survive.

218
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,072
Mr. Ma.

219
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:58,856
You are pathetic.

220
00:19:58,872 --> 00:20:01,248
You want all the powers,

221
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:04,520
but you have to run and hide like a dog.

222
00:20:05,736 --> 00:20:07,064
Mr. Ma!

223
00:20:10,344 --> 00:20:12,360
I bring the antidote for you.

224
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,192
Let go of my son now.

225
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:15,184
Mother.

226
00:20:19,032 --> 00:20:20,400
Mr. Ma.

227
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,640
Li.

228
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,640
There are oil and gunpowder inside.

229
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,640
If you plays tricks on me,

230
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,640
I will burn you to death.

231
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,640
Hey!

232
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,640
Madam.

233
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,640
Madam.

234
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,640
Li.

235
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,840
Give it to me inside.

236
00:21:00,096 --> 00:21:01,608
You come in alone.

237
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:04,140
If you don't do what I said,

238
00:21:05,616 --> 00:21:07,808
I will burn Tian until he dies alive.

239
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,336
Madam.

240
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,140
You guys wait for me here.

241
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,140
But this must be his trap.

242
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,140
But we don't have choices.

243
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,140
Madam.

244
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,140
Madam.

245
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,140
Tian.

246
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,140
Mom, stop!

247
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,140
They've poured the fuel on the floor.

248
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,140
The antidote.

249
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:35,140
Tian, Tian.

250
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:37,140
Are you alright?

251
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,140
I don't trust you.

252
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:33,140
You eat it first.

253
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,140
Eat it!

254
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,140
Eat it!

255
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,140
Eat it now!

256
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,140
You die!

257
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:51,140
Mother.

258
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,140
Mother.

259
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,140
Are you injured?

260
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:03,140
I've figured out that someone like you won't do as you said.

261
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:08,140
You two shall die in the fire.

262
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,140
What are you laughing at?

263
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,140
Are you crazy?

264
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:28,140
Mother.

265
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,140
Mother!

266
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,140
Mother!

267
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,140
Li.

268
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,140
What's wrong with you?

269
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:38,140
The medicine you took is mixed with the beetle orchid.

270
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,140
Soon you will suffer from a painful death.

271
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,140
Li!

272
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,140
Mother.

273
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,140
Sir.

274
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:54,140
Why did you do this?

275
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:56,140
How do I live?

276
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:02,140
Bitch, you die!

277
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,140
Madam!

278
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,140
Tian.

279
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,140
Madam!

280
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:11,140
Madam!

281
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,140
Help her please.

282
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,140
Madam.

283
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,440
Help Mother. Help her!
Madam, hang in there.

284
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,640
Help her.

285
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:18,240
Madam.

286
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,140
Sir.

287
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,140
Please go to the doctor first.

288
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,140
No, don't worry about me.

289
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,140
Sir.

290
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,140
I have to make sure everyone is safe.

291
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:29,130
Okay.

292
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,140
Sir.

293
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:32,140
Bao.

294
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:34,140
Did you find Li?

295
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:35,130
No, Sir.

296
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,140
Help Mother now.

297
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,140
Hang in there. / Mother.

298
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,140
Madam. / Mother.

299
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,140
Please be strong.

300
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,140
Talk to me, Mother.

301
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,140
Let's go now.

302
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:49,140
Let's die together here.

303
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:00,140
I won't let you live.

304
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,140
Hide. Now.

305
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:16,140
Chan.

306
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:20,140
Take Tian and others out.

307
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:22,140
Stop him from coming inside.

308
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,140
What are you doing?

309
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,140
Promise me.

310
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,140
Yes, Madam.

311
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:42,140
You.

312
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:45,140
You have to die with me.

313
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:52,140
Mother! / Madam!

314
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,140
Madam! / Mother!

315
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,140

Get out of here.

322
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:04,740
Mother!

323
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:05,340
Madam!

324
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:07,140
I'm going to help her.

325
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:10,340
Mother. Mother!
Bitch.

326
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,140
You bitch.

327
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,140
I'll kill you.

328
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:18,140
Madam!

329
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:22,140
Sir.

330
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,140
Don't go. It's dangerous.

331
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:28,140
Chan, get everyone out of here.

332
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,140
Mother!

333
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:32,140
Run!

334
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:36,140
Mother! Mother!

335

No! Don't go!

Let go of me.

340

Listen to me. Stop!

341

345
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:01,140
I told you to let go.

346
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,140
I'll kill you.

347
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:08,140
And I'll kill your gay son.

348
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,140
Let me go!

349
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,140
I told you to let me go.

350
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:41,140
Tian is my son.

351
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,140
No matter what he is,

352
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,140
he's still my son.

353
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,140
Don't touch him.

354
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,140
Tian, stop.

355
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:22,140
I have promised Madam already.

356
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:24,140
I'll never let you go.

357
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,140
Do you understand?

358
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:27,140
What happened?

359
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,140
What happened?

360
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:31,140
Father, help. Mother is trapped inside.

361
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:33,140
What? Madam is inside.

362
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,140

363
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:36,140

368
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:58,500
Li.

369
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:03,530
Li.

370
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,140
Li! Li!

371
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,140
Li.

372
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,140
Li, I'm here. I'm here with you now.

373
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:11,140
Li.

374
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:12,140
Li.

375
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,140
Sir.

376
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,140
Get out.

377
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:17,140
Don't help me.

378
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:20,140
No, no.

379
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,140
Li!

380
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,140
Li!

381
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:33,140
No, Tian.

382
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,140
Let me go!

383
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,140
Aunt Chan, let me go!

384
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:37,140
Sir.

385
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,140
Please let me go. I'm going to help Father and Mother.

Let me go!

387
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,140
Let me go!

388
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,140
Tian, no. / Tian!

389

Let go of me.

393
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,140
Father! Mother!

394
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,140
Tian.

395
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,140
Tian.

396
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:00,140
Tian.

397
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:03,140
You must be safe.

398
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,140
I've promised your mom.

399
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:09,140
You stay here.

400
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:11,140
I'll handle it.

401
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:21,140
Mom. / Madam.

402
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,140
Madam!

403
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,140
Sir.

404
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,140
Madam. / Mother.

405
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,140
Madam！

406
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:36,140
Madam！

407
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,140
Madam！

408
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,140
Take her to the hospital.

Hurry.

410
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,140
Mother.

411
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,140
Talk to me first, Mother.

412
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,140
Mother.

413
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:46,140
Please be okay, Mother.

414
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,140
Mother, Mother.

415
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:51,140
Talk to me first, Mother.

416
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,140
Mother!

417
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,140
Mother, please be alright.

Mother!

420
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,140
Mother, Mother.

421
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:00,140
Mother.

422
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,440
Li. Li.
Madam.

423
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,140
Mother.

424
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,140
Please be strong.

425
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,140
Hang in there.

426
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:05,140
Talk to me.

427
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:06,640
Hang in there, Madam.
I'll take you to the hospital.

428
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,140
Bao, find a car.

429
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,140
Yes, Sir.

430
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:11,140
Madam.

431
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,140
Mother.

432
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,140
Li.

433
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:16,140
It's useless now, Sir.

434
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:18,140
I'm aware of that.

435
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,140
Madam.

436
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,140
Don't say that.

437
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:26,140
Sir.

438
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:32,140
I'm sorry

439
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:36,140
that I was the cause of everything.

440
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:38,140
Mother.

441
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:40,140
Don't apologize.

442
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,140
Don't say sorry for anything.

443
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:47,140
Before I die,

444
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:55,140
I have something to ask you, Sir.

445
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:03,140
Please don't be angry or hate our son

446
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:07,140
that he's not like others.

447
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:15,140
He does his best as a son could do.

448
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:18,140
I understand everything.

449
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:24,140
No matter what he is,

450
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:26,140
no matter who he loves,

451
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:29,140
he is still our son.

452
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:39,140
Stay strong.
You must stay with our son and me.

453
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,140
Bua.

454
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:46,140
Yang.

455
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:53,140
Thank you so much

456
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:59,140
for taking care of Tian all along.

457
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:04,140
Bua.

458
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:06,140
Yes, Madam.

459
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:11,140
The day that I let Tian be your son,

460
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:16,140
I really mean it.

461
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:20,140
You are another mother of him.

462
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,140
Yes, Madam.

463
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:28,140
I really love Mr. Tian as if he was my child.

464
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:34,140
Madam.

465
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,140
Yang.

466
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:46,140
You had always known what Tian is like,

467
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:50,140
but you still loves

468
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:53,140
and respects him as before.

469
00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:00,140
I'm his mother,

470
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:03,140
but I can't even do that.

471
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:11,140
Madam, don't say that.

472
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,140
I know.

473
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:18,140
I know that you did everything because you love Tian.

474
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,140
Chan.

475
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:33,140
Our disagreement in the past,

476
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:38,140
let it end today.

477
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:44,140
Please take care of Tian for me.

478
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:49,140
No, Madam. You can't die.

479
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:54,140
He's your child. You have to take care of him. You can't let others look after him.

480
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,140
Madam.

481
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,140
Madam.

482
00:37:58,140 --> 00:37:59,140
Mother.

483
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,140
Tian.

484
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:04,140
Yes, Mother.

485
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:07,140
I'm sorry

486
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:14,140
that I made you face this mess.

487
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:18,140
I'm never angry with you.

488
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:22,140
When you were a child,

489
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:26,140
the day I knew what you are,

490
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,140
I hit you,

491
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,140
stopped you,

492
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:36,140
because I wanted to protect you.

493
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:41,140
But I didn't know that

494
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:47,140
what I did have pushed you away from me.

495
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,140
Mother.

496
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:50,140
I know.

497
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:53,140
You did everything because you love me.

498
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:05,140
I'm worried about you.

499
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,140
Really.

500
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:13,140
I'm afraid that

501
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:18,140
if someone knows what you are,

502
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:23,140
he will be disgusted and hurt you.

503
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:29,140
I was really stupid.

504
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:36,140
My Tian is smart and strong.

505
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:39,140
No matter what happens,

506
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:43,140
you can do it.

507
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:47,140
Yes, Mother.

508
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:51,140
Madam.

509
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:55,140
Sir, the car is here.

510
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,140
Let's go.

511
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,140
Li, get up.

512
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,140
Madam.

513
00:39:58,740 --> 00:39:59,240
No, no.

514
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,140
Let's go, Li.

515
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,140
No, I'm not going.

516
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,140
It's okay.

517
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:03,140
No.

518
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:05,140
Tian.

519
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:08,140
Listen to me.

520
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:14,140
Don't let others treat you

521
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:17,140
like I did to you.

522
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:24,140
Don't let anyone makes you

523
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:28,140
feel that what you are

524
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:31,140
is a disgrace,

525
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:33,140
is wrong

526
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:36,140
and have to hide it.

527
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:40,140
Live a happy life

528
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:43,140
the way you choose.

529
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:49,140
Be proud of yourself

530
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:53,140
like I do.

531
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:57,140
Yes, Mother.

532
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:19,140
Please take care of him.

533
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:23,140
Yes, Madam.

534
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:32,140
Li.

535
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,140
Li.

536
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,140
Madam.

537
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:36,140
Li./ Madam.

538
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:38,140
Madam.

539
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:39,140
Madam.

540
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:42,140
Madam.

541
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:45,140
Madam.

542
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:47,140
Madam.

543
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:49,140
Mother!

544
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,140
Madam.

545
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:52,140
Madam.

546
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,140
Madam.

547
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:08,140
Good, let's tidy the place.

548
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:12,140
It's a miracle we survived.

549
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:15,140
So what will happen to the Song family next?

550
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,140
Will something bad happen again?

551
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:18,140
No more.

552
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:21,140
From now on, there will be only happiness.

553
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:25,140
Mr. Song will protect and restore the clan for sure.

554
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:46,140
Now Mother and Aunt Jia

555
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:50,140
would have met already.

556
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:53,140
Aunt Jia,

557
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:57,140
please take care of my mother.

558
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:04,140
Madam Li would take care of us as well

559
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:06,140
just like before.

560
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:14,140
Li.

561
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:16,140
About household matters

562
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:20,140
and Tian,

563
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:24,140
don't worry.

564
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:27,140
You are very tired.

565
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:33,140
From now on, I will take care and protect our son

566
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:35,140
on behalf of you.

567
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:45,140
As for what I promised you,

568
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:48,140
don't worry.

569
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:52,140
I don't want you to remind me of the promise.

570
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:00,140
Madam.

571
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:02,140
Don't worry.

572
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:08,140
Madam Chan and I will take care of Tian.

573
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:18,140
Mother.

574
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:24,140
I'll do as you said.

575
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:30,140
I will live my life

576
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:33,140
happily

577
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:38,140
and be proud of myself.

578
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:48,140
Please watch and encourage me, Mother.

579
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:55,140
Thank you for everything

580
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:00,140
that you had always done for me.

581
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:44,140
I look good now, right?

582
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:48,140
You are gorgeous, Madam.

583
00:46:58,140 --> 00:46:59,140
Father, they are here.

584
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:10,140
Sir.

585
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:13,140
Please go inside.

586
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:30,140
Am I okay?

587
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:37,140
Sir.

588
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:40,140
Li's mourning period has passed.

589
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:44,140
It's time for us to talk about it.

590
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:49,140
We are not strangers to each other.

591
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:52,140
Please allow me to get into the point, so we won't waste time.

592
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:58,140
You knew that my son and Lady Pin love each other.

593
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:03,140
Would you mind letting her marry my son Yang?

594
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:11,140
I know these two kids love each other.

595
00:48:11,824 --> 00:48:13,140
But...

596
00:48:13,576 --> 00:48:16,960
everyone knows that previously,

597
00:48:16,992 --> 00:48:20,912
Pin was Tian's fiancée.

598
00:48:22,672 --> 00:48:24,424
Breaking up with him

599
00:48:24,912 --> 00:48:26,608
to marry his younger brother.

600
00:48:26,616 --> 00:48:29,272
I'm afraid that people will gossip about this.

601
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:38,896
On that matter, I really have to apologize, Sir.

602
00:48:39,390 --> 00:48:42,736
But I want you to have compassion for Lady Pin.

603
00:48:43,472 --> 00:48:46,056
These two really love each other.

604
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:56,504
Sir,

605
00:48:57,290 --> 00:48:59,488
we can't stop what others think,

606
00:49:00,608 --> 00:49:03,152
but what we should consider is

607
00:49:03,968 --> 00:49:05,896
the happiness of our children.

608
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:08,624
Well, you're not the person who is being gossip about.

609
00:49:10,992 --> 00:49:15,488
Mr. Yang, please take Lady Pin for a walk outside.

610
00:49:15,504 --> 00:49:17,352
Let the adults talk here.

611
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:24,608
Go.

612
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:33,520
Excuse me.

613
00:49:49,590 --> 00:49:52,944
What will your father say?

614
00:49:55,590 --> 00:49:58,840
No matter what he says, I'll have to follow him.

615
00:50:00,590 --> 00:50:01,590
Pin.

616
00:50:02,590 --> 00:50:07,112
You mean that if he doesn't allow us to get married,

617
00:50:07,496 --> 00:50:09,072
you'll do as he said?

618
00:50:09,488 --> 00:50:10,432
Yes.

619
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:12,840
If he says so, I must follow him.

620
00:50:13,504 --> 00:50:16,928
Because I'll do what I want as well.

621
00:50:21,528 --> 00:50:23,448
I thought I wasn't able to marry you anymore.

622
00:50:24,590 --> 00:50:27,184
If he don't want us to get married, we might not get married.

623
00:50:27,944 --> 00:50:32,280
But I will pack my bag and live with you here anyway.

624
00:50:34,008 --> 00:50:39,248
Pin. If you do that, others will gossip about us.

625
00:50:39,776 --> 00:50:41,984
I really mean it.

626
00:50:42,288 --> 00:50:45,160
All the things that happened made me realize.

627
00:50:45,488 --> 00:50:48,624
Maybe if we care too much about others,

628
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,952
we will not be happy.

629
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:53,192
Look at me.

630
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:57,040
At first, I was afraid that others would gossip about me,

631
00:50:57,048 --> 00:50:59,080
saying that I was poor

632
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:01,336
and needed to get married to Tian.

633
00:51:04,990 --> 00:51:06,288
You're right.

634
00:51:06,990 --> 00:51:11,896
Madam Li tried to hide Tian's secret

635
00:51:11,904 --> 00:51:14,288
due to the fear of the gossip.

636
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:16,990
That's why he suffered for a long time.

637
00:51:18,896 --> 00:51:20,368
Therefore,

638
00:51:20,368 --> 00:51:23,776
let others think or talk as they want.

639
00:51:24,990 --> 00:51:26,990
I would rather choose to live a happy life.

640
00:51:29,576 --> 00:51:33,456
But if someone talks bad about you,

641
00:51:33,450 --> 00:51:36,544
I'm going to punch the person right away.

642
00:51:38,888 --> 00:51:40,464
Me too.

643
00:51:40,512 --> 00:51:42,392
If someone talks bad about you,

644
00:51:42,408 --> 00:51:43,912
I'll deal with him.

645
00:51:45,208 --> 00:51:46,408
How?

646
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:49,352
Are you going to hide in a box?

647
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,816
What's up with you two?

648
00:51:56,448 --> 00:51:59,248
Isn't it enough to fight other people?

649
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:01,990
Hey.

650
00:52:03,256 --> 00:52:04,888
At the wedding,

651
00:52:05,152 --> 00:52:07,896
don't fight with the guests.

652
00:52:13,776 --> 00:52:14,608
Tian.

653
00:52:16,232 --> 00:52:19,520
You said the wedding just now.

654
00:52:19,752 --> 00:52:21,456
What do you mean?

655
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:24,408
It means

656
00:52:25,328 --> 00:52:27,528
Prince Pat, Pin's father,

657
00:52:29,944 --> 00:52:32,344
allows Pin to marry you.

658
00:52:34,896 --> 00:52:36,990
Tian.

659
00:52:39,176 --> 00:52:40,512
Yang.

660
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:42,990
Over there.

661
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:47,840
Sorry.

662
00:53:29,990 --> 00:53:32,472
Father, it's late.

663
00:53:32,488 --> 00:53:35,120
If you don't rest, you'll fall ill.

664
00:53:35,990 --> 00:53:38,136
I need to hurry up and finish works.

665
00:53:39,384 --> 00:53:43,232
Yang's wedding is coming soon.

666
00:53:43,496 --> 00:53:45,496
By that time I must have been very busy.

667
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,730
I have to see Xiaotong as well.

668
00:53:49,744 --> 00:53:51,240
Tell her this news.

669
00:53:52,688 --> 00:53:55,990
So I'd like to talk about the business rehabilitation too.

670
00:53:57,990 --> 00:53:59,784
It's good that the mess is over.

671
00:53:59,792 --> 00:54:01,560
So I can be relieved

672
00:54:01,672 --> 00:54:03,296
and don't worry about anything here.

673
00:54:04,552 --> 00:54:05,990
What do you mean?

674
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:10,990
I promised Jiu

675
00:54:11,344 --> 00:54:13,990
to live a quiet life with him.

676
00:54:26,864 --> 00:54:27,990
Tian.

677
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:31,088
You don't have to do that.

678
00:54:31,688 --> 00:54:33,312
Father.

679
00:54:34,184 --> 00:54:37,552
I caused the scandal in our family.

680
00:54:37,990 --> 00:54:40,504
We are currently restoring the business.

681
00:54:41,072 --> 00:54:44,264
If I stay here, it may cause you trouble.

682
00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:47,144
But I think...

683
00:54:47,144 --> 00:54:48,440
Father.

684
00:54:50,424 --> 00:54:52,264
Don't worry.

685
00:54:52,272 --> 00:54:54,064
I won't go far.

686
00:54:54,848 --> 00:54:57,352
I'll visit you often.

687
00:54:57,368 --> 00:54:59,360
Of if you miss me,

688
00:54:59,656 --> 00:55:01,656
you can visit me.

689
00:55:09,272 --> 00:55:11,256
I shouldn't stop you, right?

690
00:55:12,712 --> 00:55:14,672
I promise you already

691
00:55:18,672 --> 00:55:20,120
to let you live

692
00:55:21,624 --> 00:55:23,632
in the way that you want.

693
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:26,096
Have you finished translating the book? Let's play.

694
00:56:26,104 --> 00:56:27,072
Right.

695
00:56:27,072 --> 00:56:29,752
I want you to make me a paper bird.

696
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:31,990
Mei, Fu.

697
00:56:32,584 --> 00:56:35,144
Tian is working. Don't bother him.

698
00:56:36,664 --> 00:56:38,272
Here, eat this.

699
00:56:40,984 --> 00:56:43,424
Once it's done, I'll play with you.

700
00:56:43,456 --> 00:56:44,990
Go eat first.

701
00:56:57,816 --> 00:57:00,768
You've been translating books since morning.

702
00:57:00,776 --> 00:57:02,112
Do you want to eat first.

703
00:57:02,664 --> 00:57:04,344
I don't want to eat food.

704
00:57:04,592 --> 00:57:06,528
I want to finish translating the book first.

705
00:57:08,112 --> 00:57:10,392
If you don't want to eat food,

706
00:57:10,672 --> 00:57:12,336
how about sweets?

707
00:57:20,144 --> 00:57:22,224
Hey,

708
00:57:22,824 --> 00:57:24,990
the children are there too.

709
00:57:27,792 --> 00:57:29,552
So what's wrong with that?

710
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:41,104
I just want to give you this sugar cane.

711
00:57:50,184 --> 00:57:52,336
What do you think I'm going to do?

712
00:57:58,056 --> 00:58:00,064
No, I didn't.

713
00:58:01,208 --> 00:58:02,990
I really didn't think about anything.

714
00:58:04,368 --> 00:58:06,990
I don't talk to you anymore. I'll get back to work.

715
00:58:07,296 --> 00:58:09,320
I need to focus.

716
00:58:19,990 --> 00:58:21,152
Let me see.

717
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:24,824
I knew.

718
00:58:25,584 --> 00:58:27,416
I mumbled.

719
00:59:11,464 --> 00:59:12,840
What are you thinking?

720
00:59:13,888 --> 00:59:14,990
Nothing.

721
00:59:15,368 --> 00:59:18,216
Just watching birds,

722
00:59:18,328 --> 00:59:20,080
trees,

723
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:23,528
and the sky.

724
00:59:25,088 --> 00:59:26,832
In the past,

725
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:30,112
my life has a lot to think about.

726
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:34,080
To live life without thinking about anything

727
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:38,656
is happy too.

728
00:59:41,744 --> 00:59:43,064
So am I.

729
00:59:45,288 --> 00:59:47,536
I didn't think I'd meet you

730
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:50,624
and live together with you like this.

731
00:59:53,136 --> 00:59:54,264
For me,

732
00:59:55,504 --> 00:59:58,832
only you and my siblings makes me happy.

733
01:00:01,990 --> 01:00:03,872
But for me, it's not enough.

734
01:00:05,248 --> 01:00:06,672
What do you mean?

735
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:09,496
Do you remember?

736
01:00:12,784 --> 01:00:14,896
I told you that

737
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:19,328
someday, everything will be better.

738
01:00:21,112 --> 01:00:23,016
I dream that someday,

739
01:00:23,576 --> 01:00:27,088
we all have the right to love our loved ones,

740
01:00:27,176 --> 01:00:29,504
no matter what gender that person is.

741
01:00:31,296 --> 01:00:33,664
I dream that one day,

742
01:00:34,144 --> 01:00:37,624
all forms of love must be equal.

743
01:00:38,056 --> 01:00:39,990
They will be treated equally

744
01:00:40,152 --> 01:00:42,080
without hatred.

745
01:00:45,064 --> 01:00:46,904
Do you think what I said was nonsense?

746
01:00:48,990 --> 01:00:50,272
Not at all.

747
01:00:53,496 --> 01:00:55,136
Hopeful life

748
01:00:55,832 --> 01:00:57,496
is really good.

749
01:01:02,512 --> 01:01:06,368
I just hope that all your dreams in the future

750
01:01:07,088 --> 01:01:08,608
will have me in there.

751
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:22,296
Your speaking skill is better.

752
01:01:22,568 --> 01:01:23,990
Where did you learn it?

753
01:02:03,168 --> 01:02:05,816
Tian, someone came to see you.

754
01:02:19,776 --> 01:02:21,488
How can you come here?

755
01:02:46,008 --> 01:02:47,384
Tian.

756
01:02:47,544 --> 01:02:49,128
Eat more.

757
01:02:49,390 --> 01:02:51,600
I'll eat them all.

758
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:54,816
Everything is fine here, except that

759
01:02:54,824 --> 01:02:57,168
I miss your cooking.

760
01:02:58,496 --> 01:03:01,990
Then you must eat them all.

761
01:03:02,008 --> 01:03:02,990
Okay.

762
01:03:05,704 --> 01:03:06,832
Tian.

763
01:03:07,024 --> 01:03:09,064
I brought you a wedding invitation.

764
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:20,808
It's three weeks from now.

765
01:03:21,536 --> 01:03:22,816
Then...

766
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,190
I'll help you when it's closer.

767
01:03:27,232 --> 01:03:28,584
And...

768
01:03:28,952 --> 01:03:30,584
How are you, my sister-in-law?

769
01:03:31,392 --> 01:03:33,190
I'm excited.

770
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:35,472
But Yang is very helpful.

771
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:38,312
He behaves well lately, not getting on my nerves.

772
01:03:40,190 --> 01:03:42,128
Don't worry, Pin.

773
01:03:42,128 --> 01:03:45,272
If he doesn't behave well, tell me.

774
01:03:46,456 --> 01:03:49,736
Hey, why are you teaming up against me like this?

775
01:03:51,904 --> 01:03:53,976
Let's eat.

776
01:04:05,736 --> 01:04:06,848
Jiu.

777
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:20,656
The fish cheeks are the best.

778
01:04:27,190 --> 01:04:28,264
Thank you.

779
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:41,760
- Thanks, Chan
- Eat a lot.

780
01:04:47,728 --> 01:04:51,190
Now our business is beginning to come back.

781
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:54,496
Xiaotong is opening a new restaurant.

782
01:04:55,272 --> 01:04:56,736
Really?

783
01:04:57,104 --> 01:05:01,190
Then I have to congratulate her.

784
01:05:13,016 --> 01:05:15,456
Our home is much more peaceful.

785
01:05:16,224 --> 01:05:17,576
I miss Li.

786
01:05:19,376 --> 01:05:21,240
I want her to be with us.

787
01:05:24,190 --> 01:05:27,712
I think Mother must know it.

788
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:30,592
And now she might...

789
01:05:31,512 --> 01:05:34,456
protect everyone from the sky.

790
01:05:39,848 --> 01:05:41,072
Tian.

791
01:05:43,232 --> 01:05:45,320
Go back and help with our business.

792
01:05:46,616 --> 01:05:48,648
Take Jiu and the children with you.

793
01:05:50,792 --> 01:05:52,576
But Father...

794
01:05:53,536 --> 01:05:54,632
Tian.

795
01:05:55,832 --> 01:05:58,088
I'm not quite healthy.

796
01:05:59,728 --> 01:06:02,072
Yang also doesn't now how to do it yet.

797
01:06:03,952 --> 01:06:05,600
You are talented.

798
01:06:06,248 --> 01:06:08,752
You have experience in taking care of business

799
01:06:10,936 --> 01:06:13,190
Help me and your brother.

800
01:06:14,704 --> 01:06:17,256
Let's go back to become the leader of our family.

801
01:06:20,432 --> 01:06:22,190
I know

802
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:25,224
that you want to go home too.

803
01:06:26,392 --> 01:06:27,568
Father.

804
01:06:28,190 --> 01:06:29,656
If I go back,

805
01:06:29,672 --> 01:06:32,440
and would Aunt Chan...

806
01:06:33,648 --> 01:06:37,320
She told me to call you back.

807
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:41,632
About the inheritance of the position,

808
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:45,336
she didn't care about it anymore.

809
01:06:49,736 --> 01:06:51,190
But Father...

810
01:06:51,656 --> 01:06:53,600
I'm like this.

811
01:06:54,112 --> 01:06:56,190
I'm different.

812
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:00,744
I'm afraid if I go back to be the family leader,

813
01:07:01,728 --> 01:07:06,320
I will bring damage and shame to us.

814
01:07:07,416 --> 01:07:08,304
Tian.

815
01:07:09,190 --> 01:07:11,448
In the past, I used to think like this,

816
01:07:13,816 --> 01:07:16,190
causing Zhang to suffer

817
01:07:16,672 --> 01:07:18,408
until he had to commit suicide.

818
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:22,448
But now I understand,

819
01:07:25,408 --> 01:07:27,768
no matter who you love,

820
01:07:29,488 --> 01:07:32,190
it's a different thing from your talent.

821
01:07:35,190 --> 01:07:38,824
But I'm afraid other people won't understand me like you do.

822
01:07:40,768 --> 01:07:43,190
There are already people who don't understand this.

823
01:07:46,248 --> 01:07:48,672
But I want you to know that.

824
01:07:50,190 --> 01:07:51,190
I

825
01:07:51,944 --> 01:07:54,190
and our family members

826
01:07:55,304 --> 01:07:56,808
support you.

827
01:08:08,432 --> 01:08:10,384
Tian, come here quickly.

828
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:13,190
What's wrong?

829
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:22,190
Is it beautiful?

830
01:08:28,712 --> 01:08:32,190
When the rain stops, there's a rainbow in the sky.

831
01:08:32,216 --> 01:08:34,304
It's really beautiful.

832
01:08:37,864 --> 01:08:39,648
That's why they say

833
01:08:39,656 --> 01:08:42,190
the sky after the rain is always beautiful.

834
01:08:48,296 --> 01:08:50,272
I have made a decision.

835
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,190
I'm going back to help you.

836
01:08:58,464 --> 01:08:59,776
Good, Tian.

837
01:09:03,928 --> 01:09:05,190
That's good.

838
01:09:05,192 --> 01:09:07,072
So you can help teach Yang.

839
01:09:07,072 --> 01:09:09,190
So he'll be as good as you.

840
01:09:10,552 --> 01:09:13,688
Don't care what others say.

841
01:09:14,736 --> 01:09:16,190
Yes, Aunt Chan.

842
01:09:21,190 --> 01:09:24,960
No matter how good or bad things I encounter,

843
01:09:25,472 --> 01:09:27,520
or even if I have to encounter a rain storm,

844
01:09:28,464 --> 01:09:32,888
I believe that the sky will be bright again.

845
01:09:36,536 --> 01:09:39,480
I will do as I promised to Mother.

846
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:43,080
I will live happily

847
01:09:43,584 --> 01:09:45,496
and be proud of myself.

848
01:09:49,024 --> 01:09:50,808
No matter what decision you make,

849
01:09:51,336 --> 01:09:53,608
I will always support you, Tian.

850
01:10:00,776 --> 01:10:02,792
No matter what happens,

851
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:06,190
I will never give up.

852
01:10:08,688 --> 01:10:12,368
In the future, our world will definitely be better.

853
01:10:12,784 --> 01:10:14,608
It will keep getting better.
