1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Regarding Jiu, don't worry.

2
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,000
The poison of orchid will slowly get into the blood

3
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,000
Eventually he coughs up blood and dies. 

4
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,000
And where is he?

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,000
Jiu…Jiu is dead.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Even if I announce the marriage, 

7
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,000
he will know one day that you have poison that is used to kill people.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
what are you going to do?

9
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,000
Jia and I have already thought about how it should end.

10
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,000
I have a solution.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Tomorrow before the ceremony starts, we have to stop Mr. Ma.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Kill him before he arrives.

13
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,000
Mr. Ma has absolutely no way of exposing Mr. Tian.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Li. 

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I love you, Tian.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Everything must end today.

17
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Before paying respect, fill up with the tea.

18
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Wait.

19
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Do you see Nuan?

20
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,000
I see her walking towards the back of the house, Sir.

21
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,000
Thanks. 

22
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
What is Mr. Tian doing? Sneak up like that. 

23
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
What did he hide?

24
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
What? You said Tian hid something?

25
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,000
I don't know what he is hiding. But it's suspicious.

26
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
It must be something really important.

27
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Good, take me there quickly. 

28
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,000
Yes, Madam. 

29
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Let's go, Jia, or we won't be in time.

30
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Oh, Sir.

31
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Where have you been?

32
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
We...

33
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I feel better now.

34
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
So I go out for some fresh air.

35
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
What about the blood on your head?

36
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Why do you have a wound?

37
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I'm not careful enough,

38
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
so I walked into the door and hit my head. 

39
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
You were stupid enough to walked into the door?

40
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You think I'm so stupid that I will believe your lie?

41
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Tell me now. 

42
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Where have you been?

43
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Are you going to tell me?

44
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
The blood on your head.

45
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Is it your blood or whose blood?

46
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Sir. 

47
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
If you want to hurt anyone, 

48
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
do it to me.

49
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
What evil stuff have you done again, Li?

50
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:36,620
For you, 
 

51
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:39,748
it might be evil stuff. 

52
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
But for me, 

53
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
it's what a mother has to do.

54
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Father, what is this about?

55
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Father.

56
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
If you have something, 

57
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
put it aside first.

58
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Let's get through today. 

59
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I beg you. 

60
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
It's almost the time. 

61
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I think we better go.

62
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Please, Father.

63
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Where is the thing Tian hiding?

64
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I don't know.

65
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
What? Why don't you wait to see until he finished hiding?

66
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I was in a hurry to tell you.

67
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,000
Bitch. 

68
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Help find it. 

69
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,000
Yes, Madam. 

70
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Father, let's go.

71
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,000
The ceremony is starting soon. 

72
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Have you found it?

73
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,000
No, Madam. 

74
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,000
Find it. 

75
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Perhaps this thing will help turn the tide.

76
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,000
Alright, Madam. 

77
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Big Brother.

78
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,000
Chun, Tong. 

79
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Big brother, are you okay?

80
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,000
It seems like you aren't feeling well?

81
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
It's nothing. Mr. Song must be tired.

82
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Should we start the ceremony now?

83
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
How can we start?

84
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Ma and Chan are not here yet.

85
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,000
But if we wait, it won't be an auspicious time.

86
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,000
Right, Big Brother. 

87
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,000
I think we don't need to wait for Ma.

88
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
He never follows the rules and never be on time. 

89
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,000
If he doesn't see the importance of other people's time, 

90
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
why do we need to wait for someone like this?

91
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I agree with this.

92
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
So Ma will know that we are not satisfied with him either.

93
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Did you find it?

94
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
No, Madam. 

95
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
For today's meeting, 

96
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I have something important to let everyone know.

97
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Tian.

98
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I want to announce that 

99
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I will arrange a wedding for Tian and Mud,

100
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
and pass the leader title of the Five Dragons Association to him

101
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,000
in the next three days.

102
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Would anyone oppose?

103
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Why are you in such a hurry, Big Brother?

104
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Hasn't Tian recently broken off the engagement with Lady Pin?

105
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Oh, Chun.

106
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Young people always like this.

107
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Impatient.

108
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Lovers can't wait, of course.

109
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I think it's good.

110
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,000
After Tian gets married,

111
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,000
you gives the leader title of the Five Dragons Association to him.

112
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
So Tian can help you take care of your works.

113
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Your health isn't quite good lately, is it?

114
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Then I won't oppose this.

115
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I think Tian is the most suitable one

116
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
to inherit the position from you.

117
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
He is diligent and kind to the workers.

118
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
From now on, I'll have to call you Mr. Tian as well. 

119
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Madam, I found it.

120
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Come on, let me see it. 

121
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
This is…

122
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
If no one opposes, 

123
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I will arrange a wedding for Tian and Mud,

124
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
as well as passing the leader title of the Five Dragons Association to him

125
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
in the next three days.

126
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,000
No, you can't. 

127
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Mom. 

128
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Tian didn't deserve to be the head of the Five Dragons Association. 

129
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Can you stop causing trouble?

130
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,000
What are you talking about?

131
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Right, Chan. 

132
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Why are you making a mess?

133
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Take her out now. 

134
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Stop, No. Go away.

135
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Nuan. 

136
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Tell them what you saw.

137
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I saw Mr. Tian sneaking to hide something as if he has a secret.

138
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,000
When I followed him, I found this, Sir.

139
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Sleeping powder. 

140
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
What did he hide?

141
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
What is that letter?

142
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,000
Nuan, give it to me.

143
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Give it to me. / No, Mr. Yang.

144
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,000
Mom. 

145
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,000
Let me go. / Mr. Yang.

146
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,000
Mom. 

147
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:26,000
This letter was written by Jiu to Tian

148
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
making an appointment to run away with each other. 

149
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
It clearly stated that they were lovers.

150
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Nuan, let me go! / Mr. Yang.

151
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Please come to meet me tomorrow. 

152
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:46,000
I'll tell you everything

153
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,000
and let's run away together. 

154
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I love you, Tian. 

155
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Chan. 

156
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
What the hell are you talking about?

157
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
What is this, Tian?

158
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Tian is a homosexual like Mr. Zhang.

159
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
How are you going to judge?

160
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
In the past, Mr. Zhang was exposed that he was a homosexual.

161
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
You had expelled him from the association until he committed suicide.

162
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
How about this time?

163
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Are you going to let it go like this?

164
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Are you letting Tian become the head of the association?

165
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,000
Shut up, Chan. 

166
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:43,000
You made up the story because you wanted to steal the position for Yang.

167
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
No one would believe the lie that you said.

168
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
What would you say?

169
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Tell me that it's not true.

170
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,000
What Chan said was not true, say it. 

171
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Tian, Tian. 

172
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,100
Tell me. 

173
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
That the whole thing isn't true.

174
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
It's all a misunderstanding.

175
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Tell everyone.

176
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I'm sorry, father.

177
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
What Aunt Chan said is true. 

178
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I like men. 

179
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Tian.

180
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,000
It's the truth that I've been hiding all along.

181
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Tian, stop. 

182
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:12,700
Yang.

183
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
In the past, I lived in fear.

184
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I'm embarrassed.

185
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
It's like I have to lie to everyone all the time.

186
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
But when I said it out,

187
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I've never been at ease like this before, Yang. 

188
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Tian.

189
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,000
Bua,

190
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
don't be sad.

191
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Don't pity me.

192
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I don't need sympathy
or understanding from everyone.

193
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I just want to be myself.

194
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I want to live my life the way I choose

195
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
in which everyone respects me.

196
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Not too much.

197
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Not too less. 

198
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Just as much as a person deserves.

199
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
All these years, 

200
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I've always tried to hide the fact that I like men.

201
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
But Aunt Chan found this letter in the end. 

202
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Previously, 

203
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Our worker, Dong, knew this secret.

204
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
So I had to kill him to cover this up. 

205
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
The tiny box that comes with the letter.

206
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Huh?

207
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
It's the poison I used to kill Dong.

208
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Does this box contain poison?

209
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Not true, Tian. What did you say?

210
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,000
Why are you lying? Huh?

211
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:17,000
Killing someone to keep secrets. You evil.

212
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,000
That's not true. I don't believe it. 

213
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,000
Someone like you can't kill people. That's not true.

214
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,000
Yes. 

215
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Tian definitely wouldn't do that, Father.

216
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
What is this?

217
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,000
This isn't true, right?

218
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Father.

219
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,000
Sir. 

220
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
What did you do?

221
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Tian. 

222
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
You ruined the honor of the Song family

223
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
that we have accumulated.

224
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
You're ruining our clan.

225
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Father.

226
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Father.

227
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I'm sorry

228
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
that I couldn't become the son that you and Mother expected me to be. 

229
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
But this child does the best job.

230
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Are you crazy?

231
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:47,000
What did you do? Did you realize it?

232
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Tell me now that it's not true. It's not true.

233
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Tian. 

234
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
What kind of duty are you doing?

235
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
You ungrateful child!

236
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
You ungrateful child!

237
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Sir. 

238
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,000
Father.

239
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,000
Big Brother.

240
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,000
Let go of me. 

241
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Father. 

242
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,000
Sir. 

243
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Sir. 

244
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
How is Mr. Song, doctor?

245
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
He's better now. 

246
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,000
I'll prescribe medicine

247
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
but you must be careful not to let anything stress him. 

248
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Thanks. 

249
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Why are you here?

250
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,000
Do you still dare to come in?

251
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
If you go inside, Mr. Song will be worse after seeing you.

252
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
A homosexual

253
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,000
and a killer. 

254
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:37,000
You shameless.

255
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Mom.

256
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Tian. 

257
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Why are you doing this?

258
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
What do you mean?

259
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
If you talk about Dong's death,

260
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
It's because he knew my secret, 

261
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
so I had to kill him.

262
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
I've told you everything.

263
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
You think I'll believe you?

264
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
You can lie to others, but not me.

265
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
I grew up with you.

266
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I know what are you like. 

267
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
You can't even kill an ant.

268
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
And that letter.

269
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
If you wanted to destroy that letter, why didn't you burn it?

270
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
You buried it and deliberately let Mom and Nuan see it, right?

271
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Yes. 

272
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
I want to end everything, Yang.

273
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
About my secret

274
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
and Dong's death.

275
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Someone must plead guilty. 

276
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
If I don’t admit it, 

277
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Mother must be punished.

278
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Yang.

279
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
I've made up my mind, Yang.

280
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Could you please

281
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
take care of Father and Mother for me, okay?

282
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Promise me. 

283
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Promise me, Yang. 

284
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Madam. 

285
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,000
Madam. 

286
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Yang.

287
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Can you leave us alone?

288
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
I want to talk to Mother.

289
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Please. 

290
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Tian. 

291
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Why do you do this?

292
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Everything is about to end.

293
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
I told you already that I would handle everything.

294
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
How are you going to handle it?

295
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
You would let me take up the position.

296
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Then after that, you would confess to Father.

297
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
and you would commit suicide, right?

298
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
As a mother, 

299
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
I'm willing to do anything for you. 

300
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
But I can't stand it, Mother.

301
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I couldn't see you dying for me. 

302
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Mother.

303
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
What I did is the best for everyone.

304
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
At least everyone is still alive.

305
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
And if you miss me, 

306
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
you can still visit me in the prison.

307
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
What do you mean?

308
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Tian. 

309
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Tian. 

310
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
We come to take Mr. Tian to the police station.

311
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
No, you can't arrest my son.

312
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
He did nothing wrong.

313
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Tian, Tian. 

314
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,000
Tian. / Mother.

315
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:13,000
Listen to me. 

316
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Previously, I had already given evidence to the police.

317
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
And today, 

318
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,000
I want to surrender.

319
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
No, no. 

320
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
No, you can't take my son.

321
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,000
Tian. 

322
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Mother

323
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,000
Please listen to me.

324
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Please don't do this.

325
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Don't make everything I sacrifice 

326
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,000
all in vain.

327
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Tian. 

328
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Take me. 

329
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,000
No, no. 

330
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:55,000
No, you can't take my son.

331
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,000
Please take me. 

332
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,000
Take him. / Tian!

333
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,000
Tian! Tian!

334
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,100
Don't. No!

335
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
No. Let him go. 

336
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
No! No!

337
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
No, let go of my son. 

338
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,000
Please let him go, Madam. 

339
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,000
Let go of him. 

340
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,100
Let go of my son. 

341
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
He did nothing wrong.

342
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Let go of him. 

343
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
It was my fault. Take me.

344
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Why do you arrest my son? He did nothing wrong.

345
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,000
Let him go. 

346
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
I was at fault. I was wrong. 

347
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:27,999
Take me. Take me. I was at fault. 

348
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,000
My son did nothing wrong.

349
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Why did you take him? He's done nothing wrong. Let him go.

350
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Let him go. 

351
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Tian! Tian!

352
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Tian!

353
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:42,999
Tian!

354
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,000
Tian!

355
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Tian!

356
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Tian!

357
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Tian!

358
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Tian.

359
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
It's my fault. 

360
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Mr. Tian confessed that he killed Dong.

361
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,000
How long will he be imprisoned?

362
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,000
Will he be executed?

363
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,000
I don't know.

364
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
But they probably can't just find a way to help him out and act as if nothing happened.

365
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
He is a homosexual and a murderer.

366
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Ma must use this excuse to steal the leader title of the association for sure.

367
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
And he has the right to do so as well.

368
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
The situation has changed now. What are you going to do?

369
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Madam. 

370
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
What?

371
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
The box of beetle orchid that Mr. Tian hid along with the letter.

372
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
At first, I thought that he knew about our orchid, 

373
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
so he made fake evidence to plead guilty.

374
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
But it really has beetle orchid inside.

375
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Where did Tian get the beetle orchid from?

376
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Mr. Tian was arrested by the police.

377
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:27,000
I felt sorry for him.

378
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Why would you pity him?

379
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,000
This is a consequence from what he did. 

380
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
What should we do next?

381
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
We need to strike while the iron is hot.

382
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Madam, Madam. 

383
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Sir. 

384
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Your tea, Sir. 

385
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Why

386
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
does Tian's life has to go through something like this?

387
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
It's probably because of karma

388
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
that I did to Zhang.

389
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
He cursed me

390
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
to know his suffering

391
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
like he faced in the past. 

392
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
What will you do next?

393
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Sir, shall I call Bao for you. 

394
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:06,000
So you can discuss how to help Tian.

395
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Or shall we let Bao follow to watch Mr. Tian at the police station?

396
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
No, no. 

397
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Don't do anything.

398
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Why, sir?

399
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Do you really believe that Tian killed Dong?

400
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:21,800
No. 

401
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
I don't believe it. 

402
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
I did not believe that someone like Tian could kill anyone.

403
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
But...

404
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
But why?

405
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,000
But you're angry with him that he likes men, right?

406
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Can this matter erase his goodness,

407
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:49,000
and your father and son relationship?

408
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:50,000
Sir. 

409
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Please. Please help Tian, Sir.

410
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Now the authorities are interfering with this issue. 

411
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
We have to think carefully before taking action.

412
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
If there is a mistake, 

413
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
it can destroy many things.

414
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Sir, at that time, 

415
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
there was a tragedy of Mr. Zhang once. 

416
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,000
This time, don't let things like that happen again with Tian.

417
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Please, Sir. 

418
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Please help Tian. Please.

419
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
I beg you. 

420
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
You need to help him. 

421
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Bua. 

422
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
You need to help him. I beg you. 

423
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,000
Sir. 

424
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Regarding the head title of the Five Dragons Association, 

425
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
you must give it to my son, Yang. 

426
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
What would you say, Sir?

427
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Mom, what happened?

428
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Yang, take your mother out now.

429
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,000
No. 

430
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Unless you gives this position to my son.

431
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:13,000
But it's not the time to talk about it now, Mom.

432
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,000
I'm doing it for you.

433
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,000
Let's go

434
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Or...

435
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,000
You still haven't pass the title to him because you want to buy the time to help Tian.

436
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
He only does shameful things.

437
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
He's a homosexual and a murderer.

438
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Are you still helping him to get this position?

439
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Madam, please.

440
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:45,000
Can't you see that Mr. Song is sick? Please stop. 

441
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Do you dare to give me that attitude?

442
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,000
Enough!

443
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Madam, 

444
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
The sleeping powder is gone.

445
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Tian may switch this thing with orchid dust. 

446
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Then Mr. Ma now …

447
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Let's go.

448
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Move back. 

449
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
What is this?

450
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Mr. Ma.

451
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Give him to me.

452
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
I'll deal with him and his parents.

453
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
I can't follow your order. 

454
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Don't panic.

455
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Soon you're also going to die.

456
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Look at me. 

457
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Your mom was the one who did this to me. 

458
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:52,000
You and your family needs to pay.

459
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Split up.

460
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,000
Don't let anyone escape.

461
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
The rest follow me. 

462
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Come here.

463
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Go! Get up.

464
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:14,000
Come here.

465
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
You and your family must pay.

466
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
What should we do, Madam?

467
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
We better run away from here.

468
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Come here.

469
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Mr. Tian.

470
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Song!

471
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Song!

472
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Song!

473
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Song!

474
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Go! 

475
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Mr. Tian.

476
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
You're finally here.

477
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Ma. 

478
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
What are you doing?

479
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Let go of Tian now. 

480
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Mr. Ma isn't dead yet.

481
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:32,800
He caught Mr. Tian.

482
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
I'm going to help him. 

483
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:35,000
Calm down. 

484
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,000
If we show up now, Tian will be in danger. 

485
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Ma. 

486
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
What the hell are you doing?

487
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Why do you come here with these Japanese soldiers?

488
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Are you working with them now?

489
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
You know what they did in mainland. 

490
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Chun, Chun. 

491
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Chun, Chun. 

492
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Ma!

493
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Why did you shoot him?

494
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:08,000
If you don't want to die like him, drop the weapon

495
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:09,000
and get down on your knees.

496
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Quickly. 

497
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Ma.

498
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
How can you do this?

499
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
How can you kill your brothers?

500
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Brothers?

501
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Do you still dare to use this word?

502
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
This word 

503
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
is worth nothing

504
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
since you sent Li, your wife, to kill me. 

505
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Look at me. 

506
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
I lost my fingers, my eye.

507
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
I barely survived.

508
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
This is it?

509
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Did brothers do this to each other?

510
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Where are Li and her servant?

511
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Where are they?

512
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
You won't tell me?

513
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
I'll kill all of you.

514
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Then I'll kill them later. Kill them.

515
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
There are a lot of soldiers. 

516
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
We can't find a way to fight them.

517
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Hey!

518
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,000
Sir, Sir. 

519
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:58,000
Mom, Mom. 

520
00:48:58,200 --> 00:48:59,000
Please take it easy. Please. 

521
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:02,000
Let's discuss calmly. 

522
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Calmly?

523
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Mom!

524
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Mom!

525
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Ma.

526
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Yang!

527
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Yang!

528
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Get this. / Mr. Song.

529
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Yang, baby. 

530
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:35,000
Stop. Yang. / Let go of me!

531
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,000
Yang.

532
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Mom!

533
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:38,000
Yang! Don't hurt him. 

534
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:39,000
Yang.

535
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:40,000
Yang.

536
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Ma!

537
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Yang.

538
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Are you angry that I slapped your wife?

539
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
But in fact, 

540
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
you should be grateful

541
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,000
if you know what she has done to you

542
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:03,000
and your family.

543
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,000
She's the one who has sent news 

544
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:24,000
and reported everything about the Song family to me.

545
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Not true. 

546
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
That's not true. That's not true. 

547
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:31,000
That's not true. 

548
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
That's not true. 

549
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Sir, please. Don't do it. 

550
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:41,000
Sir, Sir. 

551
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:42,000
Please don't. 

552
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Mom!

553
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Stop!

554
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
If it wasn't true,

555
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,000
how would I know about Dong's death and bring the police to the temple?

556
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
And another thing, 

557
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:11,000
she was the one who informed me where Tian went to.

558
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:14,000
That's why I was able to let my subordinates follow to kill him.

559
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
But when I didn't succeed, 

560
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,000
she went to search for Tian's secret to tell me. 

561
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Really?

562
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
I'm sorry, Sir. 

563
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,000
I'm so sorry. 

564
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Why did you do this?

565
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
I don't think

566
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,000
the situation will get out of hand like this. 

567
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
I just want my child

568
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:33,000
to be loved and receive attention like Tian.

569
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
I don't think

570
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
that what I have done

571
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,000
will bring disaster to everyone in the Song family.

572
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,000
I was wrong, I'm really sorry.

573
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
I'm sorry

574
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,000
that I caused troubles to everyone, Sir.

575
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
I'm greedy.

576
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,000
I want my son to own everything.

577
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
I want him to have power.

578
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
I didn't think it through. 

579
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
I'm such a stupid mother. 

580
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
I'm sorry, my baby. 

581
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Let go of me!

582
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
I know that.

583
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Don't apologize. 

584
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
I know you did everything for me. 

585
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Sir. 

586
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Mr. Ma. 

587
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Don't hurt my son. Don't hurt him, please. 

588
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:43,000
If you want to do, hurt me instead. 

589
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:44,000
You can kill me. 

590
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
You can kill me. 

591
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Let my son go, please. 

592
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Let my son go, please. 

593
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Let go of him. 

594
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:53,000
Please, Sir. 

595
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Let go of him. 

596
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
No.

597
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Don't do it. 

598
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
I beg you. 

599
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Alright. 

600
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:09,000
Please stop. 

601
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
No!

602
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:14,000
No!

603
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:15,000
Mom!

604
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
No!

605
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Don't hurt my mother!

606
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Yang!

607
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Ma!

608
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Yang!

609
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Yang!

610
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Stop! Stop! 

611
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Stop it!

612
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Stop, Ma.

613
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Ma.

614
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Ma!

615
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Ma!

616
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:37,000
I'm here.

617
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Look at me. 

618
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Look at me. 

619
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,000
You want to take revenge? Attack me. 

620
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Don't hurt others. 

621
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
I'm here. Go on. 

622
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
It's not everyone's fault.

623
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,000
The situation comes to this

624
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
because of me alone. 

625
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
I didn't take good care of them.

626
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,000
I didn't care about them.

627
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
The love I have for them is not good enough.

628
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
That's why they're doing this. 

629
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:25,000
If I love and care enough, 

630
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
they wouldn't do this.

631
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Chan. 

632
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Yang.

633
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
I'm sorry.

634
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Chan. 

635
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,000
I'm sorry.

636
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
That's not true, Sir. 

637
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
You didn't do anything wrong.

638
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,000
I'm the one who did it.

639
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
I'm the one who did it, Sir. 

640
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:11,000
I'm the one who did it.

641
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:13,000
That's not true.

642
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:25,000
The wind is blowing directly towards Mr. Ma and the Japanese soldiers,

643
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
but it may be hit Mr. Tian and Mr. Song too. 

644
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,000
The touching moment is over. 

645
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:34,000
Father.

646
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
It's time for you to make amends

647
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
for what you did to me. 

648
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,000
I will kill your whole family.

649
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,000
I will kill you all. 

650
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Which one should I kill first?

651
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,000
No, Ma. 

652
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Kill me only. 

653
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:01,000
Kill me only. 

654
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:02,000
Go ahead!

655
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,000
This bitch. 

656
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,000
No. 

657
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Ma, don't. 

658
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
You!

659
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Or you!

660
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,000
All of you must die.

661
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Except Tian.

662
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,000
I'll keep him

663
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,000
until I find Li. 

664
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Then I will kill him in front of his mother.

665
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Chan. 

666
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Madam. 

667
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Everyone, down!

668
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Let's go, Madam. 

669
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Hey!

670
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Let's go. Let’s get out of here quickly.

671
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:41,000
Madam. / Madam Chan. 

672
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:41,800
Let's go. 

673
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:42,300
Mom.

674
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:43,000
Sir. / Let's go, Tian.

675
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:44,000
Let's go. 

676
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:45,000
Hurry up. 

677
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
How are you, Madam?

678
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Are you alright?

679
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:55,000
Sir. 

680
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:56,000
Are you okay, Tian?

681
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Come in quicky!

682
01:01:58,200 --> 01:01:59,000
Tian, Yang. 

683
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Nuan!

684
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Nuan!

685
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Nuan. / Let's go now. We don't have time.

686
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Mom! We don't have time. 

687
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Bua, get out. 

688
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Go.

689
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Li, Yang, take everyone out to the back. Hurry.

690
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Okay, go. 

691
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:35,000
Sir. 

692
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Let's go. Tian. 

693
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:40,000
Quickly. 

694
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Father.

695
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Where are you going, Big Brother?

696
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,000
Ma. 

697
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Mr. Yang. / Yang. 

698
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Yang. 

699
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Jia. 

700
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,000
This way. 

701
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:33,000
Are you alright, Jia?

702
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Chan. 

703
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Are you okay?

704
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,000
Get up. 

705
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Madam, 

706
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Mr. Tian and Mr. Song haven't followed us yet. 

707
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Yang, take your mother and get out of here. 

708
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:07,000
I will help them out.

709
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:08,000
Go.

710
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Jia, let's go. 

711
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,000
Madam, be careful.

712
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Yang, let's go.

713
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,000
These people died from poisoning.

714
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,000
If I didn't escape in time, 

715
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,000
my life would have ended like this. 

716
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,000
Don't hurt Mr. Tian. 

717
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Your mother is really evil. 

718
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Where is she now?

719
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,000
You won't tell me?

720
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,000
You won't tell me where she is?

721
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Tian, Tian. 

722
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Tian, Tian. 

723
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,000
Li. 

724
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
You are poisoned by beetle orchid. 

725
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
If you don't get the antidote, you'll die.

726
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
This is the antidote.

727
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
If you don't want to die,

728
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:04,000
free Mr. Song and Mr. Tian.

729
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Why do I have to do that?

730
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,000
When the antidote is in your hand, 

731
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:20,000
I just have to kill you and take it.

732
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,000
Catch her. 

733
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Alright. 

734
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,000
Jiu. 

735
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Jiu. 

736
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,000
You're not dead yet?

737
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Arrest him. 

738
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Mother.

739
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:19,000
Li, be careful!

740
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Li!

741
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Get up. 

742
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Jiu. 

743
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,000
Let go of me. 

744
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Are you okay?

745
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,000
I'm fine. 

746
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:10,000
Please take care of Mr. Song and Mr. Tian, Madam.

747
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,000
Sir. 

748
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Tian. 

749
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,000
You're still alive. 

750
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
I'm here to help you. You'll be alright. 

751
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,000
They are over there. 

752
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Madam, they are here. 

753
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:01,000
We better run away.

754
01:09:01,300 --> 01:09:03,000
Mr. Ma needs an antidote anyway. 

755
01:09:03,300 --> 01:09:06,000
He wouldn't dare to do anything to Mr. Song and Mr. Tian.

756
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:07,000
Right.

757
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:10,000
Li, get out of here. Don't worry about me.

758
01:09:10,300 --> 01:09:11,000
Not, Sir. Just a little bit more.

759
01:09:11,300 --> 01:09:13,000
Jiu, take Mother and Aunt Jia out of here. 

760
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,000
Tian, but...

761
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Please take care of Mother and Aunt Jia for me. 

762
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,000
Go. 

763
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Don't worry, Tian.

764
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,000
I'll come back to help you.

765
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,000
Madam, let's go. 

766
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:46,600
Sir. 

767
01:09:46,700 --> 01:09:48,000
Go. Li. Hurry!

768
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:49,000
Sir. / Hurry, Madam. 

769
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:49,800
Let's go, Madam. / Run!

770
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,000
Jia, take Madam Li. 

771
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:52,000
Yes, Sir. 

772
01:09:52,300 --> 01:09:53,000
Don't worry.

773
01:09:53,300 --> 01:09:55,000
He doesn't dare to hurt me. Go!

774
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:50,000
Mr. Ma was poisoned by the beetle orchid and is still waiting for the antidote from me. 

775
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:53,000
And do you really have an antidote?

776
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:08,000
If I could be the son that you and Mother hoped for, 

777
01:11:08,300 --> 01:11:10,000
everything wouldn't be like this, right?

778
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:12,000
Li will exchange the antidote for the hostages.

779
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:16,000
Wait and see the end of those who dared to be enemies against me.
