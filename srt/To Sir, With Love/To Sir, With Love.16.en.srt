1
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I like men. 

2
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,000
It's the truth that I've been hiding all along.

3
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,000
Our worker, Dong, knew this secret.

4
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,000
So I had to kill him to cover this up. 

5
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,000
Not true, Tian. Why are you lying?

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Tian. 

7
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,000
Look at me. 

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Your mom was the one who did this to me. 

9
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,000
You and your family needs to pay.

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,000
Chan, are you okay?

11
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:38,000
Madam, Mr. Tian and Mr. Song haven't followed us yet. 

12
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,000
Yang, take your mother and get out of here. 

13
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,000
I will help them out.

14
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,000
You are poisoned by beetle orchid. 

15
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:46,000
If you don't get the antidote, you'll die.

16
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,000
This is the antidote.

17
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,000
Catch her. 

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Jiu. 

19
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:54,000
Jiu. 

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You're still alive. 

21
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,000
Take Mother and Aunt Jia out of here. 

22
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:02,000
But…

23
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,000
Please take care of Mother and Aunt Jia for me. 

24
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,000
I'll come back to help you.

25
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,000
Madam, let's go. 

26
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,000
Sir. 

27
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,000
Go. Li. Hurry!

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Sir. / Hurry, Madam. 

29
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,000
Take Madam Li. / Let's go. 

30
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,000
Don't worry. He doesn't dare to hurt me. Go!

31
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Why didn't Madam Li come after us yet?

32
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Right. 

33
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'll take you two to find a place to hide first

34
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
and will find a way back to help the rest. Let's go. 

35
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,000
Okay. / Let's go.

36
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,000
Wait.

37
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Madam. 

38
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Madam. 

39
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Jiu. 

40
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Don't say anything yet. The Japanese soldiers are following us. 

41
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,000
Let's hurry and get out of here.

42
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Follow me.

43
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Father, please hang in there.

44
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Sir, please call the doctor for Father.

45
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Do you think that I'm that kind?

46
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,000
Huh?

47
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Tian, don't beg from someone like him.

48
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
If you don't want to die, give me the antidote.

49
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
W don't have one. 

50
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
If you want it, 

51
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
you'll have to wait for Madam Li and Jia to contact you.

52
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And don't even think about harming us.

53
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Otherwise, you will not get the antidote

54
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,000
and will die as well.

55
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Do you threaten me?

56
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,000
Father, no. 

57
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Shut up. 

58
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Lock them up.

59
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Sir. 

60
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Father

61
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Are you okay?

62
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,000
How are you doing, Madam?

63
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,000
Hang in there. 

64
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Jia. 

65
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,000
Hurry up, Madam.

66
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
The more he moves, the closer he is to death.

67
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
The poison of orchid will slowly get into the blood

68
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
and suck his blood. 

69
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
The one who is exposed to it will begin to suffocate.

70
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Eventually he coughs up blood and dies. 

71
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Jiu. 

72
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Why do you bring me here?

73
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
To see the doctor.

74
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Doctor Qi.

75
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You're not dead yet. 

76
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
What happened?

77
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Why are you still…

78
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Alive?

79
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,000
And you stay here with Jiu?

80
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I have saved him from the poison of the beetle orchid. 

81
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Before I returned to the Song Family, 

82
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I had successfully prepared an antidote against the poison of beetle orchid. 

83
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I brought it back with me. 

84
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
So I could survive

85
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
from the poison of beetle orchid you used to attack me.

86
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Thank heavens for that. 

87
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Mom. 

88
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Take the injured to the basement of the house quickly. 

89
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,000
Let's g. Go. 

90
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,000
Mom, hang in there. 

91
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Jia. 

92
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Jia. 

93
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,000
Jia. 

94
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Jia. 

95
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,000
Jia. 

96
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Jia. 

97
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Hey, you also got the poison of beetle orchid?

98
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,000
Jia. 

99
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Jia. 

100
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Is Fu also with Lady Pin now?

101
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Thank you very much for saving my brother. 

102
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I'll find a way to let Pin know

103
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
that you are still alive.

104
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,000
Mei and Fu must be happy.

105
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Besides, 

106
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Pin may find a way to investigate the situation for us.

107
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,000
So we can get in to help Father and Tian.

108
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Don't worry about Tian. 

109
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I have to help him out anyway. 

110
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
He is valuable and very important to me.

111
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I don't want to lose him again.

112
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
We went to find firewood to boil the herbal soup for Jia.

113
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Madam, let me do it.

114
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,000
It's okay, I can't just stand still.

115
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Let's help each other.

116
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,000
If we hurry up and give Jia and Chan treatment, 

117
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
we can go back to help Mr. Song and Tian soon. 

118
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
This mess…

119
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
It happened because of me. 

120
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Bua. 

121
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
You know that Tian didn't do it, right?

122
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Tian wasn't a murderer. 

123
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,000
I know that, Madam. 

124
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I have raised Mr. Tian since he was a child.

125
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I was the one who did it. 

126
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I didn't think the situation would get out of hand like this. 

127
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I just want to hide

128
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
that Tian is a homosexual.

129
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Madam. 

130
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Mr. Tian is a homosexual.

131
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
He can't change no matter what. 

132
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Even if you kills someone or tries to find a solution, 

133
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
he is still a homosexual.

134
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I know

135
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
that I can't change him. 

136
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
But he is my son.

137
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Whether he's gay or becomes a commoner, I still love him.

138
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
But others…

139
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Other people don't love my son like I do.

140
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I'm afraid that

141
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Others would use this to harm Tian if they know about it.

142
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I'm just a mother who wants to protect the child.

143
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Madam.

144
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I understand your feeling. 

145
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
A mother has to do everything

146
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
to protect her own child.

147
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
But from what happened today,

148
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Mr. Tian bravely pleaded guilty on behalf of you

149
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
and didn't run away from problems.

150
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
You must have seen it, right?

151
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Mr. Tian is much stronger than we thought.

152
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Madam.

153
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I beg you, Madam. 

154
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
If this ends and we survive, 

155
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,000
I would like to ask you to give him a chance.

156
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Let him live his life as he wants.

157
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Madam.

158
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Mr. Tian has grown up so much.

159
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
You don't have anything to worry now.

160
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Jia.

161
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Jia.

162
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:25,000
You know it right? You were directly exposed to the poison through your wound.

163
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
And now,

164
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
its poison penetrated and dispersed

165
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:34,000
in your body so fast that…

166
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,000
my resurrection powder can't resist it.

167
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I'm your best student. 

168
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I know since I got poisoned

169
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
that I won't survive.

170
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Doctor. 

171
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
It's great

172
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
that you're still alive. 

173
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Don't say anything now, Jia.

174
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,000
The more you talk, the more tired you become.

175
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Before I die, 

176
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I can see you alive.

177
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
This is a merit of my life. 

178
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I feel guilty for a long time.

179
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I thought l was ungrateful 

180
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
that I took part in killing my benefactor.

181
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
From now on, 

182
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I can be at ease. 

183
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
At least…

184
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
At least the hell that I'm heading to

185
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
will not punish me too harsh. 

186
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Forget about that. 

187
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Stay strong.

188
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Jia! Hold up. 

189
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Jia.

190
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Jia.

191
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Jia! Jia!

192
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,000
Jia!

193
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Jia!

194
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Jia.

195
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Jia! Hang in there. 

196
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Jia! Hang in there. 

197
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,000
Jia.

198
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,000
Jia!

199
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,000
Jia!

200
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Doctor. 

201
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
She can't be saved?

202
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Madam.

203
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Jia.

204
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Jia.

205
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Jia.

206
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Madam.

207
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
This is my time. 

208
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Jia.

209
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Please be safe. 

210
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Madam.

211
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I've committed too many sins

212
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
If I am not here anymore, 

213
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
please take good care of yourself, Madam. 

214
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I promise.

215
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I will take good care of myself.

216
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Jia.

217
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Please apologize to Mr. Tian for me. 

218
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I'm sorry

219
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
that he had to plead on my behalf.

220
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I'm sorry.

221
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
You have to help Mr. Tian.

222
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Madam, go. Go.

223
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Jia.

224
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,000
Jia.

225
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Jia, Jia. 

226
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Jia, Jia. 

227
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Jia.

228
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Jia.

229
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,000
Jia.

230
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Jia.

231
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Jia.

232
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:53,000
Jia, Jia. 

233
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Jia.

234
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Doctor. 

235
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Have you found an antidote?

236
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
There are only strange medicines. 

237
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:44,000
We should let the owner check them, Sir.

238
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
That's too much, bastard. 

239
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Bao, no!

240
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Let go. 

241
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,000
Take him to isolation.

242
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Bao. 

243
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Let go of me. 

244
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Where is the antidote?

245
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I asked where the antidote is.

246
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Bastard. 

247
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,000
Even if I have one, I won't give it to you.

248
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
You killed our brother. 

249
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Your place is hell.

250
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,000
Killing brother?

251
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
If I killed Chun, 

252
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
you also killed Zhang.

253
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
You are more cruel than me. 

254
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Killing Zhang with your words

255
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
until he had to slit his throat.

256
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Then the karma came after your sone instead. 

257
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
He becomes a homosexual like Zhang.

258
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
So what did someone with vicious mind like you

259
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
do to end up like this?

260
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Bastard, you homosexual. 

261
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,000
You pansy. 

262
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
No, No. 

263
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,000
No! 

264
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,000
No! Ma!

265
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,000
Ma, stop!

266
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
You can insult me anyway you like. 

267
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
We are judged by our behavior after all. 

268
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
No matter what gender you are, 

269
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
but if your behavior is like this,

270
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
it is even lower than a beast.

271
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
You poof. 

272
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,000
No! 

273
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Ma, stop!

274
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Even if you kill us, 

275
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,000
I don't have an antidote for you. 

276
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I'm not going to kill you guys.

277
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I will keep you

278
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
in exchange for Li's antidote.

279
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Once I get the antidote, 

280
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,000
you'll die. 

281
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Remember it. 

282
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Father.

283
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Madam, how are you?

284
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,000
Are you hurt?

285
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Bua.

286
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Yes. 

287
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Let me hep.

288
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Slowly.

289
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Wait. 

290
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Thanks a lot. 

291
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,000
Yes. 

292
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Let her drink this.

293
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,000
Yes, Madam. 

294
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I'm not drinking this. 

295
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I don't know if it's poison.

296
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Then throw it away. 

297
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,000
Calm down, Madam. Madam Chan.

298
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
How can I calm down?

299
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
You also saw

300
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,000
that Madam has poison.

301
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
All that happened

302
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
is because Madam Li used poison to kill people.

303
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,000
The whole thing happened because of me?

304
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,000
And who told everything to Mr. Ma?

305
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Letting enemies into our house, seeking for chance to attack our family. 

306
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,000
But I've never killed anyone.

307
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I just want my Yang to become the head of the Five Dragons Association. 

308
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,000
I did it to protect my son as well.

309
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,000
You can't just blame me.

310
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,000
Don't say this. 

311
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,000
Please top. 

312
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Madam Li, Madam Chan. 

313
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
You two claim to do it for your children.

314
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
But have you ever asked them if they want it?

315
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:24,000
If their mothers had to hurt others for themselves like this?

316
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
The Five Dragons Association has now collapsed.

317
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I think we shouldn't have an argument. 

318
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
We should discuss with each other. 

319
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,000
What should we do?

320
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
How can we help Mr. Song and Mr. Tian? 

321
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
The association no longer exists.

322
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:58,000
The fortune, ranking, and power that I used to fight for.

323
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
It means nothing now. 

324
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
But at least.

325
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Yang is still here with you.

326
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
But my son Tian,

327
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
I don't know if he's still alive.

328
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Jiu. 

329
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,000
Mei, Fu.

330
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
How did you get here?

331
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Pin and Yang brought us here.

332
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Her congenital disease makes her weak.

333
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
She was also poisoned by opium for a long time

334
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
until her body can't handle it. 

335
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
So that means my sister…

336
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
We can still give her treatment.

337
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Doctor Qi will treat you. 

338
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
You'll be better now. 

339
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
But we can't leave her like this long.

340
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
It's really hard to find the herbs used for the treatment.

341
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,000
But I know someone who can find it.

342
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I need to travel to get the herbs by myself right now.

343
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Thank you so much, Doctor. 

344
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Pin overheard the market vendors saying that

345
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,000
only a few workers managed to escape.

346
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:26,000
The rest are locked up in the house with Father, Tian and Bao.

347
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
But no one dared to inform the authorities

348
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
because the Japanese soldiers get involved in this. 

349
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Oh, how is Mr. Song doing now?

350
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
But Mr. Ma was poisoned by the beetle orchid.

351
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
He must be waiting for the antidote from me. 

352
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,000
He wouldn't dare hurting them. 

353
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
And do you really have an antidote?

354
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
No.

355
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
At that time, Jia lied to make Mr. Ma

356
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
release Tian and Mr. Song.

357
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Then we can't use the same trick again.

358
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Because if he finds out, 

359
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,000
he will kill us for sure. 

360
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Don't worry about the antidote.

361
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I'm preparing it.

362
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Is this the resurrection powder that can be used as an antidote against the beetle orchid?

363
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Right. 

364
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:36,000
The beetle orchid is a poisonous mushroom produced in the human body. 

365
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
It slowly sucks the blood of those poisoned to death.

366
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
To detoxify it, 

367
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
we must use the herb that heats the blood

368
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
until the orchid dust can't grow

369
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
and finally dies. 

370
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
We need nine special herbs

371
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
with fire element. 

372
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Simmer it until thickened.

373
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Wait for it to precipitate

374
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
and become crystallized and turn into powder. 

375
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
But the longer we wait, 

376
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
the more Mr. Ma will suffer. 

377
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
And he might hurt Mr. Song and everyone.

378
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
How long will it take to finish, Doctor?

379
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Three more days.

380
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
But I can't stay and watch until it is finished.

381
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:38,000
Because I need to retrieve the herbs to make medicine for Jiu's sister.

382
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Madam Li, 

383
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Madam Chan, 

384
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,000
Bua, 

385
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
help get Mr. Song out.

386
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Congratulations, Ma. 

387
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Finally, you become the leader of the Five Dragons Association as you wish. 

388
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
You got such a sweet mouth.

389
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Are you afraid of dying like Chun?

390
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Oh, brother. 

391
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
You have proven yourself

392
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
that you are eligible to be a leader.

393
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Why would I stop you?

394
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Besides, I am a woman.

395
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
How can I fight against you?

396
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Listen carefully.

397
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
I can control even Big Brother.

398
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
So don't act like a snake that secretly bites me. 

399
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Or I won't let you live. 

400
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
All the businesses of Song and Chun families, 

401
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I'll take care of everything myself, 

402
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
including your teahouse too. 

403
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Big Brother is weird.

404
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Letting a woman like you take care of the business for a long time.

405
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,000
From now on, 

406
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
you just sit and relax. 

407
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Wait for the order from me.

408
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Thank you Ma

409
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
for sharing my burden. 

410
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Sir. 

411
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Someone attaches this note on the front door.

412
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Three more days, 

413
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
I will bring you the antidote

414
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
in exchange for Mr. Song, Tian and Bao.

415
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Don't harm everyone.

416
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Three more days, 

417
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Li will exchange the antidote for the hostages.

418
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
You gather all our force, 

419
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
including the soldiers lent by Captain Hiroshi.

420
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I will surround and ambush Li.

421
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Yes, Sir. 

422
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Prepare oil and gunpowder.

423
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
I will burn this place down.

424
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:23,000
You wait and see the end of those who dared to be enemies against me. 

425
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Father.

426
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Are you feeling better?

427
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
It's all gone. 

428
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Five Dragons Association.

429
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
It is ruined. 

430
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
I'm sorry.

431
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
I'm sorry, Father.
Come here quickly. Hurry up.

432
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Next time, you have to be careful when you walk and run.

433
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
So that you don't hurt yourself like this again.

434
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
If it hurts, just cry.

435
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
I don't dare to cry. I'm afraid you will scold me. 

436
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
If you dare to say this out, then you're not really afraid of me.

437
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Madam Li won't scold you. 

438
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:11,000
She is Tian's mother. She must be kind like him. 

439
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Do you know Tian too?

440
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
When he was with you, how was he like?

441
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Tian is kind. He likes to tell stories to me. 

442
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Take me to buy delicious snacks.

443
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
When I was sick, he also feed me medicine.

444
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Yes, Tian once told us that

445
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,000
if Mei was happy, then Fu would be happy, 

446
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,000
and Jiu and Tian would be happy as well.

447
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
You are afraid of losing power

448
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
and lose your leadership because of a son like me. 

449
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Mother. 

450
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
I just want to live happily.

451
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
You'll never be happy

452
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
as long as you are like this. 

453
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
When he was with me, 

454
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
there are only sorrow, 

455
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
fear and paranoia for him. 

456
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Perhaps

457
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,000
it might be me that made him unhappy.

458
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
These are blankets for everyone.

459
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
And this is food. 

460
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
I brought a lot. I'm afraid everyone will be hungry. 

461
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Thanks.

462
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
The antidote will be completed soon. 

463
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
We will take this medicine to help Father and Tian.

464
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
This job is very dangerous.

465
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
If anything happens to me, 

466
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
You...

467
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,000
I'll find new boyfriend for sure. 

468
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
What?

469
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
So you can't die. 

470
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Help Mr. Song and Tian and come back to me. 

471
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
I have talked to my father already. 

472
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Although we don't have a lot of money now, 

473
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:58,000
but we know someone who can help you escape from Mr. Ma.

474
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Thank you for being by my side.

475
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
When I was in trouble, 

476
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
you also stay here by my side. 

477
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,000
If we don't help each other during a hard time, when will we do it?

478
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
But my family almost has nothing left.

479
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
If I come back alive,

480
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
are you really going to marry a poor guy like me?

481
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
My family is poor as well.

482
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,000
The first time we met, I still had to sell fake vase.

483
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:41,000
So I think the two of us are well suited to each other.

484
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Just live a poor life together. 

485
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
What?

486
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
You let me hide at Lady Pin's palace?

487
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Yes, you're not feeling well yet. 

488
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:33,000
I'll bring the antidote to exchange for the hostages myself. 

489
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,000
No, I'll go with you too. 

490
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:35,000
Mom. 

491
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,000
Why are you going?

492
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,000
You'll be a burden to others.

493
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
I won't let you save Mr. Song and take credit alone.

494
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Madam, please be rational.

495
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Do you want to know my reason?

496
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:49,000
Fine. 

497
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Among us, 

498
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
I am the closest with Mr. Ma. 

499
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
I know how to persuade him. 

500
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
If I go, 

501
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,000
there'll be more chance to help Mr. Song and Tian. 

502
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Are you going to help Tian?

503
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Right. 

504
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Well, Madam Li saved you and me once.

505
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:28,000
I don't want to be indebted.

506
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,000
So we won't have to meet again in the next life.

507
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Besides, 

508
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
the Five Dragons Association no longer existed.

509
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
I have no reason to let Tian die.

510
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
If you're going, 

511
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
don't be a burden to others.

512
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
The medicine will finish soon. 

513
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
We can help Tian and Mr. Song.

514
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
I'll be right back, Captain.

515
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
I have investigated, Madam. 

516
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:01,000
The Japanese don't fully support Mr. Ma.

517
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
They just wanted to use him.

518
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
If they are in trouble, 

519
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
they'll definitely kick Mr. Ma out.

520
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Are you sure?

521
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Yes, Madam. 

522
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:15,000
The captain also told me that the Japanese soldiers are at odds with each other.

523
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:18,000
If the other party caught that the captain is messing with Thais, 

524
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:20,000
they won't let him go.

525
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Press it. 

526
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Tian's handkerchief.

527
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Jiu, take it easy.

528
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
I'm confident that we will be able to help Mr. Song and Tian out.

529
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
You'll surely meet Tian again.

530
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
You don't see that the love between me and Tian…

531
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
is disgusting?

532
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
It's not my duty to judge

533
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
what kind of love is disgusting, or not disgusting.

534
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
You too. 

535
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Don't let anyone judge you. 

536
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Don't tie your own happiness to other people's thoughts.

537
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
You know what?

538
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
I have raised Tian since he was little.

539
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
He is kind, 

540
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
and humble. 

541
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:14,000
He always cares about the feelings of those around him to make them happy.

542
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:18,000
No matter how miserable he was, he never complained.

543
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
I'm glad that

544
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
now, 

545
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
you've become his happiness.

546
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Madam. 

547
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Herbal tonic

548
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
to restore your strength to fight with Mr. Ma's gang. 

549
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Thank you, Madam. 

550
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Jiu. 

551
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Drink it.

552
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Madam Li has carefully boiled it for you. 

553
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Tian. 

554
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Tian. 

555
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Tian. 

556
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Jiu. 

557
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
How did get here?

558
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Tian, I'm coming to check the area so I can find a way to help you.

559
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Doctor Qi is cooking the antidote now.

560
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:02,000
We'll take that medicine to save you and Mr. Song. 

561
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
How are Mother and everyone?

562
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Everyone is safe.

563
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Except...

564
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Jia. 

565
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Jia?

566
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
And how are you, Tian?

567
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Did they hurt you this much?

568
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Hang in there.

569
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
I'll come back to help you.

570
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
We'll leave all the chaos behind

571
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
and live the life I promised you.

572
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:48,000
I'm fine, Jiu,

573
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
but you have to help my father.

574
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
He's seriously ill.

575
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
He's suffering 

576
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
because he's disappointed in me. 

577
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
I don't want anything to happen to him. 

578
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
please help my father.

579
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Please. 

580
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Don't worry.

581
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
You and your father must be safe.

582
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
I promise with my life.

583
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Jiu. 

584
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:04,000
Get out now. They'll see you.

585
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Be careful.

586
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:08,000
I'll be right back to save you. 

587
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
How was it? Have you met Father and Tian?

588
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
How are they?

589
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Are Tian and Father injured?

590
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Both of them are safe.

591
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Jia. 

592
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Tomorrow, I'm going to help Mr. Song and Tian. 

593
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
May your soul

594
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
bless us to succeed.

595
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
If I survive, 

596
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
I'll come back to arrange a grand funeral for you.

597
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Chan and I will negotiate with Mr. Ma, 

598
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:54,000
which he probably won't give up easily.

599
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
But I will try to buy the time as long as possible.

600
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Jiu said that Mr. Song and Tian are locked up in the wood shed at the back of the house.

601
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,000
There's a small exit blocked by the trees in that area. 

602
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:09,000
Mr. Ma probably didn't know about it. 

603
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,000
You and Jiu go in to help Mr. Song and Tian out and go through that way.

604
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:15,100
As for Pin, 

605
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
and Bua, 

606
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:18,000
wait outside.

607
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
When the two are rescued, 

608
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,000
everyone gets in Pin's car and flee as quickly as possible.

609
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
And what about you and Madam Li?

610
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
I still have beetle orchid left.

611
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
I'll use it to deal with Mr. Ma and quickly escape.

612
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Madam. 

613
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
What if it doesn't succeed?

614
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Just talk about later. 

615
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
It's settled then.

616
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:50,000
I'm afraid that Ma is also preparing a plan to welcome you, Madam. 

617
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
How did you get here?

618
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
And how do you know that we are here?

619
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Didn't Jiu spy at Song family's house this morning?

620
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Mud is my staff.

621
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
But it will be too long to tell the story now.

622
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Let's get to the point.

623
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,000
You can't go back to your home now.

624
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Why do we have to believe you?

625
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
From the beginning, 

626
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:32,000
you must have sent Mud to investigate the news, right?

627
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:34,000
How much did you sell the news from Song family?

628
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
The leaked information from the house, 

629
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,000
I think it came from you, Chan.

630
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
I come here today

631
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
because I know that Ma prepares to kill everyone

632
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,000
and burn down Song family's house.

633
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
How can we believe you?

634
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
How will all of us know that you isn't working with Mr. Ma?

635
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:57,000
If I cooperates with him, 

636
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,000
isn't it easier to let them kill you here?

637
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,000
I know that you guys don't trust me

638
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
and thought that I was a hypocrite.

639
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
But you know it well, don't you, Li?

640
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
In this world, 

641
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
it's always cruel to women like us.

642
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Especially for the widow whose husband died like me. 

643
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Staying in the Five Dragons Association

644
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
is not easy.

645
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
I am underestimated

646
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
and also the target to be taken advantage of. 

647
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Because I'm a single woman, 

648
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:50,000
I have to struggle in every way possible to maintain my business.

649
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Aren't you afraid

650
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,000
that Mr. Ma will find out that you sided with us?

651
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Of course. 

652
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
But I have to do.

653
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Allowing evil guy that killed his own brother like Ma to come to power

654
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
will make all of us suffer in the future.

655
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
I may not be a good woman, 

656
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:24,000
But I am not bad enough to support an evil man like Ma. 

657
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
If you don’t want us to go help Mr. Song, 

658
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:29,000
what should we do?

659
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
About that, 

660
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
leave it to me.

661
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Father, Father. 

662
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Father. 

663
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:00,000
Father. 

664
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Big brother. 

665
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Big brother. 

666
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:14,000
Big brother. 

667
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:18,000
Big brother. 

668
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Big brother. 

669
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:24,000
Zhang.

670
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Big Brother, please sit down. 

671
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Am I really dead?

672
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Drink it first.

673
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
This must be Meng Po soup

674
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,000
given to the ghost to wipe the memories, right?

675
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
What are you talking about?

676
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,000
This is the Keemun tea that you like.

677
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Zhang. 

678
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Since you were gone, 

679
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
everything was never the same.

680
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
The Five Dragons Association had collapsed. 

681
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Tian is also...

682
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Probably because of your curse.

683
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:49,000
Oh my god. 

684
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Are you saying that

685
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
what I said before I died

686
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
caused something like this to happen?

687
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,000
I never thought that you would kill yourself. 

688
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
I did it to protect the association.

689
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
I have never hated you. 

690
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
But I don't understand people like you.

691
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
In this world, no one can understand everyone.

692
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Even ourselves,

693
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:26,000
sometimes we don't even understand ourselves, do we?

694
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,000
And I didn't want anyone to understand me.

695
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
I don't even want anyone to pity me

696
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,000
because we only pity those who are struggling

697
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,000
or inferior to us only.

698
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
I don't think that

699
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
I am inferior to anyone.

700
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
So what do you want?

701
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Respect.

702
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Respect me as a human being.

703
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,000
Not higher

704
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
nor lower than others. 

705
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Just like other people, like an equal. 

706
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Tian also said this.

707
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,000
As a human being.

708
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
That's all.

709
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Just this little thing that my son wants, 

710
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,000
but I still can't give him. 

711
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,000
It's a pity that I didn't understand this

712
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,000
when I was still alive.

713
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,000
You likes to talk nonsense.

714
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Why do you keep talking about death?

715
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
If you don't want to watch opera with me, 

716
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,000
just go back.

717
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Father, Father.

718
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:10,000
Father. 

719
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Father. 

720
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:19,000
Tian.

721
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Father. 

722
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Father, please drink some water.

723
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Do you feel better?

724
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,000
I'm sorry.

725
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Why do you apologize to me?

726
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
It's all because of me. 

727
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Not at all.

728
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
I am the cause of everything. 

729
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,000
If I wasn't like this, 

730
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
it wouldn't be a mess.

731
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:00,000
And everyone doesn't have to suffer like this. 

732
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,000
No. 

733
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Because I am narrow-minded.

734
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
I forced Zhang to commit suicide.

735
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Your mother saw the fate of Zhang,

736
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,000
so she didn't want you to end like that.

737
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Don't be angry with her. 

738
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Not at all.

739
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
I have never hold a grudge against Mother.

740
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,000
I understand.

741
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,000
She did it to protect me.

742
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,000
If I…

743
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:55,000
could be the son that you and Mother hoped for, 

744
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
everything wouldn't be like this, right?

745
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Parents gave birth to children, 

746
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
but not the owner of their lives. 

747
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:16,000
You have to carry too much of my hope.

748
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,000
In the past, 

749
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,000
I had made you

750
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
feel that being yourself is wrong, 

751
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
or inferior to others.

752
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,000
I'm sorry.

753
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
If we can survive, 

754
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
from now on,

755
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,000
how you want to live, 

756
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:01,000
who you want to love, 

757
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
what kind of life you want, 

758
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
it's up to you, Tian.

759
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Choose the live you want to have, 

760
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
live a happy life.

761
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,000
I will respect your decision.

762
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Father. 

763
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Resurrection powder. 

764
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Madam. 

765
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Everyone is ready.

766
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
How many days have we been locked up?

767
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:32,000
I can't stand it anymore.

768
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Everyone, hang in there. 

769
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:37,000
Be patient.

770
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:41,000
If Madam Li give the antidote to Mr. Ma, everyone will survive.

771
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
She won't leave us for sure.

772
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Hey what are you doing?

773
01:05:53,300 --> 01:05:54,000
What are you doing to us again?

774
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Mr. Ma ordered us to burn and blow up this place today.

775
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Wait. 

776
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,000
What do you mean?

777
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,000
Didn't he say that he will let us go if he gets the medicine?

778
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Hey, put the buckets down

779
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:12,000
and bury the dynamite around. Quickly. 

780
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
No, you can't. Don’t do it. Put it down. 

781
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:20,800
Hurry. 

782
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Thermite.

783
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Be careful.

784
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:36,000
Patrol around. Don't let any single person escape.

785
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
You must open it.

786
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,000
What's the matter?

787
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
Great you're here.

788
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,000
I've brought the gift to congratulate you

789
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,000
and the girls to entertain you guys.

790
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
But they wouldn't let me go in.

791
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
They insisted to let me open the chest.

792
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
My teahouse account

793
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
and a list of clients.

794
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:14,000
It contains information that I have obtained

795
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
for use in business negotiations.

796
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
I have been collecting it for a long time.

797
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,000
But today, 

798
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
I think it's the time to give it to you. 

799
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:28,000
As for the liquor, 

800
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
I brought them to celebrate together.

801
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:05,000
Ma, would you like some alcohol?

802
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:11,000
It has been fermented for twenty years.

803
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,000
It's the signature recipe from my teahouse.

804
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
The Japanese soldiers are all at the party.

805
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,000
There are only Mr. Ma's subordinates in the house.

806
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,000
You can follow the plan, Madam. 

807
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
Yang, be careful.

808
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Be careful.

809
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Stop!

810
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,000
Go!

811
01:11:13,300 --> 01:11:14,000
What should we do?
