1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Once he gets married, 

2
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,000
one week after, he can take the position.

3
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,000
I've looked for the auspicious time.

4
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,000
A month and a half?

5
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,000
The auspicious time for wedding can't be postponed.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
No matter what, I'll interrupt your wedding.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
but you won't be able to inherit from Father. 

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
My brother's happiness must come first.

9
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,000
Tian is getting married in a month and a half?

10
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,000
Yes. 

11
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,000
I would like you to send me news.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I will handle this myself. 

13
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,000
If you are successful, 

14
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:40,000
I will give you the medicine formula used to treat your sister.

15
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,000
Just tell me who do you want me to kill.

16
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,000
I want you to kill the Song's eldest son.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
And if this is revealed, 

18
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,000
Tian's secret that we're struggling to hide may be exposed again.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
What is Tian's secret?

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
We have asked herbal shops and pharmacies across the town, 

21
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,000
but no one can explain about this mushroom.

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Then our assumption might be true 

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
that this mushroom is probably related to the chaos in our house.

24
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,000
Right. 

25
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,000
In the past, Song family had a Chinese doctor

26
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,000
Where is he now?

27
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,000
Doctor Qi who was here?

28
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,000
I heard that he's back to Chonburi.

29
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,000
If we meet Doctor Qi, we'll know what mushroom it is, 

30
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,000
and if it has anything to do with the mystery in our home.

31
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I call everyone to come here today

32
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
because I have good news to inform you. 

33
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
In another month and a half, 

34
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
there will be an auspicious event of Tian.

35
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So I want to take everyone to pay respects to the god

36
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
at the Song family's shrine in Chonburi.

37
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
So I want everyone to get ready.

38
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,000
We will depart tomorrow.

39
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
This is a good opportunity. 

40
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,000
If we go to Chonburi, we'll get to find Doctor Qi.

41
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Soon we'll know how this mushroom is related to our family. 

42
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,000
Yes. 

43
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Yang, what if the thing we suspect comes true?

44
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
That Tian's secret made Madam Li kill a man like Chan said.

45
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,000
Why do you believe that Tian has a secret?

46
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I've secretly overheard Madam Li talking to Jia.

47
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I wanted to ask you a few days ago.

48
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Yang, you knew it, right?

49
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,000
What is Tian's secret?

50
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Yang.

51
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
If you know it, please tell me.

52
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
If there's a problem, we can solve it together.

53
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,000
I'm worried about Tian as well.

54
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
But we can't fix anything.

55
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Can't fix ? Why not?

56
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Since Tian is a good man. 

57
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,000
What secret that is so serious and sinful?

58
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It should be nothing.

59
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Is there any secret that is too hard to fix it?

60
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
But it's hard to say, I can't say it.

61
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Even though you can't say it, you must speak.

62
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Father.

63
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
What is Tian's secret?

64
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Bao.

65
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
What's the matter, Madam?

66
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Where is Mr. Song?

67
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
When I came here, he wasn't here anymore.

68
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
He isn't in the bedroom. Where has he gone?

69
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
So what is it?

70
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You guys are talking about Tian's secret.

71
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
What is his secret?

72
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
There are many chaos in our family right now. 

73
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,000
Since Dong died, strange things happen. 

74
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Li acts as if she has something hidden. 

75
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Chan blames her for killing Dong. 

76
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
And now you two are also hiding something from me as well?

77
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Bua. 

78
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Why did you ask Yang about Tian's secret?

79
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Well…

80
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I'm just worried about Mr. Tian.

81
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:56,000
I think he might be stressed about the secret Madam Chan usually mentions, Sir.

82
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Really?

83
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,000
Yes. 

84
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Yang.

85
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You said it can't be undone. 

86
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
What do you mean?

87
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Well, if you heard it just now, 

88
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
you should hear the same that I can't said it. It's difficult to explain. 

89
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Are you going to play this trick?

90
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Fine. 

91
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Getting on my nerves to hide the truth?

92
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I will ask Tian and Li instead. 

93
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Okay. 

94
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
But if you know it, 

95
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
don't scold Tian.

96
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I asked him to keep me company last night to go out and disobeyed your order.

97
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Then Bua doubted this and caught me.

98
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
So she just asked me that's all. 

99
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
This is it?

100
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
That you said you can't fix it.

101
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Don't think that it's just this small.

102
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Last time I got beaten until my back hurt.

103
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Tian is a good man, so he kept thinking

104
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,000
and was afraid that if I get caught, I'll get hit again.

105
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It's not very serious.

106
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,000
Don't punish Mr. Yang, Sir.

107
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Yang. 

108
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I'm your father.

109
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You're lying.

110
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Do you think that I don't know this?

111
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Secret?

112
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Does Mr. Tian really have something hidden?

113
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Your conversation hasn't finished yet?

114
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
At first I thought there was only Chan. 

115
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Now Bua and Mr. Yang also talked about it. 

116
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,000
That's right. 

117
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
If Chan talked about it alone, 

118
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I would think that she was trying to slander Li. 

119
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Or does Mr. Yang want to help Madam Chan?

120
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,000
They're mother and son. They might want to help each other.

121
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
No. 

122
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Even if this son is useless, 

123
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
he's not that kind of guy.

124
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
What are you going to do?

125
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Forcing Mr. Yang to speak the truth?

126
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Even if you I force him, he'll probably lie like this time. 

127
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Tian's secret

128
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
is not just about escaping to hang out like he said.

129
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
But now we can't do anything besides being silent.

130
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
We have to keep an eye on all my children and wives. 

131
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Especially Li. 

132
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
What do you suspect Madam Li?

133
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Now do you think what she said

134
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
that Madam killed Dong to hide Mr. Tian's secret was true?

135
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I won't believe anything 

136
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
until I have evidence.

137
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
This job is very important.

138
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,000
Don't make a mistake.

139
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,000
If you are successful, 

140
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:54,000
I will give you the medicine formula used to treat your sister.

141
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:58,000
You will be free. You can do whatever you want in the future.

142
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You don't have to take my job in exchange for medicine to cure your sister again.

143
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Mr. Ma said that you can't make a mistake this time.

144
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:18,000
When you get there, notice the person carrying a blue handkerchief.

145
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
She will be the one to lure Mr. Song's eldest son out for you to kill him. 

146
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Prepare enough food for everyone.

147
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
We are staying overnight. Don't miss it.

148
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,000
So once we reach the shrine, you won't have to buy it again. 

149
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,000
Yes, Madam. 

150
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
And is the stuff I let you prepared ready?

151
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
You're welcome.

152
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,000
So carry the stuff to the car.

153
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,000
Yes, Madam. 

154
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
What is the stuff?

155
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Just in case I meet Dr. Qi, Madam.

156
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,000
I've heard that he had returned from China and has lived in Chonburi.

157
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Song Family visit there every year. He might hear the news and visit us. 

158
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I haven't seen him in a long time.

159
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
If we meet this time, you will be very happy.

160
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Yes, Madam. 

161
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I have knowledge of herbs to take care of you and Mr. Song like today

162
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
because he taught me. 

163
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
He has always been considerate of me

164
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
like a teacher and a brother to me. 

165
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Let's go. 

166
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Bua, let's go. 

167
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Everything is ready. Let's go.

168
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
When you get there, keep an eye on Tian. 

169
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Don't let him out of sight.

170
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,000
Keep reporting me.

171
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Yes, Madam. 

172
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
If you're ready, let's go.

173
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Bua, the car is over there.

174
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,000
Yes, Mr. Tian. Let's go, Mr. Yang.

175
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,000
Yes. 

176
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
You guys, get in the car now.
177
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Chonburi.

177
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Mr. Song, please come in.

178
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
You must be tired from traveling. I'll find something for you to drink.

179
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Thanks. 

180
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
You brought a lot of people this year. 

181
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,000
Our family is having a big event.

182
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
It's Tian's wedding.

183
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
So I brought everyone to pay respects to the Buddha

184
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
to bless for smooth wedding.

185
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Congratulations to Mr. Tian for your wedding. 

186
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Are you going to have grandchild for Mr. Song after marriage?

187
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
It must be like that.

188
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
What are you waiting for?

189
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Right?

190
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Tian.

191
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Your face wasn't quite good then. 

192
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Are you sick?

193
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I'm just tired. It's been a long journey.

194
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I thought there was something uncomfortable for you.

195
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Time flies, Tian.

196
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I still remembers this feeling very well.

197
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I still remember the picture when you were a child.

198
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
You two brothers running and playing around. 

199
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
You are getting married soon.

200
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
You're growing up to be an adult to take care of Song Family

201
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
and continue the work after me.

202
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Father.

203
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Actually, I still enjoy my work.

204
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,000
No need to get married now. 

205
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Are you having a hard time?

206
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
In the past, I've never discussed directly with you.

207
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I've always talked through your mom. 

208
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
If you have any trouble, 

209
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
you can tell me. 

210
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I'm your father anyway.

211
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I'm ready to do everything

212
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
to make you happy, Tian.

213
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
You're not in love with Pin, right?

214
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Is she not good?

215
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Or do you already have a lover?

216
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,000
No, I don't. 

217
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Tian.

218
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Since you were child, 

219
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
you were a good,

220
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
hard-working boy.

221
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
When you grow up, you have done a good job.

222
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
The employees all love you.

223
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I saw you growing up every day.

224
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
But it seems like it's me

225
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
who is far from you day by day. 

226
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I still remember well when you were a child, 

227
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
when you saw something, 

228
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
you would always tell me about it.

229
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
But now it's changed. 

230
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
You never told me anything again.

231
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Maybe it's because I am busy working.

232
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Is it too late?

233
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
If today…

234
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
If I want to know about you. 

235
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
What do you want to know?

236
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Everything.

237
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Or a secret that everyone is talking about.

238
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
You can tell me that too. 

239
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Father.

240
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Tian.

241
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,000
What are you guys talking? 

242
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
It's nothing. 

243
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
We were talking father and son stuff.

244
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
If we wait here and don't meet Doctor Qi, 

245
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
what should we do?

246
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,000
Should we search for him?

247
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:14,000
I think if we rush out to look for him, we could miss him.

248
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,000
We also don't know which part of Chonburi Doctor Qi lives in. 

249
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Someone is here. 

250
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,000
Excuse me, can I ask you something?

251
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Do you know someone named Doctor Qi?

252
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,000
He is a doctor who is good at Chinese herbal medicine.

253
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,000
He lives in Chonburi.

254
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,000
Oh, there are many herbal medicine doctor here.

255
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I can't remember all the names.

256
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I’ll ask others and tell you later if someone know him.

257
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,000
Thank you so much. 

258
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
As a leader of Song Family, 

259
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I'd like to be a representative to pay respect to the Buddha.

260
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
A representative

261
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
to pay homage to all the gods that are here, 

262
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
including all the ancestors of the Song Family.

263
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Please help protect

264
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
everyone in our family, 

265
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
workers and servants.

266
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I wish everyone happiness and prosperity.

267
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
May the business continue to prosper.

268
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Who is Mr. Song's eldest son?

269
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Mr. Yang and Mr. Tian sleep in the same room.

270
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,000
And how are we going to lure him out and let Mr. Ma's man attack him?

271
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Has Mr. Ma's guy arrived yet?

272
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
(Whistling sound)

273
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
He's here.

274
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Mr. Ma said that if the person is here, 

275
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,000
he'll send a signal as a bird chirping to let us know. 

276
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Find time to deliver the news.

277
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Tonight, I'm going to lure Tian to the garden

278
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
and let that person kill him. 

279
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Yes, Madam. 

280
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Don't turn around, just tell me the plan.

281
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:16,000
Tonight, go to Guanyin and then kill the man who are there.

282
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Mr. Yang, 

283
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
we have a big trouble.

284
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Mr. Yang, Madam Chan said she wanted to go to the monkhood. 

285
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,000
What? Monkhood?

286
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,000
Yes. 

287
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Mother.

288
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Are you going to be ordained?

289
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I went to talk to the monk teacher.

290
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Telling him that I wanted you to be become as the clan leader.

291
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
But I can't

292
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
because…

293
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
the position belongs to Tian.

294
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
So the teacher told me that I should know how to let go.

295
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Otherwise, my heart will suffer.

296
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Now I realize that I was wrong. 

297
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
So I want to get ordained

298
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
in order to pay for my past mistakes.

299
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Someone like you are going to get ordained?

300
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Yang, can you call Tian for me?

301
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I have a lot of things that I want to talk to him. 

302
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I want to apologize.

303
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I want to ask for forgiveness,

304
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
so that I can follow the path of Dharma with peace of mind.

305
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Aunt Chan.

306
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Tian.

307
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,000
Yang said that you have something to talk to me.

308
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I don't know how I can say this feeling.

309
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
In the past, what I did to you was wrong.

310
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
I always nitpick. 

311
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Slandering Tian and Madam Li. 

312
00:25:48,500 --> 00:26:50,000
Please don't be mad at me.

313
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Yes. 
315
00:26:53,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I just realized after talking to the teacher.

314
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
She said that she would be ordained.

315
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Really?

316
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Right. 

317
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I feel guilty.

318
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
When I think of something serious I did to you, 

319
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
I am even more shocked.

320
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Tian.

321
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
In the past, when I did something,

322
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I did as I want

323
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
regardless of the rights or wrongs.

324
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
The more I think about it, the more I regret it.

325
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Tian, I'm very angry at myself.

326
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I've been wrong for half my life.

327
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,000
I'm really sorry, I was wrong.

328
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I was wrong, I'm really sorry.

329
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,400
Aunt Chan, it's okay. 

330
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I felt so frustrated that I feel like I am suffocating.

331
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
I need to take the medicine first.

332
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:02,000
Wait for me right here.

333
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:02,400
Calm down.

334
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,000
Yang, take me take medicine. I can't take it anymore.

335
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Wait here for me, I'll be right back. Please. 

336
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,000
Okay. 

337
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Mom, slowly. 

338
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Slowly.

339
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Mother.

340
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Just sit down and wait here.

341
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,000
I'll go to the doctor or Aunt Jia to let them check your condition.

342
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
No need to. 

343
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Are you better now?

344
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Not quite yet.

345
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
But I'll probably get better after I sit here for a while.

346
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
You don't have to call someone here. 

347
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Just find something to fan me. 

348
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Ngek. / Yes?

349
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,000
Did you see Tian?

350
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,000
I saw him in the garden.

351
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
It's late at night already. What is he doing in the garden?

352
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Mom. 

353
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
If you get better now, I'll see Tian.

354
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,000
It's windy outside.

355
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,000
No!

356
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Why?

357
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Are you pretending to be sick?

358
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
What are you going to do?

359
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Who are you?

360
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Tian.

361
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Tian. 

362
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Tian. 

363
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Mother...

364
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Tian. 

365
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Tian. 

366
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Tian. 

367
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Tian. 

368
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Blood. What happened to you?

369
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,000
What's wrong? What's going on?

370
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,000
Someone attacked me. 

371
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I almost killed you, Tian. 

372
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Just a little bit. 

373
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
It's done.

374
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,000
Are you in a lot of pain?

375
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:02,000
It’s okay, Bua. Thank you very much.

376
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,000
Yes. 

377
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
I let the workers go after him, but there was no sign of anything.

378
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,000
I will set up a guard team tonight

379
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
in case the villain comes back.

380
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,000
Tian. 

381
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Do you know who it is?

382
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
No, Father. 

383
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:26,000
It was very dark in that area. 

384
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
So why don't you sleep since it's late night?

385
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,000
Why did you go to the garden?

386
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
I went for a walk.

387
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
The person who attacked me must be a bandit around here.

388
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:45,000
He probably planned to rob an outsider like us for money.

389
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Really?

390
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Yes, Father. 

391
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Bao.

392
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
When you went out to find the villain, 

393
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
was there anything wrong?

394
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Not at all, Sir. 

395
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
There was no trace inside the shrine. 

396
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Everything is fine. 

397
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
But Mr. Tian said that when the thief arrived, 

398
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
he just caught the thief first. I don't think it was right.

399
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Because where Mr. Tian was attacked was an open space.

400
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:42,000
If they didn’t plan to face each other, there's probably no easy way to meet.

401
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I also thought that it wasn't a thief.

402
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
And that Tian was attacked like this,

403
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
it's probably related to his secret.

404
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Why did you do this?

405
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Did you call the thief to come here?

406
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,000
It's not me. 

407
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:12,000
Are you saying that everything that happened was a coincidence?

408
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,000
You said you were remorseful and wanted to be ordained.

409
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,000
You let me call Tian for you. I did it. 

410
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
What has gotten into you?

411
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,000
Why do you only think of hurting Tian?

412
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
And did you see it just now?

413
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
He didn't mention anything about us.

414
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
If he said we were the ones who took him out, 

415
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,000
we might be kicked out of the family right away. 

416
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
But he didn't.

417
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Have you seen his goodness?

418
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
What does it have to do with me?

419
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
No matter how good he is, 

420
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
he's the one who are going to take everything from you.

421
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,000
So what should I do?

422
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
I'm trying to figure out and expose his secret, 

423
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,000
but it was unsuccessful.

424
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
If you don't want me to hurt him again, 

425
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
tell me what's the secret.

426
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Tian.

427
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
How come you were there?

428
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Were Chan and Yang involved in this?

429
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
I told you already that I went for a walk. 

430
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Hey, don't think I can't see that you are hiding something. 

431
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
If this Chan was involved, I won't be surprised.

432
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
But if it was Yang as well, you have to tell me. 

433
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Don't worry, Mother. 

434
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Yang will never hurt me. 

435
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Don't be too confident about it.

436
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Even the brothers from the same mother, they could kill each other.

437
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
No matter how much they love each other, 

438
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
if there are interests, 

439
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,000
they're always ready to hate each other. 

440
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
What is his secret?

441
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Tell me!

442
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
I won't. 

443
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Even if I die, I won't tell you.

444
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,000
Yang!

445
00:38:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Oh, Tian.

446
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Aren't you going to bed yet? What are you doing here?

447
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
If the thief comes back, what will you do?

448
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
He probably won't come back.

449
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
The lights are on. 

450
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Right. 

451
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:18,000
So what are you thinking?

452
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
What exactly happened?

453
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
When I fixed your wound, 

454
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:28,000
I saw that both you and Yang acted strange.

455
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Bua. 

456
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,000
Yes?

457
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Actually, I didn't go for a walk.

458
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Yang was the one who took me there. 

459
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Mother can see that the people who did this were Aunt Chan

460
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
and Yang.

461
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
I don't know if it was a coincidence

462
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
or if Aunt Chan intentionally let it be like this.

463
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
So...

464
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Tian… Did you have doubts about Yang?

465
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Not at all.

466
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
I believe that no matter what happens, 

467
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Yang will never hurt me. 

468
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
I never doubt anything about him.

469
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Yes. 

470
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
What? Did Tian get away?

471
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,000
And did he see your face?

472
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
No. 

473
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
How could you miss it?

474
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
You usually never miss. 

475
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
But what's going on between you and him?

476
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,000
Why did you want me to kill him?

477
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,000
He seems to be a nice guy.

478
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Do you know him?

479
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
No. 

480
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
According to his face, he seems harmless.

481
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:08,000
He's harmless to you, but not me.

482
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
He interfered in my business and gave me a hard time. 

483
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
It's ok. You go back and rest now. 

484
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
I'll contact you later. 

485
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
I won't do this job anymore. 

486
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Why?

487
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
It's too dangerous.

488
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
The man you want me to kill has money and power.

489
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,000
I don't want to risk my life. 

490
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
You have to do it. 

491
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Did you forget

492
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,000
that your sister's condition has improved

493
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
because of the medicine I gave you.

494
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
You choose. 

495
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,000
If he's not dead, your sister will.

496
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Zhang Zhitian

497
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
I looked around the shrine and couldn't find you.

498
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
I thought that you would come to see Mr. Zhang here.

499
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
I miss Zhang. 

500
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Since he passed away, 

501
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
The Five Dragons Association was never the same.

502
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
If Mr. Zhang was still alive, 

503
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:14,000
he would be your consultant and could handle the chaos on behalf of you.

504
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
He was the younger brother that I loved. 

505
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
He was the person who understood my feelings the most.

506
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Zhang is good,

507
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
hard-working, 

508
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
and considerate.

509
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Whatever work I let him do, he always did well.

510
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:55,000
Never failed at all. 

511
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
But he shouldn't be a homosexual.

512
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
All the goodness

513
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
that Zhang did

514
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:17,000
couldn't make you overlook this?

515
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
If he could choose, 

516
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,000
he himself would want you to understand.

517
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
and accept what he was. 

518
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
It already happened.

519
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
I couldn't fix anything.

520
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
And if you could turn back time?

521
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
If you could go back, 

522
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
would you still

523
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
drive him out of the Five Dragons Associations?

524
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
I will have to make the same decision.

525
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:13,000
No one accepts a homosexual

526
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
to manage and control people.

527
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
I've made up my mind.

528
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
I will stay here further. 

529
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:50,000
Is it alright? Will Mr. Song have any doubts?

530
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,000
I will tell Father that I would like to play around a little more.

531
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,000
He probably wouldn't mind.

532
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Since we've been here, I don't want to come here in vain. 

533
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Because if we go back, we will never know

534
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:05,000
where we can find out about this mushroom.

535
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Yes, let's do this. 

536
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
That is...

537
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
What is it?

538
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Mr. Song. 

539
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,000
I thought we'd never meet again, Doctor Qi.

540
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Doctor Qi.

541
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
The people at the market have talked 

542
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
that people from the Song Family came to this shrine.

543
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:41,000
So I thought that you come here to pay homage to the gods every year.

544
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
But I was so busy that I couldn't rush here.

545
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
I need to treat the sick urgently. 

546
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,000
I thought that we would miss each other again.

547
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Mr. Song, Madam Li, how are you?

548
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:59,000
I am sick once in a while, like an old man.

549
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:03,000
But Jia has provided me treatment.

550
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
I'm fine.

551
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:10,000
I let Bao call Jia for you. She would be happy to meet you. 

552
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
How about you, Madam Chan?

553
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Good too. 

554
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Bua?

555
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Yes. 

556
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:28,000
These two must be Mr. Tian and Mr. Yang.

557
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:33,000
But I can't remember which one is Tian or Yang since I saw you when you were little.

558
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
The one on the right is Tian.

559
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:40,000
The one on the left is Yang.

560
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:48,000
These two have grown up and look handsome like you when you were young, Sir. 

561
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Everything is packed. Are you going back now?

562
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,000
It's really a pity that I'm a bit late.

563
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Not late at all, Doctor.

564
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
We still have time.

565
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Let's have some tea.

566
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Thank you so much Doctor Qi for taking such good care of us.

567
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Mr. Song, Madam Li, Madam Chan, take care of your health.

568
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:31,000
Have a safe trip back. 

569
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Mr. Yang.

570
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,000
Let's go. 

571
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Doctor Qi.

572
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Oh, Bua.

573
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
I would like to discuss with you.

574
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
This is…

575
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:05,000
Do you know this mushroom?

576
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
What mushroom is it, Doctor?

577
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Why do you look so shocked?

578
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,000
This mushroom is called

579
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
blood sucking mushroom.

580
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:20,000
Blood sucking mushroom?

581
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Why is the name so scary?

582
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,000
And it's very rare, isn't it?

583
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:31,000
Bua and I went to the drugstores and no one knows it.

584
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
It does not appear naturally.

585
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,000
This mushroom is secret knowledge. 

586
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Secret knowledge?

587
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:47,000
This is taking mushrooms that grow on insects

588
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:50,000
or we called them orchids, 

589
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:53,000
put together with some special ingredients.

590
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Just put the thing you want it to grow on in. 

591
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
As far as I see, 

592
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:09,000
this mushroom grew from the remains of living things.

593
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Remains of living things?

594
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Could you check what remains this mushroom grew on?

595
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Only those who made it will know.

596
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Where did you two get this mushroom from?

597
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
At the backyard of Song's house.

598
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
You are here. 

599
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Jia. 

600
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,000
So glad to see you. How are you?

601
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:08,000
Do you have any difficulty living here?

602
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Not at all.

603
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:16,000
You know that an old man like me was not someone who wanted any comfort.

604
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Otherwise I wouldn't have come out of the family. 

605
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,000
I know, I remember it. 

606
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:30,000
You told me that you would use your knowledge of medicine and herbs to help a lot of people.

607
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Thinking about that time, if you didn't save me, 

608
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
I was probably dead.

609
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,000
You didn't just save my life, but also gave me a new life.

610
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:53,000
You taught me until I have knowledge of medicines to save people.

611
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
And what I taught you, 

612
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Are you using it in the right way?

613
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Is it correct?

614
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Yes. 

615
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
If so, 

616
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
this mushroom…

617
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,000
How did this mushroom appear in the back of the Song's house?

618
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
What are you doing?

619
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
I didn't do anything.

620
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:33,000
These mushrooms probably grew from the ants that took the orchids that I kept and eat at its nest.

621
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
So the mushrooms grew out there. 

622
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Really?

623
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
And who shows you this mushroom?

624
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,000
If this mushroom actually grew in the ant nest like you said, 

625
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:51,000
you don't have to worry about who gave it to me. 

626
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Strange thing? There is strange thing. 

627
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
What's the matter, Sir?

628
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:07,000
Dong, a worker at my house has died.

629
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
His body disappeared.

630
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,000
The whole family suspected that it was Li who did it. 

631
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,000
So what do you think?

632
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
I suspect

633
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
that it was Li too. 

634
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:30,000
But I am surprised. Why did she do it?

635
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
What reason she has?

636
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,000
There were mushrooms like this producing at your house, right?

637
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:42,000
Yes, Doctor. 

638
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:44,000
How do you have this mushroom?

639
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:47,000
Try digging the area where this mushroom grew

640
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:49,000
and see if there is anything there. 

641
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,000
Tell me immediately if you find something.

642
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:56,000
If I have finished my errands here, I will meet you in Phra Nakhon.

643
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Someone has been investigating the mushrooms from Dong's body?

644
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
How did you answer Doctor Qi?

645
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:07,000
I made up an excuse, but I didn't think he would believe it.

646
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
What shall we do?

647
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Who is investigating this?

648
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
So how do we know?

649
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
So tired.

650
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:53,000
Hey, you were so happy when you went there, weren't you. Hurry.

651
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:37,000
It's good to go to Chonburi this time. We have met Doctor Qi.

652
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:39,000
He is still the same.

653
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
And...

654
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
What did you talk to him for a long time?

655
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
What's wrong? 

656
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Why are you looking at me like that?

657
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Nothing.

658
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,000
We talked like the old men

659
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
with deteriorating health.

660
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,000
You aren't old yet. You're still young.

661
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Among all my three wives, 

662
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Bua is the most lovable wife

663
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,000
because she is humble and never asked for anything.

664
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Chan is the most worried

665
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
because she likes to cause trouble

666
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
and won't surrender to anyone.

667
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
As for you, 

668
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
you are the most respectful wife

669
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
because you are good

670
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
and talented. 

671
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
You can help me do my job.

672
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
You know my heart.

673
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:25,000
You are also the madam of the Song family. 

674
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Thank you, Sir. 

675
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Even Homer sometimes nods.

676
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,000
The wise man can make a mistake sometimes. 

677
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
No matter how good you are, 

678
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,000
there is still a mistake.

679
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Do you have anything to tell me?

680
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
There's nothing, Sir. 

681
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Mr. Song. 

682
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Are you alright? Why are you asking me this?

683
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Sir. 

684
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
If you have something, 

685
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
you can ask me directly.

686
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
You talk like this, 

687
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
I'm not feeling well at all.

688
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,000
That's fine if you don't have anything to tell me.

689
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Please know that

690
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,000
I understand you.

691
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,000
I don't want you to be stressed.

692
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Recently, Mr. Song talks strangely.

693
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Did he say anything to you?

694
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,000
No, Madam. 

695
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,000
What's wrong?

696
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
I got a bad feeling. 

697
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
About Dong's body at the back of the house.

698
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
You can be at ease.

699
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,000
My fermented water is fatal.

700
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
It can eat into human bones

701
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,000
without traces left.

702
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Nothing is buried here, Sir. 

703
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:18,000
These days, I can't sleep tight at all.

704
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
The only way to end everything is

705
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
to hurry and let Tian take the position.

706
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Are you sure

707
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:45,000
that the workers picked mushrooms from here?

708
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,000
It must be here, Sir. 

709
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Then there must be something. 

710
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,000
A human tooth.

711
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Whose teeth would drop here?

712
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Or...

713
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Is there a corpse buried here, Sir?

714
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,000
If there is really a corpse here, 

715
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,000
then why is there only one tooth left?

716
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
How did your man work?

717
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:58,000
Instead of killing Tian, I almost got into trouble as well. 

718
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
If you did everything according to the plan, 

719
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
my subordinate would have more time to handle this. 

720
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:08,000
What Mr. Ma said was correct, Madam. 

721
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:09,000
Nuan! / Yes, Madam.

722
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,000
How much time will it take just stabbing with a knife?

723
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
I think instead of fighting, 

724
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:20,000
we should figure out a way to get rid of Tian. Isn't it better?

725
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
It must be difficult.

726
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:30,000
He was almost assassinated like this. He would probably be more careful.

727
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Previously, you said that

728
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Tian has a serious secret.

729
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:43,000
Even Li had to kill a guy to cover up. 

730
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:47,000
What if we uncover this secret?

731
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:53,000
I've been trying to search for that secret for a long time, 

732
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:54,000
but it is still unsuccessful. 

733
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Right. 

734
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,000
The more they cover up, 

735
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
The more it is important.

736
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:06,000
What is the secret of the Song Family's number one heir?

737
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,000
I would like to know that. 

738
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:15,000
So while you are planning to assassinate Tian, 

739
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
I will find out this secret.

740
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,000
What do you think?

741
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Good.

742
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Jiu. 

743
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Fu, Mei.

744
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Is anyone there?

745
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:39,000
I'm hurt. 

746
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:40,000
Mei.

747
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Mei.

748
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:43,000
I'm hurt.

749
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Move. 

750
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Mei.

751
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Eat this. 

752
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:05,000
Jiu, there's no Mei's medicine left. 

753
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:17,000
I think Mei's condition is serious. You should take her to the doctor.

754
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:18,000
I have taken her there. 

755
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
The doctor said that there was no medicine to cure her. 

756
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Besides, it's a war time. 

757
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,000
There is no western medicine as well. 

758
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Now I'm just relying on Chinese medicine from someone I know.

759
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
How long have you been treating her?

760
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:36,000
Isn't she better?

761
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Her condition improved only after taking the pills.

762
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
But when the medicine wears off, the symptoms relapsed.

763
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
So what do you do next?

764
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Are you going to let Mei be like this?

765
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,000
I won't do this job anymore. 

766
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,000
You have to do it. 

767
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Did you forget

768
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:16,000
that your sister's condition has improved

769
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,000
because of the medicine I gave you.

770
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,000
You choose. 

771
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:25,000
If he's not dead, your sister will.

772
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,000
I think you should go back today.

773
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,000
I'll send you off. 

774
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Let's go. 

775
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Why did you bring me here today?

776
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,000
It's a shortcut. 

777
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
I've never used this way before.

778
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Even though it's a bit deserted, it's pleasant. 

779
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,000
There are a lot of trees.

780
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Do you think so?

781
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Jiu. 

782
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Is there anything wrong?

783
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Nothing.

784
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Tian, dodge!

785
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Go along this way. You'll reach your home.

786
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:45,000
Hurry, go!

787
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,000
Go, Tian. Quickly!

788
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,000
Gui. 

789
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,000
Yeah, it's me. 

790
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:01,000
You are evil. Dare to lie to Mr. Ma.

791
01:07:01,300 --> 01:07:02,000
How can you do this?

792
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,000
Mr. Ma. 

793
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,000
What's up?

794
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:28,000
I came to look for you. You have been missing for a long time.

795
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Sir. 

796
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,000
He knows Tian.

797
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Just now, I went to shoot Tian, but Jiu saved him, so I missed it.

798
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Otherwise, Tian would already be dead by now. 

799
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Jerk.

800
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Hey Gui, calm down. 

801
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Don't be impulsive.

802
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,000
If Tian dies in our territory, 

803
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Big Brother must suspect us. 

804
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
You can let me kill anyone, 

805
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
but not this one, I beg you.

806
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:09,000
So this means you are really close to Tian?

807
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
He once helped my siblings.

808
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:16,000
He is like a benefactor for my siblings just like you.

809
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:19,000
Bastard, how dare you compare him to Mr. Ma?

810
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Do you want your sister to die?

811
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,000
I understand you.

812
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:31,000
A person must know gratitude.

813
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
I don't want you to be ungrateful.

814
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:39,000
So I have choices for you.

815
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
If those two kids are still with us, 

816
01:09:22,300 --> 01:09:24,000
Jiu will do anything for us.

817
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:28,000
Mr. Tian, someone wants to apply for a job.

818
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
I found this tooth.

819
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:35,000
We have to find out who knows about this mushroom.

820
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,000
Mr. Yang.

821
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Do you know that I love and trusts you?

822
01:09:42,300 --> 01:09:44,000
You won't leave me, right?

823
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
I have to live in misery because of the secret.

824
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,000
The secret that I am...
