It's all over.

It isn't!

00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:13,660
If you don't make it clear,

00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,040
I won't let you leave.

My dad said,

if we got together,

38
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,330
you wouldn't win the Golden Song Award.

39
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,450
He was capable of doing that.

40
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:46,990
Why didn't you tell me?

41
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,870
Why didn't you say anything?

42
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:49,950
I hated you for nothing.

I was miserable for nothing.

Does apology work? Does it?

You always act on your own.

47
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,580
You turned me down,

48
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:14,870
and quit the show.
Now you're going abroad.

49

Do you think

50
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,620
I'm too weak

51
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:24,660
to deal with it with you?

52
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,450
You said that.

53
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,830
You said that

54
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,700
you would start again with me.

55
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:40,080
Now after...

61
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,120
I won't go anywhere.

62
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,910
Can you love me again?

63
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:01,620
Yan Ning.

00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:02,540
Yeah?

65
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,000
We...

66
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,410
What are you doing?

67
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,660
We've moved fast enough.

68
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:11,500
We shouldn't be
too fast on other things.

69
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,910
What other things?

70
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,290
I mean the show.

71
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:16,410
What are you thinking?

72
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:21,290
Oh, the show.

73
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:25,290
I'm going to quit Perfect Romance.

74
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:26,700
Ah?

75
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:30,370
But there are only two episodes left.

76
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:33,750
Why don't we ask for Gu Han's opinion

77
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:36,620
and try to finish the shooting?

78
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,540
Don't worry.

79
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,910
I've made it clear to Gu Han.

80
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:50,660
But we should still keep a low profile.

81
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:54,330
When public opinion calms down,

82
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:56,910
we'll announce it gradually.

83
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:01,500
You mean we have to
keep our love secret?

84
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:03,700
It doesn't matter.

85
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:05,950
Being with you,

86
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,910
I'm already as happy as
living in a sweet dream.

Shen Zhizhou.

88
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:12,410
Yeah?

89
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:15,870
Promise me, no matter what happens
in the future,

90
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,160
we'll face it together, OK?

91
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,000
Yeah.

92
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,080
I promise.

93
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:50,250
Do you like it?

94
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,370
This is the tune I adapted last night.

95
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:53,870
It's great.

96
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:56,950
But, Yan Ning, why did you suddenly
adapt the tune?

97
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:58,700
It doesn't match your style.

98
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,950
Right, Feng?

99
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,580
Yeah, I think so, too.
