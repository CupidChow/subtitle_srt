you didn't sleep well last night, right?

00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:39,120
It's OK. Get back to your work.

OK.

Yan Ning?

- Yeah?

00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:02,290
She's talking to you.

00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:03,790
Check your makeup.

Oh.

It's OK.

00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,870
What's wrong with you?

34
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:13,990
Nothing.

35
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,660
Do you cook a lot?

36
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:27,950
Not much.

37
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:30,120
I usually cook instant noodles.

38
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,290
Try this.

39
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,410

44
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:38,870
Gu Han, listen carefully.

45
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:39,910
I know everything.

46
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:42,540
You and Yan Ning slipped away
during the shooting.

47
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,000
What if you were photographed?

48
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,950
It's one thing to be on the show

49
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:49,200
and it's another thing to date for real.

50
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:50,120
I'm warning you,

51
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:50,830
don't pressure me,

52
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,200
or I can do anything.

53
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:53,950
You can do anything?

54
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,660
Then make me a
boneless chicken feet salad.

55
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,370
You look like chicken feet.

56
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,700
Let me tell you,

57
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:04,080
don't contact Yan Ning in private.

58
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,250
You're a very popular couple now.

59
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,540
People are watching you.

60
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:10,250
Right.

61
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,620
We're a popular couple.

62
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:16,120
What are you going to do?

63
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:32,750
Yan Ning,

64
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,080
Gu Han is calling.

65
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,080
Hello, Gu Han.

66
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:41,700
Hello, Yan Ning.

67
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,330
Since we're a popular couple now,

68
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:46,120
shall we release a song together?

69
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,330
Release a song together?

70
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,660
Yes. What do you think?

71
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,370
OK.

72
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,990
OK, let's talk about it later.

73
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,200
OK.

74
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,290
Bye.

75
00:04:58,330 --> 00:04:59,120
Bye.

76
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,620
Aunt,

77
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,370
bring me a box of duck's web.

78
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,200
Release a song?

79
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:06,950
What song?

80
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:11,500
He thinks when we're popular,

81
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,910
we may as well compose a song together.

82
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:15,370
Oh.

83
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:17,990
I think it's a good idea.

84
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,000
Yan Ning,

85
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:25,160
are you sure you want to be
together with Gu Han?

86
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:26,830
I think he's nice.

87
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,000
And there isn't

88
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,160
a more suitable man right now.

89
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,250
Suitable?

90
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:36,200
I don't think

91
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:38,830
you should date him because
he's suitable.

92
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:41,040
When you get close to him,

93
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,160
do you feel butterflies in your stomach?

94
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:45,830
Does it matter?

95
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,910
Of course it does.

96
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:49,410
If you feel it's like

97
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:51,500
holding a tree when you hold him,

98
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,870
how can you count it as love?

99
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,620
Don't you think so?

100
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,790
Boss, my leg has recovered.

101
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:14,580
It won't affect my work.

102
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,790
When do we film my new MV?

103
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:18,950
I know you've been resting lately.

104
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:21,290
But you should be patient

105
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:22,870
with recuperating.

106
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,290
No.

107
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:26,160
Boss, I'm recovered.

108
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,200
I'm really recovered.

109
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:31,290
Look, I'm really recovered.

110
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,450
Don't play tough.

111
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,330
Come to me when you're fully recovered.

112
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:36,580
I have to go.

113
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:40,450
Boss.

114
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,910
Ah!

115
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:46,950
Useless leg,

116
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:49,330
when will you recover?

117
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,290
Oh.

118
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,370
Gu Han?

119
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,500
Are you Tong Yuxin?

120
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:02,250
The flowers are for me, right?

121
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,080
Um, no.

122
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,950
They're for Yan Ning.

123
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:10,540
I hear that you're
a toxic friend to Yan Ning.

124
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,580
You usually lash out at her in private.

125
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,080
You're colleagues.

126
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,790
You should respect her.

127
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,620
Though she is a senior to me,

128
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,250
she's also my rival.

129
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,910
I won't stop wrangling with her.

130
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:22,250
Next year's Golden Song Award

131
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,750
must be mine.

132
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,660
Wait.

133
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,200
You wanna me stay?

134
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,120
It's too late.

135
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,250
No.

136
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,000
Give me back the flowers.

137
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,540
Oh.

138
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:37,250
No, I...

139
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:40,120
Ah!

140
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:59,790
No wonder you won the Golden Song Award.

141
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:02,370
- Here.
- Hello.

142
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:03,330
Yeah.

143
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:05,250
Thanks.

144
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,950
Let's begin.

145
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:08,910
OK.

146
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,540
Why are you laughing?

147
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,910
I'm just a half baked idol.

148
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:28,910
I can't compare with
a virtuoso like you.

149
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:38,410
Use your index finger
and middle finger.

150
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:42,410
Gu Han plays aloof to me

151
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:45,200
but smiles to Yan Ning like a fool.

152
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:08,040
There will be a good play.

153
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:20,330
You proceed.

154
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:21,830
I'll leave for a while.

155
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,540
Three, two, three.

156
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,700
