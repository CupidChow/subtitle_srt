Hi, everyone.

20
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,450
Perfect Romance,
Episode Six, Scene One.

21
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:30,620
Three, two, one, action!

22
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:33,200
Miss Yan,

23
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,790
you've known Gu Han for some time,

24
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:37,370
how do you like him?

25
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,200
He is a nice guy,

26
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,540
a perfect dating partner.

27
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:42,830
Now that you have a

28
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:44,620
basic impression of each other,

29
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:46,870
I have some questions to test you.

30
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:48,250
If you both answer
one question correctly,

31
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,830
he can take two steps forward.

32
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:51,330
After answering ten questions correctly,

33
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:53,200
he can sit next to you.

34
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,950
OK.

35
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:59,750
First question, please tell us
his birthday.

36
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,750
Well, you don't know.

37
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:08,830
Let me change another one.

38
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,830
On your first date,

39
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,620
what shoes did he wear?

40
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,580
You don't know either?

41
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:21,040
When you took Polaroid together,

42
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,620
what was his sixth posture?

43
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,000
When did he make his first
public appearance,

44
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,330
accurate to hour?

45
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,580
The questions are sick.

46
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,830
If she goes on like this,

47
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:51,450
Gu Han could never reach Yan Ning.

48
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:54,040
We want the show to exceed expectations.

49
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,830
Forget it. I'll change another question.

50
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,080
Wait.

51
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,750
Don't you think
the questions are too tricky?

52
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:11,450
Could you ask some simpler ones?

53
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:12,580
Exactly.

54
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,990
She can't possibly know
the exact answers.

55
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:16,370
I don't think they are tricky.

56
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:18,830
I think if you really love each other,

57
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:21,200
you can certainly answer the questions.

58
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,160
I tell you what,

59
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,250
I'll give you a simple question.

60
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,370
Gu Han, if you answer it correctly,

61
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:29,540
I'll let you sit here right away.

62
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:31,540
OK.

63
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,580
When is my birthday?

64
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,500
What?

65
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:41,620
Why don't you even know my birthday?

66
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,950
Why should I know it?

67
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,450
Because I'm Yan Ning's junior.

68
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:49,410
Don't you want to know about me?

69
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,160
Why would I want to know about you?

70
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,700
Next question,

71
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:01,120
name 20 foods he/she hates most.

72
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:03,450
- 20 foods?
- 20 foods?

73
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,990
OK. Cut.

74
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:08,120
Hey, Mr. Shen,

75
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,250
don't you think
the questions are too difficult?

76
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,500
Well, the thing is,

77
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,370
Xiaoguang made the shooting plan
especially,

78
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:15,330
which is a bright spot.

79
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:17,750
That's all for today's shooting.

80
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:18,580
Yan Ning.

81
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:20,450
- Gu Han, Ms. Qian is calling.
- Han.

82
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:21,790
Let's talk later.

83
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:23,000
Yeah.

84
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:25,950
Hello.

85
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:30,830
Xiaoguang,

86
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:33,250
could you do me a favor?

87
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,870
OK.

88
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,830
OK. You can count on me.

89
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:41,580
Thanks.

90
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:42,330
Yeah.

91
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,830
Hum, you're my boss's rival in love.

92
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,330
I won't betray him.

93
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,330
Wait.

94
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:11,580
I know it might be a little abrupt.

95
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,580
But I need to make sure

96
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,700
and see my heart clearly.

97
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,870
So...

98
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:22,700
Let's do it.

99
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,700
Why is it you?

100
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:49,990
Didn't...

101
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:51,830
Didn't you ask me to come?

102
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,950
I asked Gu Han to come.

103
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,370
Gu Han?

104
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,500
Wait a minute.

105
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,870
Did you ask Gu Han to come

106
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,660
in order to kiss him?

107
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,500
Yes.

108
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,410
Do you like him so much?

109
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,580
Does it have anything to do with you?

110
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,540
Let go.

111
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,120
Let go.

112
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,290
I won't.

113
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,990
Shen Zhizhou, are you insane?

114
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,910
Let go of me.

115
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:23,250
Let go.

116
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,080
Let go.

117
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:28,580
Let go. What are you doing?

118
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,580
Hey, isn't she a star?

119
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,080
Hey, look.

120
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:32,830
Isn't she?

121
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,160
Isn't she?

122
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,620
- Yes, she is.
- Let's take a picture with them.

123
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,660
Let's go.

124
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,830
- Go.
- Don't run.

125
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,370
Take a picture with us.

126
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:45,620
What's wrong?

127
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,700
Let me carry you.

128

Hey, don't run.

129

Take a picture with us.

130
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,540
It's OK, they didn't catch up.

131
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,290
I thought the park
was cleared out today.

132
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:38,290
It's too big to be cleared.

133
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,830
I have to go.

134
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,250
- Let me give you a ride.
- Stop.

135
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:46,000
Let's forget what happened today.
