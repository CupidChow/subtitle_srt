Yan Ning!

Did you find them?

No.

Where can they go?

34
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,950
Look for them separately.

35
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:56,120
The book says that
girls should be reserved

36
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,750
and play cat and mouse.

37
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,200
But I'm not good at that.

00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,910
So I want to ask you,

39
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,200
Gu Han,

40
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,830
do you hate me?

41
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,040
Of course not.

42
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,370
Do you like me?

43
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:10,500
Yes.

44
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:13,750
Since the moment you opened my car door,

45
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,080
I've fallen for you.

46
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,790
Yan Ning,

47
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,080
I decided to be on the show

48
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,660
because of you.

49
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,540
I know

50
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:25,370
my character design is unconvincing,

51
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:26,620
but I swear,

52
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:29,250
every word I said to you is true.

53
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:30,790
So,

54
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:35,790
would you like to be with me?

55
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,990
I mean,

56
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:40,290
be my real girlfriend.

57
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,000
No way.

58
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,910
Why not?

59
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,410
What are you doing?

60
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,870
It's written clearly in the contract

61
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,450
that during the filming of the show,

62
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:56,200
the guests are not allowed
to date in private.

63
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,830
And we were in the middle of shooting,

64
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,040
how could you leave without notice?

65
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,370
- Go back with me.
- Hey.

66
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,790
- What's going on?
- What happened?

67
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:11,120
Continue filming.

68
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,540
Did Gu Han confess to you?

69
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,580
Oh, dear. Did you say yes?

70
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,790
Before I could say that,

71
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:21,580
we were interrupted by Shen Zhizhou.

72
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,540
Yan Ning,

73
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:29,000
don't you think you're moving too fast?

74
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:30,580
Fast?

75
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,540
Yeah.

76
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,290
It's called efficient date.

77
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:36,040
If Shen Zhizhou didn't make trouble,

78
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,160
we would've finished the whole set
including hug and kiss.

79
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:41,000
You're not dating.

80
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,910
You're trying to hit the KPI.

81
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:45,000
Isn't that good?

82
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,500
Yan Ning,

83
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,250
are you so impatient

84
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,790
because of Shen Zhizhou?

85
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:55,700
Actually, when you went missing today,

86
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,540
he was very worried.

87
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,080
I can tell that

88
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,660
he cares about you very much.

89
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,040
Anyway, now I just

90
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,830
want to be together

91
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,000
with Gu Han for real.

92
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,410
Boss,

93
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,250
why would you torture yourself?

94
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:22,750
You don't know anything.

95
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,160
I know everything, boss.

96
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,370
You look miserable every time
when we start shooting.

97
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:28,580
Why would you?

98
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:31,160
Are you really going to watch him

99
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,620
date her?

100
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:35,540
I know that

101
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:38,950
some special love is doomed to

102
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:43,700
meet with many difficulties

103
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:46,160
and objections,

104
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:50,120
but escaping and repressing your
feelings can't solve the problem.

105
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,500
In love,

106
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,370
you should be brave.

107
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:56,000
Fight for it. You can make miracles.

108
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:04,120
Do you think there will be miracles?

109
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,080
How can you know if you don't try?

110
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,790
Say whatever you want

111
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:09,500
and do whatever you like.

112
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,790
I support you.

Shen Zhizhou,

116
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,330
what's wrong with you?

117
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:25,290
Why do you always interfere with
Gu Han and me?

118
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:26,450
I told you

119
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:27,620
I was going to confess to him.

120
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,200
You should bring us together.

121
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,660
Seeing that you date,
hold hands and confess,

122

I...

123
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:35,750
I can't take it anymore.

124
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,870
Why can't you?

125
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,040
You don't like me, anyway.

126

Yan Ning,

127
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,700

I've always liked you.

129
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:49,450
I know it's too late to say anything,

130
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,080
but I don't want to pretend anymore.

131
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:54,750
I can't film the show anymore.

132
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:57,700
Shen Zhizhou, are you insane?

133
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:00,540
I loved you for ten years,

134
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,990
but you turned me down.

135
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:04,120
Now I've finally lived through the pain.

136
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,660
I no longer have feelings for you,

137
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,450
but you tell me you like me.

138
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,910
I thought I should refuse you
for your own good,

139
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:11,990
not expecting that
it would hurt you so badly.

140
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:14,330
I thought it was enough
as long as you were happy,

141
