do you know
Mr. Lin's position in the circle?

Do you want to make a movie or not?

00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,700
Yes, I admit it.

00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,750
I didn't arrange the dinner
just for your movie.

I want you to meet Lin Ya.

00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:05,000
From a respectable family, she used to
study at a famous university abroad.

No matter on character,
appearance, or manner,

28
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,580
she is better than Yan Ning.

What about you?

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,200
Where was your manner?

31
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,080
You didn't even say hi.

32
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,120
How could you embarrass me like that?

33
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,450
Let me tell you,

34
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:20,200
don't be pertinaciously stupid.

35
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:22,330
OK.

36
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,160
What did you say?

37
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,750
I said, OK.

00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:30,080
You...

39
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:35,450
Yan Ning doesn't like me.

40
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:38,040
We'll never be together.

41
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,830
Are you satisfied?

42
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,450
How are you feeling?

43
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,160
Not bad.

44
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:02,290
36.1℃. The fever has gone.

45
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,700
Sit here.

46
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:05,830
I'll get you a cup of water.

47
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:06,500
Yeah.

48
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,790
You'd better take a day off today.

49
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,750
It doesn't matter.

50
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:14,450
I can shoot today.

51
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,040
Yan Ning, did you cook porridge?

52
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,990
Didn't I tell you to call me?

53
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:26,910
Why did you cook porridge yourself?

54
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,250
What porridge?

55
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,120
Here, see for yourself.

56
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,080
It was overcooked.

57
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,950
Look at you. I told you

58
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:35,370
I should stay and take care of you,

59
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:36,540
but you wouldn't let me.

60
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,580
In the end,
you had to cook porridge yourself.

61
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,200
Yan Ning.

62
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:59,660
Yan Ning.

63
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,580
Here. Hot water.

64
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:09,540
You've just got better. Get more rest.

65
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,950
And be careful not to catch a cold.

66
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,120
Wait.

67
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,750
What's wrong?

68
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:21,370
Gu Han, I have something to tell you.

69
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:23,450
I'm listening.

70
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:27,910
- Actually, I...
- Yan Ning.

71
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:31,790
We're in trouble, Yan Ning!

72
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,410
Look.

73
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:37,370
Yan Ning, the aloof muse,
becomes a cheating muse.

74
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,830
Dating Gu Han sweetly doesn't stop her

75
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,990
from throwing herself at the director.

76
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,950
Her innocent image
has collapsed completely.

77
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:55,870
Yan Ning,

78
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:58,580
what happened between you
and Shen Zhizhou?

79
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:01,790
It's a misunderstanding,

80
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,990
but he did express his feelings for me.

81
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:05,370
What?

82
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:06,790
Did you say yes?

83
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:08,540
I didn't.

84
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,870
You and Gu Han are a popular couple now.

85
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,540
The rumors about your love affair
with Shen Zhizhou

86
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,950
will be a heavy blow to your image.

87
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,500
What should we do?

88
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,250
I can help.

89
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:20,620
Yan Ning,

90
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,080
as long as we announce that

91
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,410
we are officially dating,

92
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:24,910
the rumors will be scotched

93
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:26,500
and the show will be more popular.

94
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,250
Gu Han, you must think it through.

95
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,290
- If you officially announce...
- At this time,

96
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:32,330
nothing is more important than Yan Ning.

97
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,080
I object.

98
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:35,790
Yan Ning,

99
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:38,290
this is probably the best way
to solve the problem

100
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:39,700
- And you've always...
- Yan Ning.

101
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,950
Don't worry about it.

102
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,790
It's my pleasure.

103
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:45,250
Qiu Wen,

104
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,000
would you give us a minute?

105
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,580
Yes.

106
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,660
Gu Han,

107
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:01,330
I was about to tell you this morning.

108
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:02,830
Why?

109
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:05,290
Don't we get along well on the show?

110
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:07,200
And you've told me about your opinions.

111
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,160
Now we just need to settle it in advance.

112
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:10,830
Gu Han,

113
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:13,700
you're a perfect dating partner.

114
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,830
Being with you, either in private

115
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,700
or at work, makes me happy.

116
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,660
I thought I fell for you.

117
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,580
I've tried countless times

118
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,700
to let you into my heart

119
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,290
and fall for you for real.

120
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:29,620
But I've realized today that

121
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:33,700
I like you instead of loving you.

122
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:36,870
Gu Han, I'm sorry.

123
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,500
I should say sorry.

124
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,580
I'm too impatient.

125
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,660
Yan Ning, I promise, next time I'll...

126
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,000
Gu Han,

127
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,000
I've made up my mind.

128
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:50,370
I'll quit the show.

129
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,750
I'm sorry.

130
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:04,080
I won't give up.

131
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,500
I believe that one day,

132
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:09,500
you'll fall for me.

133
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,450
Hello, Zhizhou.

134
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:23,700
Dad, did you do that?

135
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,000
Without your instruction,

136
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
entertainment reporters won't release
the news about my love affair.

137
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:30,660
I told you clearly that

138
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:33,160
Yan Ning didn't like me at all.

139
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,910
Why don't you give her a break?

140
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:36,750
Because you care too much about her.

141
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,870
For her, you even gave up the chance
to make your own movie,

142
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:39,700
right?

143
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,370
I can't let her ruin you.

144
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:43,700
Dad,

145
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:46,500
I won't let you manipulate me again.

146
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,540
Mr. Shen, Mr. Shen.

147
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,910
We have a few questions for you.

148
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:52,750
Mr. Shen, do you really
have a love affair with Yan Ning?

149
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:53,700
As the director of the show,

150
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,080
how can you date a guest?

151
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,830
Did you give her the chance

152
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:57,790
to be on the show?

153
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:58,950
Mr. Shen, please answer us.

154
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:01,120
I'll give you a short answer.

155
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,950
I don't have an affair with Yan Ning.

156
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,080
I was the one who pestered her.

157
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,410
I like her.

158
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:09,080
I like her so much

159
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:12,410
that I'm jealous of
her relationship with Gu Han.

160
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:14,080
After the incident,

161
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,290
I'll take the blame

162
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:16,290
and resign from the show.

163
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:17,580
Thanks.

164
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:20,290
