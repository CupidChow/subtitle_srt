Yeah.

170
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:37,500
I'll confess to Gu Han
at the next shoot.

171
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,080
Boss.

172
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,580
Although...

173
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:52,330
But...

174
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,080
Don't you think they're moving too fast?

175
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:02,660
You have to control yourself.

176
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,620
Don't touch her.

177
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:07,500
Hey, boss.

178
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,040
It's just a filming maneuver.

179
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,200
Sit. Sit.

180

I'm sorry.

182

Are you all right?

183
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,040
It was urgent just now.

184
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:21,330
I'm sorry.

185
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:23,040
Did I offend you?

186
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:24,700
Never mind.

187
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,620
Let me help you.

188
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:30,250
Be careful.

189
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,950
Are you OK?

190
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,580
I may have a sprain.

191
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,910
This isn't appropriate.

I thought we wouldn't use it.

Here.

198
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:43,500
You want me to spray it myself?

199
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,450
Yeah.
