What about Yan Ning?

You must do it alone.

Mr. Shen,

00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,290
your questions

You know,

the self-discipline of entertainers

29
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:43,790
is required to be regulated now.

30

I must strictly comply with
the regulations.

31
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:49,160
So please answer me truthfully.

Go ahead.

34
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:56,910
When did your relationships
begin respectively?

35
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:58,450
When did your first love begin

36
00:01:58,450 --> 00:01:59,990
and why did you break up?

37
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:01,750
I've never had a relationship.

is your lie detector broken?

45
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:23,540
It turned red before I asked.

46
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,950
We're just friends.

Why?

50
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,830
Because I like her.

51
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:41,200
Well,

52
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:43,580
don't you think it's a little hasty?

53

Mr. Shen,

54
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:46,620
you said you would produce
a real love variety show

and help the guests
to find their true love,

didn't you?

57

I think

58
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,580
I've already found her.

59
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,700

Recover from your injury first.

I have some errands to run.

84
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,000
Gotta go.

85
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,120
Boss, don't go.

86

Being known as an aloof muse,

95

Yan Ning surprisingly goes on
a love variety show.

96

Do you know about
her previous relationships?

97
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,750
Um, her relationships were complicated.

98
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:16,250
I hear that she had a breakup recently.

99

Uh, should I tell you that?

100

Why don't you talk more about it?

101

no interview on the set.

I'm willing to be a temporary guest.

114
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,870
How can you work with your leg wounded?

115
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,620
I'll recover soon.

116
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,330
Or you can film my upper body.

117
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:50,620
Anyway, my face is pretty enough.

118

Are you OK?

164
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,450
Stop pretending to be nice.

165
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,080
Is this the first date you talked about?

166

Um...

172
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:58,540
Why, why badminton?

173
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,410
Let's go.

174
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:00,160
Well...

175
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:01,370
Well,

176
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,160
it's too late today.

177
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:04,700
I haven't finished my homework.

178
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,450
Maybe next time?

179
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,620
Oh, OK.

180
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,750
Duh.

181
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,080
Let's go play badminton.

182
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,790
Maybe next time?

183
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:36,870
I haven't finished
solving their problems yet.

184
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:39,500
Shen Zhizhou,
we'll wait for you over there.

185
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,870
OK.

186
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:45,330
I have to go now.

187
00:08:58,910 --> 00:08:59,620
Shen Zhizhou,

188
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:00,950
let's play badminton.

189
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,200
Next time.

190
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,160
I have some errands to run. Gotta go.

191
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,870
Hey, Yan Ning.

192
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:17,290
Hey.

193
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:19,990
Yan Ning, why did you throw them away?

194
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,330
Shen Zhizhou doesn't want to
play badminton with me.

195
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:24,870
Don't be upset.

196
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,290
Why don't you find another excuse?

197
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:28,250
Anyway, you just want to go out with him

198
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,950
and tell him your feelings.

199
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,160
Then, what excuse should I use?

200
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,830
Um, you can ask him

201
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:37,540
to play ping-pong.

202
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,410
Ping-pong?

203
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:40,660
Yeah.

204
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:42,660
Forget it.

205
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,580
Oh, don't be sad.

206
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,620
I believe there must be a person

207
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,750
in the world who is willing to

208
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,200
accompany you to do

209
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,250
anything you like unconditionally.

210
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:52,120
Really?

211
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:52,990
Yeah.

212
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,200
What's wrong?

213
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,500
Nothing.

214
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:01,950
Can you play badminton?

215
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,330
A little. I'm not good at it.

216
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:06,750
OK, I'll humor you a little.

217
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:08,950
OK.
