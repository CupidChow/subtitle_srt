19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,950
Feng, morning.

20
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:37,700
Do you want to listen to my new song?

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,370
I have something to tell you.

22
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:40,580
You must stay calm.

23
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:42,040
There's something wrong
with your concert.

24
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:44,120
It can't go on as planned.

25
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:56,410
Wait.

26
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:58,200
All the new programs have been canceled?

27
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,200
Yeah.

28
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,450
The negotiation was going well

29
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:01,870
when they suddenly
broke up our partnership.

30
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:03,540
Apart from that, several other programs

31
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,120
that were promising before
have gone nowhere.

32
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,620
I heard that...

33
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,120
Heard what?

34
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,000
Your dad said openly that

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,910
he wanted you to make movies with him.

36
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:15,250
So people dare not to cooperate with us.

37
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:18,160
Boss, what should we do now?

38
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,500
I got it.

39
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,750
Get back to work.

40
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,870
Yes.

41
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,290
Shen Zhizhou,

42
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,750
I'll give you one last chance.

43
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:39,330
Leave her, and make movies with me.

44
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,330
I told you three years ago,

45
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,910
I had my own goals and ambition.

46
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:47,200
I won't make movies with you.

47
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,120
As for Yan Ning,

48
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,700
I won't give up on her.

49
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,700
Fine.

50
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,450
She can't have her concert, anyway.

51
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,540
What did you do?

52
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:04,000
I told you

53
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,160
I would never allow you

54
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,000
to date a woman in the circle.

55
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:09,790
Because of you, she'll lose everything
sooner or later.

56
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,040
She'll hate you.

57
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,000
No.

58
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,950
Yan Ning?

59
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,660
Why are you here?

60
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:27,450
Mr. Shen, I don't know why

61
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:29,370
you are so hostile to me.

62
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:30,620
But since the moment

63
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,830
I decided to be together
with Shen Zhizhou,

64
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:35,950
I've been ready to face
all the consequences.

65
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,950
My dream won't end just because
I can't have a concert

66
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:41,580
or win the Golden Song Award.

67
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,330
You can't threaten us.

68
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:45,750
I'll never give up on him.

69
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:51,790
Dad,

70
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:53,950
I won't let her go.

71
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:56,370
Let's go.

72
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:57,250
Yeah.

73
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:08,950
Yan Ning.

74
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:09,790
Yeah?

75
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,370
Thanks.

76
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,370
You fool.

77
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:18,250
Didn't I tell you

78
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:21,500
that we would face it together
no matter what happened,

79
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:22,620
right?

80
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,790
Hey, be natural.

81
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,330
Why?

82
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,870
Take more pictures.

83
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:03,500
So, after your parents divorced,

84
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,410
your dad became paranoid

85
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:08,410
and never believed in any women
in show business again?

86
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:09,870
Yes.

87
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,580
In other words,

88
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:15,080
if I fell in love
with another woman in the circle,

89
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,080
he wouldn't permit it either.

90
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,990
Do you have any pictures of your mom?

91
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:23,790
Let me show you.

92
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:34,910
Wow, she's beautiful.

93
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:38,700
No wonder she was the film queen.

94
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,290
But why did she leave your dad?

95
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,910
Su Nuo, after so many years,

96
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,160
do you still not know
how much I love you?

97
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:58,790
I let you star in my movies

98
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:01,080
and made you the film queen.

99
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,660
What about you,

100
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:03,500
ah?

101
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,700
As soon as my movies failed,

102
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,580
you snared a foreign director
without wasting any time.

103
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,950
Chengfeng,

104
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:15,830
I will go regardless of your objection.

105
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:18,580
It's a good opportunity for me.

106
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,870
Good opportunity?

107
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,660
People say my inspiration has dried up.

108
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:28,580
I thought at least you would support me.

109
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,450
What about you?

110
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:33,450
You only care about your opportunities.

111
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:37,620
Su Nuo, do I mean nothing to you?

112
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,080
You're my husband.
Of course I'll support you.

113
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,910
Then don't go abroad.

114
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:48,160
Stay, OK?

115
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,080
Don't go anywhere.

116
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:52,540
Look at you!

117
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,370
Only two of your movies failed.

118
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:55,660
What's the big deal?

119
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,500
How much longer will you be decadent?

120
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:59,540
I won't be like you.

121
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:02,080
I won't abandon myself
when I have a problem.

122
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:03,500
Su Nuo,

123
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,250
I'll divorce you if you leave.

124
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,250
Whatever.

125
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:15,160
Then my mom went to the US

126
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,990
and started a career there.

127
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:19,450
My dad was overwhelmed.

128
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:21,990
He worked day and night.

129
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,450
He even started to

130
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:25,620
make commercial movies
he hated the most.

131
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,330
Finally, he rose again.

132
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:30,950
But he hates my mom's guts.

133
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,790
He thinks my mom took him

134
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:34,500
as a stepping-stone
in her acting career,

135
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,200
and suspects every female entertainer

136
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,540
that gets close to us.

137
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:42,830
What about you?

138
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,580
Do you hate your mom?

139
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,370
I don't know.

140
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:48,870
My mom has been abroad.

141
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:50,870
My dad has been busy working.

142
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:53,290
I'm often alone.

143
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:56,000
I thought that in the world,

144
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,660
no one cared about me.

145
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:01,200
Luckily,

146
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,790
you showed up.

147
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,080
Eh?

148
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,040
Yan Ning,

149
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:11,080
since you appeared,
I've never been alone.

150
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:14,410
You've brought me beautiful memories.

151
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:17,750
Thanks for accompanying me
for the last ten years.

152
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,200
Thanks, too.

153
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:26,790
I've spent the best ten years with you.

154
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,620
Here it is.

155
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:06,000
I didn't overcook it this time.

156
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:06,950
Yeah,

157
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,450
I agree.

158
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,500
I'll ladle a bowl for you.

159
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:16,790
Why are you so cute, Boat?

160
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,370
What did you call me?

161
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:20,830
Boat.

162
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,990
Isn't your nickname Boat?

163
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,660
Don't call me that again.

164
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:27,290
I don't like the old name.

165
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:28,830
Why?

166
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:30,790
You can't stop me. Boat.

167
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:32,500
Boat. Boat.

168
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,870
Boat. Boat.

169
