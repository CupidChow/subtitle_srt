Yan Ning, what are you reading?

22
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:35,040
I'm making a love plan for Gu Han.

23
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:38,330
I'll try to get close to him
as soon as possible.

00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:40,000
What?

25
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,080
The past ten years
have taught me a truth,

26
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,620
hesitation leads to failure.

27
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:47,120
Waiting for gains without pain,
you may gain nothing.

28
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:49,330
So I must take the opportunity.

29
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,990
Do you have to be so impatient?

30
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:53,700
Of course I'm impatient.

31
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,080
I must start a relationship soon.

32
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:56,790
Wow,

33
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:59,410
there are so many men chasing me.

34
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,990
I'm so annoyed.

35
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,000
Hey, Xiaoxue,

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,330
any gifts for Yan Ning?

37
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:10,290
She's always cold to others.

38
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:12,040
How dare men chase her?

39
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,910
Men love cute women like me.

40
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,830
- Duh.
- Xiaoxue.

41
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,700
Open the gifts and see what we've got.

42
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,370

43

Come on. Sit.

00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:05,990
Sit.

52
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,660
I have a surprise for you.

53
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,330
What surprise?

54
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,040
Don't look right now.

55
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,290
OK.

56
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:28,950
Did you make it yourself?

57
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:30,450
Yes, I did.

58
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,250
It looks tasty.

59
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:36,700
Have a try.

60
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,990
OK.

61
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:43,290
How do you like it?

62
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:44,540
Is it good?

63
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:46,870
Yeah, it's good.

64
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:47,910
Really?

65
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:48,620
Yeah.

66
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:49,990
Have some more.

67
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,370
Oh, OK.

68
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,870
Shall we take a photo?

69
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,290
OK.

70
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,450
One, two, three.

71
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:05,830
How about it?

72
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,000
Let me take one for you.

73
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,700
OK.

74
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,580
Get ready.

75
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:20,200
She's definitely an aloof muse.

76
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,750
No wonder people say you're cold.

77
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,830
You're stiffer than me.

78
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,750
I...

79
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,450
Act cutely.

80
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:36,790
Smile.

81
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:39,250
I'm not good at taking cute pictures.

82
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:42,540
You're cute when you smile.

83
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,990
Why don't you show a few teeth?

84
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,580
Use some gestures,

85
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,000
like this,

86
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,700
this, and this.

87
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,370
I can't...

88
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,040
Give it a try.

89
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:01,950
Let me try.

90
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,200
That's it. It's good.

91
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,250
Keep still.

92
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,990
Smile.

93
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,910
Do you think it's cute?

94
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,660
Yes, I do.

95
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,660
Another one.

96
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:20,990
Come on.

97
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:23,500
Like this?

98
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,660
OK.

99
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,250
Lower your chin.

100
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,200
With one eye closed.

101
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,620
Yeah, that's right.

102
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,410
Get ready.

103
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:35,120
Three, two, one.

104
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,700
Do you really think this one is cute?

105
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,620
Of course.

106
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,410
I love that expression best.

107
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,080
- I'm leaving.
- No, don't.

108
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,410
Let's take another one,

109
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,200
the last one.

110
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:47,540
Come on.

111
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,450
Smile a little.

112
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,410
What are you doing?

113
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:59,750
You took unflattering photos of me.

114
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,120
- Don't look.
- No. It must be good.

115
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,660
Let me check.

116
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:07,540
Look at you.

117
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:08,950
Oh, my!

118
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:11,290
Look.

119
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,120
Oh, you...

120
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:16,750
Look.

121
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,250
Any progress?

122
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,950
Progress isn't necessary.

123
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:34,040
I think it's good for you to be real.

124
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,750
I understand what you mean.

125
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,330
You mean I'm not cute.

126
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:42,160
No, I didn't mean that.

127
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,910
I mean,

128
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:45,950
in my eyes,

129
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:48,040
you are cute in any case.

130
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:09,200
We're down to the last one.

131
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,500
Shall we take a photo together?

132
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:13,120
OK.

133
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,950
Come on.

134
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:18,790
Are you ready?

135
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,000
Yes.

136
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,870
Three, two, one.

137
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:33,790
Oh, are they kissing?

138
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:36,910
Cut.

139
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:44,040
Change set.

140
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:49,540
Gu Han, come with me.

141
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:54,950
What are you doing?

142
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:57,000
Why do you have to take me here?

143
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,040
What's so important?

144
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,160
Get in the car.

145
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,370
No.

146
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:04,990
I don't want to.

147
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,120
I'm warning you,

148
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,290
on my show,

149
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:24,910
you must know the proper limits.

150
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,580
Isn't it a love show?

151
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,040
When something falls into place,

152
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,870
- it naturally...
- Did you kiss her?

153
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,910
No, I didn't.

154
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:34,000
Aren't you going to bring us together?

155
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,620
Then why do you get so excited
over a little thing?

156
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:38,870
I mean,

157
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:40,990
you should go step by step

158
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:42,290
and respect each other.

159
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:44,160
You shouldn't be so impatient.

160
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,700
If Yan Ning
takes the initiative next time,

161
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,910
can I...

162
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,040
You can't.

163
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:53,620
You've only known each other
for a few days.

164
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:54,950
Do you know her well?

165
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:57,410
She was doing it for the show.

166
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:59,410
She isn't as frivolous as you.

167
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,790
You have to control yourself,

168
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:02,450
OK?

169
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,160
You can't just...

170
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,790
You can't touch her.

171
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,830
What if I touch her a little?

172
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:10,910
No.

173
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:13,750
Can I hold her hands?

174
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,580
You can't.

175
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,120
Can't I do this, either?

176
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,120
Gu Han.

177
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,500
Oh, we...

178
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,290
We...

179
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,250
Oh, don't mind me.

180
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:31,830
I'm sorry. Sorry.

181
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:39,830
What are you doing?

182
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,750
You, no...

183
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,040
You...

184
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:45,500
I...

185
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:09,580
Shen Zhizhou.

186
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,290
Why are you here?

187
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:22,200
I want to check the filming schedule
for the next episode.

188
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,580
What?

189
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,790
More intimate plots?

190
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,120
Our premiere is a great success.

191
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,040
The couple of Yan Ning and Gu Han
made a crucial contribution.

192
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,540
The investors asked us to strike
while the iron was hot

193
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,080
and create more chances
for intimate contacts,

194
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,540
so that the show would go viral.

195
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,830
So I had to reschedule the dating plan.

196
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:41,870
Why don't you take a look?

197
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:46,950
Well...

198
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:49,990
No way.

199
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,000
Why not?

200
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,450
I think it's great.

201
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:54,950
Seriously?

202
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:56,540
Hold hands six times,

203
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,200
take you in his arms and spin?

204
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,580
How could such dramatic plots

205
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,870
be in our show?

206
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,200
What we pursue
is being natural and true.

207
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,580
Delete all the plots.

208
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:09,160
It's OK as long as
the story is reasonable.

209
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:14,290
Why don't we add more such plots?

210
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,700
The audience will think it's natural

211
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,250
when they see more of these.

212
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:18,990
Do you want more?

213
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,620
Yeah.

214
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,660
I can make sacrifices

215
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,580
and give my first kiss on the screen.

216
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:26,040
Yan Ning,

217
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,620
you've never dated.

218
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,370
You don't know such things.

219
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:32,870
Who said so?

220
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,620
I...

221
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:40,580
(It's just a date.)

222
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,160
(I've read lots of books.)

223
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,410

224
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:48,660

225
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:51,870
You...

226
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,790
What are you doing?

227
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:14,200
You are not shy, are you?

228
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,330
Wow,

229
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:22,950
the tricks in the book are useful.

230
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,080
What book?

231
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,830
Proceed with your meeting.

232
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,370
- I have to go.
- Hey.

233
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,160
Yan Ning.

234
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,160
- Yan Ning.
- Yeah?

235
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,040
- What's up?
- Listen to me.

236
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:51,580
Even if you want to date Gu Han,

237
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,620
you shouldn't be so impatient.

238
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,700
Why shouldn't I?

239
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,990
You know what,

240
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:59,830
I'll confess to Gu Han
at the next shoot.

241
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:00,580
What?

242
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,830
Wait and see.

243
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:02,910
Bye.

244
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,620
