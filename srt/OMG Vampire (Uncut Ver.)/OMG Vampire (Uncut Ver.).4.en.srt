00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,320
Hello sir

2
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,360
How can I help you, Sir?

3
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,120
The owner isn't here yet?

4
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,080
Oh

5
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:23,880
No

6
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,400
Patrick, he isn't here yet

7
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,320
Patrick?

8
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:31,880
A foreign name

9
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,200
which such an asian face

10
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,400
Oh

11
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,760
Hey

12
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,400
You don't have to call me sir

13
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:41,880
It seems too distant

14
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,000
Oh

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,840
Well…

16
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,080
Do you have anything to do with Patrick?

17
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,080
Oh we didn't do anything yet

18
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,280
like sex..

19
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,160
I'm only joking!

20
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,440
Come here

21
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,520
Come closer

22
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,560
What?!

23
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,400
NO

24
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,160
I will never do such things!

25
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,080
Come on, I know you know?

26
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,080
that you

27
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,840
have a crush on my friend, Jolie

28
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,080
If you help me with this,

29
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,480
I will help you with Jolie

30
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:26,800
How does it sounds?

31
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,120
Hmm?

32
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,920
I think..

33
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,280
Let's cheer!

34
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,080
Oh yes

35
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,040
Yes

36
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,640
Here. This one for you, Patrick

37
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,480
Thank you so much

38
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,520
Bottoms up!

39
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,880
More

40
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,000
Come on there's still some left

41
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,280
Bottoms up!!

42
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,440
Let's go!

43
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,840
Oh wow

44
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,000
Very good

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,440
Great job, Patrick

46
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:03,840
Again

47
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,040
Bottoms up

48
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,040
Only three more left

49
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,640
Oh yes

50
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,600
Keep going

51
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,480
Almost there

52
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,240
And the last one

53
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,640
Are you good hmm?

54
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,800
Keep going, Patrick

55
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,920
That is

56
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,920
Oh

57
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,360
He falls asleep already

58
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,960
Very good everyone

59
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,480
Bye bye

60
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,320
Well, can't help it

61
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,320
You were the one who rejected me

62
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,440
So you will have to face this

63
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,360
No!

64
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,040
Poom

65
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,800
Stay calm.

66
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,320
You've seen it before.

67
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,520
It's alright.

68
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,960
You've seen it before.

69
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:01,920
It's normal.

70
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,760
Poom.

71
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,400
It's ok.

72
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,040
Stay calm.

73
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,480
Everything is good.

74
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,360
Everything is fine.

75
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,720
Hey!

76
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,080
What the hell?

77
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,760
What?

78
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,760
Why so surprised?

79
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,840
You forgot about last night hmm?

80
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,880
What last night?

81
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,000
Do you really need me to explain it?

82
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,120
Hey.

83
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,880
I'm yours now.

84
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,600
I'm your responsibility.

85
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,200
Response how?

86
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,920
Accept me as waiter in your bar

87
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,440
and give me the red wine every 15 days.

88
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,200
What?

89
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,520
No what.

90
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,640
We will do it this way.

91
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,400
So you are now in waiter position?

92
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,480
Yes.

93
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,880
If you want to work as a waiter,

94
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,360
why don't you come to my shop?

95
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,440
Well…

96
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,080
Why does it have to be that bar?

97
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,280
Well

98
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,600
Let's just say I have my own reason.

99
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,560
What?

100
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,600
The hell are you doing?

101
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,720
I'm nitpicking.

102
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,240
I've heard that the bar's owner is quite handsome.

103
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,280
You don't have a crush on him right?

104
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,400
Crush what?

105
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,720
What are you talking about?

106
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,760
Poom.

107
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,600
Chin.

108
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,760
Excuse me.

109
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,120
Come here.

110
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:40,960
Let's go outside.

111
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,040
Outside what?

112
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,880
Hmm..I think..

113
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,880
There's something fishy about this.

114
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,040
Where are we going?

115
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,200
Just go outside first.

116
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,200
Hi-

117
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:49,640
Jolie-

118
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,320
What?

119
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,960
We didn't plan to meet today!

120
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,480
Come on!

121
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,320
Well…I couldn't wait any longer.

122
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,640
However,

123
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,000
I have to meet her today.

124
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,800
And oh

125
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,840
Don't forget

126
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,640
about the promise that you gave me.

127
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,360
Yeah yeah.

128
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,120
I won't forget it.

129
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:03,680
But today

130
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,720
you have to leave first.

131
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,680
Leave.

132
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,240
No.

133
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,160
Just go.

134
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,280
No.

135
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:09,840
Leave.

136
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,640
I'm not leaving!

137
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,080
Hey!

138
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,160
I won't leave!

139
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,440
Don't play a trick on me.

140
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,680
Let me tell you something.

141
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,200
If you don't help me today,

142
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,600
I will tell the truth to Patrick.

143
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,880
All of it!

144
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,840
I will.

145
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,440
Fine.

146
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,440
Ok.

147
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,440
This way.

148
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,560
It isn't that hard right?

149
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,240
Jolie.

150
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:45,560
Yes?

151
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,200
He…

152
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,880
Isn't here for me right?

153
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,480
I haven't said anything.

154
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,560
But yeah

155
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,720
He's here to see you.

156
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,800
He wants to talk about online selling.

157
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,720
Chin.

158
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,480
Chin!

159
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,640
Come here.

160
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,880
You two

161
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,760
if you have any to discuss,

162
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,240
just do it ok?

163
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,080
Discuss what?

164
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:30,720
Noo.

165
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,000
I just-

166
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,240
That's enough.

167
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,920
Just go already.

168
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,240
I'm annoyed.

169
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,840
Well…

170
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,200
This way please.

171
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,560
I'm not shy ok?

172
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,200
I squirm because

173
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,600
I well..I need stretching.

174
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,960
Hmmm…

175
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,080
Yeah yeah.

176
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,840
So believable

177
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,720
I believe you.

178
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,680
Now go.

179
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,960
Go.

180
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,400
Move aside.

181
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,160
Come on.

182
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,600
Told you.

183
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,960
There is

184
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,160
something fishy about this.

185
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,360
Go.

186
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,080
Let's go.

187
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,440
Poom

188
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,880
I think

189
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,280
they won't be able to speak to each other.

190
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,680
You may have to take them to the doctor first.

191
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,600
They will turn into number 8

192
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,560
I will take care of it.

193
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,800
Wait here.

194
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,880
Oi.

195
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,760
When will you guys stop squirming huh?

196
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,680
Just talk to each other.

197
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,320
What?

198
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,520
Squirm what?

199
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,840
You go somewhere else.

200
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,640
Oh of course.

201
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,760
I would definitely go.

202
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,360
But after you two start talking first.

203
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,840
You as well.

204
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,680
If you have something in mind, just talk to her.

205
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,440
Fine. I know.

206
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,440
There.

207
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,960
Finally start talking.

208
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,880
Hi Jolie.

209
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,400
I'm Chin.

210
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,440
Oh you already know my name?

211
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,360
Of course I know.

212
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,120
I'm a big fan.

213
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,920
I watch every livestream of you.

214
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,200
Oh right.

215
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,080
You're the one who ordered a lot?

216
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,560
Oh, you remember me as well?

217
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:39,880
Well yes.

218
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,120
That is me.

219
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,960
Thank you so much for supporting me.

220
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,880
You're welcome.

221
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,280
Oh

222
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,320
Jolie.

223
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,520
Do you recall

224
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:52,800
the last time we met what did we talk?

225
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,840
The last time…

226
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,760
Well

227
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,040
It was before,

228
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,760
You caught in the accident.

229
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,920
Oh…

230
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,880
No, I don't recall anything.

231
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,760
Maybe…

232
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,520
It's because

233
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,600
my brain got concussed.

234
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,240
Oh.

235
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,600
We had talked about

236
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,360
Soi Ju

237
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,720
Oh Soi Ju.

238
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,440
By the way,

239
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,880
What soi is it? * Soi in Thai means alley.

240
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,680
Awww.

241
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,000
You're

242
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,240
so good at making jokes.

243
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,640
And also have a sense of humor.

244
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,120
If we have time,

245
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:43,800
next time

246
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,720
I will take you to try some.

247
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,960
Sounds good.

248
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,160
Which soi?

249
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,160
Soi Ju?

250
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,240
Do you think

251
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:04,640
Jolie

252
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,560
like that guy?

253
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,000
You still have to ask?

254
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,800
Hmm.

255
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,400
Look at her.

256
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,040
In my opinion, maybe

257
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,480
it's because excitement.

258
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,720
Let's think is this way.

259
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,760
Back in the vampire land.

260
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,240
Have you guys experienced love?

261
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,040
Of course no.

262
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,560
Because it's against the rules.

263
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,680
But once you come here, in human land.

264
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,000
You meet your crush.

265
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,480
It's normal if we will feel a rush of excitement.

266
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,760
Things like this?

267
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,400
You have to wait and see in a long term.

268
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,080
Hmm…

269
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,000
True.

270
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,400
After what you have said, I also want to have a lover.

271
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,400
I want to experience how it's like when someone has a crush on you.

272
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,400
What should I do?

273
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,400
What about the person that's sitting next to you now?

274
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,920
What are you talking about?

275
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,880
You must be crazy.

276
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,160
We will get married soon

277
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,120
But you're saying that you need a lover?

278
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,280
It's just a face marriage. We have to go with the flow.

279
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,720
Yea.

280
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,040
Yeah? We just that yeah?

281
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,520
Here we go.

282
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,280
This is call family business now.

283
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,960
We outsiders shouldn't interfere.

284
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,520
Then…

285
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,640
I will go back to work.

286
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,440
Zen.

287
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,840
I think you should go talk things out with him.

288
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,760
Talk about what?

289
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,000
If you guys will marry just by paper.

290
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,960
I think you shouldn't do that.

291
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,400
You better find any excuses

292
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,400
And inform your parents and his parents.

293
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,280
That you two aren't ready.

294
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,680
Or you both need more time.

295
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,840
Or just fine any excuses or reasons.

296
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,240
Marriage isn't something you can take it as a joke.

297
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,120
I suggest you to consider it again.

298
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,040
Go.

299
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,560
Go talk with Ran.

300
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,440
Ok.

301
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,360
What happened?

302
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,960
His family problems.

303
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,480
Let him handle it himself.

304
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,680
What about you?

305
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,840
How was it going?

306
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,000
Oh.

307
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,240
What is Soi Ju?

308
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,520
What kind of Soi is that?

309
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,120
What?

310
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,080
Well. Chin mentioned

311
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,160
that he will take me to have Soi Ju.

312
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,680
And I said yes.

313
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,240
But

314
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,520
I just want to know

315
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,720
Is it a place

316
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,280
where humans going for a date?

317
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,800
No, it isn't.

318
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,240
Well.

319
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,200
Soi Ju

320
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,600
is raw meat

321
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,200
dipped in sauce.

322
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:34,880
What?

323
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,720
Raw meat?

324
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,720
Did he just ask me on a date

325
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,400
but for eating raw meat?

326
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,520
Yeah.

327
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,520
Yeah.

328
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,520
It's weird.

329
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,760
Poom!

330
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,840
You how dare you.

331
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,520
You don't try to find a job.

332
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,920
You're so-

333
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,080
Cute.

334
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,000
Quite a charmer yourself hm?

335
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,440
What?

336
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,160
I think..

337
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,400
It's because of my beauty.

338
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,640
Maai.

339
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,720
Maai.

340
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,880
Maai!

341
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,920
W-what?

342
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,040
What?

343
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:23,920
I haven't finished scolding you yet-

344
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,960
Enough.

345
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,840
That's enough.

346
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,440
I got the job.

347
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,880
Really?

348
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,200
Yeah.

349
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,960
And this is?

350
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,960
My friend.

351
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,160
How?

352
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:42,880
Hey.

353
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,080
You don't have me as your only best friend?

354
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,640
Yes.

355
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,360
Come on.

356
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,560
I will tell you about this later.

357
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,720
Aren't you here to buy some desserts.

358
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,840
Ah yes.

359
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,760
I have to buy some for my boss.

360
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,600
Talk to you later.

361
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,760
I'll get going now.

362
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,360
See you later.

363
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,040
My name is Maai.

364
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,040
It's Maai. Please don't forget it.

365
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,080
Maai.

366
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,600
Maai.

367
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,200
So beautiful huh?

368
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,280
This friend of mine.

369
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,640
It's so difficult.

370
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,400
I don't know which one should I pick.

371
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,960
Born as a beautiful woman is so difficult.

372
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,360
Have a sense girl.

373
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,400
Sense.

374
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,360
What's wrong?

375
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,320
I asked you what's wrong.

376
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,960
Just forget about it.

377
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,400
You don't have to care.

378
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,760
If you don't tell,

379
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,440
how am I supposed to know.

380
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,520
We're going to get married.

381
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,400
But you are thinking about having a lover?

382
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,760
And why would you be serious about it?

383
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,320
It's just a fake marriage.

384
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,240
Fake marriage.

385
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,480
That's how you see it?

386
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,200
And why would you be this serious?

387
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,000
I think if you really don't feel serious about this marriage.

388
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,800
Then don't get married.

389
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,800
Hey Ran.

390
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,760
I'm telling the truth.

391
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,520
If you see it as a fake marriage then don't get married.

392
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,760
I feel uncomfortable having to pretend to be this fake couple.

393
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,360
I will call our moms.

394
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,680
And tell them

395
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,760
that we will break off the marriage.

396
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,840
Where are you going troublemaker?

397
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,960
Come here.

398
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,160
Come talk to me first.

399
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,440
Go ahead.

400
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,680
What?

401
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,440
If you have any to tell me,

402
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,120
tell me all of that.

403
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,520
All of them.

404
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,400
Which one do you want me to start?

405
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,120
Job?

406
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,520
Or my beautiful friend?

407
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,280
But I think…

408
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,920
It's about my friend huh?

409
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,480
Are you crazy?

410
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,560
About your work first.

411
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,840
Speak.

412
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,920
Fine.

413
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,720
I got the job as a waiter at the bar.

414
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,880
And about my friend.

415
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,200
She is my childhood friend.

416
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,600
We just met again recently.

417
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,040
You have a crush on her?

418
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,440
If you like her…

419
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,440
Well

420
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,600
It might be a bit difficult.

421
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,320
Because there's another person that also has a crush on my friend.

422
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,960
Who the hell is that person?

423
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,760
You don't know.

424
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,160
About this crush thing.

425
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,000
You have to try harder ok?

426
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,280
Keep going.

427
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,720
Don't worry about me.

428
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,040
I won't lose to that man.

429
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,400
At ease my friend.

430
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,200
Yeah yeah.

431
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,360
And about you.

432
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:03,920
How is it going?

433
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,960
About the place to stay.

434
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,280
Have you found it yet?

435
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,120
No, I haven't.

436
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,840
And what are you going to do?

437
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,880
You have to move out tomorrow.

438
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,160
You haven't packed anything yet.

439
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,680
What you gonna do?

440
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,680
How about this?

441
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,760
If you really don't have a place to stay,

442
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,480
you can come stay at my house first.

443
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,240
My room is a bit small.

444
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,040
But it's livable.

445
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:29,920
And about your belongings.

446
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,200
You can take leave it at my house first.

447
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,400
Ok?

448
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,960
I'm ok.

449
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,800
I will be able to find a place to stay for tonight.

450
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,200
And about my belongings.

451
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,080
I only take clothes.

452
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,480
And necessary stuffs.

453
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,320
What isn't important I will leave it here.

454
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,040
Up to you then.

455
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,560
But if you have no place to stay,

456
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,280
you can come live with me.

457
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,680
Thank you.

458
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,560
Don't mention it.

459
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,360
Everything is good.

460
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,520
It's fine.

461
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,280
Hey.

462
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,880
Will you let me start working?

463
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,080
Where is my uniform?

464
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,440
Start working what?

465
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,240
What?

466
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,320
Don't tell me that…

467
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,840
You won't take responsibility for me?

468
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,600
I'm yours now.

469
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,920
You have to accept me.

470
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,080
I'm not even sure if we really made love that night.

471
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,880
I was drunk and slept like a log.

472
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,200
Therefore,

473
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,400
I won't take any responsibility.

474
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,400
What? How?

475
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,040
You got me and then acted like this?

476
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,120
No, I can't stand it.

477
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,520
I'm not someone you could just hooked up with.

478
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,200
I was being abused.

479
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,600
Yeah?

480
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,600
Yes.

481
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,640
See? You kiss me back.

482
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,040
I'm the one who's being oppressed.

483
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,080
The hell? You can't be serious.

484
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,720
Of course I can.

485
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,080
Poom.

486
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,360
Kin.

487
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,800
You remember me?

488
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,040
I'm glad.

489
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,160
Yes.

490
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:28,800
Well, I

491
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,800
was thinking about calling you,

492
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,560
since the first time we met.

493
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,480
But

494
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,400
My phone broke down first

495
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,560
Oh I see.

496
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,200
Just a minute.

497
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,840
I will take to you later.

498
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,280
So where are we now?

499
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,920
Will you hire me as a waiter?

500
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,760
Do you need any drinks, Sir?

501
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,760
Oh.

502
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,040
That's a good idea.

503
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,760
What is the menu here?

504
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,120
Oh.

505
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,160
Our bar

506
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,920
will serve the drinks according to the customer moods.

507
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,120
May I ask what is your mood like at the moment?

508
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,240
My feelings…

509
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,640
Going to be…

510
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,880
Excited and happy

511
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,400
glad that I have met someone again.

512
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,640
Just a moment please.

513
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,800
I will serve it to you.

514
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,000
You.

515
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,680
Patrick.

516
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,160
So what's the conclusion?

517
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,720
Patrick.

518
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,040
Hey!

519
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:28,800
Poom.

520
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,240
Are you looking for a job?

521
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,880
If you're interested,

522
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,760
I have the new open company.

523
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,000
Your drink is here, Sir.

524
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,000
Thanks.

525
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:40,520
Oh

526
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,960
About the job, Poom.

527
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,520
Excuse me Sir.

528
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,880
I already hired Poom.

529
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,080
Are you serious?

530
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,680
Yes.

531
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,680
Oh another thing.

532
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,280
Well..

533
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,600
In this bar

534
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,240
do you have any free room for renting?

535
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,320
Now

536
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,440
I have to move out of my rental house.

537
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,200
So I will ask your permission to let me sleep at the bar

538
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,480
And about the fee.

539
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,640
You can deduct it from my salary.

540
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,680
The free room here?

541
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:14,000
Unfortunately, none are available.

542
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,880
Oh about that Poom. How about-

543
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,640
You come stay with me.

544
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,720
Well we have slept together before.

545
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,280
O-only sleeping.

546
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,080
Last night I was drunk.

547
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:28,520
What?

548
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,200
You said that we made love.

549
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,400
Stop that.

550
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,200
We did what?

551
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,040
Well.

552
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,400
You said that already

553
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,840
That I can stay with you.

554
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,920
Here.

555
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,400
We have Kin as a witness as well.

556
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:41,960
Once you promise

557
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,480
Don't break it

558
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,920
What if

559
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,200
the owner of the store breaks his words?

560
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,480
I definitely didn't break my word.

561
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,640
You can rest assured.

562
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:01,920
So

563
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,680
I think

564
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,960
I'd like to go sit at the table first.

565
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,440
Mr.Poom

566
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,120
Would you like to sit at the table together?

567
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,560
Sure

568
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,600
Good!

569
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,120
You told that we already hooked up.

570
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,600
So why are you still going out with other people?

571
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,680
Alright

572
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,160
I'll teach him a good lesson!

573
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,800
If I knew that Mr. Poom was looking for a job.

574
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,400
I'd have invited Mr. Poom to come work with me from the first day.

575
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,320
What a pity.

576
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,640
If my phone hadn't died,

577
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,080
we'd have talked.

578
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,240
Thank you very much.

579
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,440
Do you come here often?

580
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,000
Oh!

581
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,880
Not at all.

582
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,240
I just saw the review

583
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,320
so I came to see it.

584
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,760
The vibe is so good.

585
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,880
I think after this,

586
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,080
I'll have to come often.

587
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,880
Do you like it that much?

588
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,080
I like it so much.

589
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,920
I'm sorry.

590
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,400
I've to ask for my new employee first.

591
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,800
I'm going to teach his work a bit.

592
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,120
What's wrong with you?

593
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,000
You just accepted him today.

594
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Do you want me to start work now?

595
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,720
I've accepted him since yesterday.

596
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,160
If you'll excuse me

597
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,080
Come on

598
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,800
Hey!

599
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,360
Hey!

600
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,160
What's wrong with you?

601
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,200
I don't like.

602
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,640
What don't you like?

603
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,440
About what you did.

604
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,240
Did what?

605
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,040
So you talked to that guy.

606
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,560
So why can't I talk?

607
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,560
You told that we already hooked up.

608
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,280
I don't like you messing with other people.

609
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,520
Hey, don't tell me

610
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,360
Are you serious about our relationship?

611
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,800
Hey!

612
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,800
Of course

613
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,000
With other people,

614
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,080
just wake up and separate.

615
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,840
But you keep chasing after me

616
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,040
messing me around

617
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,120
When you meet another man, do you act like this?

618
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,120
I feel like I'm being insulted.

619
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,160
Do you get it?

620
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,720
So

621
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,120
Are you jealous of me?

622
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:44,760
Why do I have to be jealous?

623
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,560
I'm not jealous.

624
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,920
I just feel like I'm being insulted.

625
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,040
You treat me like a toy.

626
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,160
What's wrong with you?

627
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,640
I'm totally confused.

628
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,360
You don't have to understand.

629
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,320
Let's just say

630
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,520
I don't like what you did.

631
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,240
Then I'll have the waiter come and teach your work.

632
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,120
Concentrate!

633
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:05,720
Bro!

634
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,720
Can you teach him some work?

635
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,200
Concentrate!

636
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,640
Is this place?

637
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:32,280
The bartender that the girls crazy about.

638
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,080
I heard that

639
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,160
if I want a drink,

640
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:39,080
I've to order it according to the mood?

641
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,160
You

642
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,880
Are you really going to let me drink blood?

643
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,120
Right!

644
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,520
Please!

645
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,280
Please! Accept me

646
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,240
But

647
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,840
But I'd like some red wine

648
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,560
every 15 days. Is that possible?

649
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,240
Peek-a-boo

650
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,640
How did you get in here?

651
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,280
How did I get in doesn't matter.

652
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,640
The matter thing is

653
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,360
will you hire me to work or not?

654
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,680
All right.

655
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,000
It's probably time.

656
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,240
Now we have investigated

657
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,960
and found something.

658
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,600
The rest had to go in ambush to make sure.

659
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,560
it was really the children who had escaped or not.

660
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,960
Go and arrest those vampires

661
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,840
and definitely don't kill them.

662
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,120
But General Lux said that

663
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,400
if they don't let them be arrested

664
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,040
then they can be killed.

665
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,320
Those vampires

666
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,960
were just child vampires.

667
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,480
If we are caught then

668
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,560
we'll be punished as normal.

669
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,840
Understand?

670
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,320
I understand.

671
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,200
Then you all can go separate and get to work.

672
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,000
Lieutenant Nikky, please stay

673
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,360
I think

674
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,880
it's too close, Captain.

675
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:28,480
Too close?

676
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,040
Just a little more and you'll kiss my cheek.

677
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,040
Your body smells good.

678
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,280
Do you use human city perfume as well?

679
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,200
Yes.

680
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,640
It really smells good.

681
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:43,080
Captain, try sniffing me

682
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,600
Really good!

683
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,800
I guess I'll have to find some to use.

684
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,160
But

685
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,400
Captain, let me stay

686
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,880
Is there something wrong?

687
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,360
I've work for you to do.

688
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,200
About Mr. Wichan

689
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,320
Mr. Wichan?

690
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,600
Evil vampire

691
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,400
who rebelled

692
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,520
and wanted to take over the vampire city?

693
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,480
Umm

694
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,520
But

695
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,440
He's already been killed.

696
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,520
I think he's not dead yet.

697
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,560
But it may be escaping in a human city

698
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,800
with the help of General Lux.

699
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,600
Don't tell me, General Lux...

700
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,800
I don't know about that,

701
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,360
but it's your duty

702
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,920
to capture Mr. Wichan

703
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:47,080
in order to know the truth.

704
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,560
And you must do this as quietly as possible.

705
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,160
This is known

706
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,200
to only the two of us.

707
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,200
It's probably just the two of us who know

708
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,560
if it's this close.

709
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,560
Is it close again?

710
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,080
Shouldn't really ask that

711
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,240
I understand.

712
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,120
If you'll excuse me, Captain

713
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,680
Captain also smells good.

714
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,040
What's the emergency

715
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,760
between you two calling me?

716
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,120
See

717
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,160
We

718
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:50,280
are going to a meditation retreat.

719
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,440
Yes.

720
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,640
Here we ask the Luangpoh to come out

721
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:56,280
and then we've to go back.

722
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,760
We apologize,

723
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,960
but we've a really urgent matter.

724
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,960
What's going on?

725
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,360
Look at the both of your faces.

726
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,040
It doesn't look good.

727
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,800
Are you quarreling or not?

728
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,960
Right!

729
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,600
Is there something wrong?

730
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,640
We..

731
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,360
We've already decided

732
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,840
not to get married.

733
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,800
Why?

734
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:27,160
Why, what happened?

735
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,080
Right!

736
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,640
What happened?

737
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,880
Me..

738
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,320
Me and Zen

739
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,040
Two of us..

740
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,600
We won't have a Christian marriage.

741
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,800
But we'll have a Thai wedding instead.

742
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,120
Hewh!

743
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,920
What a relief!

744
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,320
I was completely shocked.

745
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,800
thought that you weren't really going to get married.

746
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,960
Yes.

747
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,040
If you want to have any kind of marriage,

748
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,400
just do it.

749
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,680
Don't tell us.

750
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,440
No matter what,

751
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:57,120
we're ready to support you fully.

752
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,320
Yes.

753
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,520
That's all.

754
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,440
So

755
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,240
We'll go back first.

756
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,040
We're going to a meditation retreat.

757
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:06,560
Okay

758
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,320
See you

759
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,320
Yes.

760
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,960
Love each other well.

761
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,800
Don't let me worry.

762
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,640
Yes.

763
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:17,840
Right goes thus

764
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:20,920
Left goes thus

765
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:23,680
Right goes thus

766
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,760
Left goes thus

767
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,520
What are you playing?

768
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,360
What am I playing?

769
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,080
I'm not playing.

770
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,320
I'm serious.

771
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,400
This isn't funny.

772
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,600
So you see me laughing?

773
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,080
Zen

774
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,400
What do you want?

775
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,480
When I got married to you,

776
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,840
you weren't okay with it.

777
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,160
If I don't get married,

778
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,360
you won't be okay with it.

779
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,800
I said I was serious.

780
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,760
If you're getting married because of the owner of the body.

781
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,240
I think you don't have to get married.

782
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,600
I said I was serious.

783
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,840
I want to marry you.

784
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,080
You know,

785
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,880
I stayed up all night wondering

786
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,200
about whether I really would marry you

787
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,160
or if it was because of these two bodies.

788
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,120
But in the end,

789
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,360
I got the answer that

790
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,800
I really want to marry you.

791
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,080
I

792
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,120
don't know

793
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,240
what..

794
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,520
the reason is.

795
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,880
If you want to smile, just smile!

796
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,760
Who smiles?

797
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:12,960
What are you doing?

798
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,720
Hey, what is this?

799
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,080
Calm down!

800
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,240
What's wrong with you?

801
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,040
What is this?

802
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:20,760
You don't have to come near me.

803
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,920
I just bought this one.

804
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,320
Here

805
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,200
Has my shop become

806
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,920
their flirting arena?

807
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,200
Right!

808
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,880
Will my shop be destroyed?

809
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:30,720
What if

810
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,240
those two people

811
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,320
go crazy?

812
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,000
Right!

813
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,080
I'm stressed.

814
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,280
Don't be stressed.

815
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:41,680
I

816
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,720
I'm not stressed at...

817
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,320
the two of them are fighting.

818
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,960
But I'm stressed

819
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,560
because I'm so beautiful.

820
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,960
Hmmm.

821
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,200
Yeahh

822
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,640
If you're very beautiful, go clear it up yourself.

823
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,200
We're going to work.

824
00:40:59,200 --> 00:40:59,840
Hey!

825
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,440
Hey! You guys!

826
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,520
Came back to help me first.

827
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,760
Oh, you can help yourself.

828
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,560
Go!!

829
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,200
Shake your hair into your eyes.

830
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:10,920
What!

831
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:12,800
Hey

832
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,160
Jolie

833
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:13,880
Jolie

834
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,680
Jolie

835
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,080
please accept my bouquet.

836
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:18,880
It's better to get mine.

837
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:19,840
Jolie

838
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,600
So huge!

839
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,840
Bigger than him.

840
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,760
Ummm

841
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,120
I haven't received it yet.

842
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,720
If

843
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:42,200
Jolie took from one of us,

844
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,200
it would be like accepting love for that person.

845
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,240
But

846
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,720
If you accept both of us,

847
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,200
it also doesn't look good.

848
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,120
Let's just say

849
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:49,600
we..

850
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,240
take a look for a while first.

851
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,400
Jolie

852
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,240
And

853
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:07,160
what about we're going to eat Raw Beef with Spicy Sauce?

854
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:07,640
Are you okay with this?

855
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:07,800
Heyy

856
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,840
Do you want to go today?

857
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,280
Who wants to eat with you?

858
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,040
Here

859
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:11,800
Jolie

860
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,600
If Jolie likes to eat raw things

861
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,680
I'll take Jolie to eat spicy salad with herb and blood right away.

862
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:16,840
spicy salad with herb and blood?

863
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:17,400
Yes

864
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:20,040
Does Jolie like to eat spicy salad with herb and blood?

865
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,720
I like to drink blood.

866
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,200
I like

867
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,680
to choose food.

868
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:27,440
Stuff like this

869
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,960
I don't eat it.

870
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,640
I'm afraid of blood.

871
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,680
Just seeing the blood makes me faint.

872
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:33,800
Just thinking about this

873
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,320
makes my head dizzy.

874
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:37,400
Here

875
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:38,720
What is it?

876
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:39,480
Medicine for fainting.

877
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:41,320
Medicine for fainting?

878
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,200
Thank you

879
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,040
Hey

880
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:46,640
Smell it.

881
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,680
It has to smell

882
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:51,880
Just kidding.

883
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:53,360
I just want to be beautiful

884
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:55,040
and funny too.

885
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:58,000
Oh!

886
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,160
Right!

887
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,920
What person will take inhaler?

888
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,920
Why did you bring me to your room?

889
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:18,640
Ah!

890
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,520
Well, you have to come stay here with me.

891
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,120
Stay, Right!!

892
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:25,120
But...Don't you have another room?

893
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,400
You haven't noticed, right?

894
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,880
My condo has only one bedroom.

895
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:35,200
So

896
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:36,040
I...

897
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,320
I can sleep on the sofa.

898
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:41,200
What are you going to do?

899
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,080
Let me go.

900
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:44,320
Why?

901
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:44,920
Hmm?

902
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
That you don't dare sleep with me.

903
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:48,800
Actually,

904
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,120
we didn't hook up each other, right?

905
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:51,840
You're just fooling me.

906
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,200
I'm not fooling

907
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,480
If we've really already hooked up.

908
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:03,680
Then

909
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:04,960
you must dare to sleep with me.

910
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,280
Dare.

911
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,560
At first,

912
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:09,720
I was just

913
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,200
empathy foy you.

914
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,280
I really

915
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,840
want to sleep with you.

916
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:17,240
It's weird,

917
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:19,440
It's like you're trying to cover me up with a lie.

918
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,400
Actually, we didn't hook up each other, right?

919
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:36,840
Stop talking now.

920
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:37,960
Come

921
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:39,360
Help me clear up first.

922
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:44,080
Where do you put it?

923
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,240
Come, put it here.

924
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:57,360
Hey

925
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:00,200
It's so messy

926
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:01,360
Please help me clear it.

927
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:09,040
Ouch!

928
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:10,880
What are you doing?

929
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:13,240
Heyy!

930
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:15,840
You

931
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:16,840
What are you doing?

932
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:18,640
What

933
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:24,920
Do you want it?

934
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:25,720
Hmm!

935
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:27,440
Do you want it?

936
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:30,840
Come on!

937
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:33,840
Enogh!

938
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:34,640
Stop it!

939
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:43,520
Put it more!

940
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:45,440
Put it more!

941
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:46,520
Enogh!

942
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:47,680
Put it more!

943
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:52,360
Is it good?

944
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:01,800
Is it good?

945
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:07,120
Eat it!

946
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:09,960
Be careful, it's hot.

947
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,080
Or is it edible?

948
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:43,680
Oh!!

949
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:56,480
Is it delicious?

950
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:17,840
Thank you everyone very much.

951
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:18,880
Let's meet

952
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,400
tomorrow.

953
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:21,200
Anyway

954
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,720
I hope everyone enjoys it.

955
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:40,960
What is this?

956
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:43,600
Well

957
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,480
Looked into your eyes and didn't blink at all.

958
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:47,440
How?

959
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:48,400
How?

960
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,560
I heard news that this person

961
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:52,160
took him back to sleep with him, right?

962
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,360
Are you serious?

963
00:47:58,120 --> 00:47:58,880
Ummm

964
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:02,360
I think

965
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:04,640
It's time for me to open up.

966
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:06,280
Geez!!

967
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:07,760
The tiger has taken off its teeth and claws.

968
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:09,800
Are you sure?

969
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:12,920
I can't answer.

970
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:15,560
He looks like

971
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:16,720
he has something.

972
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:18,880
It's a sign that

973
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:20,000
this is

974
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,360
the right person.

975
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:26,040
But I'm still not sure.

976
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:27,560
I have to prove it more.

977
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:29,920
That this person

978
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:31,360
is the person I'm really waiting for.

979
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:33,640
confused

980
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:34,680
I don't get it.

981
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,200
But anyway

982
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,040
I see you are in love.

983
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,680
I'm pleased too.

984
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:42,240
Let's go.

985
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:43,720
I'm rooting for you.

986
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,480
I've just talked about me.

987
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:47,600
What about yours?

988
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:52,880
After saying that, I'm bored.

989
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,160
I have a rival

990
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,760
who is your boyfriend's friend.

991
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:56,600
Wait!

992
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:58,800
boyfriend’s

993
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,000
friend?

994
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:00,680
Yes

995
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:01,560
Right!

996
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:05,320
Not yet a boyfriend

997
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:07,360
Just looking at each other.

998
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,480
Well, that's it.

999
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:11,080
Your boyfriend's friend

1000
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:12,800
He ended up liking Jolie like me.

1001
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:14,560
But let me tell you,

1002
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:17,320
I'll never give up on it.

1003
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:18,720
How?

1004
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:21,240
I've to win Jolie's heart.

1005
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:49,720
Zen

1006
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:53,560
Zen

1007
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:57,000
What?

1008
00:49:57,840 --> 00:49:59,280
Sleeping on the floor

1009
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:00,280
causes back pain?

1010
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:02,480
Just a little bit.

1011
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:04,720
I told you to take turns sleeping.

1012
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,040
You don't believe me.

1013
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:09,720
It's okay.

1014
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:10,680
I can bear it.

1015
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:21,800
let's sleep together!

1016
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:27,360
What mood is this?

1017
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:28,720
Not any mood at all.

1018
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:30,160
Well,

1019
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:30,840
when we get married,

1020
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:33,000
we have to sleep together, right?

1021
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:34,880
Are you going to sleep on the floor?

1022
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:52,080
Why would you bring a blanket up here?

1023
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:55,000
Roughly

1024
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,280
Wear the same blanket!

1025
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:58,480
It's weird, today.

1026
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:00,400
Not weird!

1027
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:01,160
Hurry and sleep.

1028
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:30,480
What are you doing?

1029
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:32,600
Don't speak.

1030
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:02,240
Where have you gone?

1031
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:06,320
Why are you following me?

1032
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:09,000
What following?

1033
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,440
I drove the car and got lost.

1034
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:11,880
What have you lost?

1035
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:14,640
I really lost

1036
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,280
I just came here for the first time.

1037
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:17,680
Do you think that if you get lost in this area,

1038
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:19,240
you can easily go back?

1039
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:25,280
Hey!!

1040
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:25,800
Stop!

1041
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:31,800
Are you okay?

1042
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:39,880
How are you doing?

1043
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:41,600
I'm sorry, Captain.

1044
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,120
I couldn't keep up with them.

1045
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:44,920
Let it be like that.

1046
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:46,800
It's time to unwind.

1047
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:49,680
I think it must be the work of Mr. Wichan.

1048
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:51,680
I remember their faces

1049
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:54,480
Let's go

1050
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:55,560
It's time to rest.

1051
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:56,600
I'll drive myself.

1052
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:17,200
The location here is really good.

1053
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:19,360
I'll take it here.

1054
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:22,080
Those two people

1055
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:23,120
are the shop owners.

1056
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:27,360
Go make arrangements to buy it.

1057
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,720
If they don't sell it, sir.

1058
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:40,040
If they don't sell,

1059
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:41,760
easy!

1060
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:44,240
Kill them!

1061
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,200
Patrick

1062
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:55,600
Chin!

1063
00:53:58,240 --> 00:53:59,440
Congratulation!

1064
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:01,920
I wish your business

1065
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:02,920
to be prosperous.

1066
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:04,400
thank you very much

1067
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:07,440
And what about your clothing store?

1068
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:08,480
Can you sell it?

1069
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:10,400
Sure!

1070
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:11,800
I'd like to ask permission

1071
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:14,280
to take a look around the shop first.

1072
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:15,520
Here this way

1073
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:17,720
Here it is, our Warrix

1074
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:20,800
There are many styles of clothing to choose from.

1075
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:21,520
Here it will be

1076
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:22,600
Polo shirts.

1077
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:23,960
There are many different colors.

1078
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:24,800
I'd like to recommend

1079
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,520
this t-shirt with our shop's pattern.

1080
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:28,320
This is not an ordinary t-shirt,

1081
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:29,840
this is a fashion t-shirt

1082
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:31,560
with many different designs.

1083
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:32,800
It's not finished yet.

1084
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:33,640
Here it is.

1085
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:35,360
I'd like to recommend

1086
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:36,480
This one

1087
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:37,280
Here!

1088
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:37,880
Warrix

1089
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:39,760
Comba+ Cool

1090
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:41,400
The fabric is breathable

1091
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:42,600
and cool to wear.

1092
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:44,920
It fits perfectly with the weather in Thailand.

1093
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:45,720
Patrick

1094
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,200
It's beautiful.

1095
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:48,920
Here

1096
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:49,960
I'll give it to you.

1097
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:50,440
Well

1098
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:51,040
try it!

1099
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:53,000
I'll add one more.

1100
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:53,920
Sure.

1101
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:54,800
For you!

1102
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:55,840
I can give it to you

1103
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:56,280
here!

1104
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:57,320
Samon, please take care of it.

1105
00:54:58,080 --> 00:54:59,840
Oh!!

1106
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:01,640
Wear our t-shirt

1107
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:03,000
look so handsome!

1108
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,480
Are you comfortable?

1109
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:05,400
So fine

1110
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:06,200
Wear it like..

1111
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:07,360
Okay, it's not hot at all.

1112
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:09,640
I told you that it suits the weather in Thailand

1113
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:11,320
The shape is also great.

1114
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:12,280
Here you are!

1115
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:13,680
2 shirts

1116
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:15,560
Here

1117
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:16,240
See you at the bar.

1118
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:17,200
See you.
