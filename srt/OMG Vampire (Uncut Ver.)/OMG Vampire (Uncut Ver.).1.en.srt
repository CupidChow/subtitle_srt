I love you too

3
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,920
Ten

4
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,760
Nine

5
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,600
Eight

6
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,360
Seven

7
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,200
Six

8
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,040
Five

9
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:24,800
Four

10
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,520
Three

11
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,120
Two

12
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:26,720
One

13
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,920
Welcome back my friend.

14
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,760
Poom

15
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,360
Nothing

16
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,240
Aghh!

17
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,200
Where is Poom?!

18
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,800
His body is gone!

19
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,760
Somebody stole  his body

20
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,080
To where?

21
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,000
This isn't good.

22
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,800
We must inform the governor.

23
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:47,720
The governor

24
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,400
Let's go.

25
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,200
Surprise!

26
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,520
Haa! you guys got tricked by me.

27
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,680
Poom!

28
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,440
Oh my.

29
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,360
Poom, my dear friend.

30
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,320
Where have you been?

31
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,040
Or

32
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,760
You have invisibility power?

33
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,080
Can you teach us?

34
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,120
I want ability to vanish into thin air.

35
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,560
Hey!

36
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,000
Don't be silly.

37
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,440
Who would be able to do that?

38
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,480
We're vampires.

39
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,320
Not ghosts.

40
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:12,880
And...

41
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,760
vampires aren't ghost?

42
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,560
Yeah....

43
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,520
Vampires are also ghosts.

44
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,160
Well we..

45
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,840
Pff, ok ghosts but we can't disappear.

46
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,000
Come on, you guys stop arguing.

47
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,080
You want to sleep for another century?

48
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,760
Yet still argruing?

49
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,000
Don't complain us.

50
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,720
You get out of the coffin first.

51
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,160
Or

52
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,720
You want to sleep for another century?

53
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,040
No.

54
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,600
Let's close the coffin.

55
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,880
Hey! hey! calm down

56
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,160
I'm just kidding.

57
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,640
Come, let's go.

58
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,840
For friend who came back from deep slumber.

59
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,960
Come.

60
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,320
Cheer!

61
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,040
Wait for a second.

62
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,200
I'll be right back.

63
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,640
Ohh.

64
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,000
You guys are suspicious.

65
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,440
Who suspicious?

66
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,600
No one.

67
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,240
No one, i just..forgot something.

68
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,400
Don't tell me..

69
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,000
You stole from your father again?

70
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,920
Yes.

71
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,280
Hey! you all grown ma-

72
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,520
Stop complaining Jolie.

73
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,400
You always like this.

74
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,480
Hey

75
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,080
let's go drinking outside.

76
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:40,800
I don't want to listen to her complaining.

77
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,280
Ow!

78
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:45,760
Ow!

79
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,960
That's a good one.

80
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,920
Well Jolie...

81
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,120
I had been sleeping for 100 years.

82
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,000
You guys still don't have lovers?

83
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,920
Nah, we don't.

84
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:02,960
why?

85
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,000
Oh, don't tell me that...

86
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,040
You all are insensitive about love?

87
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,320
Insensitive what?

88
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,800
It's the governor who makes the rule.

89
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,360
That forbid Gen X vampires like us.

90
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,160
From having a lover or loving each other.

91
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:14,920
And why is that?

92
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,320
Well, for the population controling.

93
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,880
What? forbid vampires from loving?

94
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,800
That's unfair.

95
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,800
And what are you gonna do about it?

96
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,760
If someone breaks the rule,

97
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,960
They will be imprisoned in human land till death.

98
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,280
So, that's mean..

99
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,760
If it's man and man, it's fine?

100
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,360
Because no population increasing.

101
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,560
No, men love is much worse

102
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,880
If being caught,

103
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,360
Their skin and flesh will be slashed.

104
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,360
And will be imprison in the sun at human land.

105
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:42,920
Gosh!

106
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,000
the punishment is much worse than straight one.

107
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,120
I will never accept this.

108
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,600
I believe in love.

109
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,320
I will love.

110
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,080
Love is a beautiful thing.

111
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,280
Would it be possible

112
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,560
If we live without love?

113
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,640
Are you still believing in love?

114
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,640
Wasn't it because of love

115
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,360
That made you became a vampire?

116
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,560
Hey..

117
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,600
I'm sorry.

118
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,880
Don't be sorry.

119
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,080
What you said it's right.

120
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,480
Because of him.

121
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,680
That made me became a vampire.

122
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,520
Mmmm.

123
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,600
Mmmm.

124
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,000
let's exchange.

125
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,480
Welcome the new vampire member.

126
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,200
You were right.

127
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,960
Love makes me becomes this.

128
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,080
He tricked me to love him with all my heart.

129
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,960
So, he could drink the blood of the person he loves.

130
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,680
And, becomes human.

131
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,640
I still remember.

132
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,440
The first day that you came to vampire's land.

133
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,400
You were frantic.

134
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,000
Kept shouting that you didn't want to be a vampire.

135
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:13,240
We had to sooth you for a while.

136
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,120
Well

137
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,600
I couldn't accept it.

138
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,880
But, I was lucky.

139
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,360
That Charles and Anne adoped me.

140
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,120
But you couldn't forget you lover.

141
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,480
So, you decided to sleep for 100 years.

142
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,840
Left us waiting!

143
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,160
But I can say that

144
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,520
Sleeping doesn't help erese him.

145
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,760
I woke up and still remember everything.

146
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,600
Come on.

147
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,080
Stop being drama.

148
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,600
Let's have fun.

149
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,640
Here.

150
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,560
Don't tell me.

151
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,520
Toad blood.

152
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,560
Let's get drunk!

153
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,880
Gosh

154
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,280
burning my throat this much

155
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,680
Must be an old toad blood.

156
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,560
Well

157
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,600
if we're going to get drunk, we must go all the way.

158
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,160
Those three are just for kids.

159
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,320
Couldn't compare to our old toad blood.

160
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,520
Stop!

161
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,880
You have to wait  for our son.

162
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:49,920
All these prepared foods are for our son welcomimg.

163
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,120
If you don stop complain,

164
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,720
And get wrinkles.

165
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,840
I can't help you with that.

166
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:56,960
Oh my god!

167
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,760
My face has wrinkles already?

168
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,840
Oh no no.. this is not good.

169
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,040
Alright today

170
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,760
I will have to do Piranha's blood injection.

171
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,080
To lift my face up.

172
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,800
Your face is already beautiful.

173
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,120
You don't need that.

174
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,520
Hmm, you don't have to pretend.

175
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,680
The reason why, you don't want me to to that.

176
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,320
Because it's expensive right?

177
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,440
Just a few needles.

178
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,440
That is not true.

179
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,760
What? Are you complaining?

180
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,480
No, nothing.

181
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,440
Father.

182
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,000
Mother.

183
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,320
Son.

184
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,400
Welcome home my dear son.

185
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,520
Yes, mother.

186
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,400
Had been sleeping for a century.

187
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,480
Doesn't need anymore sleep, I guess.

188
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,960
Come on, father.

189
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,520
Stop teasing our son.

190
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,880
Come, let's enjoy the meal.Come, let's enjoy the meal.

191
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,400
Why are you looking at me like that?

192
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,800
Are there.. any wrinkles on my face?

193
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,000
No, not at all.

194
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,480
I just surprised that

195
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,800
Both of you don't get older.

196
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,960
How old are you guys?

197
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,200
800 years.

198
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,720
800 years, still looks young.

199
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,320
800 years, still looks young.

200
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,920
Vampires like us

201
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,040
When we reached the age of 700

202
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,720
Our faces will stop aging.

203
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,960
Older

204
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,280
But our faces remain the same.

205
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,280
Therefore, if you want to look young

206
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,000
You must take a very good care of yourselves.

207
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,920
Understand?

208
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,600
Once you reach the age of 700

209
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,160
Your face will look young forever.

210
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,680
Just like me.

211
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,000
When I was younger, I'm so pround

212
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,640
That I take a good care of myself.

213
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,160
I ate fruits.

214
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,360
And I also had vitamin C.

215
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,560
But, I mainly had fruits and did exercises.

216
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,360
Oh, and for drinking blood

217
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,040
Must drink 8 glasses per day.

218
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:48,760
If not,

219
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,480
You won't be beautiful like this.

220
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,880
Wow, the flowers are beautiful this year.

221
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,560
Both of you have a cup of tea first.

222
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,520
It's hot be careful.

223
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,480
Here.

224
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,520
Thank you, mother.

225
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,800
Where have you guys been?

226
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:26,200
We've been to the National Blood Association.

227
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,400
Yes.

228
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,600
Right now, blood is in short supply.

229
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,880
Because vampire's population increase.

230
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,440
The association suggests us to rise an animals at home.

231
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,520
So, we can consume their blood

232
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,320
Instead of consuming from the wild animals.

233
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,600
We have to let them reproduction first.

234
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,880
So, this is the reason why

235
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,280
"The governor forbids my vampire generation from love."

236
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,600
Yes.

237
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,840
But, I think it isn't fair for my generation.

238
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,800
Forbidding us from love?

239
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,520
Actually, me and your mom disagree.

240
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,680
But, the majority has already voted.

241
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,320
We have to obey.

242
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,120
The old generation of vampire..

243
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,600
I can't believe it.

244
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,360
They don't give a new Gen the right to choose.

245
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,560
Oh, don't be like that dear.

246
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,920
Calm down.

247
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,840
Father.

248
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,840
Mother.

249
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,240
If I want to go to the human land,

250
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,360
What do I have to do?

251
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:32,480
Well, you want to go there because

252
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,720
Of love?

253
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,360
It's just a part of it.

254
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,360
But, I just miss the town I've left.

255
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,560
I don't know what would it be now.

256
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,440
I think it isn't much different from when you've left.

257
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,200
"Because 100 years for us are only 3 years in human's land."

258
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,200
And one more thing, son.

259
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,960
Going to their land

260
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,480
Isn't easy.

261
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,240
Because our land and their land are parallel.

262
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,320
In their land

263
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:06,560
Also has another person that looks just like you.

264
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,600
That person

265
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,720
Has to be decease

266
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,920
So that you could do there and replace his place.

267
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,400
So....

268
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,240
I have to live in his body?

269
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,120
Yes.

270
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,800
If he doesn't pass away,

271
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,240
You can't go down there.

272
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,840
And, how could we know

273
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,960
When will he pass away?

274
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,680
You have to check in the Book of Life

275
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,120
In the town's library.

276
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,040
And, sign your name stating your intention

277
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,680
That you willing to go to the human's world.

278
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:35,960
However,

279
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,960
vampires that allowed to go to the
human's world must be 500 years old or more.

280
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,520
Now you are 300 years old.

281
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,080
You must wait another 200 years.

282
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,040
Just a little bit more.

283
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,760
What if..

284
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,600
My parallel body

285
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,760
Die before I reach the age of 500?

286
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,960
Then I couldn't go to the human world?

287
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,000
Human world

288
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:05,200
Hey! hey! everyone comeback!

289
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:09,080
Oh come on! it's Patrick again.

290
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,520
I don't have to sing tonight yeah?

291
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,960
Good!

292
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,520
At least I get paid.

293
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,080
Good! Very good!

294
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,160
Sing

295
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,240
I want to hear.

296
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,880
Yes.

297
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,400
Yes.

298
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,360
Hello, ladies.

299
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,520

300
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:13,880
Me! Me! Me!

301
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,600
Alright, please tell me what your mood is.

302
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,120
My mood now

303
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,280
It's like

304
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,200
I'm seeing my true love right in front of me.

305
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:25,560
Of course.

306
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,240
Here it is.

307
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,680
A drink for a beautiful lady

308
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,960
Who found her true love.

309
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,760
And for my mood right now

310
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,280
It's like I meet my groom

311
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,240
Who will ask me to marry him.

312
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,920
Of course.

313
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,360
Here it is.

314
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,040
A drink for my bride.

315
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,240
Can I have one please?

316
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,760
Please. Please.

317
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,640
Can I sit here?

318
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:33,200
Why those women have to tell their emotions to him?

319
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,400
Oh

320
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,320
Well, when you walked in

321
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,720
You didn't notice

322
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,720
That our bar

323
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,080
Doesn't have a drink menu?

324
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,600
Well, this is our signature.

325
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,760
Just tell your moods

326
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,640
Or feelings

327
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,520
And, he will make a drink according to your moods.

328
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,360
Cool isn't it?

329
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,320
Then my drink would be very bitter.

330
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,320
Bitter?

331
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,320
Oh!

332
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,880

341
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,360
Yes, not funny

342
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,040
What's Soi Ju, Jaew khom

343
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,440
Well, we can change the topic.

344
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,240
No.

345
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,680
Sitting still is funnier.

346
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,520
Not carving Soi Ju?

347
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,840
let's drink in silent.

348
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,880
Ok

349
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,320
I warn you.

350
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,000
To stop that.

351
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,440
I came this far.

352
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,440
I warn you.

353
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,520
Don't make me be cruel.

354
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,600
Are you threaten me?

355
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,680
I'm not scare of you.

356
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,480
I warned you.

357
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:36,840
How was that?

358
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,200
Ok, I'm leaving.

359
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,520
Go ahead

360
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,160
Damn it, not in the mood anymore.

361
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,840
Hey guys

362
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,480
I have a question.

363
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,680
You guys don't want to try living in the human world?

364
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,560
Well..

365
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,760
I used to consider it.

366
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,680
But, I think

367
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,600
We are all happy staying here in vampire land.

368
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,560
Hmm..

369
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,000
Let's go straight to the point.

370
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,680
You guys don't want to be in love?

371
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,160
Living lives like a free teenagers?

372
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,160
We do.

373
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,600
See?

374
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,560
Let me tell you something.

375
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,800
In their land

376
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:49,200
They live a life like full of freedom.

377
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,200
We can eat anything.

378
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,800
We can travel everywhere, do what we want, love
someone, get in to a relationship with anybody.

379
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,000
We can do all of that.

380
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,320
It is the best.

381
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,920
But, how could we go check the Book of Life?

382
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,600
The librarian won't let us do that.

383
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,440
We are underage.

384
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,280
Mix, was right.

385
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,440
well

386
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,480
how difficult is it going to be?

387
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,200
We just take the lizard blood

388
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,720
And make the librarian drink it.

389
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,440
When we command

390
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,000
They will follow it.

391
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,200
Hold on

392
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,160
And where could we find a lizard blood?

393
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:29,720
What?

394
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:30,760
Are you stupid? dude!

395
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,640
We're in the woods!

396
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,640
Let's go catch some lizards.

397
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:35,480
Go!

398
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,120
Stop it!

399
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,560
What?

400
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,840
Are you saying I'm stupid?

401
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,480
That lizard blood I'm talking about

402
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,960
has to be cooked.

403
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,800
So, it will work.

404
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,760
The blood of these bastard wild lizards,

405
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:53,840
when you eat it,

406
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,680
your hair will definitely change color.

407
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,400
Are you saying I'm stupid?

408
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:57,840
Take it!

409
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,280
Oh, double

410
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,640
Sorry, dude

411
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,000
Ouch!

412
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,440
I was wrong.

413
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,720
I forgive.

414
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,880
My head almost take off my shoulders.

415
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,800
Does that mean

416
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,160
we have to go get lizard blood

417
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,280
from a specialized blood bank?

418
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,800
Just thinking about it makes me hopeless.

419
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,960
Will the gate guard let us through easily?

420
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,720
I have a plan.

421
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,000
Come here!

422
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,800
The thing is....

423
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,680
Are you guys ready?

424
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,400
Wait!

425
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,960
I'd like to meditate first.

426
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:53,920
Ready?

427
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,600
Hey, I don't think that I can do it.

428
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,920
Umm, right!

429
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,640
Can we cancel it?

430
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,120
You guys

431
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,440
Listen!!

432
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,080
You can do it.

433
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,360
Your acting

434
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,040
is the best in this town.

435
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:14,880
Do you get it?

436
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,400
Believe in yourself

437
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,080
You can do it!

438
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,120
Come, I'm ready.

439
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,120
Please help me!!

440
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,880
Please help!!

441
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,440
Please help!!

442
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,120
Stop right there!

443
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,080
Don't follow me.

444
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:35,640
Where will you escape?

445
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,400
I can't escape.

446
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,400
Oh, I fell.

447
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,720
Can't escape anymore.

448
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,120
What should I do?

449
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:47,320
If it's me, I don't buy it.

450
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,000
Become ours now!

451
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,320
I'm going to rape you.

452
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,120
Yes

453
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,520
If you want to help, hurry and help me.

454
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:01,760
Is there anyone coming to help?

455
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,120
Oh, I'm really going to rape.

456
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,680
Don't do anything to me.

457
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,240
I'm willing to die.

458
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,280
I'm going to hold my breath to death.

459
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,800
If you want to play, go over there!

460
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,480
Annoyed, go!

461
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,320
Well, don't you believe this?

462
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,640
Acting so sucks like this.

463
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,600
Who will believe?

464
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:19,520
Go!

465
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:21,600
Damn

466
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,600
What's not good?

467
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,800
He can't reach our level of acting.

468
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,400
He just doesn't believe it.

469
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,040
Anyone who believes this is crazy.

470
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,360
Acting like shxt!

471
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,320
If it's me, I don't buy it.

472
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,040
well!

473
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,640
Hey, but Poom said we played so well.

474
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,280
well!

475
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,520
that's fine.

476
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,840
So well!

477
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,280
But it's better not to play.

478
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,000
Why does it have to be my skill?

479
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,720
You'll just wait and see.

480
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,040
I'll show you.

481
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,080
Mix

482
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:08,880
I'm sorry.

483
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,200
Run away quickly.

484
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,680
Hey, what is this?

485
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,520
Is this blood?

486
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,160
Oops, be careful.

487
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:34,840
Poom

488
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,400
You bastard!

489
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,000
Are you thinking of killing me?

490
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,720
Mix, you take it easy first.

491
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:44,440
I'm so sorry.

492
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,600
I didn't mean.

493
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,080
But you've just splashed blood on me.

494
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,360
You're thinking of killing me.

495
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,080
No

496
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,120
Alright, if you're thinking of killing me.

497
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,520
I'll kill you too.

498
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,280
Wait a sec! Poom

499
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,240
I'm choking on my saliva.

500
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,720
Well, my throat is completely dry.

501
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:17,640
So are you?

502
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,320
Yeah!

503
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,440
Hey, you guys

504
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,120
stop being idiot.

505
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,320
So, did you get any blood?

506
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,200
Here it is.

507
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,640
Heyyy

508
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Yeahh!

509
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,520
Got it.

510
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,560
Can you take it?

511
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,840
But now I can't take you guys anymore.

512
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,680
Get out of me!!

513
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,640
I'm about to die.

514
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,200
It's heavy.

515
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,120
Oh, why does it always have to be me who's unlucky?

516
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,280
Hey, come on.

517
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,840
Tomorrow we'll go to the library

518
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,360
to look at the Book of Life.

519
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:25,600
Yes!

520
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,200
I told you my plan worked.

521
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,840
Hey, but Poom is very talented.

522
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,000
I got you!

523
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:34,920
I've been searching for a long time.

524
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,360
Well, why are you looking for us?

525
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,200
Officer

526
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,400
We didn't do anything wrong.

527
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:44,520
Right?

528
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,600
When you get to the police station, you'll know.

529
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:48,680
I'm not going.

530
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,000
I didn't do anything wrong.

531
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,400
I didn't steal anything.

532
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:52,960
Yes, sir

533
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,240
We don't know anything about blood.

534
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:56,600
Okay

535
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:57,760
We'll go to the police station.

536
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,800
We're pure-hearted.

537
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:02,880
Yes

538
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,080
Good!

539
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,360
We won't have to be tired of chasing each other.

540
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,560
Take them to the police station.

541
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,480
I'll go check at the blood bank.

542
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,960
Actually, you don't have to search for it.

543
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,200
We've never seen any blood.

544
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,280
Green..

545
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,760
These are the kids, Captain.

546
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,360
Hey you guys.

547
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,520
Well, what did that man do wrong?

548
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,520
Thief steals blood

549
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,080
No! didn't steal it.

550
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,080
Didn't do anything at all.

551
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:37,960
Hey you guys.

552
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,320
What about that guy?

553
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,640
He stole the blood of reserved animals.

554
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,080
Ohhh

555
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:47,320
Hey you guys.

556
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,080
What about that vampire?

557
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:48,960
Hey!

558
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,760
Stop evading.

559
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,480
You'd better confess

560
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,400
who stole

561
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,000
the blood from our specialized blood bank.

562
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:02,880
We didn't do it.

563
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:03,840
We just went out

564
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,880
to have fun.

565
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,240
Didn't do anything.

566
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,280
Didn't steal anything either.

567
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:07,840
That's not true.

568
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,520
You're clearly a shepherd.

569
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,320
We're not.

570
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,040
We don't raise sheep.

571
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,880
We raise ducks and chickens.

572
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,880
I'm telling the truth, Captain.

573
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,640
These guys like to raise ducks and chickens.

574
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,120
You think I'm kidding!

575
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,080
Umm

576
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,080
I saw him standing tensely.

577
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,280
So I'll just make him smile.

578
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,360
Right!

579
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,920
I didn't steal any blood.

580
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,680
Smile

581
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,600
I'm going to give you one last chance to confess.

582
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:41,120
Who stole the blood from our specialized blood bank.

583
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:42,840
None

584
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,520
Didn't steal.

585
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:44,240
Didn't lie.

586
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,720
Didn't have any suspicion at all.

587
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:48,920
Good!!

588
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,320
You're very stubborn, right?

589
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:56,480
My eyes hurt.

590
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,240
I understand, sir.

591
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,280
Well

592
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,240
Business is over.

593
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,480
You guys can go.

594
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,600
Just now, they still didn't believe it.

595
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:23,920
I've changed my mind.

596
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,200
My subordinate came to inform me

597
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,040
that there was no blood missing from the bank.

598
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,520
Then why were you whispering?

599
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,720
Why don't you say out loud?

600
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:40,240
Why!

601
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,520
Let's just say you guys can go.

602
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,680
We're done here.

603
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,920
But I want to warn you one thing.

604
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,480
Don't try to tease the guard again, do you understand?

605
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:51,960
Yes

606
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,560
Thank you

607
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,360
Hey, then why haven't you gone yet?

608
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,000
Human city

609
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,600
That axshole!

610
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,880
What a douchbag!

611
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,240
Insatiable!

612
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,400
Casanova!

613
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:00,920
Bastard!

614
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:01,960
Extremely!

615
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,800
To bastard man

616
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,320
Will it be good, dudes?

617
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,360
Good

618
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:26,760
Are you sure?

619
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:29,440
But if it doesn't succeed, we definitely won't survive.

620
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,640
Come on.

621
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,360
Who will go first?

622
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,400
You

623
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,680
Me

624
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:35,800
Yes, go ahead

625
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,520
Go!!

626
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,760
Is there anything I can help with?

627
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,560
Ummm

628
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,040
We...

629
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,200
came to find a book.

630
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,480
Please come above.

631
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:57,920
Feel free to find it.

632
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,000
Ummm

633
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,520
I'm...

634
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,640
What do you say?

635
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:54,640
Jumping jacks

636
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:06,800
Got it.

637
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,680
There's nothing.

638
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:11,800
Sorry

639
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,760
Take me to see the Bible of Life.

640
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,360
Walk and shake your waist.

641
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,200
You go first.

642
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:34,000
Whoa, whoa

643
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,200
Hey

644
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,080
Where are you going?

645
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,200
Here is your drink.

646
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:25,360
Make way

647
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:27,720
Make way!

648
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:32,760
Is this him?

649
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,320
The bartender that the girls are crazy about.

650
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:37,840
Yes

651
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,080
Is there something wrong?

652
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:39,960
Yes

653
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:42,600
I heard that

654
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:44,720
if I want a drink.

655
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:47,120
Do I have to order a drink based on my mood?

656
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:49,320
So

657
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,040
Please make drinks for the two of us.

658
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:55,280
What about the emotions of the two of you right now?

659
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,800
What kind is it?

660
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:57,880
Look at my face.

661
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:10,840
Is it clear?

662
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:12,160
What mood?

663
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:14,360
It's very clear.

664
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,440
Then wait a moment.

665
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,280
I think we're enough.

666
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:44,400
What?

667
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,640
We haven't seen the Bible of Life yet.

668
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:46,520
Right

669
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,280
What are you going to quit now?

670
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,920
I mean shaking your waist is enough.

671
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,480
My waist is completely sprained.

672
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:54,840
Right

673
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:56,720
You ordered him to stop too.

674
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,480
Stop shaking your waist.

675
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:05,880
Are you sure?

676
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:07,440
to see the book of life

677
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:10,880
If you're sure

678
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:13,880
you want to go down to live in the human city,

679
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,840
I'll let you see.

680
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:17,880
You all must sign this book.

681
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:19,920
When your body expires,

682
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:21,720
your parallel body

683
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,360
must immediately replace it.

684
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:29,640
I'm sure.

685
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:32,640
If you are sure, then put your hand on the book.

686
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:58,640
Beverage

687
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:11,760
Why is this bitter?

688
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:14,320
It's the mood of the two of you right now.

689
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:16,240
It's bitter, isn't it?

690
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:33,360
Babe!

691
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:39,440
This club is not good at all.

692
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:40,840
Take it to the next one.

693
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:43,960
Calm down

694
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,840
The club over there is good.

695
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:49,440
Go

696
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:55,360
Heyy

697
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:35,680
Doctor, Please helped prepare ambulance bag

698
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,640
and a breathing tube.

699
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:38,960
The patient has no pulse.

700
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:39,680
Prepare CPR.

701
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:21,480
Hey

702
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:23,160
We have come to the city of humans.

703
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:26,600
Yeahhh

704
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:32,400
Hey you

705
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,920
Why must I be the only one left?

706
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:39,240
Zen

707
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:40,640
Ran

708
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:41,840
Jolie

709
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:45,040
Poom

710
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:02,440
There's still another person left, right?

711
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:04,960
Who hasn't gone to the human city yet?

712
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:05,560
Yes

713
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:07,480
Now I'm sending people out to look for it.

714
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:14,400
Almost 1000 years ago

715
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:18,040
That no teenage vampire would dare break the rules

716
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,400
They dare to betray me.

717
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,200
Go and capture them all,

718
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:25,920
don't leave a single one.
