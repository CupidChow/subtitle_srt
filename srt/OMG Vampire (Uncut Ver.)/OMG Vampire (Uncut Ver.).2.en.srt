1
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,480
The hell?!

2
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,160
What are you surprise for?

3
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,200
It should be me not you!

4
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,400
Are you crazy?

5
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,720
Because of a jerk,
you had to commit suicide?

6
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,440
Wait...

7
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,640
Who are you sir?

8
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,800
"Oh, so you will play amnesia
joke now? “
*a partial or total loss of memmory

9
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,120
I'm Maai

10
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,320
your one and only best friend.

11
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,040
Or should I smack your head first?

12
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,840
Hey, wait wait wait!

13
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,200
Well....

14
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,600
I think I couldn't remember much right now.

15
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,360
My brain might be concussed.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,600
Come on Pure.

17
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,960
I already warned you

18
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,680
that Rome is a player.

19
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,120
You never listened.

20
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,000
How is it now?

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Being blinded by love

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,400
Lead you to commit a suicide

23
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,640
Me? commit a suicide?

24
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,120
YES !

25
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,240
And stop using that polite pronoun

26
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,720
it seems distant.

27
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,280
Just me, you

28
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,000
Ok?

29
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,520
My parallel body still has to die because of love?

30
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,440
Pararellel?

31
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,520
What pararellel?

32
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,640
I only know

33
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,520
Kanchanaphisek parallel road.

34
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,280
Your way back home.

35
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,680
No just..

36
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,040
Well I..

37
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,520
I have a headache.

38
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,480
Can I take some rest first?

39
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,560
Yeah yeah

40
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,960
Go get some rest.

41
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,600
So you would get better sooner.

42
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,040
I'm lazy of taking care of you here.

43
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,160
See you then.

44
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,360
I had been sleeping for 100 years.
You guys still don't have lovers?

45
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,680
It's the governor who makes the rule.

46
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,080
That forbid Gen X vampires like us from having a lover
or loving each other.

47
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,040
If I want to go to the human land,

48
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,080
What do I have to do?

49
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,600
You have to check in the Book of Life In the town's library.

50
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,200
However, vampires that allowed to go to the
human's world must be 500 years old or more.

51
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,960
But how could we go check the Book of Life?

52
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,480
The librarian won't let us do that.

53
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,000
We are underage.

54
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,240
How are you guys doing?

55
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,320
We're lucky that we got only external wounds.

56
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,680
The internal is fine not much damage.

57
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,560
We replaced their bodies.

58
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,080
However, they said that you and me

59
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,000
we were HEARTBROKEN.

60
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,120
Then we decide to commit suicide together

61
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,520
Oh, yeah in this body i'm an online seller.

62
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,680
Yours is good.

63
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,440
But for me and Zen..

64
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,280
Why?

65
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,680
well, we open Thai dessert shop.

66
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,600
Moreover, we're about to get married.

67
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,600
I think..

68
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,640
You two seem perfect together.

69
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,960
True.

70
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,840
By the way..

71
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,320
Who will be the bride and who will be the groom?

72
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,000
Yeah who...

73
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,760
I'll be the groom.

74
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,440
I'll be the groom.

75
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,120
No,I'll be the groom.

76
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:16,880
No,I'll be the groom.

77
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,320
Me

78
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:17,760
Me

79
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,200
Me !

80
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:21,280
Hey! stop arguing.

81
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,520
Both of you will have to marry anyway.

82
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,960
And, the most important thing is

83
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,120
All of us have to bare in mind that
we aren't who we use to be anymore.

84
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,680
How so?

85
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,160
Well, we're now living in our parallel bodiesnow.

86
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,120
Be careful of how you act. Don't be out of character.

87
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,120
Understand?

88
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,320
Yeah.

89
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,960
Now.

90
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,680
We have to learn about the bodies that we're in

91
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,640
and live in them as good as we can.

92
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,640
One more important thing.

93
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,120
We must not forget to drink blood every 15 days

94
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,320
So that we can

95
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,640
walk under the daylight.

96
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,360
Do not forget this.

97
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,200
or else...

98
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,880
We will die.

99
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,280
By the way..

100
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,400
Do we really have to use
the host's body names forever?

101
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,520
I'm not use to it.

102
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,400
Yeah.

103
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,160
True.

104
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:23,600
There is a way that we can go
back to use our old names.

105
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,280
But...

106
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,080
I miss Mix.

107
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,720
I wonder, how's he doing now.

108
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:37,440
Yeah you're right.

109
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:41,000
He must be lonely.

110
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,720
Come on, you don't have to be worried.

111
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,320
He will follow us here soon.

112
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,400
Mix. Hey, Mix.

113
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,720
Mix, this is Aunty Anne.

114
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,040
Mix.

115
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,480
Auntie Anne.

116
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,600
How are you doing dear?

117
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,200
I'm still doing ok.

118
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,160
Here some foods and necessary items for you.

119
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,120
Thank you so much.

120
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,640
Hmph.

121
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,000
Why did't you guys discuss with
us first before doing something?

122
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,480
I can't believe it.

123
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,080
I strongly apologize.

124
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,080
Alright.

125
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,240
Scolding him now won't change anything.

126
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,360
We will find a way to help you guys.

127
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,720
Thank you so much.

128
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,080
And how many days left

129
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,000
untill you would be able to go replace
your parallel body?

130
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,600
Not long...

131
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,920
just In a couple days

132
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,360
Stay well hiding

133
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,320
Don't get caught.

134
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,720
Oh and...

135
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,360
Don't forget to warn your friends as well

136
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,720
Tell them to be ware of the vampire cops.

137
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,800
DO NOT get caught.

138
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,440
untill we able to find the ways to help all of you.

139
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,920
Understand?

140
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,920
Understood.

141
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,920
Hey! what are you doing?

142
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,160
Go, Mix go.

143
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,400
Go quickly.

144
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,800
I asked. What were you doing?

145
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,120
Why didn't you answer?

146
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:48,960
Hey!!

147
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,400
What? this is my house.

148
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,520
I can do whatever and wherever I want.

149
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,000
Why?

150
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,360
I just want to try something new like outdoor.

151
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,200
I don't see any problem with it.

152
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,760
It isn't wrong.

153
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,840
just suspicious

154
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:19,080
You are well aware that
we're under the population controlling.

155
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,440
I'm unable to have children.

156
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,440
If I able to,

157
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,960
my house would be full of children.

158
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,960
Therefore,

159
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,360
you don't have to worry.

160
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,280
Ok,Ok

161
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,800
You guys want to continue so bad ,right?

162
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,240
Go ahead then.

163
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,720
No. no more.

164
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,640
I'm not in the mood anymore.

165
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,120
Come hun.

166
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:46,960
Let's go back inside.

167
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,600
I don't buy it.

168
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,520
They will continue it inside anyway.

169
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,280
Am I right about this?

170
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,840
Why I have to be the one being left alone?

171
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,040
(Crying)

172
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,240
I’m starving.

173
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,600
Still lucky I have these breads from aunt Anne.

174
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,440
Thank you so much auntie.

175
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,080
(AAAAAAAHHHHH)

176
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:39,080
hard as a rock!

177
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,920
How cold I even eat it?

178
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,920
(Huh Huuuh)

179
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,240
Screw it, I'm not eating it.

180
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,800
(Huh Huuuh)

181
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,160
Finally home huh?

182
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,240
Hey, what's wrong?

183
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:08,760
You act like this is your first time here.

184
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,960
It is.

185
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,800
What?!

186
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,440
Well I'm.. observing you know?

187
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,520
Making sure nothing missing.

188
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,520
I was in hospital for awhile.

189
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,960
Let's drop it for now. Have a seat.

190
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,360
Oh well..

191
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,600
what will you do next?

192
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,680
About your work.

193
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,560
You resigned.

194
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,560
What?

195
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,200
I resigned from work?

196
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,680
Don't tell me that you forget?

197
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,840
Well, that day

198
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,640
you came sobboing with me.

199
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,080
Telling that you didn't want to meet that jerk again.

200
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,600
Then you resigned.

201
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,000
What a coward.

202
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,840
Yeah, a damn coward.

203
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,360
I told you to stay and slay.

204
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,160
But you didn't listen.

205
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:02,680
See?

206
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,320
You see now.

207
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,480
Hello dear.

208
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,640
Hello.

209
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,760
So lucky

210
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,280
that you are here today.

211
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,240
Ah, yes.

212
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,680
I found a new renter after you left.

213
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,840
Next week They will move in.

214
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,480
So, you can start moving out dear.

215
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,680
What?

216
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,480
Why are you confusing?

217
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,680
You were the one who canceled
the rental contract.

218
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,200
Mentioned that you would go traveling,
give your heart a break,

219
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,000
and live out of town.

220
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,240
I'm counting on you, dear.

221
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,840
you don't forget to move out, do you?

222
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,760
See you later.

223
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,480
What’s the hell Poom?

224
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,320
Canceled your rental contract

225
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,760
and quit your job.

226
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,840
And now

227
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,800
where would you live?

228
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,080
Where would you work?

229
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,480
I haven't thought about that yet.

230
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,240
I will think about that later.

231
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,760
Can I take some rest for now?

232
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,080
Fine.

233
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,800
Take some rest.

234
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,240
Rest is rest then.

235
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,400
If you need anything,

236
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,400
call me then.

237
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,800
Ok?

238
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,560
Thank you so much.

239
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,240
Hmm, yeah ok.

240
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,080
See you later.

241
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,560
Be careful while walking please?

242
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,520
while sitting as well.

243
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,440
Welcome back home

244
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,680
Pol and Tee.

245
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,400
Umm, who is this?

246
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,680
Oh my..

247
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:01,440
Oh my, you couldn't remember me?

248
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,640
This is Kaew.

249
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,240
The employee in our shop, dear.

250
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,280
You can't remember her?

251
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:09,000
Oh yes.

252
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,320
Maybe because I had been in the hospital
for too long that is why I couldn't remember her.

253
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:12,880
It is ok.

254
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,080
Oh hey Mom

255
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:17,000
I think we should take our sons to the ritual ceremony

256
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,040
to ward off bad luck.

257
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,840
You're right.

258
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,040
Well...

259
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,520
Well, since we're all here together.

260
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,680
We have something to tell you guys.

261
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:28,920
Well...

262
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,360
We went to see a fortuneteller.

263
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,920
He suggested us to change our name for dispelling

264
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,920
and bad things will turn into good things.

265
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:36,400
Really?

266
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,040
Yes, mom.

267
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,720
When did you go see him?

268
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,080
And who is that fortuneteller?

269
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,520
Is he trustworthy?

270
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,600
Yes. That’s right. Is he trustworthy?

271
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,680
We saw him in online.

272
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,880
Yes, yes.

273
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,440
He is very accurate.

274
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,240
Are you sure?

275
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,240
Highly accurate

276
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:50,720
Yeah?

277
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,240
Yes, I can guarantee.

278
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:55,160
Can you show us then? Including Kaew as well.

279
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,720
I..already forgot the website name.

280
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,880
Ahh, yes.

281
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,560
What a shame.

282
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,880
Hmm, about

283
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,920
the fortuneteller

284
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:12,120
What are the names that
he suggested you to change?

285
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,800
For me it's Ran.

286
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:14,440
Ran

287
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,680
And for me it's Zen.

288
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,280
Zen

289
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,520
Ran

290
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,400
Zen

291
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,640
you’re right.

292
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,200
Mr.Zen

293
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,040
and Mr.Ran

294
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,640
Mr.Zen and Mr.Ran

295
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,360
Mr.Zen and Mr.Ran

296
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,560
I can remember it now.

297
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,520
Mr.Sun and Mr.Ran

298
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,080
No!

299
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,880
Mr.Zen and Mr.Ran

300
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,960
Mr.Zen and Mr.Ran

301
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,440
That's right.

302
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,440
Mr.Zen and Mr.Ran

303
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,160
Well, well

304
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,360
smiling sweetly at each other like this.

305
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,800
Forget that we are still here?

306
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,520
Oh.

307
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,280
About your wedding

308
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,960
you don't have to worry about it.

309
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,960
We had planned everything for you.

310
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:54,880
OK?

311
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,880
Yes, dear.

312
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,800
Just both of you

313
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,200
behave well

314
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,320
and take a good care of yourselves.

315
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,400
So that in a wedding day you both will look good.

316
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,680
Understand dear?

317
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,080
Understand?

318
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:06,800
Yes, mom.

319
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,640
Alright, now Mr.Pol

320
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,000
Oh!

321
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,440
It's Zen.

322
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,920
Zen and Ran

323
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,640
Right !

324
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:16,920
Mr.....

325
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:17,760
Mr.Ran

326
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,000
And Mr.Zen

327
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,760
may take a rest upstairs please.

328
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,160
Let's go dear.

329
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:22,680
Come, come.

330
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,480
Be careful ok?

331
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,600
This way please.

332
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,560
Mr.Zen and Mr.Ran

333
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,680
Yeah, keep saying that.

334
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,640
Mr.Zen and Mr.Ran

335
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,280
Mr.Zen , Zen

336
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:35,960
Mr.Zen

337
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,840
Mr.Zen !

338
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,800
Ahh, right that's Zen.

339
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,960
Mr.Ran

340
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,040
Ahh, right that's Ran.

341
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,160
Mr.Zen and Mr.Ran

342
00:18:44,080 --> 00:19:01,600
(singing)

343
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,720
Thank you so much.

344
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,560
See you again next time

345
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,680
and I hope you all enjoy.

346
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,440
What's wrong with you today, Chin?

347
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,320
Since you had sung ,you sung it incorrectly.

348
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,440
Well, it's because of that woman.

349
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,680
I haven't heard any news from her.

350
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,880
Which one?

351
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,160
The one that got hit by a car.

352
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,120
Why?

353
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,880
You like her?

354
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,480
Hell yes.

355
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,840
At first

356
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,360
I thought I would flirt with her for a bit.

357
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,480
I only talked to her once!

358
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,920
Let me tell you something, dude.

359
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,400
If you and her are soulmates,

360
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,080
you will meet her again.

361
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,400
If it's not...

362
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,760
Then she's dead.

363
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,800
Hey!

364
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,040
Why did you say that?

365
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,680
What should I do?

366
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,080
Is It so difficult to you ?

367
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,600
Just fine a new one.

368
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,000
Nooo!

369
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,240
I want this girl.

370
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,200
I like this girl.

371
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:12,760
I will flirt her and

372
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,240
I will find her.

373
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,480
I like this girl.

374
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,800
Ouch!!

375
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,360
It hurts!

376
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,200
That's what I want.

377
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,400
Have a sense for once.

378
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,480
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

379
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,880
Well, I like her

380
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,360
what can I do?

381
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,640
Oh.

382
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,320
The shop isn't open yet.

383
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,720
It will open in 2 days .

384
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,720
Oh well.

385
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,800
We are not here to buy anything.

386
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,600
We are here for Ran-

387
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,600
Oh...

388
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,120
Hey Julie

389
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,880
what is his human name?

390
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,080
I forgot.

391
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,800
Um...

392
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,040
Do you mean Zen and Ran?

393
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,080
Oh yes.

394
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,000
Yes.

395
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,480
By the way…

396
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,040
You also know their names?

397
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,800
So that's mean that you are vamp-

398
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,520
What vamp?

399
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,720
Umm it's ummm.

400
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,240
Flash

401
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,040
like flash

402
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,240
Their names just flashed into my mind, just like that.

403
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,400
Oh I see.

404
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,840
Flash into your mind.

405
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,960
I remember it well.

406
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,360
The two changed their names recently.

407
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,720
According to what the fortuneteller suggested.

408
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,320
They can’t remember their name that well yet.

409
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,720
You two are their friends?

410
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,440
Yes.

411
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,360
Yes,we are.

412
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,800
Are you sure about that?

413
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,000
You sure about that?

414
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,960
Or scammers?

415
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,560
Are you guys scammers?

416
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,400
Scammers

417
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,680
Oh no no , we are not.

418
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,960
Please calm down first aunty.

419
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,280
We are truly friends.

420
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,600
If you are truly their friends.

421
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,080
You must be able to answer this!

422
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,880
That Tee and Pol no!

423
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,520
Zen and Ran

424
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,480
How long have they been in this relationship?

425
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,760
And when will they get married?

426
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,680
Where does it take place?

427
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,360
Answer now!

428
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,360
Hey Poom , Jolie

429
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,360
You guys really know each other.

430
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,000
Of course we do.

431
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,040
This is my best friend.

432
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:28,920
What?

433
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,280
Best friends?

434
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,160
Yes

435
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,680
Then why I don't know them?

436
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,600
Umm…we have known each other for a long time.

437
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,960
Long time friends, yes.

438
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,760
Oh I see.

439
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,320
Have been friends for so long.

440
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,400
Too long that I don't even know.

441
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,960
But you have known each other for a very long time.

442
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,760
I think Aunt Kaew should get some rest first.

443
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:49,320
Before things get more complicated than this.

444
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:52,200
I would like to have some conversation with my friends.

445
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,840
Of course.

446
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,160
Why do I feel like being chased away?

447
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,120
It's not like that.

448
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,000
Oh yes, no chasing just want me to get some rest.

449
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,680
But I think it's chasing.

450
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,840
Oh no not chasing. Go get some rest.

451
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,360
Oh right.

452
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:13,640
Who do I keep imagining things?

453
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,880
Let's talk outside.

454
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,680
Well, I live with my family.

455
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,880
My mom said

456
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,920
my main job is an online seller.

457
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,720
and the minor job is...

458
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,280
a yoga trainer.

459
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,400
Well then

460
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,880
take some Thai desserts from our shop and sell them.

461
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,080
You guy's lives are so perfect.

462
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,760
Have jobs

463
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,560
Have homes

464
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,440
What about you?

465
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,840
Yours is not good?

466
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,320
This body well

467
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,560
heartbroken,

468
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,920
no job,

469
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,520
and no place to live.

470
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,600
My life is so cruel.

471
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,280
What is your next plan?

472
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,560
I don't know about that yet.

473
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,720
But what I know now

474
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,920
I will hunt down the person who turned me into a vampire

475
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,280
Are you sure about that?

476
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,080
Yes.

477
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,560
By the way

478
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,440
If you have no place to live,

479
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,800
you can stay with us.

480
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,200
It's ok.

481
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,760
I don't want to disturb you the loving couple

482
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,680
I might become a third wheel.

483
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,200
Poom you!!

484
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:42,120
Hey! Calm down!

485
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,080
Jolie-

486
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,000
Jolie help!

487
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,000
It is so the little kindergarden.

488
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,080
catch him.

489
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,480
God, I'm so worried about my son,Mix.

490
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,920
Please don't be caught by the vampire cops.

491
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,800
You're right.

492
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,680
We have to find a way

493
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,040
to help our sons and daughters.

494
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,240
The reason why I gather you all here today

495
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,800
Is to discuss this matter.

496
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,040
How can we save our sons and daughters.

497
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,000
In my opinion,

498
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,720
the age rules for parallel replacements

499
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,360
I think it should've been canceled a long time ago.

500
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,000
TRUE

501
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,800
Because all teenage vampires

502
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,000
should've freedom to make their choices

503
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,120
to live in the human world

504
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,160
or to live in a vampire city.

505
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,760
And the age limit rule should also be abolished.

506
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,560
I totally agree with you.

507
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,720
Because when I was a teenager,

508
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,080
I wanted to go to the human city.

509
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,520
But when we reach the age of limit,

510
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,560
our parallel body already passed away.

511
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,920
That’s too bad.

512
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,520
So what should we do?

513
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,480
I think we should sign a petition

514
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,040
to abolish the rule

515
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,000
and submit it to the High Council.

516
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,360
Good?

517
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,360
I agree with Artan

518
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,400
but...

519
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,440
Will the council member accept it?

520
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,120
We are the vampire population.

521
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,440
Will it be loud enough?

522
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,920
If you don't try, you won't know.

523
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,800
If you don't try, you won't know.

524
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,640
Even though this time it wasn't work.

525
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,080
But all of us

526
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,520
have done it for our descendants.

527
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,760
So...

528
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,160
we should go separate.

529
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,440
Let's start a petition,

530
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,040
but we must do it secretly.

531
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:49,360
if this gets to General Lux,

532
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,520
we're done.

533
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,320
Hey !

534
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,560
Why do you always keep thinking about him?

535
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,840
How did you get in?

536
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,360
You forgot it again?

537
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,840
You gave me the house key,

538
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,440
don't you remember?

539
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,080
and this!!

540
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,360
You don't have to check this.

541
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,960
There's not a baht left.

542
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,800
You've transferred all the money to him.

543
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,920
So stupid to transfer all the money to men?

544
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,680
Hmm!?

545
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,960
Have you just found out, dude?

546
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:56,960
Me !

547
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,640
I was going to eat dog food instead of human food.

548
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,920
I've warned you many times.

549
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,600
You've never listened to me at all.

550
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,840
This one should be burned and thrown away.

551
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,080
Don't keep it.

552
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,800
Have you eaten yet?

553
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,440
(ToT) No

554
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,240
My mom made it for you.

555
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,800
Eat it!

556
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,440
Please thank your mom.

557
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,480
And have you kept your stuff yet?

558
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,440
And!! There's more stuff at the office.

559
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,400
Will you go to keep it all ?

560
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,320
so we can go together.

561
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,480
Pure

562
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,640
Pure

563
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,400
How are you?

564
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,720
I'm worried about you.

565
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,720
I can’t eat

566
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,880
or sleep

567
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,960
restless..

568
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,560
beath-taking..

569
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,600
So fake!

570
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,200
Please give me some personal time

571
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,080
to talk with my boyfriend.

572
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,040
BITCH !

573
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,440
Pure

574
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,840
Enough!

575
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,280
What?

576
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,160
Are you still mad at me?

577
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,160
I'm sorry.

578
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,480
I'm not angry.

579
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,760
But who are you?

580
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,600
Do I know you?

581
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,240
Hey, stop teasing me.

582
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,560
I thought you were joking.

583
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,800
I'm not Pure

584
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,720
I'm Poom

585
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,840
and in my memories

586
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,000
I don't know you.

587
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,160
You can get out of my house now.

588
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,920
Pure

589
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:35,800
Please get out

590
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,840
Pure No!

591
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,880
The door is over there.

592
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,640
Pure

593
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,920
Where are you going?

594
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,600
Mai come here

595
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,040
Pure !

596
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,560
Pure !!

597
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,600
What?

598
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,000
Did I come to the wrong house?

599
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,320
So, I didn't.

600
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,440
That's so embarrassing.

601
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,480
What  happened?

602
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:32,960
What?

603
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,640
Who are you?

604
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,240
Why are you holding my hand?

605
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,680
What do you want?

606
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,160
You're not my friend, right?

607
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,720
Y...eah

608
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,440
Hey, what's wrong with you?

609
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,320
You told that your name is Poom not Pure .

610
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,560
Tell me now.

611
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,080
Who are you?

612
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,520
I....

613
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,320
I'm just being me.

614
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I told you that my name is Poom.

615
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,600
I've just changed my name

616
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,040
to dispel bad luck.

617
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,160
alright!

618
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,720
I will be a new person.

619
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,200
I won't be tricked by men.

620
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,000
Really?

621
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:09,960
Really

622
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,520
Sure?

623
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,480
Sure

624
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,640
Seriously?

625
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,920
Oh! Enough!

626
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,800
What?

627
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,320
I'm very proud of you.

628
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,440
It has to be like this,

629
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,720
my friend!!

630
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,960
New Poom

631
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,720
The Old Pure has already died.

632
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,080
Right! THe Old Pure has died.

633
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,720
Let's eat.

634
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,360
I'm coming.

635
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,000
Mr.Zen Mr.Ran

636
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,520
Don't you want to help Auntie serve?

637
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,320
Oh, Auntie Kaew.

638
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,000
Here I am

639
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,880
We are doing a live broadcast here to sell things.

640
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,520
Hmm...

641
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:07,000
It's a way to increase sales for our shop.

642
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,120
Alright !

643
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,120
But I..

644
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,120
Well, I think

645
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,720
it's better for you to go rest first.

646
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,960
The three of us will go live.

647
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,280
Are you pushing me away again?

648
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:21,040
Guys, this is like pushing me away, right?

649
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,480
I haven't pressed live yet.

650
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,840
Oh, alright

651
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,160
Auntie

652
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:30,240
This one is for use in live broadcasts.

653
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,800
I think...

654
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:40,520
you should find someone to help Auntie Kaew.

655
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,960
What about Poom!

656
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,200
He's unemployed, right?

657
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,680
Are you crazy?

658
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,360
Will you let Poom help us

659
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,920
as a waiter?

660
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,520
I don't think it's good a idea.

661
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,520
But if you let him go live for selling

662
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,720
and share the percentage like Jolie, it may be good.

663
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,120
Talking about Poom

664
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,760
feel sorry for him.

665
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,640
Last night,when I called him.

666
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,960
He told me that

667
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,320
the ex-boyfriend of the owner of the body

668
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,880
had come to make up with him.

669
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:10,120
I don't know how to help.

670
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,600
Come on!

671
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,360
He can make it!

672
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,120
He was once human.

673
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,560
He understands humans better than us.

674
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,680
Well, that's true.

675
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,160
But now

676
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,360
I want to go live and sell things.

677
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,080
I've never gone live before.

678
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:27,560
TRUE

679
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,600
I'm also excited.

680
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,080
Yes

681
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,000
This has been a dream of mine for a long time.

682
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,840
to go live and sell things.

683
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:33,240
TRUE

684
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,440
I took my mom's clothes

685
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,600
and turned them into teenagers' clothes

686
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,320
a lot!

687
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,280
But I didn't go live and sell them.

688
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,200
Because of our city's regulations,

689
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,720
you have to be 500 years old or older

690
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,280
to sell things.

691
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,400
500 years old! Who will selling?

692
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,560
But the city of humans

693
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,520
is really as good as Poom said.

694
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,520
Very Free!

695
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,000
Umm

696
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,040
But now

697
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,040
Ready?

698
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,640
- Come on!
-Go

699
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,240
Hi Guys

700
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,960
The old Lalil is back.

701
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,280
After not going live for a while.

702
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,440
Today Lalil has delicious Thai desserts

703
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,320
for everyone to order.

704
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,640
Have you guys come yet?

705
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,680
First of all,

706
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:12,160
I would like to inform you that

707
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,360
I've changed my name.

708
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:16,280
From Lalil to Jolie.

709
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,360
If someone called it wrong,I'll be sulking!

710
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,920
Don't call me wrong, everyone.

711
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:22,720
Ah, let's come to Thai desserts first.

712
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:25,040
Ah, this one

713
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,000
What kind of dessert is this?

714
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,040
Cassava Cake! (Kanom Maan)

715
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,040
Can I eat this?

716
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:29,920
No, you can't.

717
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:30,480
Why?

718
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,280
It's "Maan" (Yours)

719
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,040
(Joke)

720
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,200
Next!

721
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,640
Mik

722
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,800
Hurry and follow us.

723
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,400
Pure

724
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,120
Stop right there.

725
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:55,960
You're not making any sense!

726
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,320
I'm not Pure

727
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,160
How can it be?

728
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,320
I know you're still mad at me.

729
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,320
so you pretend that you're not Pure.

730
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,760
Stop being mad at me.

731
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,640
Pleaseeeee

732
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,280
Don't you get it?

733
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,000
Come here

734
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,800
Come give me a hug.

735
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,080
I guarantee that

736
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,120
your anger will disappear immediately.

737
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,240
You're not making any sense!

738
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,480
What kind of creature are you?

739
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,480
I'm sorry

740
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,760
I'm sorry

741
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,040
Kiw loves Poom

742
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,840
Poom loves P’Kiw too

743
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:51,200
Hmmm, delicious as always.

744
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,960
I haven't eaten it in a long time.

745
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,120
(Ouch)

746
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,560
You

747
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,840
I'm sorry

748
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,840
I'll wipe it for you.

749
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:01,720
I'll wipe it for you.

750
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,440
Hey you

751
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,600
You !!

752
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,240
Hey you that...

753
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,440
Do we know each other?

754
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,480
Well, that day

755
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,800
you went to my bar.

756
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,520
The day you got hit by a car,

757
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,600
I went to your bar.

758
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,600
Why can't I remember anything?

759
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,080
I must have remembered the wrong person.

760
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,240
I'm sorry.

761
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,320
You don't have to apologize to me at all.

762
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,960
It must be me to apologize to you.

763
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,600
I've soiled all your clothes.

764
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,200
Please Take it off.

765
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,360
I'll go wash it for you.

766
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,560
Hey you!

767
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,160
If I take it off,

768
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,960
it will be obscene.

769
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Where do I put the shirt to go back?

770
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:44,840
It's true.

771
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,280
I'm really sorry.

772
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,480
I'm really sorry.

773
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,120
Enough!

774
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,440
Well

775
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,160
I'll give it to you.

776
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,480
You don't have to!

777
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,600
Please take it.

778
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,080
Yours are all spilled.

779
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,440
Is it really okay?

780
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,480
I bought this

781
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,000
as 1 get 1 promotion.

782
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,240
I can't drink the all alone.

783
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,280
Here take it

784
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,640
Oh, here's the straw.

785
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,760
You seem like drinking milk tea so much.

786
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:30,720
I really like it.

787
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,680
I haven't drunk in many years.

788
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,280
didn't drink

789
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,840
in many years?

790
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:36,880
Hmmm...

791
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,520
Oh, there's nothing.

792
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,880
I have to hurry and run some errands.

793
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,400
I

794
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,280
I will get going.

795
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,720
I'm really sorry.

796
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,280
and thank you very much.

797
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,000
I will get going.

798
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,320
Everything sold out very quickly today.

799
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,120
I'll go to the market

800
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,680
and buy more things.

801
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,320
Today I've to make more dessert.

802
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,240
Are you just going to buy things?

803
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,080
I'll stop by to visit the security guard for a while.

804
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,360
He seems crushing on me.

805
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,400
Yeah!

806
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,960
Why would you be unnatural?

807
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,320
Do we usually hug each other?

808
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,440
That's natural.

809
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:57,880
We're a couple about to get married.

810
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:02,120
What you think of me?

811
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,760
What are you saying?

812
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,320
Who thinks of you?

813
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,640
Let me love you

814
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,160
Just thinking about it makes me vomit.

815
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:17,440
You might be attracted to me.

816
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,600
No way!

817
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,760
What?

818
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,920
I will get going.

819
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,560
Babeee!!

820
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:38,280
Wait me please!

821
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,880
I'll leave you to it.

822
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,320
I have to go run some errands

823
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:18,040
I haven't given you any reward yet.

824
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:20,280
What's the reward?

825
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,920
Reward for walking with me

826
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,680
Yes

827
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:50,000
Who are you looking for?

828
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:55,440
Who are YOU looking for?

829
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,240
P’Kiw

830
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,320
Come find Kiw, right?

831
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,200
Pretend like you don't remember?

832
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,600
Have you forgotten

833
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:08,920
what you did to me?

834
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,800
You are misunderstanding.

835
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,440
Really?

836
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,600
Poom, I love you.

837
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:44,880
What's the matter, Kin?

838
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,240
Kin?

839
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:48,560
Yes

840
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,080
So...

841
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:53,720
you came to find Kiw, right?

842
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,720
Kiw has died since last year.

843
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:12,320
I am Kiw's twin brother.

844
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,160
When he passed away,

845
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:19,560
I couldn't return to see him in time.

846
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:23,560
We haven't said goodbye.

847
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:29,880
I'm sorry to hear that.

848
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,280
Thank you

849
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:49,080
If my brother does something bad to you.

850
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:53,320
I ask for forgiveness for my brother as well.

851
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:06,400
Are you Poom, right?

852
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:07,760
Yes

853
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,680
Kiw, he had said that.

854
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,480
If you meet someone named Poom.

855
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,800
Please send this box.

856
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,680
K’Poom

857
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:43,800
Well

858
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:48,880
May I have your number please?

859
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,520
You called me here.

860
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:32,640
I..

861
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:35,760
have something to ask you.

862
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,520
We...Two of us

863
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:41,800
have known each other for a long time.

864
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,160
So I thought maybe...

865
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:48,920
Two of us

866
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,240
Wait!!

867
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:55,280
He definitely want to ask me to be his boyfriend.

868
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:02,000
I’m ready.

869
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:07,600
So..

870
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,400
Two of us

871
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:17,640
Two of us

872
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:20,000
Would you be my boyfriend?

873
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:47,760
I have something to give you.

874
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,760
This necklace

875
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:57,320
was given to me by my dad.

876
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:58,400
Dad told me

877
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,160
to wear it for the person I love.

878
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,720
Thank you

879
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:10,200
That's so bad.

880
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,400
I've nothing to give you.

881
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,640
That's fine

882
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:16,400
Just you are my boyfriend

883
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:19,760
is the best gift to me.

884
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:24,040
Really cute

885
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,360
I've heard the news for a long time that

886
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:25,760
the owner of this bar is very handsome.

887
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:29,240
When you met the real one, what was it like?

888
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:31,080
Ummm...

889
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:33,360
More handsome than I thought.

890
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:35,560
Would you mind

891
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:38,160
if I asked to sit with you?

892
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,280
What?

893
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:44,200
Can you go sit somewhere else first?

894
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:45,120
I came first.

895
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:47,640
That's you. Must go sit somewhere else.

896
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,560
Babe!

897
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,240
Why do you do this?

898
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:01,560
I won't accept that

899
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:03,480
to let other people sit with us like this.

900
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:05,200
I didn't

901
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:10,080
I'm going to be really angry.

902
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:23,360
We'll talk later.

903
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:26,480
I'd like to take care of this naughty child first.

904
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:34,200
Bro!

905
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:35,720
Bro! What are you doing to me?

906
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:36,720
Bro!

907
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:37,920
What Bro??

908
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:39,760
It has to be BABY!

909
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:41,520
Come on, give me a kiss.

910
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:42,160
No! I don't want it.

911
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:42,840
I don't want it.

912
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,000
Don't!

913
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:48,720
What wrong with you?

914
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:49,920
What are you doing to me?

915
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:51,640
What!?

916
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:52,960
What the heck is wrong with you?

917
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:53,720
Suddenly you interrupted me

918
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:55,080
and told me you were my boyfriend.

919
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:00,000
Bro!

920
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:02,160
I met her

921
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:04,120
She's still alive.

922
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:05,680
Who?

923
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:09,120
The girl that you like.

924
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:10,040
Yeahh

925
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:11,840
I met her on social media.

926
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:14,240
She is an online seller.

927
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:17,040
I ordered a lot of Thai desserts.

928
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:18,920
I'll bring them for you to eat.

929
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:20,400
Hey Chin

930
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:22,800
I'm too lazy to talk to you.

931
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:23,720
foolish!

932
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:25,560
I'll let you take a look at the bar as well.

933
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:26,400
I'll go outside.

934
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:28,680
All right.

935
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:48,640
Welcome!

936
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:50,800
What would you like to have?

937
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:53,120
Bring me the beer.

938
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:54,160
4 glasses

939
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:55,280
Sure

940
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:05,240
Here they are!

941
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:27,520
Hey, it's been 15 days already.

942
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:30,160
We haven't had any blood yet.

943
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:30,840
Blood

944
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:33,120
Blood

945
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:35,520
Please give me some blood.

946
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:39,320
Blood

947
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:41,240
Please give me some blood.

948
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:42,040
Blood

949
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:43,040
Blood

950
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,400
Please give me some blood.

951
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,080
What's the matter, Chin?

952
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:47,720
That customer.

953
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:49,480
Please give me some blood.

954
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:50,600
He's drunk.

955
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:51,320
After getting drunk,

956
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:53,120
he walked around begging for blood to drink.

957
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:55,600
I wonder if he was drunk and thought he was a vampire.

958
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,480
Please give me some blood.

959
00:51:58,760 --> 00:51:59,600
Please give me some blood.

960
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:00,680
I have to drink blood

961
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:02,160
What blood?

962
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:03,320
If you were drunk, go back to sleep.

963
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:05,680
Do you think you're a blood-sucking zombie?

964
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:06,480
YES

965
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:07,600
Give me some blood.

966
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:08,200
Please

967
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:09,560
Give me some blood.

968
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:10,560
Just go away!

969
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:12,960
I'll handle it.

970
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:14,720
Hey!

971
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:15,680
You

972
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:16,120
Blood

973
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:17,120
I have to drink blood

974
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:17,720
You HEY YOU!

975
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:18,520
Pull yourself together!

976
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:20,720
Give me some blood.

977
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:22,280
Give me some blood.

978
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:23,600
Okay

979
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:24,360
Take you out to drink.

980
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:25,920
Let's drink blood

981
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:26,880
drink blood

982
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:28,160
Blood

983
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:35,680
You

984
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:38,880
Are you really going to let me drink blood?

985
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:40,680
Sure!
