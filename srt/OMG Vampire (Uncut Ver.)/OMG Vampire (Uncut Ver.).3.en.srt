1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,080
Blood..please. I need blood.

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:02,520
Alright alright

3
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:03,560
I will take you

4
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:05,000
to have it.

5
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,000
Blood

6
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:07,120
Blood

7
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:08,960
Drink blood..

8
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,160
You

9
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,920
You will let me drink your blood?

10
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,080
Yes, of course.

11
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:29,920
Ah!

12
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,360
We

13
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,000
have to learn about the bodies

14
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,640
and live in them

15
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,480
as good as we can

16
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,560
One more important thing

17
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,560
We must not forget to drink blood
every 15 days

18
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,680
So that we can

19
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,520
walk under the daylight

20
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,360
Stay well hiding ok?

21
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,080
Don't get caught

22
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,560
This body

23
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,560
Heartbroken

24
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,120
Resigned from work

25
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,840
Canceled the rental contract

26
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,480
Isn't life too rugh?

27
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,920
Are you looking for someone?

28
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,440
Kiw..

29
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,120
15 days already

30
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,960
I haven't drunk blood

31
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,640
Damn it

32
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,640
I finally come back to human word

33
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,360
and I didn't even know that I slept with someone?

34
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,760
It's like loosing my virginity!

35
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,280
Noooo!

36
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,560
What are you complaining?

37
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,000
Oh!

38
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,200
Ouch!

39
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,480
The hell?

40
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,080
What is wrong with you?

41
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,280
Last night..

42
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,600
Didn't you die last night?

43
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:12,920
What?

44
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,720
What do you mean?

45
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,040
Well..

46
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,680
Last night..

47
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,160
I..

48
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,880
You? You what?

49
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,400
Why don't you

50
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,360
put some clothes on first?

51
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,800
There. Happy now?

52
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,120
Tell me, I am what last night

53
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,160
I..

54
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:49,960
I..

55
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,240
I can't remember it anymore

56
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,480
I would be surprised if you able to

57
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,760
You were so drunk last night

58
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,000
and asking for blood from other people

59
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,200
What?

60
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,840
I did that?

61
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:03,960
Yes

62
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,080
I had to

63
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,520
drag you to the bar counter

64
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,680
And what happened after that?

65
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,560
You asked for more

66
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,840

00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,240

Are you saying that I lie to you?

110
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,360
Well..

111
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,600

112
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,080
Why would I call you handsome in the first place?

113
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,680
Take a look again and tell me

114
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,720

123
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,760

128
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,120

135
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:09,960

00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,320
Thank you.

137
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,400

Hello.

141
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,360
Hi.

142
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,840
My car fixing isn't done today?

143
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,680
Hoe many more days will it take?

144
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,680
Oh right.

145
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,160
Alright

146
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,720
Thank you so much.

147
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,240
Ok.

148
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,480
The hell?

149
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,920
What's wrong with you?

150
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:43,880
What are you wearing?

151
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,480
My skin is sensitive especially to the sun.

152
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,400
Just slightly exposing to it

153
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,280
is enough to burn my skin.

154
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,800
Sensitive skin?

155
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:16,960
What is that?

156
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,280
And why would you use the umbrella?

157
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,120
Well, my skin is sensitive to the sun.

158
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:24,920
I told you.

159
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,560
Just a bit of sunlight my skin can get burnt.

160
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,520
Come on take a look.

161
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,160
There is no sunlight

162
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:30,640
See?

163
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,200
We are walking under the shade.

164
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,240
Give it to me.

165
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,160
NO.

166
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,160
Give it to me.

167
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,320
I'm embarrassed enough.

168
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,240
No.

169
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,120
You dressing like this is bad enough.

170
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,120
Give it to me.

171
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,480
Hey you!

172
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,280
The hell?

173
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,480
Damn it.

174
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,160
Are you carzy?

175
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,040
Do you even know how to drive?

176
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,320
Are you blind?

177
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:03,720
You!

178
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:06,600
Hey! You!

179
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,520
What is wrong with you?

180
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,480
What are you screaming for?!

181
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,200
Oh?

182
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,600
Nothing happened

183
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,600
Not dead

184
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,120
Can't believe it.

185
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,600
You are really crazy.

186
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,200

187
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,240

00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,080
How many layers did you put on?

192
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,480
Don't worry.

193
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,720
I will clean it and hand it back later.

194
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:41,760

195
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,640

196
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,320
I just don't understand why you are so scare of the sun.

197
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,880
You aren't in my shoes.

198
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:48,720
You don't understan.

199
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,640
Of couse I do.

200
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,080
Really?

201
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,360
You do?

202
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,520
Yes, I do.

203
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,760
I do understand that you are crazy.

204
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,040
You..

205
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,720
turn around please.

206
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,840
This is the last piece.

207
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,680
What are you shy?

208
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,760
Last night I saw all of you already.

209
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,640
Just turn around.

210
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,480
Do not peek.

211
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,480
Who peek?

212
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,760
I didn't.

213
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,440
Finished?

214
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,720
Hmm

215
00:15:59,080 --> 00:15:59,560
Just a moment.

216
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,240
Are you done yet?

217
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,520
Yeah finished.

218
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,000
Oh

219
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,120
Last night

220
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,560
You didn't really give me blood right?

221
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,080
Are you crazy?

222
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,040
Where could I even find blood for you?

223
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,680
And..

224
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,760
What did you get for me?

225
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,200
Red wine.

226
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,760
Juat normal red wine?

227
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,680
Normal red wine?

228
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,480
That's the special wine of our bar.

229
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:39,720
Hey

230
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,680
Why are you taking me out to eat?

231
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:42,880
Well

232
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,920
You won't treat me with a meal?

233
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,000
As a thank you?

234
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:48,840
Oh well I can.

235
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:49,760
By the way

236
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,360
What do you want to eat?

237
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,920
Well

238
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,560
Can be a nearby restaurant.

239
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:56,680
Right.

240
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,400
Oh

241
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,240
You umm

242
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,320
Well, you live in a luxurious condo

243
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,080
but you don't have a car?

244
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,280
Oh

245
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,000
My car is-

246
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,560
Ohh I see.

247
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,400
I understand now.

248
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,320
A waiter like you

249
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,480
Hmmm

250
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,640
Might spend most money on the condo rental fee.

251
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,600
A waiter?

252
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,560
Why, yes.

253
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,600
Oh

254
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,000
Being a waiter

255
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,440
you earn a lot of money?

256
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,440
How are you able to live in such an expensive condo?

257
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,800
Stop now!

258
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,800
Hell no!

259
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,920
I've come this far.

260
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,800
Why are you guys so fast?

261
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,440
Come on look at you.

262
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:51,880
Why?

263
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,240
Being fat

264
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,040
is wrong?

265
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:54,920
Hey!

266
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,800
You barely escape us here. Shut up.

267
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,640
Go!

268
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:08,880
Don't move!

269
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,320
Stop resisting!

270
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:09,960
Let me go!

271
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,560
Wait..

272
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,160
Let me go!

273
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,160
What the hell?

274
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:12,920
What?

275
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,640
Where did he go?

276
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,560
He can vanish? How?

277
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,280
Stay away from me!

278
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,040
Don't touch me!

279
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:22,640
Stay away from me!

280
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,080
Go away!

281
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:23,880
Hey you calm down.

282
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,360
Mick?

283
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,880
Stay away from me!

284
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,560
Please calm down.

285
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,520
Stay away from me!

286
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,080
Mick!

287
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:28,920
God!

288
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,240
Poom!

289
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,680
Poom!

290
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,760
Poom!

291
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,800
How did you get here?

292
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,520
I don't know!

293
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,560
I woke up and these people already captured me!

294
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,480
We didn't capture you Sir.

295
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:51,960
He suddenly collapsed

296
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,520
convulsing

297
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,000
and then

298
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:53,440
stop moving.

299
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,560
We just tried to help.

300
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,040
After he woke up

301
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,360
he start screaming like this.

302
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,760
I'm so sorry about my friend.

303
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,360
And

304
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,400
thanks everyone for helping.

305
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:05,800
Thank you so much.

306
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,160
How are you feeling?

307
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,400
Poom.

308
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,120
I'm so glad

309
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,480
that you helped me.

310
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,120
Do you know that

311
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,200
now

312
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,680
in Vamp-

313
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,600
What?

314
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,000
in Vamp-

315
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,680
Mick!

316
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,320
Umm Mr.Waiter

317
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,440
About buying you a meal

318
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,480
let's do it later.

319
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,400
I just met my friend.

320
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,280
I umm

321
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,040
I will

322
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:30,760
take my friend

323
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,760
to run an errand first.

324
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,480
The vampire land-

325
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:33,960
Hey!

326
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,480
Hey! You!

327
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:35,760
Hey!

328
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,400
Where are you taking me to?

329
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,920
I can remember your face!

330
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,880
God what the hell

331
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,640
Bad luck this early?

332
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,280
Let me go!

333
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,320
Calm down.

334
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,560
Don't say it yet.

335
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,120
Why did you cover my mouth?

336
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,400
I almost got suffocated.

337
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,560
I'm sorry.

338
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,240
Well back there

339
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,440
You almost said that you were vampire.

340
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,800
Don't forget that

341
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,960
this is human land.

342
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,240
And you must not let anyone knows

343
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:02,840
that we are

344
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:03,880
vampires.

345
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,440
Really?

346
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,160
Yes.

347
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,400
I'm so sorry.

348
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,560
I was so excited.

349
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,640
Do you know?

350
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,120
When I was in the vampire land

351
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,480
my life was so difficult.

352
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,280
I miss you all of you.

353
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,760
One more thing

354
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,520
Before I ran away from the policeman-

355
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,120
Right right that's enough for now.

356
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,560
Let's talk about it later

357
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,320
when all of us

358
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:24,960
are together.

359
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:25,840
Ok?

360
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:26,720
For now

361
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,240
You come stay with me at my house first.

362
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,240
And in the evening

363
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,440
I will take you to meet the rest of us.

364
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,280
Really?

365
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:31,760
Yes.

366
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,840
You guys live together?

367
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:34,640
Oh my.

368
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,480
Then quickly take me there.

369
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,240
I miss you guys.

370
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,480
I'm dying to meet all of you.

371
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,040
Hey, Mick

372
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,520
Your horns.

373
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,160
Horns what?

374
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,080
Your horns are gone.

375
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,600
My horns.

376
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,360
Horns

377
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,160
Where did my horns go?

378
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,760
Where did it go?!

379
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,040
My horns gone?

380
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,200
It's ok.

381
00:20:59,080 --> 00:20:59,800
No horns

382
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,600
But still have me.

383
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,720
Thank you so much.

384
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,080
Poom.

385
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,200
What the hell?

386
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,760
I'm just kidding.

387
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,200
Come let's go.

388
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,320
But my horns.

389
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,320
Will it grow back?

390
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,400
Only a young vampire

391
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,400
you still let he escape?

392
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,840
What about the other in human land?

393
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,040
What is their status?

394
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,160
I already sent out my men to find their trace.

395
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,400
I will tell them to hurry up.

396
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,040
One more thing.

397
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,400
I've heard that

398
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,760
There's a group gathering the names to change
the city regulations.

399
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,760
I've heard of that as well.

400
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,200
But I'm not sure what the facts are.

401
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,360
Then go investigate.

402
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,160
When you know who is behind it, get rid of them.

403
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,160
Are you sure about that?

404
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,280
I think

405
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,840
everyone has the right to-

406
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,160
They don't have any right!

407
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,240
Even if they can gather the names

408
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,560
and hand them to the high council.

409
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,120
They can't change anything.

410
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,920
Because the final person who has to sigh the
approving

411
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,400
is the governor

412
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,160
If it's like what you say

413
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,280
we really don't have to do anything.

414
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,160
I give you a command. Do what I said.

415
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,880
I don't need your opinion.

416
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,440
If we don't handle them,

417
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,560
soon someone will do it again.

418
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,480
It will cause a mess.

419
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,880
Keep your mouth shut.

420
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,400
And follow my command.

421
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:44,920
GO.

422
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,240
Yes sir.

423
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,760
How are you guys doing?

424
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,080
I able to gather just a few names.

425
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,560
Most vampires

426
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,280
are afraid of General Lux authority.

427
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,320
That's why they don't sign the names.

428
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,560
I think

429
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,800
we should try to convince them again.

430
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,760
Just in case someone is still scared

431
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,760
we can explain the reasons to them again.

432
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,880
Hmm. That's a good idea.

433
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,440
However,

434
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,800
we still need a lot more of names

435
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,040
till it's enough to hand to the high conncil.

436
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,480
I think our hope

437
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,480
it getting low.

438
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,000
Come on.

439
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,360
Les't not be discouraged.

440
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,040
At least we have tried.

441
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,120
We still have a change to accomplish it.

442
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,200
But if we don't do anything

443
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,320
the change to success is zero percen.

444
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,720
In my opinion

445
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,480
even we can gather enough names

446
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,400
and the council approves it.

447
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,920
The final person who has to sigh the
approving

448
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:00,800
is

449
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:01,960
the governor.

450
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,160
I think, would it be better if we hand in the names straight to the governor?

451
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:05,880
Yes.

452
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,240
Let's hand it to the governor.

453
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,680
Don't wait for the high council to vote.

454
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,320
But the governor is on the vacation time.

455
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,280
We don't know when he will come back.

456
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,120
This is strange.

457
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:18,680
the governor.

458
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,360
normally he wouldn't be away this long.

459
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,040
But this is a few months already.

460
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,560
There's gonna be somthing

461
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,400
involve with General Lux.

462
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,360
Then

463
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,600
it may not be save for us right now.

464
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:31,720
If

465
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,600
General Lux knows this.

466
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,880
Hmm

467
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,240
How about

468
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,560
all of us

469
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,680
come stay at my home for awhile?

470
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,320
Just in case something happen, we would be able
to help each other.

471
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:43,760
What do you think?

472
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:47,360
Come on.

473
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,440
But the sunlight at your house is so strong.

474
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:53,600
It's ok.

475
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,720
I will tell the workers

476
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,520
to make the shade

477
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,480
the whole yard.

478
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,280
How about that?

479
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,080
Yes, don't worry.

480
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,120
I've never seen something like this before.

481
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,160
Yeah.

482
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,480
Come inside.

483
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,320
This is human world?

484
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,480
Yes.

485
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,160
Hey!

486
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:18,880
Zen!

487
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,040
Ran!

488
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,440
Jolie!

489
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,200
I miss you guys!

490
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:28,960
Hey!

491
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,840
You guys abbandoned me.

492
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:35,640
Wait.

493
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,120
Why are you wearing this outfit?

494
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,640
I don't know either.

495
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,000
At first,

496
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,600
I was chased by the vampire police

497
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,160
and suddenly appeared in this body.

498
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,240
Police

499
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,240
Yes

500
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:48,880
Mick

501
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:51,720
Mick

502
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,160
How did you come to be here son?

503
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,280
Son?

504
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,080
Yes

505
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,600
Son

506
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:58,720
Well,

507
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,440
I broke up with my husband.

508
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,400
And then

509
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,960
my husband took him to raise when he was so small.

510
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,200
And he wouldn't let me see him at all.

511
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,600
Poor Mick!

512
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,880
Son

513
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:10,680
Mick

514
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,320
Are you a security guard?

515
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,480
Why?

516
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,480
Why did your father say he would take good care of you?

517
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,920
he said he scraped up child support!

518
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,080
So why is end up like this?

519
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,760
Hmmm, pretending to be a good show off.

520
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,960
I'll call and scold him.

521
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,040
I'll blame him!

522
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,200
There's no need to do that.

523
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:27,800
Mom

524
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,200
Dad..

525
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,360
He's gone

526
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:37,880
Huhh?

527
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,440
Huhh?

528
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,960
Is he dead?

529
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,800
Yes, mom

530
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,120
I don't know what kind of disease he is.

531
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,720
Suddenly his tongue was stuck in his mouth.

532
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,760
Mick!

533
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,040
And I had to make a living for myself, Mom.

534
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,600
I'm struggling

535
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,160
wandering

536
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,600
living from hand to mouth

537
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,080
Poor boy!

538
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,640
Anything else?

539
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,640
There's nothing else, right?

540
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,840
It's hard enough, son.

541
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:08,720
Wait!

542
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:10,760
By the way,

543
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,320
how did you come to know him?

544
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,240
Umm

545
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,440
Well…

546
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Mick has helped me a long time ago.

547
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,720
That's right!

548
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,400
Yes

549
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,160
That's right!

550
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,840
Today I met him outside

551
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,040
so I brought him to the shop.

552
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:30,760
Really?

553
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,920
So I invited him

554
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,800
to work at our shop.

555
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,080
Come work at the shop.

556
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:41,000
Oh, thank you very much.

557
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:42,600
If that's the case,

558
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,680
I'll excuse me for a moment.

559
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,480
I'll go make a place for him to sleep first.

560
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,760
Or you can sleep in the same room as me.

561
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,120
Well, I can't.

562
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,600
Why not?

563
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,040
Umm Well!

564
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,480
I'm all grown up now!

565
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,360
and my voice is cracked now.

566
00:27:59,040 --> 00:27:59,560
Huh?

567
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,560
But Mick

568
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,000
Auntie Kaew

569
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,360
I'll let Mick sleep in another room.

570
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,240
There's a spare room.

571
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,360
Yes!

572
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,680
Can not!

573
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,360
Auntie Kaew

574
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,760
As a teenager, we'd like to have some personal space.

575
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,480
Yes

576
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,720
I'm a full-fledged man.

577
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,720
If you say so

578
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,920
Oh, I have to thank you once again.

579
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,920
Then I'll go make Mick's bed first.

580
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,680
There's space next to the trash can

581
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,920
I'll clear it up for you.

582
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,640
Thank you

583
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:30,520
Love it!

584
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,360
Mick

585
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,040
Son

586
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,320
Next to the trash can

587
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,800
Oh, Mom, that's enough.

588
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,240
I'm so happy

589
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,400
Ouch!

590
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,680
Suddenly, I got a Mom.

591
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,440
How?

592
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:42,760
Yeah!

593
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,200
Leave about your mom for later.

594
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,680
What about the police?

595
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,480
Right!

596
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,040
Right!

597
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,080
You guys

598
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:53,840
General Luke

599
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,880
He sent his men to capture us and punish us.

600
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,440
Your parents

601
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,120
asked me to tell you

602
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,960
to be careful.

603
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,360
Now

604
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,640
they are looking for ways to help us.

605
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,400
So, Will we survive?

606
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,560
Don't survive

607
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:12,880
Hey!

608
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,320
If you don't survive, you have to survive.

609
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,080
We've arrived in the human city.

610
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,880
We can retreat now.

611
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,280
Well

612
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,440
One more thing,

613
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:22,800
You guys

614
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,840
haven't eaten any blood yet, right?

615
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:24,880
Yes

616
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,640
right!

617
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,240
We didn't go out anywhere.

618
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,320
At first,

619
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,480
I thought I was going to drink Auntie Kaew's blood.

620
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,520
That was a good idea!

621
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,560
Are you crazy?

622
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:33,760
Can not!

623
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,400
That's my mom.

624
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:35,840
Hey!

625
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,240
Why are you getting too emotional?

626
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,040
Mom of the body owner

627
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:38,840
not your mom!

628
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:41,000
Well, but it's not a good idea.

629
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:41,960
You look at her.

630
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,280
When she's breathing, she's still tired.

631
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,920
So what should we do?

632
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,080
Why are you so overacting?

633
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,800
I have a place to take you guys.

634
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,480
From now on,

635
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,160
we don't have to drink blood.

636
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,680
So what do we drink?

637
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,920
Whatever!

638
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,760
Just hurry and take us there!

639
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,280
Hurry!

640
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,080
But you're going to let me go with this outfit.

641
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,080
Stop my friend

642
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:15,600
You're not going anywhere.

643
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,520
You need to stay and talk to your mom first.

644
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,880
Otherwise our secret will surely be revealed.

645
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,680
Hey! It's not fair!

646
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,640
When you came to the human city, you came before me.

647
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,040
Now, are you going to leave me again?

648
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,240
Come on!

649
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,240
We have a lot of time to live in the human world.

650
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:31,840
Well

651
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,440
It's just the first day you're here.

652
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,840
You can drink blood after.

653
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,640
Guys! Let's go!

654
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,160
I'll take you next time.

655
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,320
Go

656
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:03,680
Oh!

657
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,120
That's awesome.

658
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,080
Is this a human city bar

659
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,240
like this?

660
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,360
You talk like

661
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,120
you're in a vampire city

662
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,200
and you've never been to a pub.

663
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,600
You guys

664
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,560
contain yourself!

665
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,520
Our secret will soon be busted!

666
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,880
Hello!

667
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,480
Hi

668
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,080
Do you have table yet?

669
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:23,800
Table

670
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,440
Do we have to bring a table?

671
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,520
Well, that is

672
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,080
We don't have it.

673
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,400
Will there be an available table?

674
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,240
Sure!

675
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,680
Then customers, please come this way.

676
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,440
Please follow me.

677
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:36,720
Yes

678
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,240
What kind of crazy table is this?

679
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:38,800
Oh

680
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,760
Well, I just don't know it.

681
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:48,640
Excuse me!

682
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,400
Isn't the other waiter coming?

683
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,160
Oh! There he is!

684
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:53,680
Excuse me!

685
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,200
Waiter

686
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,080
Come here quickly.

687
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,600
Sorry!

688
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,440
This person isn't a waiter.

689
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,480
But he's a bar owner.

690
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,320
Go! Go take care  of other customers.

691
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,600
Hello Sir!

692
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,120
Is there anything this waiter

693
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:17,960
can do for you?

694
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,240
I need to say sorry.

695
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,600
I misunderstood

696
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:22,800
Well

697
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,280
I'd like

698
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,320
a bottle of the wine

699
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,080
you gave me last night.

700
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,600
Last night's red wine

701
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,720
We sell it by the glass.

702
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,240
Then

703
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,040
give me 4 glasses.

704
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:36,520
Sure!

705
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,240
Please give me a moment.

706
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,160
Bar owner?

707
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,400
He's acting like a waiter.

708
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,120
Here is

709
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,120
your red wine.

710
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,520
Chin!

711
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,320
Contain yourself!

712
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:14,880
Chin!

713
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:24,960
I think

714
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,160
he likes you.

715
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,280
Umm

716
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,200
Whh What?

717
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,520
Are you crazy?

718
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:31,920
Like me?

719
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,400
Nonsense!

720
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,800
t's better to drink wine.

721
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:38,480
Come!

722
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:39,480
Cheer!

723
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,840
There's no need to hurry, guys.

724
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:50,880
Just walk slowly

725
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:51,840
Catch!

726
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,160
Okay

727
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,000
Will this be good?

728
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:55,720
Good!

729
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,800
Believe me!

730
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,040
Are you ready?

731
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,280
If it doesn't work,

732
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,840
your skin will definitely get burned.

733
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:01,400
True

734
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:01,840
Come!

735
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:05,400
123

736
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:18,560
Why are you screaming?

737
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,440
It's nothing!

738
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,400
You guys stepped on my feet!!

739
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,240
Oh! I think what is wrong with you?

740
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,320
But it's okay to be nothing!

741
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,800
Yeah!

742
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:33,680
Mick!

743
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:36,280
How can you act so close to them like this?

744
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:39,440
But

745
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,280
Mom...

746
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:40,840
No! But

747
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,000
Mom, I...

748
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,240
Don't speak.

749
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,320
Come help mom in the house now.

750
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:45,720
But

751
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:47,440
Mom!

752
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,000
Mom

753
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,200
Ouch! It's twisted like a motorcycle!

754
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:54,640
Go!!

755
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:55,560
Mick! Sorry!

756
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,800
Hey!

757
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,080
I told you

758
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:05,960
it worked.

759
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,320
You keep doing it, Mick.

760
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,280
Poom

761
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,080
What are you going to do

762
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,560
with your life right now?

763
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:29,840
You're the worst.

764
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:31,840
Umm

765
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,520
No job

766
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,240
No place for living

767
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:39,280
Or you can come live with us.

768
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,760
Right!

769
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,040
No!!

770
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,520
I'm the one who invited you guys to come.

771
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,280
Do I still have to relied on you guys?

772
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,200
I'll make my life better.

773
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,280
Why are you so proud of your dignity?

774
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,280
I'm not arrogant.

775
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,000
But you try to think about it first.

776
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,840
I came here

777
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,760
so I could become human again.

778
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,200
I'll make my life better.

779
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:07,960
I've already thought

780
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,040
about what I'm going to do.

781
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,160
Please!!

782
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,120
Please take me to work.

783
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,880
Please!

784
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,720
But my bar is small

785
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,200
and all staffed.

786
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,120
I don't take a lot of money.

787
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:32,760
I can take half

788
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,920
of your waiter

789
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,840
But I'd like some red wine

790
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,000
every 15 days. Is that possible?

791
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,840
Did you hear what I said?

792
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,880
I'm not hiring any more waiter.

793
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,960
There are no more vacant positions.

794
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:45,920
But!

795
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,040
I'm

796
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,280
very good at serving,

797
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,280
come to work every day

798
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:50,720
without leave

799
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:50,960
no slack off

800
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,600
no shirk

801
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,400
Please hire me.

802
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:57,360
Please!!

803
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,680
Please

804
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,440
Please

805
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,160
Don't you believe me?

806
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:05,680
You'd better watch out!

807
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:07,480
Come on!

808
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,720
I'll serve it.

809
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,040
Which table?

810
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:15,920
Table 3

811
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,760
Where is table 3?

812
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:21,800
Well, I think

813
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,000
I'd better go serve myself.

814
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,920
I just

815
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,640
don't know the table.

816
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,720
When I knew that

817
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,040
I was very good at serving.

818
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:35,920
If I know

819
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,840
Rapidly!!

820
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,960
Customers won't wait long at all.

821
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,080
Please!

822
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,680
I beg you

823
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:43,160
Please take me to work.

824
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,960
Please!!

825
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,400
Please

826
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:00,880
Peek-a-boo

827
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,880
How did you get in here?

828
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,080
How did I get in doesn't matter.

829
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,800
The matter thing is

830
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,160
will you hire me to work or not?

831
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:09,400
No!

832
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,200
Yes

833
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:10,720
No!

834
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:11,240
Yes

835
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:11,960
No!

836
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,440
Please say yes!

837
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,680
I really want to work in your bar.

838
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,920
Please!!

839
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,920
I said no!

840
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,120
Please!

841
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,560
Please say yes!

842
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,480
Hey you!

843
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,000
Please say yes!

844
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:34,920
Hey Bro!

845
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:39,960
I don't see anyone.

846
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,120
Damn!

847
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,520
You think you can escape me?

848
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,480
Who are you hiding from?

849
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,360
I hid that perverted man who asked for a job.

850
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,240
Oh, really?

851
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:32,960
Yes

852
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,560
What kind of person

853
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,360
doesn't know how to be so stubborn?

854
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,640
Said I didn't hire him and still wanted to work.

855
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,000
So why don't you hire it?

856
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,600
There are no more vacant positions.

857
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,080
Hey!

858
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,360
Please hire me!

859
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,800
Please hire me!

860
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,520
Listen!

861
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,600
No!

862
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:55,440
Yes!

863
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,120
No!

864
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,080
Noooo!!!

865
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:58,480
Yes!

866
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,400
Please!!

867
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,000
Hey! Wait!

868
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,080
So you still don't have a job

869
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,280
or a new place to live?

870
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,320
What are you doing? I'm really asking.

871
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,720
In a few days you'll have to move out.

872
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,800
Do you think you'd be a little eager for me?

873
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,360
You stop complaining me first.

874
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,840
I'm trying.

875
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,200
Trying?

876
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:23,800
How do you try?

877
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,920
I see you going to bar every day.

878
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:26,720
What are you going to do?

879
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,000
Come on!

880
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,480
I have my own way.

881
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,000
And if you still don't have a job

882
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
or a place to live?

883
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,240
What am I going to do with your life?

884
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,120
You can't go to my house.

885
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,160
There's no room for you anymore.

886
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:46,880
Hey!

887
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,600
I knew it!

888
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,320
you go to stay at the temple.

889
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,000
Go live with monk

890
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,960
and eat rice from the alms bowl to survive.

891
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,320
I think this way will

892
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,000
work!

893
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:58,760
Stop it!

894
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,880
Can you stop

895
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,080
thinking about it for now?

896
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,440
If the heart is tired

897
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,640
Fingers crossed!

898
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,000
In 2 more days you have to move out.

899
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,520
You asked him to postpone it for a week.

900
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,560
Don't you remember?

901
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,800
What about your money? It's run out, right?

902
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,320
I won't lend it to you.

903
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,280
Don't look at me like that.

904
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,400
Or do you like this one more?

905
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,000
No

906
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,080
I've got snacks now.

907
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,720
What are you guys doing?

908
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,760
I choose souvenirs

909
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,160
souvenirs?

910
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,640
What is the souvenirs?

911
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:52,120
It's a wedding souvenirs!

912
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:52,840
Wedding

913
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:56,760
Whose wedding is it?

914
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,080
So who will get married?

915
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,560
You really don't know?

916
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,240
Haven't you noticed anything?

917
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,480
Notice?

918
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,320
Oh!

919
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,680
Is it my mom?

920
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,600
Or the body owner's mom

921
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,480
is about to remarry?

922
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,800
I just got a new mom.

923
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:14,800
So I have to get a new father too?

924
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:15,440
Stop!

925
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:19,920
You're about to get married.

926
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,880
Silently!

927
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,440
Are the two of you getting married?

928
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,360
When are you going to make love?

929
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:27,360
Or since

930
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:29,760
he came down to the human city?

931
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,120
You're just starting to play overacting, right?

932
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,640
You're as irritable as ever.

933
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,320
keep calm!

934
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,360
I told you

935
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,160
the owner of the body that

936
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,360
they were in a relationship,

937
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,360
so we had to get along together.

938
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,080
really

939
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,320
I don't think

940
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,280
both of you

941
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,400
who secretly have feelings for each other.

942
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,360
No!

943
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:57,520
I think that's right.

944
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,440
I think you'd better hurry and get to work.

945
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,000
Then I'll call your mom to take care of it.

946
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,320
That's it.

947
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,200
Both of you are embarrassed.

948
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:07,600
See!

949
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:08,840
You're embarrassed.

950
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:10,080
And you're embarrassed too.

951
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:11,000
Hey!

952
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,120
Are the both of you embarrassed?

953
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:13,160
Auntie Kaew

954
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,040
Tom doesn't work, Auntie Kaew.

955
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:16,240
Auntie Kaew

956
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:17,360
My mom!

957
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:18,520
Auntie Kaew

958
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,080
Are you shy?

959
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:21,120
I knew it!

960
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,040
I think...

961
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:33,280
better to go choose something.

962
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:34,520
Umm

963
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:05,080
What?

964
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:07,680
Come on!

965
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,080
You acted like

966
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,600
you were shocked last night.

967
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:13,440
What?

968
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,400
What was it last night?

969
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:19,960
Do I still have to say it?

970
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:21,800
Here

971
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:24,760
I'm yours now.

972
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,560
You're responsible for me.

973
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,320
What are you responsible for?

974
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:30,160
Hey

975
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:31,800
This is the first time

976
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:32,880
since I came to the city.

977
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:35,720
City

978
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:38,280
Come to the city,

979
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,400
left the farm, left the rice field to find the dream.

980
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:41,280
Enough!

981
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,200
How will you be responsible?

982
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,960
You must take me as a waiter

983
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:50,920
and give me red wine

984
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:51,920
every 15 days.

985
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:52,800
Huh?

986
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:53,760
You don't have to say Huh!

987
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:55,320
Agreed to that.

988
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,720
Let's disperse and bring those children back.

989
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:37,000
If they resist, you can have them take you back.

990
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:38,560
Yes, Sir!

991
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:40,000
GO

992
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,040
Separate!
