1
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,720
Come on, I know you know?

2
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,440
that you

3
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,840
have a crush on my friend, Jolie

4
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,040
If you help me with this,

5
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,560
I will help you with Jolie

6
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,040
I'm yours now.

7
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,120
You must take responsibility for me.

8
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,280
And how do you want me to?

9
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,920
You have to accept me as waiter in your bar,

10
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,320
and give that red wine to me every 15 days.

11
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:15,960
Poom.

12
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,400
Are you looking for a job now?

13
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,800
If you interested

14
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,600
I just opened my new company.

15
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,480
Sorry but I already accepted Poom to work with me.

16
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,720
If you aren't being serious,

17
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,360
we don't have to get married.

18
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,160
I feel uncomfortable with this faking couple.

19
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,840
I have a task for you.

20
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,120
It's about Mr.Wichan

21
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,000
The location here is perfect.

22
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,160
I want it.

23
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,160
Those two are the owners of the shop.

24
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,320
The two have just opened the shop for over a year.

25
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,000
Building up a fortunes, I see.

26
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,080
Very well.

27
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,760
Go negotiate with them about selling this place to me.

28
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,960
What if they reject Sir?

29
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,520
If they reject,

30
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,720
the solution is easy

31
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,280
just kill them.

32
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,560
I give you one week.

33
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,680
Get this place for me no matter what.

34
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,840
Yes sir.

35
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,520
Let's go.

36
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,040
You stay away from her.

37
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,320
No no.

38
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,920
You're just passing by don't you dare.

39
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,400
Oh well.

40
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,480
You have bodyguards now?

41
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,120
No, no stop that.

42
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,760
Stop joking and come here!

43
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,760
Hurry up!

44
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,280
May I excuse myself for a moment, please?

45
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,440
I’ll be right back.

46
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,000
Oh of course.

47
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,080
Come here.

48
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,800
Mix. Mix.

49
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,040
What?

50
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:11,880
What happened?

51
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,200
Just come here first.

52
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,400
What?

53
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,200
What's the matter, Jolie?

54
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,200
What's the matter?

55
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,080
Yeah, what happened?

56
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,640
I..

57
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,080
I saw a vampire, it was Wichan!

58
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,080
What?

59
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:26,800
Really?

60
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,040
Wichan.

61
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,240
Who is he?

62
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,600
And why would you act surprised?

63
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,440
Well,

64
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,800
I saw you act like that so I did too.

65
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,760
You guys

66
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,440
have never studied about

67
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,040
the history of vampire land before?

68
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,360
No.

69
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,320
I knew it.

70
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,000
Well, Wichan

71
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,240
he had rebelled once.

72
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,880
Aimed to conquer the vampire land,

73
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,080
but didn't succeed.

74
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,120
However, according to the history

75
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,040
he is already dead.

76
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,040
But I can remember his face.

77
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,680
There is one in the book.

78
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,920
It looks just like

79
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,960
the man I saw at the front of the shop.

80
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,120
Really?

81
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,680
Are you sure about that?

82
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,320
What if you misremember him with someone else?

83
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,920
No, I’m sure about it.

84
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,080
Or

85
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,360
he’s just the parallel body

86
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,160
just like the one that we’re living in now.

87
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,040
Hmm.

88
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,000
Oh yeah.

89
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,040
That's true.

90
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,800
You don't have to worry about that Jolie.

91
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,160
What you should be worried

92
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,960
isn’t, a vampire, Wichan

93
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,120
but those two.

94
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,520
The two men over there.

95
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,760
Oh yeah.

96
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,280
It's so hard being a beautiful lady.

97
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,080
Oh please,

98
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:39,800
where did you get that failed belief from?

99
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,920
-where did you get that failed belief from?
-What?

100
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,160
You silly men.

101
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,280
Hands off.

102
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:48,880
No, you hand off.

103
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,760
Your hands aren't dirty? Are you sure about that?

104
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,680
Hell yes.

105
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,800
Oh, Jolie

106
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,280
about

107
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,000
umm.

108
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,680
About the date of our date.

109
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,480
What date should we pick?

110
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,480
Who will go on a date with you?

111
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,560
Jolie

112
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,560
will go on a date with me!

113
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,120
Right, Jolie?

114
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,880
Yes.

115
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,360
How about this?

116
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,400
Today

117
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,240
Maai

118
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,520
and Chin

119
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,640
will have to help Jolie live to sell the product.

120
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,480
Who can make more sales,

121
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,200
I will go on a date with that person.

122
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,120
Oh of course Jolie!

123
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,560
Mr.Chin

124
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,840
will help you

125
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,160
make the best sales of all time!

126
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,120
The best

127
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,800
sales ever.

128
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,920
Yeah?

129
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,760
A man like you will make that good sale?

130
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,040
You glib musician.

131
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,920
Don’t worry Jolie.

132
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,320
I am the best salesman.

133
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,040
I will make all the products sold out!

134
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,640
Yeah? I will look forward to that.

135
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,720
Whether a water filter salesman like you

136
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,400
could do like what your babble.

137
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,280
Wait and see.

138
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,720
How about

139
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,560
I

140
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,320
give both of you 30 minutes each?

141
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,080
Who get more orders

142
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,360
will be the winner.

143
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,200
What are you doing?

144
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,400
What? Are you scared?

145
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,440
No, I am not.

146
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,560
But what did you do?

147
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,760
Waking you up.

148
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,320
Walking me up?

149
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,680
It's late now

150
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,720
and I am hungry.

151
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,520
You have to make a breakfast for me.

152
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,760
Huh?

153
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,320
Do I have to cook?

154
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,080
Yes.

155
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,280
And why should I?

156
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,240
Well,

157
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,040
I’m a househusband

158
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,600
and you're the housewife.

159
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,920
Ridiculous.

160
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,200
Who's the housewife huh?

161
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,560
Will you do it or not?

162
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,320
No.

163
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,840
Are you sure?

164
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,320
Very.

165
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,480
Hey!

166
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,080
Let go of me.

167
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,200
What are you doing?

168
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,400
Will you do it or not?

169
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,720
Hm?

170
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,840
No.

171
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,920
No?

172
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,400
Well.

173
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,440
What would you do huh?

174
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,480
Very well.

175
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,120
Let go of me!

176
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,440
I won't cook.

177
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:25,560
Ok ok.

178
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,200
Ok I surrender.

179
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,600
It isn't that hard is it?

180
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,240
Get off me

181
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,480
so I could start doing it.

182
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,640
Actually we can do it here.

183
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,720
You pervert.

184
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,160
I mean cooking.

185
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,760
Cooking huh?

186
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,400
What a cutie.

187
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,960
Are you full?

188
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,120
Take your shirt off.

189
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,280
Take off for what?

190
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,760
I will take care of your wounds.

191
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,240
I can do it myself.

192
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:57,920
Captain?!

193
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,520
Turn around.

194
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,680
This

195
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,240
is the medicine from human land.

196
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,720
They said if you apply this your wounds will heal.

197
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,080
Turn around.

198
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,880
Well, on the front

199
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,240
you apply it yourself then.

200
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,680
I have something to tend to.

201
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,400
Yes sir.

202
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,840
Here.

203
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,000
Oh,

204
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,720
looks delicious.

205
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:45,800
Shut up.

206
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,400
Start eating already.

207
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,200
What?

208
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,560
This's how you speak to your boss?

209
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,400
I will deduct your salary.

210
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,320
Go ahead. You I don't care.

211
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,040
This's good.

212
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,280
Just fried them.

213
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,600
I didn't do much.

214
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,000
Oh, even just frying them

215
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,040
still not delicious.

216
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:20,520
Hey!

217
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,600
Just kidding.

218
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,080
It's really delicious.

219
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,280
Of course.

220
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,680
Back then when I was in-

221
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,720
When I was in the city yeah.

222
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,800
I cooked delicious foods.

223
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,160
Aren't you always living in the city?

224
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,280
Yeah

225
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,880
whatever just forget about it.

226
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:44,240
Hey, I've been working with you for a while.

227
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,040
How is it?

228
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,360
How is my working performance?

229
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,200
It's ok.

230
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,680
Hey, It is almost the day

231
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,040
that I have to drink your special red wine.

232
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,760
Why?

233
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,240
Why are you want to drink it?

234
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,720
Is there something I should know?

235
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,680
No nothing.

236
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,880
It's just delicious.

237
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,000
So I want to drink it again.

238
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,880
But I wonder

239
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,640
about your special red wine.

240
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,440
Why?

241
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,720
Why don't you promote it to sell?

242
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,600
It takes awhile for someone to order it.

243
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,360
The making process is hard

244
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:24,680
and

245
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,600
it's expensive.

246
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,720
Moreover, it's a special recipe.

247
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,240
If you aren't wealthy enough.

248
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,400
you won't be able to order one.

249
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:33,240
It's indeed expensive.

250
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,800
The day that I had it with my friends,

251
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,160
I almost went broke.

252
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,240
Only wealthy people

253
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,640
who could afford it.

254
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,880
Well, it's a special recipe

255
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,280
For special people.

256
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,000
But

257
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,040
you have to give it to me

258
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,880
free no charge for my money later.

259
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,200
According to our deal.

260
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,480
I don't know.

261
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,040
I have to see if you behave well or not.

262
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,800
Pool will be your good boy.

263
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,560
Please.

264
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,960
Please Patrick.

265
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,600
I will be your good boy. I promise.

266
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,920
Pretty please.

267
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,640
Poom will behave well like a good boy.

268
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,960
Please Patrick, please.

269
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,360
Yeah yeah.

270
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,440
Just eat.

271
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,480
Do you think who among the two will win?

272
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,800
What are you doing?

273
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,280
No.

274
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,560
Nothing.

275
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,040
Hmm answer right together?

276
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,600
Suspicious.

277
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,480
Suspicious what?

278
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,080
Well,

279
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:46,640
here

280
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,400
I assign you to

281
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,160
serve the dessert and drink to the customer.

282
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,360
Yes.

283
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,920
You go serve it.

284
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,680
Hurry up the customer is waiting.

285
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,440
I feel like you are chasing me away.

286
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:57,880
Chasing what?

287
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,000
You have to go anywhere.

288
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,080
Go.

289
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,120
Just go.

290
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,240
Fine I will go.

291
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,680
But just a moment before,

292
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,920
I saw you

293
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,000
kissing his cheek.

294
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,240
Why did you do that?

295
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,720
Why?

296
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,880
Everyone already knows that we are a couple.

297
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,960
You don't like it?

298
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,360
No, I don't.

299
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,800
Oh and last night who did-

300
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,800
Stop.

301
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,360
I don't want to talk with you anymore.

302
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,200
And for today,

303
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,320
Thai desserts

304
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,040
are already sold out.

305
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,280
Thank you so much for

306
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,760
supporting and ordering from us.

307
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,960
We will see you guys again next live.

308
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,520
Bye bye.

309
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,280
What do you think Jolie?

310
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,560
I told you

311
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,480
that I'm very good at selling.

312
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,400
Oh well,

313
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,920
don't be sad ok?

314
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,760
You just

315
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,640
have to accept that you lose.

316
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,400
Yeah yeah.

317
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,960
I'm manly enough.

318
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:18,360
Chin, are you sure that you will be fine?

319
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,000
Of course I am sure.

320
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,120
I lose.

321
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,200
I have to accept that I lose.

322
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,120
But if there's next time,

323
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,720
I won't give up!

324
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,360
Let's not waste our time, Jolie.

325
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,120
Let's go

326
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,640
on a date.

327
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,200
Oh then I will start cleaning up first.

328
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,600
Oh no no no.

329
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,240
I think

330
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,520
let the loser

331
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,400
clean it up.

332
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,160
Yeah

333
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,480
whatever.

334
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,800
You better get going.

335
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,920
Don't worry.

336
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,200
I will take care of everything here.

337
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,080
Thank you so much.

338
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,920
Thank you.

339
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,840
Let's go Jolie.

340
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,440
Oh Jolie,

341
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,520
you won't take your phone with you?

342
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,400
Thank you very much.

343
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,840
Oh, Kin.

344
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,920
Yes, I'm free.

345
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,520
Alright

346
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,400
see you there.

347
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,520
Where are you going?

348
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,880
Meeting up with Kin.

349
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,160
What about the house chores?

350
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,200
You finished them all?

351
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,400
I do finish them all, Boss.

352
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,560
But I think you-

353
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,840
No i won't do that.

354
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,640
If you want to

355
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,840
do anything

356
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,800
or

357
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,200
do whatever,

358
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,400
You go ahead and do it yourself.

359
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,200
Where did he go?

360
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,520
I'm sorry!

361
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,040
-Chin!
-Patrick?!

362
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,160
What are you doing here?

363
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,680
I'm here for running.

364
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,920
You? A man like you

365
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,680
would come for running in the park?

366
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,240
Just tell me.

367
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,280
Why are you here.

368
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,040
You keep asking me huh?

369
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,160
What about you? Why are you here?

370
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,880
Well,

371
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,720
I'm here to look for Jolie

372
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,520
and Maai

373
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,240
friend of your dating partner.

374
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,680
Damn.

375
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,400
He won in selling live.

376
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,240
That's why he is on a date with Jolie.

377
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,600
I don't like this. I don't like it at all.

378
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,640
Yeah.

379
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,960
I hate it.

380
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,600
Why would they come here?

381
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,840
Only two of them.

382
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,120
Yeah.

383
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,720
Why would they come

384
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,000
together.

385
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,800
I think you didn't mean about Jolie and Maai.

386
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,520
You're here looking for Poom right?!

387
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,040
Yes,

388
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,760
you smart ass.

389
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,080
By the way, have you seen Poom?

390
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,480
Poom?

391
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,160
No, I haven't.

392
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,640
I never imagined

393
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,240
that

394
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,680
You will be a man like this.

395
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,720
Like this?

396
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,400
Like how?

397
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,400
A man who's here to picnic

398
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,040
and cook.

399
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,600
I think it's relaxing

400
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,800
and

401
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,560
I don't like going to the mall that much.

402
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,440
Oh me too.

403
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,520
Hmm

404
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,640
really?

405
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,440
So it's mean

406
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,760
that we

407
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,760
have so much in common.

408
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,440
Just like Kiw.

409
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,000
He also likes something like this.

410
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,720
Poom,

411
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,200
well

412
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:58,840
If my brother

413
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,680
had done something bad to you,

414
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,760
I want to be the one who fixes it for you.

415
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,440
I want to-

416
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,040
Poom!

417
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,040
Jolie?

418
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,960
Maai?

419
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,400
Come sit with us.

420
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,440
Kin

421
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,960
can we let my friends join us?

422
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,920
Oh of course.

423
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,640
Come take a seat.

424
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,640
Come come.

425
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,360
Thank you so much.

426
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,240
Oh

427
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,320
Kin this is Kin.

428
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,200
And this is Jolie

429
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,800
and Maai.

430
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,240
Nice to meet you.

431
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,560
On it's noon already.

432
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,920
How about we have lunch together?

433
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,240
Oh will it be ok?

434
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,280
By the way

435
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,840
do you have enough foods for four people?

436
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,640
Oh, of course.

437
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,000
I brought a lot of foods

438
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,080
because I don't know

439
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,520
what's Poom's favorite

440
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,040
Hey Are you planning to flirt with my friend?

441
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,320
What flirting?

442
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,040
Come

443
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,400
let's eat.

444
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,320
Come come.

445
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:12,680
Oh

446
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:13,960
suspicious.

447
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,880
What? How are they together?

448
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,480
What should we do bro?

449
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,760
I don't know

450
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,360
but it's annoying.

451
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,240
Agree.

452
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,640
Hey, Chin?

453
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,960
Do you know the other two?

454
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,560
What other two?

455
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,720
Well, that's Jolie and Maai

456
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,760
friend of your dating partner.

457
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,520
No, not them.

458
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,640
These two.

459
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,960
I don't know them.

460
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:57,960
The hell?

461
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,680
Why do those two

462
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,640
follow them like us?

463
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,920
Yeah, why?

464
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,080
That's them.

465
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:13,880
Yes.

466
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,520
Wait for the right time

467
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,960
and we will capture them.

468
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,960
Where did they go?

469
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,560
Yes. Where did they go?

470
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,920
They were so fast.

471
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,640
We have to warn them.

472
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,600
Go go.

473
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,320
Hey you guys.

474
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,520
What? What are you doing here?

475
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,040
Yes! What are you doing here?

476
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:44,960
Don't tell me

477
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,040
that you guys have been stalking us!

478
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,320
Oh definitely!

479
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,800
Who follows?

480
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,320
Normally, Chin and I

481
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,000
exercise regularly

482
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,320
Is that right? Chin

483
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,680
Oh, that's right.

484
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,640
Workout

485
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,720
Strong

486
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,160
Well, don't care about us.

487
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,320
I have something to tell you.

488
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,600
I saw two guys

489
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,480
acting secretly

490
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,720
watching you.

491
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:15,840
Yes

492
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,040
I really saw

493
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,960
New two guys acting secretly.

494
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,160
And then it's like they said....

495
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,000
It's like I heard....

496
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:21,920
What?

497
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,880
What?

498
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,080
It must be right.

499
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,520
Definitely the right one.

500
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,040
We must capture!

501
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,200
General Lux.

502
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,160
He sent his subordinates to catch and punish us.

503
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,560
All of your parents

504
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,080
asked me to tell you

505
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,920
to be better watch out.

506
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,400
Jolie

507
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,320
Please come with me.

508
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,480
They're just looking

509
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,280
for an excuse.

510
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,360
Right!

511
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,320
Who's coming to sneak a peek?

512
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,440
Who will come to capture us?

513
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,840
We don't have any enemies.

514
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,960
Right! Jolie

515
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,840
Kin

516
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,480
If you will excuse us

517
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,800
We have an appointment.

518
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,200
Right!

519
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,040
Yes!

520
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,480
I forgot

521
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,520
yes

522
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,320
An...

523
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,320
appointment,

524
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:02,360
we have to help with a friend's wedding.

525
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,040
Jolie

526
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:03,600
Go

527
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,240
Hurry!

528
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,520
Hurry! Jolie!

529
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,400
Why are they in a hurry?

530
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,040
I'm sure it must be the police.

531
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,800
They found us.

532
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,080
What should we do?

533
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,120
When I'm the only one left.

534
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,600
The police kept chasing me and wouldn't let me go.

535
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,320
There is absolutely no way for us to escape.

536
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,640
To be saved

537
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,040
we must become human.

538
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,960
So what?

539
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,040
Are you going to trick other people into loving you

540
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,080
So you'll do the same thing that they've done to you?.

541
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,760
Well, I'm telling the truth.

542
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,680
Even we don't want to be a vampire at all.

543
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,720
what are you going to do to someone else?

544
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,080
I think it's not right!

545
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,360
But it's our only way!

546
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,920
Is that all you can think of?

547
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,520
Why don't you think about fighting?

548
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,720
So do you think we can fight?

549
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,800
Even if we can't fight but we'll try!

550
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,760
Enough

551
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,080
Enough!

552
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,600
Why are you arguing?

553
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,120
Poom

554
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,560
If you're thinking of doing something like that.

555
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,080
I won't deny!

556
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,480
But no matter what

557
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,680
we'll fight

558
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,960
even if we lose, we'll fight.

559
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,680
Right!

560
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,000
If we lose, we'll die.

561
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,360
If we're captured, we'll die anyway.

562
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,200
Losing and dying is more dignified than being captured and then having to be killed.

563
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,160
Umm...

564
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,040
Tell me

565
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,440
Where is the insignia?

566
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,920
You think I'm going to tell you?

567
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,000
If I were to tell you,

568
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,680
I would have told you a long time ago.

569
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,200
Watch your mouth

570
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,960
Do you want to die?

571
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,400
If you want to die,

572
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,680
just tell me

573
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,200
where you hid the insignia.

574
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,600
But before you die,

575
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:09,400
you'll conduct a ceremony to appoint me as governor.

576
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,120
Then you'll die as you please.

577
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,520
Dream on!

578
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,400
People like you,

579
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,040
No matter how many 100 years it takes you,

580
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,640
you'll never be able to lead

581
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,800
the vampire city.

582
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,920
Drag it out!

583
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,680
And watch him,

584
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,720
it, I'll make him suffer until  he's unbearable.

585
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,240
Drag it

586
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,800
General Lux

587
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,120
is Looking for a insignia.

588
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,920
We have to do something.

589
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,760
What can we do?

590
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,720
Because the police are all allies with the generals.

591
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,760
As for the other citizens,

592
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,840
I don't think

593
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,640
anyone dares stand up against the general.

594
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,320
Or...

595
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,120
I think we shouldn't just overthink about it.

596
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,520
There must be someone who isn't afraid of the general.

597
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,280
We must

598
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:30,240
gather our forces and make a plan

599
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,520
to defeat General Lux.

600
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,920
Umm...

601
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,680
There were also police who disagreed with the general.

602
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,920
We must gather as many of these officers

603
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,520
as possible to our side.

604
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,920
So that we can know as many secrets as possible.

605
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,960
Poom

606
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,000
Poom

607
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,200
What's wrong?

608
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,320
No!

609
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,120
Nothing

610
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:18,840
I can see that

611
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,640
you're space out!

612
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,680
or have you been slacking off?

613
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,880
I haven't!

614
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,600
Wait!

615
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,960
I'm going to work.

616
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,680
I'll go serve right away.

617
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,280
Here's your drinks!

618
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:49,840
Hi!

619
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,680
Have you now fallen to the point of having to become a waiter?

620
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,960
Have we known each other before?

621
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,280
Are you pretending to forget

622
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,400
or are you embarrassed?

623
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,720
I'll tell you something.

624
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,520
My boyfriend

625
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,640
won't go back with someone like you.

626
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,840
I think

627
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,640
you've misunderstood.

628
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,960
Your boyfriend and I

629
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,360
have never met each other.

630
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,840
Don't pretend to forget.

631
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:21,880
Behind my back,

632
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,320
you probably secretly went looking for him.

633
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,880
How pitiful

634
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,920
From being a company employee

635
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,920
to becoming a waiter

636
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,400
because you spent money to pay men.

637
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,600
Hey you!

638
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,040
If you can't speak nicely,

639
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,360
you better not speak.

640
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,280
What are you doing?

641
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,280
Who are you?

642
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,480
Bar Owner

643
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,480
Well then,

644
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,600
Please warn your waiter

645
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,280
not to mess with my boyfriend.

646
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,000
Is this Poom?

647
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,560
messing with your boyfriend?

648
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,920
Did you misunderstand something?

649
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,320
What misunderstanding?

650
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,000
Poom

651
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
He's my boyfriend.

652
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,400
And when he came to work as a waiter,

653
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,840
he just came to do it for fun

654
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,480
and relieve boredom.

655
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,160
Because normally I give him money to use, he's not in need.

656
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,280
The money I give him per month

657
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,040
is more than the money you earn in your entire life.

658
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,200
And people in a relationship,

659
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,240
learn to take good care of their boyfriend too.

660
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,080
I think you're sick or out of mind

661
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,280
to scold another boyfriend like this.

662
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,800
How dare you talk to customers like this?

663
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,640
Yes

664
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,640
Well, if the customer is silly,

665
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,120
I don't have to say nice things.

666
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,000
You can't do this to me.

667
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:51,840
Stop!

668
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,240
Stop being crazy.

669
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,760
I don't know him.

670
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,320
My ex-boyfriend's name is Pure.

671
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,640
Not Poom!

672
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,480
Go back!

673
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,240
Not going back

674
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,600
Up to you

675
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,840
I'll go!

676
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,000
Wait!

677
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,640
What?

678
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,000
Please pay the bill.

679
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,320
How much!

680
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,440
Please wait a moment.

681
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,720
Here's your drinks

682
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,440
Why are you looking at me?

683
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,400
I look at my boyfriend's work.

684
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,760
When did I become your boyfriend?

685
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,440
Well, today.

686
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,600
Don't you remember?

687
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,520
Well

688
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,920
You said it well,

689
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,760
but how could you tell them that I'm your boyfriend?

690
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,400
I'm helping you.

691
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,680
So what?

692
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,280
Is that guy

693
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,600
really your ex-boyfriend?

694
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,600
No

695
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,320
I don't even know him.

696
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,360
It's true.

697
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,600
How can you have a boyfriend?

698
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,120
You just came here.

699
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,360
Why do you ask?

700
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,720
Are you jealous of me?

701
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,840
Who's jealous?

702
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,120
Why am I jealous?

703
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:47,680
Well, you're jealous of me.

704
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,080
You said I'm your boyfriend.

705
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,640
Well, we're not boyfriend,

706
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:58,920
but we're husband and wife.

707
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,920
Bastard!

708
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,120
Let's make it come true now.

709
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,440
Guys

710
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,600
Do you think that Poom will do as he says?

711
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,720
I think

712
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,640
we shouldn't stress about this.

713
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,200
Let's focus on happiness.

714
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,040
I don't know if I'll be caught any day.

715
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,160
Because of that

716
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,480
Let's be extremely happy.

717
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,880
Whatever we do that makes us happy,

718
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,680
do it to the max!

719
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,480
First of all

720
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,200
your wedding!

721
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,080
The day after tomorrow!

722
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,160
Are you ready?

723
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,880
I think they're ready.

724
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,200
What?

725
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,400
What are you ready?

726
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,480
Ready for the wedding?

727
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,920
You look into each other's eyes so sweetly.

728
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,800
Not ready at all, Huh?

729
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,000
I'm asking directly.

730
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:39,720
Did you guys

731
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:40,960
ever have ......?

732
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,840
Right?

733
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,480
Not yet!

734
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:47,840
Hey!

735
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:49,880
Mick

736
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,640
Don't tease your friends.

737
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,400
But seriously?

738
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,640
If you really love each other,

739
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,240
I'm okay.

740
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,400
Umm

741
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,120
It's good for the two of you to love each other.

742
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,760
The chemistry works out.

743
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,160
Is it really true?

744
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,920
yeah

745
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:09,800
Have you forgotten?

746
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,520
Poom also likes men.

747
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,000
If we're not okay.

748
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,840
Will we stay with you as a friend?

749
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:15,800
Right!!!!

750
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,920
Well

751
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,920
I'd better go back.

752
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,040
Don't have to send me.

753
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,880
I'll stop by and get something to eat.

754
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:26,840
Oh!!

755
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,960
One more thing,

756
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,040
don't forget that tomorrow

757
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,760
we have to go drink red wine.

758
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,880
I'm okay with red wine.

759
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,800
But I'm not okay with

760
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,760
not letting me send her back.

761
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,120
Right!

762
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,400
Do you think like me?

763
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,920
Come on!

764
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,080
Hey!

765
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,480
Did you hear what I said?

766
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,400
No!

767
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,200
Good to hear that!

768
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,560
Please allow me to be captured.

769
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,280
I don't want to use force.

770
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,520
Do you think I'm a woman and I won't fight?

771
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,400
How dare you do this

772
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,120
to someone I like?

773
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,160
Jolie

774
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,400
Are you alright?

775
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,760
It's not your business.

776
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:33,800
Don't mess with me

777
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,880
I'll do!

778
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,720
idiot!

779
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,280
Why put a child's fangs on it?

780
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,080
Jolie

781
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,920
I think we'd better not pay any attention to crazy people.

782
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,080
Go!

783
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,440
Isn't it scary?

784
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,240
Well

785
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,800
It's scary!

786
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,320
thank you

787
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,040
Thank you very much

788
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,360
for coming to help me.

789
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,520
I'm very pleased.

790
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,800
Jolie

791
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,800
By the way,

792
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,720
how did you come to see me?

793
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:19,960
or

794
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,160
secretly follow me?

795
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,720
Not like that

796
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,240
I'm hungry

797
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:27,120
so I went down to get something to eat.

798
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,640
Then I happened to see you

799
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,120
walking in a hurry.

800
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:30,920
I'll hurry up

801
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,200
and follow you.

802
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:34,840
So..

803
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,640
Aren't you frightened by that vampire?

804
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,760
Jolie

805
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,080
There aren't any vampires.

806
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,400
Actually,

807
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,280
that guy is a weirdo.

808
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,360
You don't have to be afraid.

809
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,720
If he pops up again

810
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:48,840
Please tell me

811
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:51,400
and I'll smack him right up.

812
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,640
I'm afraid

813
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,800
you'll fall over instead.

814
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,440
Jolie

815
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,600
I'm not fall over.

816
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,560
I am

817
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,600
a high school

818
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,240
Boxer!

819
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,560
Chin!

820
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,040
Yes

821
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,480
I think

822
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,360
it's better if you sit down and eat.

823
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,720
Come on! Jolie

824
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,120
But I still haven't shown all

825
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:20,080
15 million moves.

826
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,200
It's better to eat

827
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,200
I am so hungry.

828
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:26,920
Yes

829
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,480
Enjoy!

830
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,440
What are you looking at?

831
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,640
brush it!

832
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:16,720
What are you doing?

833
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,960
Kissing your cheek.

834
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,960
It's all messed up.

835
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,280
And who uses it to look cute?

836
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:29,160
You're going too far with your own desires.

837
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,720
If you don't stop talking.

838
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,280
I'll kiss you more

839
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,840
Just now it was considered

840
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,200
It's already a rental fee

841
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,240
I think

842
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,760
you'll pay 500 bath per kiss.

843
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,320
Just 500?

844
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,640
Like me,

845
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,200
1,000 per kiss

846
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:07,840
ok

847
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:10,480
So my condo fee is 5,000 per month.

848
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,160
At the end of every month you have to let me kiss you.

849
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,480
5 times

850
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:14,920
Hey!

851
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,240
I just have to wash the cups

852
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:16,840
wash the dishes

853
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:17,280
sweep the room

854
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,080
mop the room

855
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:19,560
Do everything for you.

856
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:21,720
Is this already over the rent?

857
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,120
Wait!

858
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,520
What?

859
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,400
Your cheeks are messed up, right?

860
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,880
I'll clean it up for you.

861
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,320
Come

862
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,640
I'll also clean it up for you.

863
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:13,800
I'll give it to you

864
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,600
What are you confused about?

865
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:25,160
Here!

866
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:26,800
When did you buy it?

867
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:27,680
So

868
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:30,080
What mood do you give my doll?

869
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:32,680
Go buy it at lunchtime today.

870
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:33,240
I saw it was cute

871
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:34,200
so I bought it.

872
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:36,880
And another thing that I bought for you.

873
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:38,680
How about you hug it

874
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:39,800
instead of me.

875
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:43,160
You like to accidentally hug me all the time.

876
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:45,520
Don't talk nonsense.

877
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:46,760
Am I

878
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:47,760
want to hug you?

879
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:48,680
Hey!

880
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:50,040
You don't know.

881
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:50,800
Late at night,

882
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,720
you always hug me.

883
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:56,440
I don't believe it.

884
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:58,600
But

885
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:00,760
thank you

886
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:11,840
So

887
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:13,440
why does it have to be a teddy bear

888
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,080
wearing a rabbit hat?

889
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:21,680
Well, teddy bears are just like me, cuddly.

890
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:28,520
The bunny hat is just like you.

891
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:30,520
Cute!

892
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,280
It's almost morning.

893
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:55,840
I'd better go to bed now.

894
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:58,040
Right!

895
00:46:58,040 --> 00:46:59,200
Let's sleep.

896
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:57,960
Miss Lalin

897
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:59,000
Good Morning!

898
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:01,200
My name is Jolie.

899
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,280
I've changed my name.

900
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:03,200
Ohh!

901
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:04,160
I'm sorry.

902
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:06,040
I've a short memory.

903
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:07,040
Well!

904
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:07,720
But anyway

905
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:09,240
Thank you very much

906
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:10,720
for the honor of accepting this job.

907
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:13,320
Ah, then

908
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:14,240
please come upstairs.

909
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:15,200
I...

910
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,600
arranged the set for your live.

911
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:18,560
Sure

912
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:20,000
Hello

913
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,520
Today we are with Jolie.

914
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:22,200
and

915
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:23,040
Chin

916
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,800
Yes, we come with

917
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,920
a warrix brand.

918
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:28,200
This brand

919
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:30,360
has a wide variety of clothes to choose from.

920
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:31,240
such as

921
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:32,480
polo shirt

922
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:33,520
Here!

923
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:33,880
Yes

924
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:34,600
t-shirt

925
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:35,520
here

926
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:37,560
And next is a sports shirt.

927
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:38,840
Must be this pair.

928
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:39,640
This is the last one

929
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:41,240
It's oversized shirt.

930
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:43,520
Must be liked by hip hop girls for sure.

931
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:44,440
Yo! Yo!

932
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:45,480
And our fabric

933
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:48,080
is made from 100% cotton,

934
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:49,240
which is very popular

935
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:50,200
Right now!

936
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:51,040
And the advantage

937
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:51,800
of this fabric

938
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:52,600
is that

939
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:53,560
it's smooth

940
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:54,480
soft

941
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:55,960
And most importantly,

942
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:57,240
it's very comfortable to wear

943
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:58,720
and extremely breathable.

944
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:00,040
For anyone interested,

945
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:01,640
you can order online.

946
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:02,960
Or you can come

947
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:04,360
and meet us at the store.

948
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:05,000
Right!

949
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:05,600
Let's go!

950
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:06,120
Order now.

951
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:07,320
Hey, We've sold 2 already.

952
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:08,200
5

953
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:08,880
50

954
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:11,720
Now the polo shirts are out of stock

955
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:12,880
Hey!

956
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:13,240
Not yet

957
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:14,200
Is this one too?

958
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:15,520
There are still

959
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:16,400
5 of these left.

960
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:17,440
Out of stock

961
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:18,160
Holy Moly!

962
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:18,640
It's selling very well.

963
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:19,680
Out of stock?
