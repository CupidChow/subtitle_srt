1
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:04,880
Where are those two?Where are those two?

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:06,200
They're making the desserts

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,880
for our wedding tomorrow.

4
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,480
What are you doing?

5
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,880
Why? I can't hug you now?

6
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,280
Our friends aren't here by the way.

7
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,880
Moreover, we will get married tomorrow.

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,000
Um..

9
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,320
I know that they aren't in the way.

10
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,200
But before we get married

11
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,680
I want to know more about this one thing.

12
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,840
How do you feel about me?

13
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,760
You always ask me how I feel

14
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:43,600
but what about you?

15
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,960
How do you feel about me?

16
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,640
Well..

17
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,880
Oh excuse me

18
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,320
the shop is closed today.

19
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,800
We aren't here to buy anything

20
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,760
but we are here to talk with you two.

21
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:00,640
Oh then

22
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,880
this way, please.

23
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,320
You said you had something to talk to us.

24
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,160
I wonder whether

25
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,280
you rent this shop

26
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,520
or does it belong to you?

27
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,600
It belongs to us.

28
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,520
Oh!

29
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,680
Very well.

30
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,440
Then I won't beat around the bush.

31
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,000
Mr.Wichan

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
he wants to buy this place.

33
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,240
You two can offer the price.

34
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,880
Mr.Wichan will pay no matter how expensive it is.

35
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,120
I'm so sorry to inform you that

36
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,080
we won't sell this place

37
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,000
because it's my mother's inherited property.

38
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,520
I suggest you to reconsider this offer.

39
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,520
If you sell this place

40
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,040
and buy a house instead

41
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,680
You won't have to work hard selling your desserts like this.

42
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,600
We don't have financial problems

43
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,960
and this shop also has a lot of customers.

44
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,000
Selling is our passion.

45
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,040
So you won't sell this shop yeah?!

46
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,680
Yes, we won't sell it.

47
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,000
Are you sure?!

48
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,160
I'm certain.

49
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,640
I suggest you guys to find somewhere else instead.

50
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,960
If you deny

51
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,600
then you better watch your back.

52
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,040
Because everyone knows

53
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,760
what will happen

54
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,120
when you rejected Mr.Wichan.

55
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,440
This isn't a threat

56
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,440
but I’m

57
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,560
telling you the truth.

58
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,040
Two guys

59
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,200
looking suspicious

60
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,280
I’m sure!

61
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,600
They must be captured!

62
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,360
They finally found us.

63
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,360
What should we do?

64
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,600
We can get through it.

65
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,680
We have to turn into humans.

66
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,680
This is almost the day

67
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,800
that I have to drink

68
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,640
your special red wine.

69
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,840
Why are you so eager to drink it?

70
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,640
Is there something special?

71
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,640
General Lux

72
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,920
is looking for the insignia.

73
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,920
Why teddy bear

74
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,440
with a bunny hat?

75
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,120
The teddy bear represents me

76
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:36,920
huggable.

77
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,240
And for the bunny hat

78
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,120
it represents you

79
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:39,720
cute.

80
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,720
General Lux wants us to find the governor's insignia.

81
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,720
He doubts that it would be here in the human land.

82
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,840
It might be with the vampires

83
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,160
that is hidden among humans.

84
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,720
You go gather my vampire subordinates

85
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,480
and hunt those vampires who disguise and live in the human land.

86
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,040
Go get the governor’s insignia and bring it to me.

87
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,320
Finally, I could go back to the vampire land.

88
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,800
I’m tired of these damn humans already.

89
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,320
Do not let the human subordinates know about this.

90
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,720
Get out.

91
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,040
How was it?

92
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,200
They rejected our offer, sir

93
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,480
even we offered them a high price.

94
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,080
I’m pretty sure

95
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,280
that they won't accept our offer.

96
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,280
They underestimate me!

97
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,320
You know

98
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,280
what to do next right?

99
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,040
Start with something light

100
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,240
and then keep double the violence.

101
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,680
We'll see

102
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,920
how much they can take.

103
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,200
Yes sir.

104
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,160
Hm?

105
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,440
And he still says that I was the one who unconsciously hugged him.

106
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,360
Who was the one huh?

107
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,800
Not unconsciously

108
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,440
I intentionally hug you.

109
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,360
Let go of me.

110
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,760
Are you stealing my hug?

111
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,600
Just a little more.

112
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,160
No, you can't.

113
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,080
I have to go to my friend’s wedding.

114
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,240
Do you want to come along?

115
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,240
Do you want me to?

116
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,280
Well, I will have more hands to help around.

117
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,640
Then no

118
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,680
I’m lazy.

119
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,480
Fine.

120
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,200
I will just give Kin a call.

121
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:25,960
No!

122
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,760
No!

123
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,600
I will go

124
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,600
right now

125
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,360
I will go.

126
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,840
What a cutie.

127
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,360
How do you use this thing, Mom?

128
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,080
Turn this black stick towards yourself

129
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,040
like this.

130
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,400
Then place your hand here

131
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,240
on the black stick

132
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,280
and push as hard as you can.

133
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:02,800
Push.

134
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,600
What the-

135
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,480
Come on Mom.

136
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,680
Lying to your son is a sin!

137
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,080
I’m just kidding.

138
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:09,640
Look

139
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,640
when I was in my youthful time

140
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,960
she couldn't compare to me.

141
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,520
Always surrounded by them.

142
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,640
You mean men, Mom?

143
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,720
No flies.

144
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,000
Back then I was a fruit vendor

145
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,400
but the sales were low

146
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,440
and some leftover fruits rotted.

147
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,600
You aren't poop, right?

148
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,960
Oh poop.

149
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,520
You are a sinner.

150
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,320
You lied to me.

151
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,000
I’m a sinner?

152
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,080
Oh, I’m so sorry my dear.

153
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:29,960
Forgive me.

154
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,680
I’m sorry for joking Mom.

155
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,440
I forgive you.

156
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,600
Stop that Mom.

157
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,160
I’m here!

158
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:33,960
Oh, hey!

159
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,040
Hey Poom!

160
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:36,960
You finally show up huh?

161
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,520
We are almost finished.

162
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,640
Why don't you come on the wedding day instead?

163
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,400
See? It's because of you.

164
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,120
You keep me doing some silly things.

165
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,320
It's night time already.

166
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,240
Please don't blame on Poom.

167
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,640
It's because of me that we are late.

168
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,080
Oh taking the blame for him

169
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,280
hmm, something is going on between you two.

170
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,600
I can see that.

171
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,720
Come on there is nothing between us.

172
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,320
Do you need help with anything?

173
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,040
It's ok

174
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:58,920
we are almost finished here.

175
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,960
Oh my friend

176
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,920
is so beautiful huh?

177
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,120
Gotta give her a credit.

178
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,560
You're also cute.

179
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,800
Well

180
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,960
for my late arriving

181
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,400
and barely help anything.

182
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,360
Let me buy dinners for all of you.

183
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,120
What do you want to eat

184
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:22,840
please tell me.

185
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,800
Really Patrick?

186
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,160
Very good!

187
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,240
I’m so hungry.

188
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,360
By the way

189
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,600
what foods in human land

190
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,440
that

191
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,800
I haven't tried?

192
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,160
Hm..

193
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,840
Oh!

194
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,880
I mean last night I watched too many episodes of the series.

195
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,040
It's about

196
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:41,720
giant’s land

197
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,560
and human land.

198
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,160
And I remember some words from the series and use them in real life.

199
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,160
Right?

200
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,520
Yes. Yes. Yes.

201
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,120
Human land.

202
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,560
The menus are up to you then.

203
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,400
Well

204
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:52,880
anything.

205
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,160
Right?

206
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,040
Yes. Yes.

207
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:55,840
Oh um.

208
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,600
Well

209
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,480
you all enjoy the food ok?

210
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,840
I shall go get some rest.

211
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,120
Of course Mom.

212
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:00,760
Right.

213
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,360
Bye-bye, son.

214
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:01,920
Goodbye, everyone.

215
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,080
Goodbye.

216
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:03,920
Mom.

217
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,280
Come on

218
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,560
there are pineapples in the pizza.

219
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,240
Just have it.

220
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,840
Patrick is kind enough to buy us these foods.

221
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,480
Here

222
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,480
nom nom.

223
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,960
Well well

224
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,000
getting married soon and showing a lot of love huh?

225
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,520
Why?

226
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,840
We love each other. What's the problem?

227
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,520
I want to take care of my bride.

228
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,120
Who is your bride?

229
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:36,760
Huh?

230
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,000
It's you

231
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,960
just accept it.

232
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:42,840
Here

233
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,120
I took the pineapples out already.

234
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,480
Oh, see?

235
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,120
Not just us

236
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,680
look at you.

237
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,720
What?

238
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,040
You hurry up and eat!

239
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,200
Aww.

240
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,560
Thank you.

241
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,800
Everyone has their partner

242
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,840
but I have no one!

243
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,200
At least I have the pizza to be my partner.

244
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,160
Oh delicious.

245
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,680
Human foods are good.

246
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,840
Why don't you pick them yourself?

247
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,680
Oh god!

248
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,320
God!

249
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,920
Single isn't enough

250
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,080
now I don't have anything to eat.

251
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:31,840
What a miserable man.

252
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,720
I would die miserablely.

253
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,680
You can have them.

254
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,600
I will take these with me.

255
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:35,920
Jolie

256
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,440
I’m scared ok?

257
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,240
Stay away from me.

258
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:39,840
Jolie!

259
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,040
Mix!

260
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,600
You troublemaker.

261
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,560
Where are you going huh?

262
00:11:59,080 --> 00:11:59,840
Um…

263
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,640
Can I go hang out with my friends please?

264
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,680
I mean

265
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,120
with them.

266
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,000
Do you have money?

267
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,280
Are you a millionaire?

268
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,160
Auntie Kaew

269
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,000
actually

270
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,120
we can provide money for Mix.

271
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,040
Oh no no you can't do that.

272
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,400
Please don't do that.

273
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,120
If you do that more often

274
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,160
Mix will

275
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,040
has a bad habit.

276
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,120
Please

277
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,240
if he doesn't have money then don't let him go out.

278
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,360
Oh, come on Mom.

279
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,280
Y’all go without me

280
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:28,680
What?

281
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,520
I think I can't go now.

282
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,040
Mix!

283
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,760
Ouch, Mom!

284
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,320
Who do you think you are?

285
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,120
How could you

286
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:35,480
address them

287
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,240
as y’all? Be polite to them!

288
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,760
Please Mom you’re hurting me!

289
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,880
Go! Get back inside!

290
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,520
Ouch!

291
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,640
Auntie Kaew.

292
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,640
Mom Mom Mom!

293
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,240
This is me your son!

294
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,000
Mix is that you?

295
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,520
Oh let’s get back to sleep inside.

296
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,080
Mom.

297
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:50,880
Go back inside dear.

298
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,000
Mom stop pinching me!

299
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,600
You bad son!

300
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,520
It's ok guys.

301
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,200
We can buy the wine for him later.

302
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,200
Let’s go.

303
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:13,720
Hey.

304
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,760
Can I go drinking the wine with my friends?

305
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,040
But this is your working time.

306
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:22,680
Please.

307
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,240
It won’t be long.

308
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,200
Just a few minutes.

309
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,280
Please.

310
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,640
Could I go drinking with my friends for a few minutes, please?

311
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,320
May Poom go drinking wine with my friends, please?

00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,920
Pretty please.

313
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,080
Please.

314
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:35,680
Alright alright.

315
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,760
Fine fine.

316
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,480
Go get changed first.

317
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,120
Thank you!

318
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,480
Damn.

319
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,880
Public affection huh?

320
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,840
My friend is the best.

321
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,520
Yeah

322
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,360
gotta give it to him.

323
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,800
Are you happy now?

324
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,640
Happy what?

325
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,600
I pointed

326
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,920
because you had some sauce stains on your lips.

327
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,000
Oh

328
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,200
I will go to the toilet for a moment.

329
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,040
Now what is this?

330
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:41,880
Spit it out.

331
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,000
Tell us the truth.

332
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,280
How do you feel towards my friend?

333
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,080
Well I

334
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,080
have a good feeling for him

335
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,080
but we still have a lot to learn about each other.

336
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:53,840
And our status in the future.

337
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,440
If you like him just tell him.

338
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:57,760
Yes.

339
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,320
Don’t lead him on.

340
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:00,840
Yes.

341
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,000
You act this way is unclear.

342
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,880
I don't want my friend to face another heartbreak.

343
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,840
Another heartbreak?

344
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,560
Yes.

345
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,440
If you like him, be clear to him.

346
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,000
Auntie Kaew

347
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,440

348
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,440

00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,000
What? Are you calling me fat?!

355
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:54,560

Let me tell you this.

387
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,800
This is just a small part of my skill.

388
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,160
Oh wow!

389
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:03,640
But hey!

390
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:04,720
Mix!

391
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,080
Why are you out here this late huh?

392
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,560
Oh..

393
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,360
Well..

394
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,160
Oh!

395
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,480
I'm out here to make sure that the ceremony is organized perfectly.

396
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,640
Why don't you go get some rest inside first?

397
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,480
Yeah?

398
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,360
You aren't trying to sneak out to party right?

399
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,000
Oh no of course not.

400
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,960
Who would sneak out to party? Not me.

401
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,840
Why such a high pitch?!

402
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:21,640
Who would sneak out to party? Not me.

403
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,320
Oh then I'm relieved.

404
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:23,880
Thank you, mom.

405
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,480
Yes, Mom.

406
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,520
What is wrong with my mom?

407
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:30,840
Come on Auntie Kaew.

408
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:32,920
I haven't drunk blood

409
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,680
and where would I find one.

410
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,960
Sigh.

411
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,600
Jolie.

412
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,400
Jolie

413
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,760
had you listened to my singing?

414
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,200
Of course I had.

415
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,800
In this bar

416
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,360
you're the only singer.

417
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,120
So everyone here could hear.

418
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,640
And what do you think?

419
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,640
How do you feel?

420
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,280
Well it's good

421
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,960
but just a bit off keys.

422
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,520
Well I mean-

423
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,560
Let's go.

424
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,200
Let's go.

425
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,080
Oh why leaving so soon?

426
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,240
Um..

427
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,600
Chin, I really have to go now.

428
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,000
Tomorrow is Zen and Ran's wedding

429
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,040
I have to go to bed early.

430
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,480
Oh.

431
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,800
Then I will walk you home.

432
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,680
Oh ok.

433
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,440
Um..

434
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,480
Chin let's dance!

435
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,680
Dance?

436
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,160
This is weird.

437
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,640
Captain are you ok?

438
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,520
I smell a very strong vampire scent.

439
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,920
Vampire scent?

440
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,000
I can't smell anything.

441
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:47,800
By the way

442
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,640
What does it smell like? The vampire scent.

443
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,680
It smells just like yours smell.

444
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:00,680
Um..

445
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,400
Captain

446
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,360
I have something to ask you.

447
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,800
Why did we come to this secret bar?

448
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,120
I have an intel

449
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:10,960
that this bar

450
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,640
many high-class vampires often hang out here.

451
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,680
Maybe we can meet

452
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,960
Wichan here.

453
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:19,840
But

454
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,720
as far as I can see,

455
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,840
there are only teenagers.

456
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,760
I think Wichan shouldn't come to a bar like this.

457
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,400
If it's children who ran away, it might be possible.

458
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,880
Welcome

459
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,120
Hello

460
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,520
Umm..

461
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,320
Do the two of you know each other?

462
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,760
No, I don't

463
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,360
By the way, this is your first time here, right?

464
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,200
Yes

465
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,960
Lieutenant

466
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,720
wait!

467
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,440
Please go find a seat and wait for me first.

468
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,120
I

469
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:07,600
just

470
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,400
have something I'd like to talk to him.

471
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:12,720
Yes

472
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,920
Do we

473
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,920
know each other or not?

474
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,080
I don't think so

475
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,760
But I think we knew each other before.

476
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,400
I think you must have gotten really drunk.

477
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,640
Then I'll let our waiter take care of you.

478
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,280
I have business to attend to.

479
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,080
If you'll excuse me

480
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:11,920
Lieutenant

481
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,760
Keep your voice down

482
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,560
The drinks at Human City

483
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,520
are strong.

484
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,840
It's not like the toad blood at our home.

485
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,360
Chill!

486
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,520
I'm hard to get drunk.

487
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,600
But

488
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,840
Is he a vampire?

489
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,040
At first

490
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,680
I thought it was.

491
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,120
But

492
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,080
maybe not

493
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,800
Because the people I know

494
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,440
shouldn't be doing anything in a human city.

495
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,600
It might be a parallel body.

496
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,480
That's it

497
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,360
Lieutenant

498
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,440
I smell a strong vampire scent.

499
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,480
The person who just walked out of the bar just now

500
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,920
must be a vampire.

501
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,400
Let's see.

502
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,680
Where are you going?

503
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,160
We'll go home

504
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,200
But before that, I'd like to ask you something.

505
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:31,840
What are you asking?

506
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,040
We don't know anything at all.

507
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,400
If no one answers the question,

508
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,880
don't expect to return at all.

509
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,760
Tell me Where is the associate gang?

510
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,600
So

511
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,520
The gang keeps the governor’s insignia , right?

512
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,120
We don't know.

513
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,360
We're not vampires.

514
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,160
Shuu!!

515
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,680
See!!

516
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,040
I'll give you one last chance.

517
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,560
Tell me where is the gang?

518
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,760
Drag him to a safe house for investigating.

519
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,360
Yes

520
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,280
What about Mick?

521
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,760
If he doesn't come out and help with the work,

522
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,080
I'm sure Auntie Kaew won't accept that.

523
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:01,720
Right!

524
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,920
he still hasn't drank blood.

525
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,720
Maybe our secret will be revealed!

526
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,920
Busted it's not that bad.

527
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,240
But I'm afraid he will die.

528
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,560
What are you guys talking about?

529
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:12,680
Aren't you going to get dressed?

530
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,480
Hey Jolie, what are you doing?

531
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,080
wait!

532
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:16,520
Zen

533
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,080
Ran

534
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:17,600
wait!

535
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,240
What are you doing?

536
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,760
Hey, what are you guys doing?

537
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:21,680
You haven't drank blood yet.

538
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,760
You might die.

539
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,360
Come on, I've already drank.

540
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:28,560
Huh?

541
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,040
Right!

542
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:29,560
I've drank it.

543
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,560
Let me go.

544
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:31,800
alright!

545
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,320
Umm..

546
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,640
Damn it!

547
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:37,400
wait!

548
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,360
Don't puke.

549
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,080
Ohh!

550
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,080
I'm not puking anymore.

551
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,280
I swallowed it back down.

552
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,000
But

553
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,920
where did you go to drink blood?

554
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,440
Do you want to know?

555
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,280
Umm..

556
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,000
Come

557
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,360
I feel sorry,

558
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,680
but must I move on with my life?

559
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,880
Stop it!

560
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,240
Swallow

561
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,040
It will get better.

562
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,760
Poor Moomoo!

563
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,320
You didn't ask me first.

564
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,600
Gosh!

565
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,960
I thought it was a newlywed couple.

566
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,840
Please invite the bride and groom

567
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,440
to the ceremony.

568
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,080
You make me and Ran are all dull, you guys.

569
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,200
What?

570
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,600
Why don't you hurry to get dressed?

571
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,360
Right!

572
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,000
See you guys.

573
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:43,920
See you

574
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,240
Mick

575
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,160
Well

576
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:48,920
It's okay, Poom

577
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,000
I'm okay

578
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,560
I'm very comfortable

579
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:51,880
See!

580
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,560
Thank you for your concern.

581
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:54,400
Jolie

582
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,120
Let's get dressed.

583
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:05,480
Ho hee ho hee ho hoi

584
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,640
Hewww!!

585
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:12,160
Ho hee ho hee ho hoi

586
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:15,040
Hewww!!

587
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,160
First checkpoint

588
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,320
You'll have to show off your waist.

589
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:26,880
Right!

590
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,640
At this door,

591
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,120
Let me test the strength of the groom.

592
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:40,520
1 2 3 4 5 6 7

593
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,320
My checkpoint

594
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,040
so easy!

595
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,640
I want to hear you say love the groom.

596
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,680
Loudly

597
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,680
Let the other groom

598
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,400
hear it.

599
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,080
Go ahead!

600
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,880
Zen loves Ran.

601
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,920
I love you the most in the world.

602
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,600
I love only you.

603
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:03,720
Poom

604
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:04,880
Stop staring

605
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,200
and blushing Patrick.

606
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,840
He didn't confess you.

607
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,240
What?

608
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,320
Don't talk nonsense.

609
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,160
I didn't hear anything

610
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,080
you said just now.

611
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,320
So how are you going to hear me?

612
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,560
Are you interested in me just now?

613
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,840
Come on!

614
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,360
Do you want to go in?

615
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,000
Huh?

616
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,960
Shout it out loud!

617
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,480
You're going to go in.

618
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,600
Do you want to go get Ran?

619
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,960
Zen loves Ran.

620
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,040
I love only you.

621
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,600
I love you the most in the world.

622
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,600
Mother,

623
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:35,960
please allow me

624
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,920
to take your son

625
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,200
into the ceremony.

626
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,960
Sure

627
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,240
Because I've been waiting for a long time.

628
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,840
Take him

629
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,200
All right, everyone.

630
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,640
It's important time.

631
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,680
Please allow me

632
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,040
to invite all the single people

633
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,640
in front of me.

634
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:16,560
But

635
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,880
But!!

636
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,280
Before we go throw the bouquet.

637
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,600
I want to see both grooms

638
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:25,280
show a little bit of love for each other,

639
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,320
would you?

640
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,040
Yes

641
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,360
Umm..

642
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,360
When everyone wants to see

643
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,080
Both grooms

644
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,040
Please kiss

645
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,360
Kiss him!

646
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:50,480
Kiss him!!

647
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,720
Wow!

648
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:55,760
Gee!

649
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,520
Wow!

650
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,560
So jealous.

651
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,880
But that's okay

652
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,240
I think we'd better pass on the love.

653
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,480
Is everyone ready?

654
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,560
Ready!

655
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,560
Ready or not?

656
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,480
Ready!

657
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,400
Louder!

658
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,520
Ready!

659
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,520
Okay

660
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,840
Let's see.

661
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,600
who will be the next couple.

662
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,920
I'll count to 3

663
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,240
and you can throw.

664
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,440
1

665
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,960
2

666
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,160
1

667
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,480
Hey!!

668
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,120
3!

669
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,720
I'd like to play a little.

670
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,240
hey!!

671
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,040
Go!!

672
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,720
1

673
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,520
2

674
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,960
3

675
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,960
Hey!

676
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,160
Got it, everyone.

677
00:32:55,160 --> 00:33:03,440
Kiss him!

678
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,080
Damn!

679
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,520
Just a little more.

680
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,400
Just a little more, everyone.

681
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,760
Oh, that's okay.

682
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,360
So

683
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,480
please invite both of them

684
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,720
to the front.

685
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,000
It looks like

686
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,960
we have a new couple, everyone.

687
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,480
Heyy!!

688
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,680
Are you going to secretly make score points?

689
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,200
Huh?

690
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,120
Jolie,

691
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,000
don't listen to him too much.

692
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,280
He is a singer

693
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,600
and likes to give sweet glances to customers all the time.

694
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,720
Hmm?

695
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,640
Talk only about me?

696
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,960
You're the same.

697
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,840
You're a salesperson

698
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,000
who likes to sweet talk

699
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,400
and seduce customers.

700
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,720
Come on!

701
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,080
Stop!

702
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:10,760
Sit now

703
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,600
I think

704
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,080
we'd rather eat.

705
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,120
I'm embarrassed of other people.

706
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,200
Hew!!

707
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,120
I'm really tired of my own beauty.

708
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,640
I really want to be

709
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,680
50 percent less beautiful.

710
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,320
Do you have leg pain?

711
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,200
Umm

712
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:55,200
Jolie had me do push-ups.

713
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:55,800
and today

714
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,720
I stood all day.

715
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,640
Um..

716
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:01,840
Go up to bed.

717
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,840
Hurry!

718
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,120
Go to bed.

719
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,320
I'll give you a massage.

720
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,760
Umm

721
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,320
Better?

722
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,800
It's okay.

723
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:08,920
Thank you.

724
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,040
Umm

725
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:38,880
Can I...?

726
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,920
Your leg hurts, right?

727
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,200
There was someone who gave me a massage.

728
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,200
My pain is gone.

729
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,000
Hey

730
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:37,880
I'm not drunk yet.

731
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,000
Not going back

732
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:39,880
Not drunk?

733
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,440
You're all tongue twisters.

734
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,000
Who talks with a tongue twister?

735
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,120
I'm going with friends.

736
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:47,520
Enough!

737
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,640
Go take a nap.

738
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,360
Umm…

739
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,000
Don't fool me.

740
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,640
I also

741
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,400
tend to trust people easily

742
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,160
When you said you liked me

743
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:18,840
I believe it.

744
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,280
I've told you all my feelings.

745
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,480
What about you?

746
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,680
How do you feel about me?

747
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,280
Or will you keep fooling me like this?

748
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:39,960
Hmm??

749
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,280
You're really not going to tell me, are you?

750
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,000
You really want to get hurt, don't you?

751
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,720
Calm down!

752
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,080
What am I going to do with you?

753
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,040
Well

754
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,280
I knew it!

755
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,960
If you don't say anything,

756
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:10,040
I'll expose you to the sun to die in agony.

757
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:15,440
You probably think I'm joking.

758
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,600
Lieutenant Nickky

759
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,280
Drag him to dry in the sun.

760
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,160
And you can't probably bear it that long

761
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:23,480
Yes

762
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,840
Where are you going?

763
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:28,440
Go!

764
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,680
I'm not going anywhere!

765
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:30,920
I told you to get up.

766
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:31,800
Alright!

767
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:32,360
I'll

768
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,320
I'll tell you.

769
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,400
I'll tell you.

770
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,520
If I tell you guys,

771
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,280
don't put me out in the sun.

772
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,000
Stepfather Wichan

773
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,960
received orders from General Lux

774
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,960
to go find the governor’s insignia

775
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,440
Then we found out that

776
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,000
the insignia was passed on to the Vampire Order.

777
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,760
But we don't know

778
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,680
where the Vampire Order is.

779
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,320
And why did stepfather Wichan have to help General Lux?

780
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:07,760
If General Lux becomes governor of the city,

781
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,280
stepfather Wichan will be able to return to live a comfortable life in the vampire city

782
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,480
without having to endure living in the human city,

783
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,440
and not having to secretly drink blood every 15 days

784
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,360
to conceal himself as a vampire.

785
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,600
What do you know about the Vampire Order?

786
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,240
Tell me

787
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,400
The vampire order that I know about

788
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,040
The leader of the group

789
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,240
is the grandson of the city governor.

790
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:36,560
Impossible!

791
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,040
The grandson of the governor

792
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,480
The grandson of the governor has died.

793
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,040
Well, I got it like this.

794
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,040
That's all I know

795
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,400
What else do you want?

796
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:02,760
Do you guys really think

797
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,520
that you can defeat me?

798
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:06,760
Right!

799
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,200
Evil vampire like you

800
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,560
won't last long.

801
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,720
But I had been around for so long

802
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:17,160
that my plan to take over the vampire city was almost complete.

803
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,560
You'll never make it!

804
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:20,120
Right!

805
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,040
You'll receive the same results as those evil bastards

806
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,680
who used to take over the city in the past.

807
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,320
Bastard!

808
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:37,160
Shut up!

809
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:41,920
Take them to jail

810
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:45,600
and capture all the remaining people

811
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:47,520
so that we'll kill them together

812
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:48,920
for treason.

813
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:51,280
Up

814
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:51,960
Get up!

815
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:52,760
No

816
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:53,640
Not going!

817
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:54,280
Not going!

818
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:55,400
I'll make you pay.

819
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:56,760
Not going!

820
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:57,560
Let me go!

821
00:43:58,560 --> 00:43:59,440
Bastard!

822
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,120
Hey!

823
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:01,440
Bastard!

824
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:02,400
Let me go!

825
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:11,400
Damn!!

826
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:13,960
Everyone has a partner,

827
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,040
so I'm lonely again.

828
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:27,080
Why did I warp to this body

829
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:29,400
and this thing followed?

830
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:31,880
Or

831
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:33,600
do I have to sell it?

832
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:35,520
I definitely need to sell it.

833
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:36,840
Like this!

834
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,600
I'll definitely make a profit in the human city.

835
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:40,720
I'm really smart.

836
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:42,280
I'm going to be rich!

837
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:51,640
Joile

838
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:53,600
Where did you bring us here?

839
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:54,400
Right!

840
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:55,560
What mood is this?

841
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:56,680
What mood?

842
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:59,040
Tomorrow will be 15 days since we had to drink blood.

843
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:00,280
If we don't drink blood,

844
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,760
we definitely won't get sunlight.

845
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,040
So I took you to a clothing store

846
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,640
to look for sun protection clothes.

847
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:05,640
that's right

848
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:08,800
I've studied

849
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,080
this store's clothes well.

850
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:11,240
Their shirt

851
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:12,440
is good quality.

852
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:13,120
Especially

853
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:15,440
the Warrix Comba+ cool shirt.

854
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,160
Their innovation is very good.

855
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:18,080
Because they are breathable

856
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:19,880
and can control humidity well.

857
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:20,800
Moreover,

858
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,240
UV protection

859
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:23,480
is perfect for us.

860
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:25,160
So

861
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:25,960
How do you know

862
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,000
about these clothes?

863
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:28,080
Well

864
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:29,400
I

865
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,480
I've come to live and sell here.

866
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:32,920
Well,

867
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:34,080
Chin

868
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:35,560
is the owner of the shop.

869
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:37,000
Ummm

870
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:38,560
Really

871
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:41,720
I think you and Chin

872
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:42,560
Strange!

873
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,240
What's so strange?

874
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,960
Everyone knows that this brand of clothing is good.

875
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:47,960
Go

876
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:48,840
Go choose your clothes

877
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:49,240
Go

878
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:52,080
Look, you're blushing!

879
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:52,800
Who blushing?

880
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:53,720
Go choose your clothes

881
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:55,720
This one might be suitable for you.

882
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:56,960
Which one is suitable?

883
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,040
Which one is more suitable?

884
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:13,600
You don't have to act shy.

885
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:14,560
I know

886
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:15,480
you like him

887
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:16,440
like what?

888
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:17,760
Well, you like Patrick.

889
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:21,480
Mick

890
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,040
Please answer directly.

891
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:24,560
How did you get it?

892
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:27,400
But I think Jolie

893
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:28,800
likes me more than you.

894
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:30,560
You better back off for me.

895
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,160
Why did you decide so quickly?

896
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:33,800
Do you know him well already?

897
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:34,880
Maybe

898
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,280
he can trick you

899
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:37,680
Where did Patrick go?

900
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:39,400
I saw that he was going to run some errands,

901
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:41,360
but I didn't know what errand it was.
