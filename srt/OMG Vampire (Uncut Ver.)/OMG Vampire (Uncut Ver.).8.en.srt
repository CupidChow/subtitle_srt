1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:02,720
What happened to your faces?

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,080
Who did you get in a fight with?

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,240
It was Wichan’s men.

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,760
They came to oppress the two of us to sell this shop to him.

5
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:10,640
Wichan

6
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:11,680
want to buy this shop?

7
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:12,520
Yes.

8
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,080
But we refused to sell it

9
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,680
so he keeps sending his men to bother us.

10
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,000
By the way

11
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,200
why are you calling us to come here?

12
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,400
What's the matter?

13
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,040
Yeah.

14
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,960
Moreover, you told us to close the shop for half of the day.

15
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,480
You must have very important news, right?

16
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,360
Just wait for a moment.

17
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,840
Someone will come to inform you soon.

18
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,600
Guys!

19
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,520
The Vampire policemen!

20
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:34,400
Quickly run!

21
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:34,880
Calm down, please!

22
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:35,840
They're on our side.

23
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,480
They're on our side.

24
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:38,920
Hm.

25
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,000
An ally.

26
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,680
Please sit back down.

27
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,200
An ally.

28
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,000
Well.

29
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,480
They aren't here to capture you

30
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,560
but come to telling us the news.

31
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:49,920
Why

32
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,520
are you talking like you know that we are..

33
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,800
Vampires.

34
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,440
I have something to sell you.

35
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,880
Where did Patrick go?

36
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,240
He mentioned errands

37
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,640
but I don't know what is it about.

38
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,160
This is the insignia

39
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,920
that I coincidentally received it

40
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:49,520
from the teenage vampire

41
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,080
who escapes to the human land.

42
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,520
Do you know him well enough?

43
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,320
Maybe

44
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,120
he might fool you, Poom.

45
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,560
Up to you then.

46
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,320
I did warn you.

47
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,280
The last time that we met

48
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,160
you pretend that you can’t remember me right?

49
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,400
You haven’t told them yet

50
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,440
that you’re a vampire too?

51
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,240
Are you a vampire?

52
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,080
You knew from the very first time right

53
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,640
that we are vampires?

54
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,080
You enjoy it huh?

55
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,440
Making a fool of me.

56
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,000
Do you think I’m stupid?

57
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,440
Poom.

58
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,880
Poom.

59
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,920
Poom.

60
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,680
Follow him, Patrick.

61
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,520
Go after him.

62
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,560
Yes.

63
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,360
Go talk to him.

64
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,040
You can do it.

65
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,120
Um..

66
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,160
Jolie.

67
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,120
What?

68
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,320
You as well.

69
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,920
Go talk to him.

70
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,760
Don’t be scared.

71
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,480
No matter what happens

72
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,800
you will have to tell him the truth.

73
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,800
Be prepare.

74
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,880
You can handle it.

75
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,520
Well seems like there's only me

76
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,240
who doesn't have to explain myself to anyone.

77
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,120
Sometimes living without love is better.

78
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,280
Sometimes may feel lonely

79
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,640
and solitary

80
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,640
but I can stand them.

81
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,040
So when can we inform you guys of the news?

82
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,840
Oh, I forgot.

83
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,280
I forgot to be scared

84
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:00,760
and shocked.

85
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,120
I forgot all of them.

86
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,480
Well hey, policemen!

87
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,080
If you try to quarrel with us

88
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,440
we won't back down.

89
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,120
We will fight to the death!

90
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,440
Oh, come on.

91
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,120
I’m so tired of these guys.

92
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,240
Are you a comedian or a vampire?

93
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,240
Can you behave normally for once?

94
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,320
By the way, this shop sells Thai desserts, right?

95
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,200
Go get some for me.

96
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,720
What?

97
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,400
I'm not asking you for free.

98
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,080
I will buy them.

99
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:30,920
Buy them?

100
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,600
Let's go guys.

101
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,920
Let's prepare them for Captain.

102
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,240
Ouch, my wounds.

103
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,320
I always wanted to try the desserts.

104
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,360
Many said the desserts here are delicious.

105
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,840
I will feed you.

106
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,520
I know that you don't have much strength today.

107
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,760
Stop it.

108
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,600
I told you to stop but you kept going.

109
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,920
Didn't know why you so starve.

110
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,960
Chin.

111
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,120
Chin.

112
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,080
What I heard

113
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,320
was it true?

114
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,440
I’m sorry.

115
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,360
I’m so sorry

116
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,080
that

117
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,640
I hide it from you.

118
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,040
But

119
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,320
How could I tell you

120
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,440
that I’m a vampire?

121
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,760
Have you ever thought about killing me

122
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,520
for blood?

123
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,000
Chin.

124
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,680
There are both

125
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,120
good

126
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,160
and bad vampires.

127
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,680
And I have never thought about killing you

128
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,120
to drink your blood.

129
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,640
I’m sorry that I asked you that question.

130
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,800
I understand.

131
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,040
If I was a human

132
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,160
I would have a thought like you.

133
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,360
But

134
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,440
I want you to reconsider it carefully.

135
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,040
If all vampires that came to human world

136
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,040
for killing and drinking their blood

137
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,480
Patrick would have already killed you long ago.

138
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,680
Right?

139
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,200
Do you know why?

140
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,840
It's because Patrick

141
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,200
love you like his own brother.

142
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,920
And what about you?

143
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,800
You haven’t killed me.

144
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,360
What am I to you?

145
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,360
Is it because you see me as a friend?

146
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,440
No not because of that!

147
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,200
Then what am I to you?

148
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,840
I..

149
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,240
Because I like you!

150
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,520
What did I just say?

151
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,920
I’m a lady god.

152
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,360
What you said.

153
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,280
It is true?

154
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,880
What are you doing?

155
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,560
You aren't

156
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,200
afraid of me anymore?

157
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,920
Not anymore.

158
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,400
Because now

159
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,640
love has blinded me.

160
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,160
You are so shy and hit me so hard as well.

161
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,840
You are silly!

162
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,160
Vampire is this shy? Damn.

163
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,240
Wait Jolie.

164
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,680
Wait for me!

165
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,880
Poom

166
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,440
let's talk.

167
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,480
Poom, please.

168
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,120
please listen to me first.

169
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,080
Please.

170
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,480
Then explain yourself.

171
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,240
Actually

172
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,560
I don't want to hide the truth from you at all

173
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,840
that I’m a vampire.

174
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,320
Because I thought you were a human

175
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,520
so I don't dare to tell you what I am.

176
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,480
Until then day that you went to the bar

177
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,520
and asked for blood from other people.

178
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,880
Blood please..

179
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,560
I need blood.

180
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,640
You..

181
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,840
Will you really let me drink your blood?

182
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,120
Yes of course.

183
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,720
Please accept me.

184
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,360
Can I drink

185
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,640
the red wine every 15 days?

186
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,040
I’ve observed your behavior.

187
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,120
You

188
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,480
urge me to bring you and your friend a red wine every 15 days.

189
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,280
That

190
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,920
made me curtains that you’re a vampire.

191
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,360
You knew yet kept your mouth shut.

192
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,400
You make me scared of telling you the truth.

193
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,480
It's very tired.

194
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,760
I didn't dare to tell back then.

195
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,120
I was afraid that you would be mad.

196
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,080
Moreover, you didn't tell me the truth either.

197
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,400
Are you blaming it on me?

198
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,760
No.

199
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,160
I mean that

200
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,320
we both

201
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,600
are keeping the secret from each other.

202
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,320
I have been waiting for you to tell me first.

203
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,160
So that I can tell you.

204
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,120
I also don't dare to tell you.

205
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,680
I’m afraid that you will be sacred

206
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,160
and leave me.

207
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,880
Oh

208
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,240
so you like me that much?

209
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,160
Hey!

210
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,400
I’m mad at you

211
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,760
and you still playing around?

212
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,440
Come on Poom.

213
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,720
It was so hard for me

214
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,640
to let someone into my health

215
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,240
since I came to human land.

216
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,760
Me either.

217
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,960
But still playing around.

218
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,160
No not like that.

219
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:33,680
Who told you?

220
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,000
Chin told me.

221
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,280
He told me all of them.

222
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,960
Chin.

223
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,880
I will deal with him later.

224
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,400
But it just that.

225
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,400
I hadn't been in a relationship.

226
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,720
Until I met you

227
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,800
that was when I could feel love again.

228
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,320
I don't want to lose you.

229
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,640
I don't want to lie to you

230
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,920
and I also don't want to hide anything from you.

231
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,000
Today

232
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,840
I want to confess you this

233
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,760
but that Captain and Lieutenant

234
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,960
show up first.

235
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,160
Really?

236
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,280
Yes really.

237
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,840
One more thing.

238
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,640
Why your wine

239
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,200
can make us vampires walking under the sun?

240
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,240
Well, my red wind

241
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,320
made from special recipes.

242
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,800
It took years

243
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,920
till I could figure this recipe out.

244
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,200
Special recipes?

245
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,560
Could you tell me about it?

246
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,480
You want to know it?

247
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,040
Stop being mad at me first

248
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,720
and tonight

249
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,440
I will tell you everything you want to know.

250
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,040
Come on, Poom.

251
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,720
Please don't be mad at me.

252
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,600
Please.

253
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,480
I will be a good boy.

254
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:03,880
Good boy

255
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,760
and well behaved.

256
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,120
I will be your only good boy.

257
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,960
Enough.

258
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,880
What are you saying?

259
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,720
Get off me.

260
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,200
Ah so you smile already.

261
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,120
Not mad at me any more right?

262
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,280
Treat each other sweetly.

263
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,200
Smile at each other sweetly.

264
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,560
You guys

265
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,520
could you stop being a lovey-dovey first.

266
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,480
Haven’t you said

267
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,480
that you have something to tell us, Captain Joe?

268
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,120
Oh right.

269
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:38,840
Well.

270
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,960
The thing that I’m going to tell you

271
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,440
is very important.

272
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,040
Now General Lux

273
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:46,640
has caused a rebellion

274
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,120
and take control of Vampire Land.

275
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,400
He also captured your parents.

276
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,400
Not long after this

277
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,000
I think he will execute them.

278
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,040
We have to rescue them.

279
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,000
Yes

280
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,520
but how.

281
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,760
It shouldn't be like this.

282
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,960
Our parents have to bear the consequences of our actions.

283
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,760
We have to help them out no matter what it takes.

284
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,560
Don’t worry.

285
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,120
I and Patrick

286
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,840
we already planned

287
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,520
what we will do next.

288
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,160
Then let’s go.

289
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,240
What are we waiting for?

290
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,280
No, we can’t. Not now.

291
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,600
Please calm down first.

292
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,440
Before we can go back to Vampire Land.

293
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,760
We have to get rid of Wichan first.

294
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,200
Wichan

295
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,840
he is the one who want to buy our shop right?

296
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:33,920
Yes that man.

297
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,160
He’s a vicious vampire

298
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,480
who escape to this land

299
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,600
and has been helping General Lux.

300
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,640
See?

301
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,760
I told you

302
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,920
that he’s a vicious vampire.

303
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,840
But

304
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,040
how could we go to the Vampire Land?

305
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,040
We have to go to the gateway which connects the two lands.

306
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,960
We have the key

307
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,600
but

308
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,720
only vampires can go through it.

309
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,080
Alright

310
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,560
everyone

311
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,640
let's start the plan meeting.

312
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,080
Alright.

313
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:24,000
Today we will learn basic self-defense.

314
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,760
This is the position one.

315
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,600
Don't cry.

316
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,200
Ok?

317
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,800
Are you hurt anywhere?

318
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,440
Alright.

319
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,320
Are you guys ready?

320
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,560
Ready or not we have to go.

321
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,520
It's better than nothing.

322
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,840
Actually,

323
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,000
what we are doing now it's very risky.

324
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,840
I know that you guys know what are we doing

325
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,440
but it can cause our lives.

326
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,120
I also don't want all of you to be in a risk situation like this.

327
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,400
If any of you want to withdraw

328
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,200
you can go

329
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,520
and I won’t say a word.

330
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,600
Especially you, Chin.

331
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,040
You’re a human.

332
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,440
You don't have to go.

333
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,360
No.

334
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,080
I will fight

335
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,640
for my girlfriend.

336
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,040
Jolie

337
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,600
be composed.

338
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,440
We won’t withdraw.

339
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,400
We will fight.

340
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,280
Yes.

341
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,400
We are not a coward.

342
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,000
Even if we have to die

343
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,200
it's worth it.

344
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,120
At least we can fight for our homeland.

345
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,480
We are a new generation of vampires.

346
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,400
If we don't fight, nothing will change.

347
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,960
I would rather die than become the slave of that vicious vampire.

348
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,440
Guys

349
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,240
let's drink the wine together.

350
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,880
It's 15 days already

351
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,680
so that tomorrow we will have the strength to fight.

352
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,520
YES! Finally, I can drink it!

353
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,600
Yes!

354
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,960
Come.

355
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,640
Raise your glasses.

356
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,400
Cheers!

357
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,400
Cheers!

358
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,480
Hooray!

359
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,600
Mr.Wichan!

360
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,200
There is a group of people who break into the house area!

361
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,440
Yeah?

362
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,320
And you will let them waltz in until they reach me?

363
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,960
Go get rid of them.

364
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,800
Chin!

365
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,080
Chin!

366
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,040
Chin!

367
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,480
Don’t die!

368
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,960
Jolie..

369
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,800
I’m so sorry

370
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,200
that I could only come this far.

371
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,760
You can’t die!

372
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,960
Please, Chin!

373
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:14,960
Don’t die.

374
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,360
Bite his neck, Jolie!

375
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,920
Now Jolie!

376
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,800
Bite his neck now!

377
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,960
Chin.

378
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,520
Jolie.

379
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,200
Patrick

380
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,760
break in!

381
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,920
Well done.

382
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,200
You could come this far hm?

383
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,120
Stop talking nonsense.

384
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,440
Fight or surrender.

385
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,560
Choose!

386
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,040
I thought about who it was. Patrick.

387
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,240
The governor’s nephew.

388
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,720
And the phrase fight or surrender

389
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,200
it should be me who said that.

390
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,920
A young vampires like you

391
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,360
don't be so confident.

392
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,240
Any last words for your loved ones?

393
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,080
Because you

394
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,040
both will die here.

395
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,080
Are you alright?

396
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,400
Hm.

397
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,720
Do you really think

398
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,880
that you can win?

399
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,080
Pathetic.

400
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,640
Are you ok?

401
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,200
Yes, I’m ok.

402
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,440
You?

403
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,920
Just a few scratches

404
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,040
but I’m ok.

405
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,440
The reason that we won today

406
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,440
is because we all work together.

407
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,440
I want all of you to go back and get some rest

408
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,440
and heal yourself fast

409
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,360
because we have one more significant war to face.

410
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,640
In the next two days

411
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,400
we will meet at the gateway to Vampire Land

412
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,120
at the end of the pine forest.

413
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,040
Hey.

414
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,000
I..

415
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,280
I have something to ask you.

416
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,240
Why

417
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,560
did Jolie bite Chin

418
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,440
but she didn't turn into a human?

419
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,320
Well, I can explain in a clear picture.

420
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,800
Human who is being bitten by a vampire

421
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,200
and in a state of dying

422
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,200
when being bitten by a vampire who is their lover,

423
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,680
The human will turn into a vampire

424
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,960
but the vampire won’t turn into a human.

425
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,600
Hm.

426
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,320
So it's different from me.

427
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,000
Mine

428
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,760
he tricked me into loving him

429
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,280
so that he could bite me

430
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,120
and turn it into a human himself.

431
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,920
I think

432
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,840
that vampire loved you

433
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,680
but not as much

434
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,240
as he loved himself.

435
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,280
So this means

436
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:20,040
that I’m a vampire now?

437
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,800
I’m so sorry

438
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,400
that

439
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,360
I made you

440
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,440
become a vampire like me.

441
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,360
Don’t be sorry.

442
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,880
You saved my life.

443
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,080
I become a vampire

444
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,480
it's good

445
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,080
so that I can be like you.

446
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,200
Ahem!

447
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,320
I think

448
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,400
we should go get some rest

449
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,040
because around here

450
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,280
It seems to fill with love.

451
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,680
Zen

452
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,840
Zen

453
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,280
My wound hurts.

454
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,880
I want a magic potion.

455
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,520
Magic potion like that day

456
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,560
As doctor

457
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,040
If the wound is this big,

458
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,560
you'll need to get an injection.

459
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,480
What are you talking about?

460
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,800
Ummm

461
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,800
Don't be stubborn with the doctor.

462
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,360
So

463
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,440
I want to give you an injection.

464
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,280
Ohhh

465
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,280
The human city's whisky

466
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,760
is very strong.

467
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,280
Are you okay?

468
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,920
It seems like you can't handle it at all.

469
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,720
Captain,

470
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,720
please help me sober up a bit.

471
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,760
Are you sure

472
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,120
you want me to sober you up?

473
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,800
Is it better?

474
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,320
A little

475
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,280
Then

476
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,600
let's go to our room to sober up.

477
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,400
Yes

478
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,600
Nothing

479
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,840
Are you my boyfriend?

480
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,360
What are you looking at?

481
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,400
Aren't you going to eat it?

482
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,920
I look at cute guy.

483
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,680
What's wrong?

484
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,600
Strange

485
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,280
What's strange?

486
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,040
If I have a cute boyfriend,

487
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,520
I have to look at my boyfriend.

488
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,040
What?

489
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,800
I'd better put the dishes away.

490
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,720
Oh

491
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,920
What's this about you?

492
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,520
What's this about you?

493
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,680
After finishing eating savory food,

494
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,120
don't you want to continue eating dessert?

495
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,200
Where is the dessert?

496
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,280
Then turn around.

497
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,920
How?

498
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:03,880
Is it sweet?

499
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,040
It's not very sweet at all

500
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,760
but it's a candy shell.

501
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,960
If you want to eat dessert

502
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,840
Peel off the shell.

503
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,120
Really?

504
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,080
Try it

505
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,320
Stop it, everyone.

506
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,720
It's here.

507
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,720
Can I have a look please?

508
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,000
Is this

509
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,280
the gate connecting two cities?

510
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,840
Where's the door?

511
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,800
I only see forests and trees.

512
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,120
I don't see anything.

513
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,400
Oh

514
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,480
Mick

515
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,440
Hey

516
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,760
Everyone's ready.

517
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:53,760
Everyone

518
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,680
Go

519
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,920
This round of toad blood was really strong.

520
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,800
Who gave it to you?

521
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,680
This bottle

522
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,480
was taken from the governor's office.

523
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,080
Eat good things.

524
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:28,080
It probably won't eat anything from now on.

525
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,720
General

526
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,880
the execution ground is already prepared.

527
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,720
Good

528
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,000
And how are the prisoners?

529
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:41,520
Look!

530
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,160
They are not afraid of dying at all.

531
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,320
afraid or not, you'll know tomorrow.

532
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,880
Have you received any news from Wichan?

533
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:50,680
He hasn't sent

534
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,040
any news yet.

535
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,720
What is it doing?

536
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,800
You guys can go now.

537
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,480
stop

538
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,160
You guys so brave.

539
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,640
Young whippersnapper!

540
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,520
Even if you break the rules,

541
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,080
you still dare to invade this place.

542
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,320
Why don't I dare?

543
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,760
When a vampire like you

544
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,280
plans to take over this city.

545
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,000
Captain Joe

546
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,960
dares to betray me to go to that side?

547
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,880
When did I say

548
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,440
that I'm on the same side as you?

549
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,840
I'll give you all a chance.

550
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,200
Who wants to survive?

551
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,760
Let's move to my side.

552
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,720
good

553
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,240
Then let's all die.

554
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,320
Long time no see,

555
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,680
General Lux

556
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,640
Patrick,

557
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,680
I'm glad

558
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,360
you remember me

559
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,640
but I have an offer.

560
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,680
What?

561
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,440
I challenge you, as the grandson of the city governor,

562
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,320
Just you and me

563
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,480
Fighting

564
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,440
If you win,

565
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,320
I will give you the governor’s insignia.

566
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,440
Including their lives.

567
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,000
Why?

568
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,320
Are you afraid of losing?

569
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,200
Sure

570
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,080
But if I win

571
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,600
You must kill yourself.

572
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,880
Do you dare?

573
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,760
Then you guys prepare to die.

574
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,600
So good at this?

575
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,440
Don't have to say much.

576
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,000
How good is this?

577
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:20,760
Patrick

578
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,560
Don't die

579
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,000
We have to stay together, Patrick.

580
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,040
Fighting!

581
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,400
Patrick

582
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,480
You don't have to kill yourself,

583
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,520
I'll take care of it for you.

584
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:43,040
this

585
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:43,960
Ah!

586
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,720
Who is who's boyfriend or girlfriend?

587
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,680
I'm

588
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,360
Poom boyfriend

589
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,960
As for Ran and I

590
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,480
We're

591
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,280
already married

592
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,600
here

593
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,320
We're married.

594
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:11,960
Well

595
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:13,400
I'm shocked.

596
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,400
But I can accept it.

597
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,320
As for me

598
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:20,840
I'm Chin girlfriend

599
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:25,440
Who is he

600
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,200
He's human

601
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,160
but now he's a vampire.

602
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:33,680
Please take care of my sister, Brother Chin.

603
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:34,720
Sure

604
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:35,560
However

605
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:38,040
I'll take care of Jolie as best I can.

606
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,280
Okay.

607
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:45,120
After all, everyone is in a relationship.

608
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,480
Lieutenant Nikky

609
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:52,960
He's my boyfriend.

610
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,440
Huh!

611
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:58,400
It's like proposing for marriage.

612
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,240
Yes!

613
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:01,160
Really steals the scene.

614
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:02,560
Come on.

615
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:03,720
And what about you?

616
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,360
Hmmm.

617
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:07,160
How about it, child?

618
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:10,240
Or because you were human, you couldn't come to the vampire city.

619
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,280
beautiful?

620
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:13,920
Is she a model?

621
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,200
or that

622
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,400
Is he handsome?

623
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,000
How about it, child?

624
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:23,480
Hey!

625
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:26,960
Oh

626
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,600
I don't have any yet.

627
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:31,280
Poor my child

628
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,400
nevermind

629
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,360
It's okay, my child.

630
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:35,560
It'll come soon, child.

631
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:36,960
I'll give you some money.

632
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,160
You're handsome, my boy

633
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:39,920
Is it true?

634
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:40,400
It's true.

635
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,440
I'm handsome like my father and mother.

636
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,240
And Patrick?

637
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,400
About governor

638
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,160
giving you the position.

639
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:48,520
What do you say?

640
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:51,200
Ummm

641
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:53,320
I feel like

642
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:55,560
I'm not like being the city governor.

643
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:58,960
I'd rather go back to living in the human world.

644
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:03,800
Oh, now

645
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,360
Like this

646
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:08,720
Who will inherit the position of governor?

647
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:09,680
Anyone?

648
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:11,120
Is anyone interested?

649
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:18,600
human city

650
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:22,760
Hopefully, the methods we've learned

651
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:25,840
will prevent us from having to drink red wine again.

652
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:26,840
Right!

653
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:29,120
I'll be human again.

654
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,280
Hello

655
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,720
Can I join?

656
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:37,160
Mai

657
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:39,200
Heyy

658
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,680
Aren't you afraid of them anymore?

659
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:42,800
I thought about it

660
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:43,960
If they were to gang up

661
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:44,680
and suck my blood,

662
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:46,480
I wouldn't be standing here.

663
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:49,760
One more thing,

664
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:53,200
I feel sorry for the friendship between you and me, Poom

665
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:54,120
and

666
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:55,560
all of you as well.

667
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,760
Hmmm.

668
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,320
Come on!

669
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:02,400
My BFF

670
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:04,680
You're not going to bite my throat, are you?

671
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:06,080
I'll really bite you.

672
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:07,840
Calm down! dude

673
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:09,040
Hmmm.

674
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,800
enough

675
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,440
Hug for too long

676
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,080
I'm sorry.

677
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:16,920
Can I hug you too?

678
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:19,520
Kin

679
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:20,960
hello

680
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:22,480
What are you hugging?

681
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:24,280
Take it easy, man

682
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:25,640
I'm just joking.

683
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:27,200
It's me and Poom.

684
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,280
We've cleared

685
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:30,400
that we're just friends.

686
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,800
The two of you

687
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:33,160
are boyfriend.

688
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:34,840
I won't interfere.

689
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:36,280
Apart from...

690
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:38,200
Apart from what?

691
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:40,520
Apart from

692
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:42,200
the two of you broke up.

693
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:52,280
Actually, I'm looking for a way to break up with Poom.

694
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:54,440
But there's no way we'll ever break up.

695
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:56,560
I think you'd be better off

696
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,840
just giving up and finding someone new.

697
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,400
It's enough

698
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:02,520
for both of you.

699
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:03,800
Kin

700
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:04,560
can stop teasing

701
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:05,840
Patrick now.

702
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:07,960
As for you,

703
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:10,320
stop being jealous of me.

704
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:12,320
I love only you,

705
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:13,360
do you know that?

706
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:20,920
I'm going to vomit. How much will it be?

707
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:21,600
Well

708
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:22,280
I think

709
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:24,400
everyone should sit down first.

710
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:26,160
Good,

711
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:27,160
you're welcome.

712
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:29,960
Sir

713
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:31,800
2 glasses of champagne

714
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:35,840
Cheer!

715
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:38,920
Mom

716
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:39,720
Hmmm.

717
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,000
Mom, you have to take good care of yourself.

718
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:43,400
Yes.

719
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,160
You don't have to order.

720
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:46,480
Mick

721
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,120
Can't you go, child?

722
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:49,080
Hey

723
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:51,000
I don't want you to go.

724
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,120
I speak from the heart.

725
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:54,680
I want you to stay with me.

726
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:56,120
Can it be?

727
00:47:57,720 --> 00:47:59,440
I don't really want to go, mom

728
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:02,440
but it's really necessary.

729
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,000
I promise that

730
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,200
I'll come back to visit you often.

731
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:12,000
Even though there may not be time,

732
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,560
I promise

733
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,440
that I'll find time for you.

734
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:22,440
Hmmm, Mick.

735
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:26,360
please make a wish, child.

736
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:28,360
I wish my child good luck and success.

737
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:31,240
Whatever you do, it will only get better and better.

738
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:32,920
If you make any decision,

739
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:34,840
may blessings pour out

740
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:36,280
in his decision.

741
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:37,920
May you prosper.

742
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:39,800
amen

743
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:40,760
Mick

744
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:44,000
Can't you go?

745
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:47,160
Mick!

746
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:48,840
I love you very much.

747
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:50,000
Mick!

748
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,120
I love you the most.

749
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:53,240
This person I love the most.

750
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:54,520
Mick

751
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:00,760
Oh my god Mick!

752
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:03,760
Don't cry.

753
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:06,520
I love you the most, child.

754
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:08,560
Mom

755
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:14,520
Why do you have to go?

756
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:23,720
Thank you, mom.

757
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:27,040
Take good care of yourself.

758
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:27,640
Yes.

759
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:28,000
no

760
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,160
Cried like a child.

761
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:31,120
We'll come back to see each other again.

762
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:32,320
No, no, no crying.

763
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:34,360
Don't cry.

764
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:35,960
Go, go, child.

765
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:36,920
Go, child. Go.

766
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:39,120
I love you.

767
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:40,640
I love you the most, child.

768
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:42,760
Go, go, go.

769
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:44,240
What is this?

770
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:48,680
Bye!

771
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,440
Let's go.

772
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:54,760
Mick

773
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:56,080
Promise me

774
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:58,520
That you'll come back to me

775
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:01,520
Yes, mother.

776
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:03,880
Oh, my son

777
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:06,480
Oh, oh, hey!

778
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,920
Mother's beloved child

779
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:43,280
I offer you

780
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,120
the position of Lord

781
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:46,680
of the Vampire City

782
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:47,920
and hope that

783
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,960
you'll rule it well

784
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:52,040
and happily for a long time to come.

785
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:54,600
It's time for

786
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:55,840
a new generation of vampires

787
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:57,240
to take over

788
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:02,600
and do their part well.

789
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:02,040
It's delicious to chew.

790
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:03,720
This Thai dessert

791
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:05,960
is said to have

792
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:08,080
a very firm texture.

793
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:10,000
We do not use any preservatives

794
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,280
or borax.

795
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:12,160
Let me try it.

796
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,360
Jolie

797
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:41,360
What are you doing?

798
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:43,240
How to wake up a sleepy person?

799
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,640
Aren't you tired at all?

800
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:50,960
Last night it was almost morning.

801
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:54,240
I don't feel tired at all.

802
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:56,160
old person

803
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:57,520
That's it.

804
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:59,320
You're 100 years old already.

805
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:01,040
Little by little, feel tired.

806
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:06,640
Hmm.

807
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:08,840
Who was old just now?

808
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:10,640
Well

809
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:12,720
People around here

810
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:14,160
People around here

811
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:16,840
Well

812
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:18,840
Hey!

813
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:25,000
That's enough.

814
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:29,160
Why don't you say it again?

815
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:30,040
Who is old?

816
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:34,000
I don't see anyone talking.

817
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,560
Just now there was

818
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:37,720
I have to shut your mouth.

819
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:41,800
Hey!

820
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:44,640
It'll be long.

821
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:53,560
Tonight

822
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:55,400
The moon's full.

823
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:58,000
Are you ready?

824
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:03,600
Ready!

825
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:07,040
But I don't know.

826
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:08,400
Will it be effective or not?

827
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:12,520
Whether it can or not,

828
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:14,120
Let's try it first.

829
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,200
afraid?

830
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:52,640
Don't be afraid.

831
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,080
If we've done it already

832
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:56,480
We didn't become human.

833
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:59,480
We'll die together.

834
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,160
Do you understand?

835
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,240
We're okay

836
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:14,280
We don't die.

837
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:19,240
We have become human.

838
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:41,240
I really want my friends to stay with me.

839
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:42,040
Hey!

840
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:43,600
We're here.

841
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:46,080
We have become human.

842
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:47,960
The book isn't really a scam.

843
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:53,120
By the way,

844
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:54,800
where did you find the book?

845
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:57,040
The previous governor gave it to me.

846
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:58,560
Told you to try reading it.

847
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:00,680
There are things we want to write.

848
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:03,760
Oh wow!

849
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:05,680
Whose boyfriend is this?

850
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:07,600
The best at it.

851
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:08,800
Hey!

852
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:11,240
My boyfriend is smart too.

853
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:15,960
Oh, yes.

854
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:16,680
What are we going to talk about?

855
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:19,480
Please be considerate of single people like me.

856
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:37,080
I miss you Mick.

857
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:39,040
I don't know what he'll be like.

858
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:41,600
I'm here.

859
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:42,480
Hey!

860
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:43,720
I'm Mick.

861
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:44,720
Come here quickly.

862
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:46,720
fast

863
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:52,960
Oh wow!

864
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:54,240
Prepare a cloth.

865
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:55,160
Please have a seat.

866
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:57,040
Come sit here, Mai

867
00:57:58,800 --> 00:57:59,800
Thank you.

868
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:04,000
My lord of the city

869
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:17,360
I'm happy for you guys too.

870
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:19,280
May you all live

871
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:20,600
your lives as human

872
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:22,680
beings to the fullest extent possible.

873
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:24,200
You're the same, Mick.

874
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:26,240
You're the governor of all vampires.

875
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:29,120
I think you're the coolest governor.

876
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:34,360
Captain and Lieutenant

877
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:35,200
Don't forget

878
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:37,200
Please take good care of my friend.

879
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:39,120
Certainly

880
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:40,360
Will not let any villain

881
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:41,760
harm them at all.

882
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:46,560
Everyone has a partner.

883
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:48,360
or that

884
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:49,600
we

885
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:51,000
will

886
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:53,960
Yes!

887
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:57,520
I like being alone.

888
00:59:57,960 --> 00:59:59,200
Please, Come on!

889
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:00,320
He's not like other people.

890
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:01,640
Hey, I don't want it.

891
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:02,440
A little bit

892
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:03,160
Mai! Mai!

893
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:04,400
I'm the the governor

894
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:05,640
The governor is the governor.

895
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:06,120
no

896
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:06,960
I don't want to have a queen.

897
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:07,560
Mai!

898
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:09,120
I'll be the only governor.

899
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:10,040
Don't mess with me.

900
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:11,040
Mai!!
