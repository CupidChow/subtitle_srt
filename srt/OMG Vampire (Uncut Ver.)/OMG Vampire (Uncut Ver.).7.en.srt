1
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:07,920
Calling for an urgent gathering like this

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,200
what's the matter, Boss?

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,120
Now general Lux

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,080
is planning a rebellion.

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,480
He has been contacted with Wichan

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,600
to find him the governor’s insignia.

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,280
Moreover, Wichan knew that

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,560
we have the vampire associate

9
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,960
and he thinks that we have that insignia.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,040
However, I also do not know

11
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,200
where the insignia is.

12
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,600
I want all of you

13
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,880
to deal with this matter as fast as possible.

14
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:32,680
I want all of you

15
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,160
to gather a vampire associate.

16
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,360
Then eliminate both Wichan

17
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,760
and general Lux.

18
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,080
Mr.Wichan

19
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,360
want to buy this shop.

20
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,000
I’m sorry

21
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,840
but we won’t sell this shop.

22
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,080
Hm..

23
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,400
You guys

24
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,520
know each other?

25
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,600
Take them to the jail!

26
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,680
And capture the rest!

27
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,480
Mr.Wichan

28
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,440
got the order from general Lux.

29
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,480
He has to find the governor's insignia.

30
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:40,360
(Thai traditional

31
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,560
wedding song singing.)

32
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,560
What you said in the evening

33
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,600
you

34
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,400
really meant what you said?

35
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,480
Where have you been?

36
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,280
I went to have a glass of water.

37
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,080
I'm thirsty.

38
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,760
You went for a glass of water

39
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,200
and you had to dress like this?

40
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,040
Well it was cold outside.

41
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,440
So I have to

42
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,960
put on some thicker clothes.

43
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,280
And we just

44
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,720
well had sex.

45
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,320
Shut it.

46
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,120
You pervert.

47
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,920
By the way

48
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,560
I want to warm myself up again with you.

49
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,520
You-

50
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,520
You pervert.

51
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,560
What are you doing!

52
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,160
I'm just hugging you here.

53
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,840
I won't do anything more.

54
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,880
If you dare do more than just hugging,

55
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,160
I will face the consequences.

56
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,880
We aren't friends anymore.

57
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,200
Did you try to do something when I was sleeping?

58
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:42,720
What?

59
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,600
Who did that?

60
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,360
Then who just kissed me hm?

61
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,320
Why?

62
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,240
I can't kiss my boyfriend?

63
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,480
Hey!

64
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,400
Zen

65
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,560
what are you doing!

66
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,560
Let me have you.

67
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,560
Hey!

68
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,880
May you have long life

69
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,680
full of happiness

70
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,760
and good health.

71
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,440
Since I was born

72
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,480
this is my first time seeing vampires give alms to the monk.

73
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,200
You should try to do something you haven't done before.

74
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,960
Doing this makes me feel better.

75
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:00,760
Oh well

76
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,960
your words

77
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,480
sound more like humans in every day.

78
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,760
Well we have to adjust

79
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,640
because we don't know how long will we live in this body.

80
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,560
Talking about this body.

81
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,680
I miss my parents so much.

82
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:18,760
Hey.

83
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,800
What are you guys doing out here?

84
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,600
Oh.

85
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,400
I brought the newlywed couple

86
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,400
to give alms a monk.

87
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,320
Really?

88
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,120
You guys

89
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,680
don't feel suffer being close to the monk?

90
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,520
Oh please.

91
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,800
Your couple

92
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,680
yesterday

93
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,120
got all the attention.

94
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,720
What attention?

95
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,560
Patrick.

96
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,080
Yes?

97
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,400
Can I talk with you?

98
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,520
Yes, of course.

99
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,360
Just you and me, please.

100
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,000
What do you mean only you two?

101
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,960
Are you keeping a secret from me?

102
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,240
What Poom?

103
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:06,960
Oh please.

104
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,800
Are you jealous?

105
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,560
Come on. I won’t steal him from you.

106
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:10,960
Mix!

107
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,720
No.

108
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,600
Stop.

109
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,160
Patrick

110
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,080
let's go talk inside instead.

111
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,120
Inside

112
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,080
there is an air conditioner

113
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,080
more colder than here.

114
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,600
Outside is hot.

115
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,080
Come this way.

116
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:21,600
Now

117
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,720
I will tell you a story.

118
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,160
Once upon a time

119
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:24,880
there was a Stork.

120
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,760
Does he have to wrap his arm around his waist?

121
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,960
The stork is over there.

122
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,200
Um

123
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,480
Officially hello again.

124
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,000
Mix

125
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
do you have something to talk to me?

126
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,160
Yes, I do.

127
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,800
I have something to sell you.

128
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,400
This item

129
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,160
is the only piece in the world.

130
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,200
If I'm not in the financial problems

131
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,280
I won't sell it to you.

132
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,160
Um.. Mix.

133
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,520
It's ok.

134
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,000
I understand you

135
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,320
but please have a look at this item first.

136
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,040
Then you can decide

137
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,080
whether to buy it

138
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,160
or suggest any place for selling it.

139
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:15,720
Ok.

140
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,480
Here.

141
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:33,920
Mix

142
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,000
please answer me honestly

143
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,520
where did you get this?

144
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,960
I didn't steal it.

145
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,880
I saw it on the floor

146
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,440
and I picked it up.

147
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,760
Please, Patrick.

148
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,280
I’m so sorry.

149
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,880
Please don't be angry at me.

150
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,480
I did not steal it.

151
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,440
I didn't intend to steal it.

152
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,800
Please

153
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,200
don't call the police.

154
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,000
Please Patrick

155
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,160
I saw it on the ground.

156
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:15,600
Please

157
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,200
don't call the police.

158
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:17,800
Please, Patrick.

159
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,320
Calm down.

160
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:18,920
Please calm down.

161
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:19,760
Mix

162
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,760
I haven't said anything yet.

163
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:24,920
Oh.

164
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,280
By the way

165
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,640
Will you buy it?

166
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,000
Are you interested?

167
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,560
You were crying just a moment ago.

168
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,200
Oh.

169
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,680
That was the different parts of me.

170
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,160
We human

171
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,160
always have two personalities.

172
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,240
Back there was a drama part

173
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,760
now a selling part.

174
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:52,600
Oh right.

175
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,560
Different parts yeah?

176
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,320
So

177
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,640
will you buy it?

178
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,080
Yes, I will.

179
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,440
How much is it?

180
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,920
Come on you look like a giraffe doing that long neck.

181
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,640
If you are worried about him like that

182
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,120
just go see him.

183
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,120
I didn't do that.

184
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,240
I just see?

185
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,400
Stretching

186
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,760
like this.

187
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,120
Well last night

188
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,080
my neck is sore.

189
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Your neck is sore?

190
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,840
What did you do let night?

191
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,240
I

192
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,920
I didn't do anything with Patrick.

193
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,240
I just lay on the bed.

194
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,960
What are you guys smiling for?

195
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,160
How about your

196
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,480
first night together?

197
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,280
How was it?

198
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,040
We are husband and wife it's normal for us.

199
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,400
What about your couple?

200
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,560
Tell me

201
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,840
you did that with him right?

202
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,320
If you don't answer

203
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,120
then

204
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,480
I will ask Patrick myself.

205
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,640
No wait!

206
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,680
Sit down.

207
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,680
Yeah.

208
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,040
We

209
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,160
did that.

210
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,840
So..

211
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,400
Does that mean you guys are in a relationship now?

212
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,840
He hasn't asked me to be in a relationship yet.

213
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,280
What should I do?

214
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,680
I fell in love with him.

215
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,680
If he knows that I’m a vampire

216
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,680
he will break up with me.

217
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,760
Don't you worry your head.

218
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,000
I think that

219
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,360
If he really loves you

220
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,080
whatever you are

221
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,360
he can accept you.

222
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,120
You speak well.

223
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,800
I was in a dramatic mood you know?

224
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,720
Showing affection and completely ignoring me huh?

225
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,840
Getting more bold huh?

226
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,160
Huh?

227
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,560
We are a married couple.

228
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,920
We can do anything we want to do.

229
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,560
Hey.

230
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:09,880
That's enough.

231
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,040
Come on

232
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,640
just go back into the house.

233
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,800
Spit it out.

234
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,640
What is your problem

235
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,200
that you have to meet me here again.

236
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,760
It's about Jolie.

237
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,600
What will you do huh?

238
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,280
What will I do?

239
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,480
You said we would flirt with her and see who would win her heart.

240
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,760
Who will capture her heart?

241
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,640
I think she seems

242
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,600
to like me more than you.

243
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,920
Just give up.

244
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,840
What?

245
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,800
You said she likes you more?

246
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,800
But from what I see

247
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,240
she seems to like me more.

248
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,920
It's you who is supposed to give up and walk away.

249
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,040
I’m not backing down.

250
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,960
Me neither.

251
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,880
You better give up.

252
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,800
No, I won’t.

253
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,520
Me neither.

254
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,240
I won’t back down.

255
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,000
I won’t as well.

256
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,640
I won’t!

257
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,320
I won’t!

258
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:07,760
You should give up.

259
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,320
No, you!

260
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:08,680
No, you!

261
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,320
You!

262
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,080
I won’t!

263
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,040
Then let's do it like this.

264
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:13,960
You and me

265
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,080
take turns flirting every day.

266
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,160
When we both together

267
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,000
we can't do anything to gain her favor.

268
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,480
Well, you keep interrupting me.

269
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,880
So I have to do it back.

270
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,000
This is why I’m telling you this.

271
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,840
You and me

272
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,760
take turns flirting with her.

273
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,440
Fine

274
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,680
take turns each day.

275
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,160
I'm in even days.

276
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,400
You have odd days.

277
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,480
I don't want to go to the toilet now.

278
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,320
Not that-

279
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,760
But fine.

280
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,040
We have a deal.

281
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:45,800
Yeah.

282
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,400
Fine.

283
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,280
Let go of my hand.

284
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,160
No, you let go of my hand first.

285
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,720
No, you first.

286
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,400
No, you first.

287
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,080
That's what they call human life.

288
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:04,760
I’m sorry

289
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,280
I just

290
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,720
finished delivering goods to the customers.

291
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,040
So many queues today.

292
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,280
It's ok Jolie.

293
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,280
Here

294
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,160
we are all friends.

295
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:13,920
What is wrong with him?

296
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,120
If we are all here

297
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:18,680
then

298
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,640
I shall start.

299
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,440
After that day

300
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,880
from what you guys told me.

301
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,120
I went back and thought

302
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,520
about my feelings for Poom.

303
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,200
I will take a chance to tell you guys here.

304
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,200
Poom will you be my boyfriend?

305
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,840
Yes just like that!

306
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,280
You said that

307
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,120
and my friends here are the witnesses.

308
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,760
If you can't keep your words

309
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,000
you are dead.

310
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,600
What are you doing?

311
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,480
Oh, come on

312
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,680
Poom.

313
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,440
Don’t act like you are shy.

314
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,200
I know you

315
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,200
like that.

316
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,120
Like what?

317
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,000
Well like Patrick.

318
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,560
What?

319
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,680
You told us how much you like him yeah?

320
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,320
Come on.

321
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,360
Finally, our friend found his soulmate.

322
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,680
Then today

323
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,920
Who wants to eat anything

324
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,040
order it

325
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,760
I will pay for all the foods.

326
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,840
You have money?

327
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,640
What? Come on.

328
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,160
Why speak such things man?

329
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,920
Of course, I have money

330
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,040
a lot of them!

331
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,320
And where did you get those money from?

332
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,760
Um..

333
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,440
I’m doing a business

334
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,760
business with..

335
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,080
Umm..

336
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,960
with Patrick.

337
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,280
Hey.

338
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,640
Don’t tell me

339
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,960
that you sold Poom to Patrick?

340
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,520
What?

341
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,480
Are you crazy?

342
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,680
How could I do that?

343
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,160
Poom like Patrick by himself.

344
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,520
By the way whatever you guys want to eat

345
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,600
just hurry and order the foods.

346
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,120
Rich Man Mix will pay!

347
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,800
Hey, I saw that.

348
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,960
If you can’t wait any longer

349
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,320
you can go home first.

350
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,400
I understand how it feels.

351
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,840
shut up mix

352
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,280
What?

353
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,800
What did you just call me?

354
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,720
Mix.

355
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,600
No, I’m Rich Man Mix now.

356
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,920
Put the title on for me ok?

357
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,120
That's my new pronoun.

358
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,040
Yeah yeah Rich Man Mix.

359
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,480
You silly man.

360
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,840
What's wrong Chin?

361
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,080
Not perform tonight?

362
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:23,480
Hey.

363
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,880
Stop being lazy.

364
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,680
if not iI will deduct your salary.

365
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,440
What the?

366
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,320
What happened?

367
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,680
Men’s pride bro.

368
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,120
What the hell are you saying?

369
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,120
You will never understand

370
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,720
that men’s pride

371
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,360
can't be bent.

372
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,520
Let's say

373
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,760
I can’t perform tonight

374
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,040
and I can't sing either.

375
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,400
If you want to deduct my salary then go ahead.

376
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,320
Hm..

377
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,400
Up to you then.

378
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,600
But Chin

379
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,480
I have to run some errands for a while.

380
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,680
Can you take care of Poom for me?

381
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,640
Oh please. If you are this possessive of him

382
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,160
why don't you chain him up at the house?

383
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,080
I can do that?

384
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,800
Crazy in love

385
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,880
I’m so jealous of the couple.

386
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,440
Shut it.

387
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,760
Take care of him for me.

388
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,800
Don’t let anyone

389
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,280
bother him at all.

390
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,480
Okay?

391
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,000
Of course!

392
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,680
Chin your bro

393
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,440
will take care of your boyfriend

394
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,160
and I won’t let anyone lay a finger on him.

395
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,400
Ok?

396
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,400
Ok very well.

397
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,280
Where is Patrick going?

398
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,880
He said he had to run some errands

399
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,560
but he didn't mention what are they.

400
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,160
Hey! Hey! Hey!

401
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:00,600
Calm down.

402
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,440
What?

403
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,280
Come on.

404
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,800
He has to run some errands that's all.

405
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,360
Don't be so possessive.

406
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,440
It's too much.

407
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,520
Hey.

408
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,400
If both of you are this possessive towards each other

409
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,720
why don't you just tie yourself up at home?

410
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,120
So sarcastic huh?

411
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,920
I may just tell Jolie to like Maai.

412
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,160
No no.

413
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,400
Don’t do that.

414
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,240
Hello Poom.

415
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,320
Another problem.

416
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,640
Hello.

417
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:33,880
Are you

418
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,880
here to see someone

419
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,000
or

420
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,280
you reserved the table here?

421
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,080
No table reservation

422
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,800
and no meeting someone.

423
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,240
I intentionally come here to see you.

424
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,880
I’m afraid that you can't right now

425
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,920
because

426
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,840
Poom

427
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,640
is still on his shift.

428
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:52,960
Oh.

429
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,280
But I have a very important matter to discuss with Poom.

430
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,960
Do you have any spare time for me?

431
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,360
Then..

432
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,360
Could you wait for me at the table over there for a moment please?

433
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:09,880
I would go change first.

434
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,040
Of course.

435
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,600
Damn.

436
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,560
What a day!

437
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,160
Maai, who are you looking for?

438
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,280
I’m looking for

439
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,200
a third wheel.

440
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,080
A

441
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:44,560
third

442
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,360
wheel?

443
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,120
Why would you look for that?

444
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,000
Isn’t it supposed to be on the car?

445
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,440
Moreover

446
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,360
the foods we ordered

447
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,800
are already here no wheel.

448
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,920
Oh

449
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,000
You are so funny, Jolie.

450
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,720
I didn't mean that third wheel.

451
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,280
I mean Chin.

452
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:07,360
He always is a third wheel between us.

453
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,280
Oh

454
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,080
right.

455
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,120
Um. I want to ask you about this for a while now

456
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,400
but I was busy packaging the products.

457
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,640
What happened to your hand?

458
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,040
Oh, this?

459
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,120
Well it is

460
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,840
men’s pride

461
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,640
Jolie.

462
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,640
Oh, you got a new tattoo?

463
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,680
What design?

464
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,800
Can I have a look?

465
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,120
You are being funny again.

466
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,760
I didn't mean that I got a new tattoo

467
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,360
but it was the fighting of real men.

468
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,320
Oh.

469
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,000
I see

470
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,720
but I still don't understand.

471
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,520
Let's eat.

472
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,680
Men’s pride? What is that?

473
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,080
Found the target.

474
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,200
When she left the restaurant

475
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,240
get her.

476
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,280
What is the matter that you want to discuss, Kin?

477
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,280
Shall we have a drink first?

478
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,600
And we can talk later.

479
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,640
I don’t think it's a good idea.

480
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,000
I am still in my working shift.

481
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,400
If I drink now, it will be inappropriate.

482
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:18,800
Ok.

483
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,440
Well.

484
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,560
The topic that I want to discuss is about work.

485
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,280
I have been thinking

486
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,600
that being a waiter

487
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,040
doesn't suit you.

488
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:28,960
Well

489
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,040
I’m opening an organized company

490
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,640
and I need an assistant.

491
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,800
I think

492
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,280
this position suit you well.

493
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,960
Oh, I don't think I can fit in such a position.

494
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,120
I don’t think I have that many skills.

495
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,160
Please don't sell yourself short like that.

496
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,280
Poom don’t have to worry

497
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,000
I will teach you every step of working.

498
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,120
But for me

499
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,320
I think

500
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,680
the job I have now

501
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,720
is good enough for me.

502
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:50,920
Good?

503
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,000
How?

504
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,080
Well it's good

505
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,080
because he can work with his boyfriend.

506
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,800
Boyfriend?

507
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,640
What boyfriend?

508
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,800
Well Poom

509
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,080
and Patrick

510
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,680
are now in a relationship.

511
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,840
Really Poom?

512
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,240
Why did you decide so fast?

513
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,760
Do you know him enough?

514
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,440
What if he takes advantage of you?

515
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,840
I think

516
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,600
he can’t be trusted.

517
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,520
Hey!

518
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,200
Are you accusing my bro?

519
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,800
I said from what I saw.

520
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,480
Watch your mouth!

521
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,200
You!

522
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,240
I’m sorry. I’m sorry

523
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:31,960
but you

524
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,280
stay calm first.

525
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:36,920
Well

526
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,280
Kin.

527
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,520
I already made up my mind.

528
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,400
Good or bad

529
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,880
I will receive my consequence.

530
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,440
Why don't you give me a chance?

531
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,120
I believe I can definitely take care of you better.

532
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,000
Sometime

533
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,880
Love doesn't have anything as you wish

534
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,680
Once,

535
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,440
I made a wrong decision

536
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,320
Kin should know better

537
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,760
Who is that person?

538
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,560
Poom didn't give me a chance

539
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,480
because we both look good, right?

540
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,400
Not like that

541
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,840
I can distinguish

542
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,760
Love

543
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,560
is complicate like this.

544
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,920
Today it may be right,

545
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,040
tomorrow it may not be.

546
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,240
But today

547
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,720
Kin is still not right for me.

548
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,400
I'm sorry

549
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,840
that have to be said honestly.

550
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,080
But

551
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,480
We can still be friends, right?

552
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,240
Sure

553
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,240
Thank you very much.

554
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,240
for still accepting to be my friend.

555
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,560
It's probably true like you said.

556
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,880
Today may not be for you yet

557
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,640
But one day

558
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,760
it may be right?

559
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,360
In the meantime,

560
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,120
we can be friend.

561
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,000
Come on!

562
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,680
Please wait for the rest of your life.

563
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,200
Because I think that

564
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,200
Poom

565
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,600
and Patrick

566
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,200
will never have

567
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,480
to break up.

568
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,600
Stop it

569
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,040
Kin,

570
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,280
I need to go to work first

571
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:47,800
Yes

572
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,880
You

573
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,440
Please wait for the rest of your life.

574
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,480
Please wait a longggg time.

575
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,600
actually

576
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,800
You don't have to send me home

577
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,360
My condo is nearby.

578
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,840
Oh, that's not possible, Jolie.

579
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,680
For your safety

580
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:19,080
I have to send you to the front of the condo only.

581
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,080
But

582
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,040
Jolie

583
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,640
I think

584
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,200
someone has been secretly following us for a while.

585
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,840
But don't look around

586
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,080
Jolie

587
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,840
Run!

588
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,560
Better not think about running away.

589
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,200
Don't come in.

590
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,880
I can fight

591
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,120
Surrender!

592
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,080
If you don't want human

593
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:42,960
to be dangerous.

594
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,520
He's not involved,

595
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,120
don't do anything to him.

596
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,960
What happened here, Jolie?

597
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:48,200
I

598
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,120
I'm so confused

599
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,760
You run away first.

600
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:51,960
No, Jolie

601
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,160
I'll help you!

602
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,560
Run

603
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:54,920
No

604
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,800
Jolie

605
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,920
Please run away

606
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,960
No, Jolie

607
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:58,560
Run

608
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,480
Hey!!

609
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,440
It's annoying.

610
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,520
You're

611
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,760
Vampire!!

612
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:09,920
Jolie

613
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:33,760
I think

614
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,040
we

615
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,680
have to stop pretending!

616
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,200
Ouch!!

617
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:40,840
Jolie

618
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,240
Why are you clapping?

619
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,080
The most important thing now

620
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,440
Run

621
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:50,960
Wait!

622
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:52,720
Mai

623
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,000
Ouch!

624
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,360
Mai

625
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,880
Hey, the cloth is broken.

626
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,760
Do you think that

627
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,000
if he wakes up,

628
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,600
will he be afraid of me?

629
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,440
fainted out like this

630
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,680
Of course!

631
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:16,880
Right!

632
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,600
By the way

633
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,960
How did you find me?

634
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,840
Well, Mick invited us to Patrick's secret bar.

635
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,040
He'll treat

636
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,600
We can't call you.

637
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,120
So I went to look at the condo

638
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,200
until I found you.

639
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,800
Heyy

640
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,720
Ghost

641
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:41,680
Ghost !!

642
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,600
Come on!

643
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,000
Why are we afraid?

644
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,800
We're all ghosts.

645
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,080
Umm...

646
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,840
Are you all ghosts?

647
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,760
Yes

648
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:58,800
Haunted ghost!

649
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,560
Help!!

650
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,560
Wait Mai

651
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:03,400
Mai

652
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,440
Haunted ghost!

653
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:06,960
Help!!

654
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,840
Mai

655
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,840
Mai Stop!

656
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:10,840
Mai

657
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:16,960
Gone

658
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,400
Come on

659
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,160
Whoever it was, everyone was shocked

660
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,680
that the person they liked was suddenly a vampire.

661
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,920
Do you like him?

662
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,800
I like him as a friend.

663
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,760
I don't like him as a boyfriend.

664
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,200
To sum up, the person you like

665
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,920
is Chin, right?

666
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:43,880
See!

667
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,720
You really like Chin

668
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,200
I guess

669
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,600
I guessed not wrong at all.

670
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,320
Umm...

671
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:54,720
But

672
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,680
I saw Mai like this.

673
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,440
I'm sure Chin will be no different.

674
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,640
What should I do?

675
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,760
I already like him.

676
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,440
Come on

677
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,760
Chin, he might be like you.

678
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:16,720
Right!

679
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,600
Guys

680
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,000
We're in trouble

681
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,800
What?

682
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,120
What will it be?

683
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,760
If you all want to live in peace,

684
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,800
then sell this shop to stepfather Wichan.

685
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,440
We don't sell!

686
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,640
Hey

687
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,320
Do you want to get hurt?

688
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,320
I can't stand it anymore.

689
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,680
Come in!

690
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,800
Jolie

691
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,240
Why are you pushing me?

692
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,080
Fighting!

693
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,320
That bastard punched my eye.

694
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,120
punched my eye

695
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,120
You've to fight back!

696
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,520
Why are you pushing me?

697
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,680
You'll go first.

698
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,000
I can't bear it!

699
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:18,840
Well

700
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:28,920
You guys,

701
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,160
what are you?

702
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:32,920
blood

703
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,720
I want to drink blood.

704
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,840
Come!

705
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,360
Come and let me drink your blood.

706
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,480
Mick!

707
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,800
Is this the time to be funny?

708
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,440
I'm sorry

709
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,120
I saw that he was a bit tense.

710
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,920
If you guys don't want to die

711
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,160
Hurry and get the hell out!

712
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,440
Hey!

713
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,320
Go!

714
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,480
Come on!

715
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,720
I though you'll be brave

716
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,160
mix

717
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:02,520
What are you going to say?

718
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,000
You look at each of our bodies.

719
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,320
Oh!

720
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,880
They hit me right here.

721
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,160
How should we tell Auntie Kaew?

722
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,360
Tomorrow morning, when Auntie Kaew comes back,

723
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,800
she'll definitely have to ask us.

724
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,200
Hey! Let's talk about Auntie Kaew later!

725
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:17,880
Keep it later

726
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,360
Now I've got a headache.

727
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,040
You can go rest now.

728
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:21,840
Go!

729
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,720
Jolie, please heal my wound.

730
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,160
Well, I'll do it

731
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:03,960
Lieutenant!

732
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,840
We come to work.

733
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,520
Leave other things for later.

734
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:12,440
Well

735
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,800
I don't know what's wrong with me just now.

736
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,440
unconscious

737
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:14,680
blur

738
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,640
and then I felt dizzy.

739
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,280
calm down

740
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,840
I haven't said anything yet.

741
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,560
Well

742
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:22,520
I think

743
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,120
General

744
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,000
Would you mind getting off of me first?

745
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:27,880
Oh

746
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,160
Let's go

747
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,000
The news has been reported to the members of the Alliance, right?

748
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Done

749
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,360
This is the insignia.

750
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,320
I got it by accident

751
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,600
from a teenage vampire who had fled to a human city.

752
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,560
Then we

753
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,200
can all invade and save the governor

754
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,520
from General Luxu.

755
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:20,240
Not yet

756
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,840
Before we enter Vampire City

757
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,640
We have to deal with Wichan first.

758
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:26,840
Otherwise, if they gather together first,

759
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,800
we won't be able to fight.

760
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,800
We have to cut their force

761
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,600
then go and help the governor.

762
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:34,800
Those eavesdroppers

763
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,160
Jo

764
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,720
It's the vampire police.

765
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,320
Do you remember me now?

766
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,120
Here!

767
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,240
Police

768
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,120
that mean

769
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,080
You're General Lux's servant.

770
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,440
So we'll get rid of you

771
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,320
Wait

772
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,920
We aren't General Lux's servant.

773
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,680
We're investigating about Wichan

774
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:11,840
and General Lux.

775
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,520
Until now,

776
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:14,960
we're clear.

777
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,040
How can we trust you?

778
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,000
that you will not deceive us

779
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,400
You should know me well.

780
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,280
Patrick

781
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,120
Take it

782
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,320
I think it suits you well.

783
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,280
so I bought it for you.

784
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,680
Do you really buy it?

785
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,040
Hey!

786
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,040
Thank you

787
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,560
So when should we go to the human city?

788
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,560
I'm ready

789
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,720
What's wrong with you?

790
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:50,920
Hey

791
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,120
If there's anything, we can tell each other.

792
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:58,840
Patrick

793
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,400
I probably won't be able to go with you.

794
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,080
I'm about to become a police officer.

795
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:13,280
What about

796
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,400
our promise?

797
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,960
that we would go live in the human city together.

798
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,240
We don't have to hide like this.

799
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,840
Being a police officer is my dream.

800
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:30,080
And it is also my family's dream.

801
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,480
What we've been through

802
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,800
our relationship was worthless?

803
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,400
It's not like that, Patrick.

804
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,640
I want you to understand me.

805
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,800
Okay

806
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,360
You want me to understand you.

807
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:56,640
Alright!

808
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,440
I'll understand you

809
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,920
Have fun being a police officer

810
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,080
with your dreams

811
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,880
As for me,

812
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,600
I'm going to follow my dreams as well.

813
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,520
Because I know you well

814
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,280
I don't trust you.

815
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,400
Catch him

816
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,920
Don't catch

817
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,720
We're not on General Lux's side.

818
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,920
We also want to help the vampire city.

819
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,040
Now we've arrested Wichan's servent

820
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:48,040
already at the safe house.

821
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,720
If you don't believe it, you can go look.

822
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,920
We want to get rid of that bastard

823
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,040
and overthrow General Lux as well

824
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,680
I want the vampire city to return to the way it was before

825
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,360
without any crazy rules like this.

826
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,000
That we met last time

827
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,080
You pretend you don't remember me, right?

828
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,160
Do you still dare to ask?

829
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,040
I'm sorry

830
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,720
Sorry about?

831
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,160
So

832
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,560
about the time you left me before

833
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,080
Actually

834
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:40,920
Ohh

835
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:42,920
Let it go

836
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,040
What has passed

837
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,000
let it pass

838
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,120
I don't have the same feelings for you anymore.

839
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,920
And I'm not angry, I don't hate you either.

840
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:53,520
Here,

841
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,200
You're not being sarcastic, are you?

842
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,040
Why are you being sarcastic?

843
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,880
Well, I don't have the same feelings for you anymore.

844
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,600
Maybe you

845
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:07,960
Do you feel the same?

846
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,400
Nickky

847
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,200
Come back and discuss plans with me first.

848
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,320
I'm tried

849
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,520
Don't want to talk.

850
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,800
What are you?

851
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,840
I'm fine

852
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,240
If it wasn't something like this?

853
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,320
Come discuss the plan with me first.

854
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,280
Want to talk to me already?

855
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,360
Don't you want to talk to your old lover, Patrick?

856
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,080
What are you smiling at?

857
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:53,160
So

858
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,600
I'm glad that

859
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,040
you're jealous of me

860
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:58,440
Jealous?

861
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,640
Why would I be jealous of you?

862
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,160
We're nothing.

863
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,240
What is this, Captain?

864
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,160
Don't resist.

865
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,400
Captain

866
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,120
Let me go!

867
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,160
Do you want me to release it?

868
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,400
Let me go now.

869
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,800
Do you like sadistic things?

870
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,680
Who likes sadism?

871
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:37,680
Let me go!

872
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:42,400
Oh

873
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,640
If you don't want to get hurt

874
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,520
don't resist.

875
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:52,520
Get it?

876
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,600
Let me go now.

877
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,480
Ouch! I'm hurt

878
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,560
I didn't resist

879
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,120
I'm surrender

880
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,720
look at my face

881
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,400
What's wrong?

882
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,000
I'm stressed.

883
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:40,000
I don't know when we'll have to face something like this.

884
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:45,600
No matter how many times we encounter something like this again.

885
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,160
We'll get through this together.

886
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:50,800
Or

887
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,400
Do you want to sell this place?

888
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,280
No

889
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:00,320
I don't want to.

890
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,080
I like this place

891
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,040
I like selling Thai desserts.

892
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,560
Then you don't have to stress anymore.

893
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,480
Get it?

894
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,280
Better?

895
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,080
Oh wow

896
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:54,440
Hey

897
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:56,800
Your mouth haven't healed yet.

898
00:45:58,440 --> 00:45:59,360
There!

899
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:03,920
Well, it still hasn't really healed.

900
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,840
So what should I do?

901
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:11,640
Kiss me

902
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:16,440
Why are you so greedy now?

903
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,680
Give me a little kiss.

904
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:46,440
If you found out I was a vampire,

905
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:49,520
would you be angry at me?

906
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:55,560
But don't be mad at me.

907
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:59,320
I don't want to hide it from you.

908
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:12,920
Cute

909
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:24,400
Poom

910
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:29,240
Poom

911
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:45,360
Poom

912
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,480
Aren't you awake?

913
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:05,880
Poom

914
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:10,720
If you don't wake up, I won't stop.

915
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:34,600
So

916
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:37,840
I consider it already requested.

917
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:26,440
Huh!

918
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:28,160
What's wrong with you?

919
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,080
You came alone, right?

920
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:35,640
Umm

921
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:39,840
Sit

922
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:49,720
What's up?

923
00:51:58,040 --> 00:51:59,880
Please stop flirting with Jolie.

924
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:01,720
Believe me

925
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:04,840
What's wrong with you?

926
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:07,360
Do you think you're going to come and ask stubbornly like this?

927
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:09,040
No way

928
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:12,600
It's not like that.

929
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:17,360
It may sound unbelievable.

930
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:19,240
But it's true.

931
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:25,680
Jolie

932
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:27,440
She isn't human.

933
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:32,440
What exactly are you going to say?

934
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:33,840
Are you crazy?

935
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,240
I’m telling you the truth

936
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:39,280
I saw it with my own eyes.

937
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,480
Jolie and her friends

938
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:42,600
aren't human.

939
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:44,520
They're kind of

940
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:48,480
zombies and vampires.

941
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:52,240
If you're going to cut off your competitors?

942
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:53,920
You play with other people.

943
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:55,240
I don't buy it

944
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:57,600
And there's no way I'll ever stop liking Jolie.

945
00:52:58,200 --> 00:52:59,400
Don't trolling

946
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:01,240
Alright

947
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:02,880
It's up to you

948
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:05,400
I think I've come to warn you.

949
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:08,560
I won't flirt with Jolie anymore.

950
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,200
If you want to flirt.

951
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:11,600
Go ahead

952
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:14,960
When will you get your throat bitten and your blood drawn?

953
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:17,600
I'm just warning you.

954
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,440
All the rebels have been captured.

955
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:38,560
Good

956
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,080
Do they really think

957
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:43,880
they can beat me?

958
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:46,160
Other thing

959
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:47,360
Stepfather Wichan

960
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:49,040
has a clue about the insignia.

961
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:51,560
I think it won't be long

962
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:54,160
before we can get the insignia to the general

963
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:00,080
It's considered very good news.

964
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:05,080
3 more days to take all the rebels and put them to death.

965
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,280
Those who want to oppose me will know

966
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:10,760
what the end will be.

967
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:13,560
Yes sir

968
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:39,800
Hey

969
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:41,800
Last night

970
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:43,080
You

971
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,520
Yes

972
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:48,480
I manage everything myself.

973
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,160
You don't have to talk formally

974
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:51,560
Do you rape me?

975
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:54,520
We're boyfriend

976
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:55,080
And one more thing,

977
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:56,920
I already asked you.

978
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:58,480
When I asked you said

979
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:00,280
Ummm

980
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:03,120
Don't bug me

981
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:03,720
Huh

982
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:04,200
Umm what?

983
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:05,320
I don't know anything

984
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:08,400
Stop complaining here.

985
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:09,480
Go take a shower.

986
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:11,520
Let's go to your friend's shop.

987
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:14,040
There's someone who wants to meet you.

988
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:15,720
Go

989
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:20,160
This shop, Jolie.

990
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:21,840
If Jolie wants to exercise.

991
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:22,320
I recommend

992
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:23,920
this clothing store.

993
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:24,640
sports shirt

994
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:25,960
exercise clothes

995
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:27,560
Complete set, Jolie.

996
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:30,080
Most importantly, their clothes are very good.

997
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:31,320
Well

998
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:32,000
Umm

999
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:32,640
Jolie

1000
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:33,640
Jolie

1001
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:37,920
Jolie has come to look at sportswear, right?

1002
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:38,440
Wait

1003
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:40,120
Please come

1004
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:40,840
Okay

1005
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:42,640
Talk like you're the owner of the shop.

1006
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:44,400
Umm

1007
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:45,320
Mai

1008
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:46,160
It turns out that

1009
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:48,480
Chin is the owner of the shop.

1010
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:51,760
Well

1011
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:52,880
Okay

1012
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:53,680
Here

1013
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:56,040
If you don't see that his clothes are really good.

1014
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:57,920
I'll give in one day.

1015
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:59,080
Of course

1016
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:00,920
I only sell quality items.

1017
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:04,000
Hey

1018
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:04,920
The shop owner

1019
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:05,920
recommended it.

1020
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:08,560
So let me introduce to Jolie.

1021
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:09,960
This collection

1022
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:10,600
Here

1023
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:12,120
This is our new collection

1024
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:13,960
Like running

1025
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:15,000
Light weight

1026
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:15,720
Dries quickly

1027
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:17,520
Plus it protects against bacteria.

1028
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:18,320
Here

1029
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:19,120
And that's important things

1030
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:20,680
Seamless

1031
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:21,240
Seamless

1032
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:21,680
Not itchy

1033
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:23,480
It definitely doesn't hurt.

1034
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:24,880
What's more special is that

1035
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:25,920
we skim it

1036
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:27,240
in a reflective way.

1037
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:28,800
When Jolie runs at night,

1038
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:29,480
there is no fear of danger

1039
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:30,720
at all

1040
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:32,600
So

1041
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:33,920
I'll give

1042
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:34,920
I'll give it to you

1043
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:35,800
Go try it out first.

1044
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:36,800
thank you

1045
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:40,480
Heww

1046
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:41,640
So cute

1047
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:42,560
Umm

1048
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:45,240
What?

1049
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:45,800
What?

1050
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:46,840
What?

1051
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:48,760
You see me as a friend, right?

1052
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:51,520
Well, I don't dare tell you.

1053
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:53,520
I'm afraid that you'll be afraid of me

1054
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:55,080
and leave me

1055
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:58,400
Now General Lux

1056
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:00,320
rebels and seizes the vampire city

1057
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:02,080
and captures everyone's parents.

1058
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:03,680
We must hurry and help them.

1059
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:06,960
Stepfather

1060
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,520
someone broke into the house.

1061
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:13,160
I'll give all of you a chance.

1062
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:15,400
Whoever wants to survive,

1063
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:17,040
just move to another side.
