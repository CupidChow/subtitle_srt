4
00:00:13,008 --> 00:00:14,130
This handsome boxer.

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:16,673
The more I dig, the more suspicious he seems.

6
00:00:16,673 --> 00:00:18,935
You’re fake.

7
00:00:19,893 --> 00:00:21,386
The higher power in the shrine.

8
00:00:21,386 --> 00:00:24,615
Please help me win the boxing match.

9
00:00:26,729 --> 00:00:29,298
I think you are targeted by the grandma spirit.

10
00:00:29,298 --> 00:00:30,552
Malai Traditional Dance.

11
00:00:30,552 --> 00:00:32,392
I can perform Thai traditional dance 
across the country.

12
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:36,515
Shit, the curse is back.

13
00:00:36,515 --> 00:00:38,368
But we already arranged 
a dance performance for her.

14
00:00:38,368 --> 00:00:41,833
She’s a con artist.

15
00:01:22,537 --> 00:01:23,390
You are working hard.

16
00:01:25,522 --> 00:01:27,495
You’re going to cancel your contract with me.

17
00:01:27,802 --> 00:01:29,501
But you still continue to practice.

18
00:01:35,112 --> 00:01:36,472
You are still stubborn, Malai.

19
00:01:37,195 --> 00:01:38,594
If you move to another agency,

20
00:01:39,642 --> 00:01:40,954
don’t act like this there.

21
00:01:48,425 --> 00:01:49,015
Hey.

22
00:01:51,002 --> 00:01:51,887
I saw the news.

23
00:02:01,385 --> 00:02:02,434
It’s only two weeks away.

24
00:02:03,644 --> 00:02:07,804
Will you be able to find money 
to pay the contract cancellation fee?

25
00:02:09,556 --> 00:02:11,434
If you can’t find the money,

26
00:02:15,542 --> 00:02:18,105
then you will be stuck with the slave contract.

27
00:03:05,078 --> 00:03:06,325
Calm down, Malai.

28
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,229
Everything will be okay.

29
00:03:08,663 --> 00:03:10,286
Everything will be fine.

30
00:03:18,137 --> 00:03:19,990
Everything will be alright.

31
00:03:20,785 --> 00:03:21,542
Malai!

32
00:03:21,542 --> 00:03:22,205
Holy shit!

33
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,112
There you are.

34
00:03:34,817 --> 00:03:35,889
You, con artist.

35
00:04:36,337 --> 00:04:37,728
- Stop right there.
- Help me.

36
00:04:37,818 --> 00:04:39,655
Con artist, stop right there.
EP2: LOSING IN A BOXING IS BEARABLE, BUT PERFORMING A DANCE IS TOO MUCH.

37
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,516
Stop.

38
00:04:40,679 --> 00:04:41,215
Help me.

39
00:04:41,215 --> 00:04:41,909
Stop running.

40
00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:43,685
- Stop.
- Help me.

41
00:04:43,685 --> 00:04:44,701
Stop, stop.

42
00:04:45,207 --> 00:04:46,304
Did you lose your mind?

43
00:04:46,412 --> 00:04:47,704
Can we talk this out calmly?

44
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:48,903
I have nothing to talk about with you.

45
00:04:48,903 --> 00:04:50,324
You are running away from me like this.

46
00:04:50,324 --> 00:04:52,785
It means you admit that you are a con artist.

47
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,884
Anyone would run from you.

48
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:56,722
You threatened me with the stick.

49
00:04:56,993 --> 00:04:58,663
Yeah, you need to calm down.

50
00:04:59,892 --> 00:05:01,779
You ripped me off.

51
00:05:01,905 --> 00:05:03,042
My hands are stuck open.

52
00:05:03,042 --> 00:05:04,549
They spread out like sculptured hands.

53
00:05:05,832 --> 00:05:06,544
Look.

54
00:05:08,712 --> 00:05:09,398
Wait.

55
00:05:09,669 --> 00:05:10,802
What do you mean?

56
00:05:12,175 --> 00:05:13,737
Why aren’t your hands cured?

57
00:05:14,171 --> 00:05:16,896
I should be the one who asks you that.

58
00:05:16,896 --> 00:05:17,953
It’s getting worse.

59
00:05:18,369 --> 00:05:18,992
Look.

60
00:05:19,299 --> 00:05:20,677
I cannot fold my hands.

61
00:05:21,111 --> 00:05:22,636
This must be a mistake.

62
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,756
Usually, when the dance performance is done, 
the curse is ended.

63
00:05:25,756 --> 00:05:26,793
But it doesn’t end.

64
00:05:26,883 --> 00:05:29,467
This morning, I needed to ask my friend 
to brush my teeth.

65
00:05:29,467 --> 00:05:30,491
Right, Han?

66
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:32,656
Yes.

67
00:05:33,072 --> 00:05:35,106
But now you need to help wipe my blood.

68
00:05:36,768 --> 00:05:38,130
I told you to talk to her nicely.

69
00:05:38,419 --> 00:05:39,533
But you kept swinging the stick.

70
00:05:39,533 --> 00:05:41,612
Do you think you were playing a piñata game?

71
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,050
You too.

72
00:05:43,195 --> 00:05:45,092
Didn’t you say his hands would be back 
to normal after the dance?

73
00:05:45,092 --> 00:05:46,686
Did you do the wrong dance?

74
00:05:46,686 --> 00:05:48,864
Didn’t you update it to the 2025 version?

75
00:05:48,864 --> 00:05:49,364
Yeah.

76
00:05:50,108 --> 00:05:51,435
Did you promise to give her something else?

77
00:05:51,832 --> 00:05:53,501
Maybe you didn’t promise her 
a Thai dance performance.

78
00:05:53,718 --> 00:05:54,514
No way.

79
00:05:54,731 --> 00:05:56,055
I was indeed drunk that night.

80
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:58,574
But I told her I would arrange 
a Thai dance performance for her.

81
00:05:58,719 --> 00:05:59,298
Right?

82
00:05:59,298 --> 00:05:59,878
Yes.

83
00:05:59,878 --> 00:06:02,041
You definitely said you would arrange 
a Thai dance performance.

84
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:02,541
See?

85
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:03,703
Holy crap!

86
00:06:04,913 --> 00:06:05,813
What’s wrong?

87
00:06:08,812 --> 00:06:10,346
I just remember something.

88
00:06:11,575 --> 00:06:12,368
What do you remember?

89
00:06:17,198 --> 00:06:22,198
Please help me win the boxing match.

90
00:06:22,523 --> 00:06:24,004
If you grant my wish,

91
00:06:24,401 --> 00:06:28,647
I will arrange 
a Thai traditional dance performance for you.

92
00:06:29,297 --> 00:06:31,260
Amen.

93
00:06:31,549 --> 00:06:33,945
Your promise is so boring, Rung.

94
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:39,385
Even a Neanderthal could come up 
with something better than the mid-ass gift.

95
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:41,166
You are an influencer.

96
00:06:41,256 --> 00:06:45,377
You can’t promise her 
something so basic like that.

97
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,572
Yeah.

98
00:06:48,204 --> 00:06:48,877
You are right.

99
00:06:49,816 --> 00:06:51,893
Then what should I give her?

100
00:06:53,718 --> 00:06:54,908
I have an idea.

101
00:06:55,342 --> 00:06:58,815
How about this, the higher power?

102
00:06:59,483 --> 00:07:03,120
I won’t hire someone to perform the dance.

103
00:07:04,337 --> 00:07:08,278
I, Klairung, will perform the dance myself.

104
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:11,919
Show me some samples.

105
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:12,692
You want to see it?

106
00:07:12,692 --> 00:07:13,428
Yes.

107
00:07:18,052 --> 00:07:20,563
Show it to the higher power.

108
00:07:21,806 --> 00:07:22,611
Give it more.

109
00:07:22,611 --> 00:07:23,863
Do twerk moves.

110
00:07:23,863 --> 00:07:25,702
The higher power would like it.

111
00:07:26,172 --> 00:07:28,456
Let’s get Lisa to do the dance.

112
00:07:28,601 --> 00:07:31,417
Why don’t you do a backflip?

113
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:38,211
Now you know why your hands aren’t cured.

114
00:07:38,681 --> 00:07:40,228
Damn it, Han.

115
00:07:40,228 --> 00:07:40,989
It’s your fault.

116
00:07:40,989 --> 00:07:41,855
Why did you tell me to say that?

117
00:07:41,963 --> 00:07:43,283
I should be the one who asks you that.

118
00:07:43,482 --> 00:07:46,232
I told you to hire Lisa to do the Thai dance.

119
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:47,754
I didn’t tell you to do it yourself.

120
00:07:50,652 --> 00:07:51,976
What am I going to do?

121
00:07:53,728 --> 00:07:54,381
Hey.

122
00:07:55,447 --> 00:07:57,610
Can you help talk to your grandma?

123
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,355
No.

124
00:07:58,789 --> 00:08:00,496
She’s very strict.

125
00:08:00,785 --> 00:08:02,417
You need to keep your promise.

126
00:08:04,024 --> 00:08:07,539
He’s a boxer, not a Thai traditional dancer.

127
00:08:07,539 --> 00:08:09,101
If you don’t know how to dance, then learn it.

128
00:08:10,762 --> 00:08:11,801
I can teach you.

129
00:08:12,488 --> 00:08:13,220
What?

130
00:08:13,455 --> 00:08:15,165
I already paid you 5,000 baht.

131
00:08:15,165 --> 00:08:15,816
You still want more?

132
00:08:15,816 --> 00:08:18,170
The 5,000 baht is for me to perform the dance.

133
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:19,953
But you need to do the dance yourself.

134
00:08:20,098 --> 00:08:21,239
My class is not that expensive.

135
00:08:21,239 --> 00:08:22,535
It’s only 20,000 baht.

136
00:08:24,143 --> 00:08:26,527
There’s also a consultant fee, 
another 500 baht.

137
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,139
Why are you so greedy?

138
00:08:29,555 --> 00:08:31,303
You are making money from my problems.

139
00:08:31,303 --> 00:08:33,298
Do you think 
you are the only one who has problems?

140
00:08:33,876 --> 00:08:36,135
You have your way to survive.

141
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:38,010
So do I.

142
00:08:38,118 --> 00:08:40,052
How much do you want?

143
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:41,133
Only 50,000 baht.

144
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:51,155
I really need that money in two weeks.

145
00:08:52,402 --> 00:08:54,037
Otherwise, my life will be ruined.

146
00:08:54,705 --> 00:08:56,790
My dream will be gone.

147
00:09:06,242 --> 00:09:09,471
My dream is to be an artist.

148
00:09:10,627 --> 00:09:15,960
The time when I work hard for my dream 
is full of hope and happiness.

149
00:09:18,344 --> 00:09:22,606
Things start to go downhill 
because of my foolishness.

150
00:09:22,606 --> 00:09:24,844
I signed a contract with that company.

151
00:09:27,247 --> 00:09:28,814
I’m so mad every time I think about it.

152
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,034
Because I…

153
00:09:33,431 --> 00:09:34,462
You are big jerks.

154
00:09:34,462 --> 00:09:35,889
You should have listened to me until the end.

155
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:37,548
Hey, where are you going?

156
00:09:37,945 --> 00:09:39,133
Why don’t we go back and listen to her?

157
00:09:39,133 --> 00:09:40,329
I’m starting to be moved by her story.

158
00:09:41,395 --> 00:09:43,191
I can tell you the end of her story.

159
00:09:43,607 --> 00:09:45,763
In the end, she’s doing this for money.

160
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:46,839
No need to empathize with her.

161
00:09:47,236 --> 00:09:48,665
I’m not empathizing with her.

162
00:09:48,665 --> 00:09:49,437
I’m just curious about it.

163
00:09:51,009 --> 00:09:52,929
She tries to manipulate us 
by using her sad past.

164
00:09:53,507 --> 00:09:54,329
But actually,

165
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,857
she’s making money 
from her grandma’s power.

166
00:09:58,342 --> 00:09:59,764
What are you going to do?

167
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,109
Are you going to let your hands 
spread out like this?

168
00:10:09,264 --> 00:10:10,334
This is the 21st century.

169
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:11,963
I’ll figure something out.

170
00:10:12,432 --> 00:10:15,413
I will not surrender to Titan Grandma.

171
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:17,734
I will defeat her.

172
00:10:20,516 --> 00:10:21,257
Damn it.

173
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:23,019
Shit.

174
00:10:23,019 --> 00:10:24,212
It can be cured.

175
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:26,053
You can cure it?
