1
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:09,855
Is it heavy?

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,493
No.

3
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:17,666
I’m talking about the tiara.

4
00:00:18,329 --> 00:00:19,029
Oh.

5
00:00:21,904 --> 00:00:22,811
A little.

6
00:00:29,443 --> 00:00:32,593
I think I’d better dine out.

7
00:00:32,593 --> 00:00:34,258
No, Dad. You can eat here.

8
00:00:42,217 --> 00:00:43,654
How would I know…

9
00:00:44,064 --> 00:00:47,163
you brought a friend 
to have boxing training at our home?

10
00:00:48,158 --> 00:00:52,102
So your coach is a beautiful girl.

11
00:00:53,604 --> 00:00:56,834
I thought you had a girlfriend 
and didn’t tell me.

12
00:00:57,205 --> 00:00:58,224
Are you crazy?

13
00:00:58,751 --> 00:01:00,126
When do I have time to date?

14
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:01,029
Sit down.

15
00:01:01,029 --> 00:01:01,595
Come on.

16
00:01:02,044 --> 00:01:03,724
Malai, dig in.

17
00:01:04,036 --> 00:01:05,111
Yes, Uncle Wan.

18
00:01:05,111 --> 00:01:06,609
You can go ahead and enjoy the meal.

19
00:01:06,707 --> 00:01:08,710
I’ll go pay respect first.

20
00:01:14,152 --> 00:01:15,541
Was your grandfather a boxer?

21
00:01:18,253 --> 00:01:19,750
He’s not my grandfather.

22
00:01:20,628 --> 00:01:23,816
He’s my dad’s idol.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,713
He’s a boxer.

24
00:01:24,947 --> 00:01:25,646
Is that so?

25
00:01:26,348 --> 00:01:28,285
Is he that good?

26
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,973
Yes.

27
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:37,167
Baby Shark is the boxing prodigy of this era.

28
00:01:37,752 --> 00:01:38,774
His left punch is lethal.

29
00:01:38,872 --> 00:01:40,427
His right punch is deadly.

30
00:01:40,661 --> 00:01:44,623
All his opponents crawl out of the ring.

31
00:01:47,881 --> 00:01:51,539
Rung fought with him in a junior tournament.

32
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:55,309
How did you survive the match?

33
00:02:00,986 --> 00:02:02,608
That’s how boxing is.

34
00:02:02,608 --> 00:02:03,965
You win some, you lose some.

35
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:08,253
Rung did his best.

36
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:16,702
You beat him in the first round.

37
00:02:16,702 --> 00:02:18,192
Your opponent is not in the same league 
as you.

38
00:02:18,192 --> 00:02:20,221
Will any boxers dare to fight with you?

39
00:02:20,904 --> 00:02:22,083
You are overstating.

40
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:26,377
Of course, there will be other boxers 
who want to try me.

41
00:02:26,377 --> 00:02:27,834
I’ll give them a chance.

42
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:42,115
It’s okay.

43
00:02:42,778 --> 00:02:44,135
You just need to practice a bit more.

44
00:02:47,315 --> 00:02:48,262
Practice?

45
00:02:48,847 --> 00:02:50,060
Dad, it’s me, Klairung.

46
00:02:50,294 --> 00:02:51,840
I’ll come back to the ring in no time.

47
00:03:10,283 --> 00:03:12,686
I was really worried.

48
00:03:13,778 --> 00:03:17,290
I was worried that he would be 
too disappointed to fight in the ring again.

49
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:21,748
When I heard that he would compete 
in the Jamaree-Thammchak boxing match,

50
00:03:21,885 --> 00:03:23,493
I was so happy.

51
00:03:24,507 --> 00:03:27,725
He finally decided to face his fear.

52
00:03:29,383 --> 00:03:33,947
Malai, please take care of him.

53
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:36,007
Yes.

54
00:03:39,323 --> 00:03:40,127
I’m not hungry.

55
00:03:46,545 --> 00:03:48,087
Dig in.

56
00:03:48,087 --> 00:03:48,653
Yes.

57
00:04:02,069 --> 00:04:02,733
Damn it.

58
00:04:04,099 --> 00:04:05,366
Calm down, Klairung.

59
00:04:05,503 --> 00:04:06,285
You can do it.

60
00:04:06,285 --> 00:04:08,433
You can do it, Klairung.

61
00:04:28,974 --> 00:04:30,598
What are you practicing?

62
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,708
Boxing or Thai dance?

63
00:04:37,317 --> 00:04:38,025
Here.

64
00:04:38,942 --> 00:04:40,260
Did you take it from the altar?

65
00:04:40,865 --> 00:04:41,880
Are you crazy?

66
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:44,191
I brought it from my grandma’s shrine.

67
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,453
That’s not better.

68
00:04:54,432 --> 00:04:54,988
Here.

69
00:04:56,354 --> 00:04:57,090
Your hands.

70
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:00,644
Will I get to drink it today?

71
00:05:00,742 --> 00:05:02,070
Wait a moment.

72
00:05:03,241 --> 00:05:03,741
Here.

73
00:05:04,755 --> 00:05:05,404
Thank you.

74
00:05:14,327 --> 00:05:15,101
Give it to me.

75
00:05:15,101 --> 00:05:15,833
I’ll do it.

76
00:05:30,164 --> 00:05:31,920
Are you worried about the boxing match?

77
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:35,949
Yes, a little.

78
00:05:36,885 --> 00:05:39,495
But I’m more worried about your grandma 
rushing me to do the dance performance.

79
00:05:39,749 --> 00:05:41,920
She visits me in my dream every night.

80
00:05:42,096 --> 00:05:43,154
We are now becoming friends.

81
00:05:44,967 --> 00:05:47,616
You talk to her more than me, 
her granddaughter.

82
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:53,077
I’ve never seen her or dreamed of her.

83
00:05:56,354 --> 00:05:59,190
She visited everyone except me.

84
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:08,741
We will go our separate ways soon.

85
00:06:08,741 --> 00:06:12,109
Your grandma is so picky.

86
00:06:13,572 --> 00:06:14,459
I know.

87
00:06:21,169 --> 00:06:27,350
After cancelling your contract with the agency, 
what will you do next?

88
00:06:35,631 --> 00:06:38,426
I have an audition with a Korean agency 
in two weeks.

89
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:41,291
But I still have a contract 
with my current agency.

90
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,738
If I cannot cancel the contract,

91
00:06:44,284 --> 00:06:45,414
I will be eliminated from the audition.

92
00:06:47,131 --> 00:06:51,194
So you need to get the money 
before the audition date.

93
00:06:52,794 --> 00:06:56,601
Your current agency is so greedy.

94
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:59,050
The cancellation fee is so expensive.

95
00:07:00,123 --> 00:07:01,559
They are bloodsuckers.

96
00:07:02,651 --> 00:07:03,833
The truth is…

97
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,606
the cancellation fee is only 30,000 baht.

98
00:07:08,167 --> 00:07:09,180
What about the other 20,000 baht?

99
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:15,014
I’ll tell you,

100
00:07:16,262 --> 00:07:17,445
but don’t criticize me.

101
00:07:18,498 --> 00:07:21,716
Biao, the owner of the company, 
is a greedy man.

102
00:07:21,716 --> 00:07:23,525
He always takes advantage of me.

103
00:07:23,701 --> 00:07:25,836
I lost my temper and kicked him.

104
00:07:27,377 --> 00:07:31,216
I now have to pay him 
another 20,000 baht as compensation.

105
00:07:32,094 --> 00:07:33,872
I think you did it on purpose.

106
00:07:34,164 --> 00:07:36,763
You are quite tough.

107
00:07:36,997 --> 00:07:38,034
It’s not funny.

108
00:07:38,678 --> 00:07:41,354
I was so furious at that time.

109
00:07:43,188 --> 00:07:44,233
I get it, I guess.

110
00:07:45,267 --> 00:07:46,860
I think you did the right thing.

111
00:07:48,538 --> 00:07:49,846
It’s good that you didn’t give in to him.

112
00:07:50,217 --> 00:07:50,890
Well done.

113
00:08:00,569 --> 00:08:01,283
What about you?

114
00:08:02,044 --> 00:08:03,021
What are you going to do next?

115
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:17,026
If my hands are cured,

116
00:08:18,313 --> 00:08:20,907
I will probably go back to being an influencer.

117
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:25,021
To tell you the truth, 
when I started to practice boxing again,

118
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,893
I got my fire back.

119
00:08:28,517 --> 00:08:31,441
I want to give myself another chance.

120
00:08:32,241 --> 00:08:39,693
I want to fight in the ring one last time 
to see if I still want to do it.

121
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:44,331
Let’s make a pact.

122
00:08:44,721 --> 00:08:47,849
When we can solve our problems, 
I’ll work hard to pass the audition.

123
00:08:48,512 --> 00:08:50,061
You will do your best to win the match.

124
00:08:50,217 --> 00:08:50,952
Okay?

125
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:56,582
Winning the match?

126
00:08:57,362 --> 00:08:58,706
I can’t promise it.

127
00:09:00,228 --> 00:09:03,088
If my opponent is someone 
who is older than me

128
00:09:03,478 --> 00:09:05,587
or those who have more experience, 
like Baby Shark,

129
00:09:05,802 --> 00:09:08,601
I don’t think I can do it.

130
00:09:12,658 --> 00:09:14,058
How about this?

131
00:09:15,697 --> 00:09:17,396
Can you promise you will fight in the match?

132
00:09:17,863 --> 00:09:18,523
Okay?

133
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:23,851
Deal.

134
00:09:27,578 --> 00:09:29,031
We are screwed, Rung.

135
00:09:29,285 --> 00:09:30,424
We are so screwed.

136
00:09:30,892 --> 00:09:33,991
Thammachak announced its athlete.

137
00:09:34,654 --> 00:09:35,331
So what?

138
00:09:35,565 --> 00:09:36,065
Look.

139
00:09:39,284 --> 00:09:45,752
We are happy to have a talented boxer 
like Baby Shark to represent our university.

140
00:09:46,025 --> 00:09:48,041
Baby Shark, aren’t you too old for this?

141
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:50,391
I still have one class that I haven’t passed.

142
00:09:50,391 --> 00:09:51,852
I keep failing the class.

143
00:09:52,203 --> 00:09:54,138
The professor said he will help me 
if I say yes to…

144
00:09:54,138 --> 00:09:57,488
♪ Say yes to heaven, say yes to me ♪

145
00:09:57,488 --> 00:09:59,637
I think we should wrap it up.

146
00:09:59,637 --> 00:10:04,414
Baby Shark, do you have anything to say 
to Jamaree, your opponent?

147
00:10:04,785 --> 00:10:07,430
I hope my opponent will do his best.

148
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:09,416
I’ll do my best, too.

149
00:10:09,553 --> 00:10:10,336
I will not go easy on you.

150
00:10:13,059 --> 00:10:14,034
Can you…

151
00:10:14,229 --> 00:10:15,435
do it?

152
00:10:23,508 --> 00:10:24,322
I can do it.

153
00:10:27,697 --> 00:10:28,449
I guess.

154
00:10:33,164 --> 00:10:35,866
He’s just a boxer you have a rematch with.

155
00:10:37,777 --> 00:10:39,754
It may not be a bad thing.

156
00:10:39,852 --> 00:10:42,490
Welcome back to hell, Klairung.

157
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,503
I know you are stressed out about Baby Shark.

158
00:10:47,503 --> 00:10:49,032
But you need to hang in there.

159
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,172
Can you do it?

160
00:10:52,504 --> 00:10:53,088
Yes.

161
00:10:56,151 --> 00:10:57,851
I’ll work hard to practice boxing.

162
00:10:58,105 --> 00:11:00,281
I’ll show you that I can defeat Baby Shark.

163
00:11:00,379 --> 00:11:01,040
Just wait and see.
