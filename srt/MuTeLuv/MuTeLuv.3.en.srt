1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,725
The person you need to make fall for you

2
00:00:01,725 --> 00:00:02,428
is Mawin?

3
00:00:03,289 --> 00:00:04,905
Right? I'm not sure either.

4
00:00:06,027 --> 00:00:06,702
Let's eat together.

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,596
Didn't you try to start a convo with me
earlier today?

6
00:00:08,596 --> 00:00:09,125
So talk to me.

7
00:00:09,742 --> 00:00:11,477
I'll let you guess what I was listening to.

8
00:00:13,572 --> 00:00:14,364
You are listening to the radio?

9
00:00:16,459 --> 00:00:18,160
But you are the first who solve it.

10
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,146
Why didn't you raise your hand to answer?

11
00:00:19,146 --> 00:00:21,179
I didn't feel confident in my answer.

12
00:00:21,179 --> 00:00:23,109
You believe in everyone, but yourself.

13
00:00:23,109 --> 00:00:24,108
Go and solve it.

14
00:01:24,517 --> 00:01:25,835
(If we didn't need to study.)

15
00:01:28,978 --> 00:01:30,276
(What would we be doing?)

16
00:01:33,157 --> 00:01:35,055
(If we weren't competing against each other.)

17
00:01:36,514 --> 00:01:38,664
(If we were just living our own lives.)

18
00:01:41,788 --> 00:01:43,284
(Would we wake up this early?)

19
00:01:43,845 --> 00:01:45,420
(How long would we be competing with others?)

20
00:01:46,337 --> 00:01:48,283
(Do we need to study for the rest of my life?)

21
00:01:51,632 --> 00:01:53,858
[How are you doing?]

22
00:01:54,195 --> 00:01:56,158
[Will we get to celebrate?]

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,376
[I'm not trying to pressure you.]

24
00:01:58,638 --> 00:02:01,423
[I just ask in case we need to book a caterer.]

25
00:02:01,423 --> 00:02:03,485
[So I'll contact them in advance.]

26
00:02:05,056 --> 00:02:07,832
I found him. He's zoning out here.

27
00:02:08,543 --> 00:02:10,803
Err, why didn't you answer my messages?

28
00:02:11,233 --> 00:02:12,404
I didn't answer my mom's messages either.

29
00:02:14,219 --> 00:02:15,492
All I do is solve math questions all day.

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,211
I'm tired of it, Benz.

31
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:22,122
My ranking has been unchanged for days.

32
00:02:22,122 --> 00:02:22,622
Hold on.

33
00:02:23,782 --> 00:02:26,117
Did you follow the fortune teller's advice?

34
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,579
I'm not joking, Err.

35
00:02:28,747 --> 00:02:30,555
If you really want this scholarship,

36
00:02:30,555 --> 00:02:32,536
you need to make him fall for you.

37
00:02:32,536 --> 00:02:33,788
It's easier said than done.

38
00:02:34,181 --> 00:02:36,201
We only spend a few days together.
How can I make him fall for me?

39
00:02:36,201 --> 00:02:37,959
It happens all the time in dramas.

40
00:02:39,194 --> 00:02:41,157
Guys, it's time for the morning assembly.

41
00:02:41,456 --> 00:02:42,683
Don't forget it, Err.

42
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,303
You need to make him fall for you.

43
00:02:44,453 --> 00:02:45,443
I've got to go. Bye.

44
00:02:47,407 --> 00:02:48,772
How can I make him like me?

45
00:02:49,371 --> 00:02:52,480
A guy like him doesn't seem to like anyone
but himself.

46
00:02:55,136 --> 00:02:56,767
Last night, I made a predicted paper
for the final exam.

47
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:57,991
You should try it.

48
00:03:07,323 --> 00:03:10,515
I think you are the first person he likes
besides himself.

49
00:03:25,285 --> 00:03:27,990
Can't they turn down the AC?

50
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:30,269
It's too cold.

51
00:03:34,572 --> 00:03:35,303
Damn.

52
00:03:35,733 --> 00:03:38,057
Who came up with such a cheesy question?

53
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:39,236
It's so funny.

54
00:03:39,498 --> 00:03:40,770
Hi.

55
00:03:53,712 --> 00:03:54,468
Why are you grinning?

56
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:56,175
That's your question.

57
00:04:02,236 --> 00:04:03,651
Why did you give me your predicted paper?

58
00:04:04,175 --> 00:04:05,673
We are rivals.

59
00:04:05,972 --> 00:04:07,442
Aren't you afraid that I will outrank you?

60
00:04:09,032 --> 00:04:10,030
I have no particular reason.

61
00:04:10,142 --> 00:04:11,669
If I like someone, I want to do it for them.

62
00:04:15,915 --> 00:04:16,988
Hurry and get better.

63
00:04:17,362 --> 00:04:18,670
I can't wait for you to outrank me.

64
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:24,860
How is it, everyone?

65
00:04:25,608 --> 00:04:27,693
Can you do the exercise I gave you?

66
00:04:31,022 --> 00:04:32,006
Is it hard?

67
00:04:33,578 --> 00:04:35,207
I don't think it's that hard.

68
00:04:35,207 --> 00:04:36,415
I know you can do it.

69
00:04:45,949 --> 00:04:50,060
But this question might be hard for you

70
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,156
to score full marks on.

71
00:04:53,409 --> 00:04:55,079
Does anyone want to try to solve it?

72
00:04:55,996 --> 00:04:59,247
Kaenpanya, you should give your friend
a chance to do it.

73
00:04:59,584 --> 00:05:00,771
I want a new face.

74
00:05:00,977 --> 00:05:01,887
Anyone?

75
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,253
Baromavidya, come up here.

76
00:05:05,683 --> 00:05:07,629
Come on.

77
00:05:08,021 --> 00:05:08,593
Come here.

78
00:05:08,593 --> 00:05:10,580
Give him a round of applause.

79
00:05:10,954 --> 00:05:13,094
Come here.

80
00:05:14,198 --> 00:05:16,039
He raises his hand with confidence.

81
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:18,265
I'm sure he will do well.

82
00:05:20,656 --> 00:05:23,253
Go for it. Do your best.

83
00:05:29,052 --> 00:05:32,027
(You believe in everyone, but yourself.)

84
00:05:32,551 --> 00:05:33,787
(Try to have some faith in yourself.)

85
00:05:33,937 --> 00:05:37,392
(If you get it wrong, just do it again.)

86
00:05:37,392 --> 00:05:38,831
(If I like someone, I want to do it for them.)

87
00:05:38,831 --> 00:05:39,513
(Go and solve it.)

88
00:05:39,513 --> 00:05:40,312
(I can't wait for you to outrank me.)

89
00:05:40,611 --> 00:05:41,873
(There's only me in this room.)

90
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,302
(Hurry and get better.)

91
00:05:43,302 --> 00:05:46,493
- (It's not a big deal if you get it wrong.)
- (You believe in everyone, but yourself.)

92
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,516
(Try to have some faith in yourself.)

93
00:05:48,946 --> 00:05:51,717
- (If I like someone, I want to do it for them.)
- (If you get it wrong, just do it again.)

94
00:05:52,148 --> 00:05:53,088
(Hurry and get better.)

95
00:05:53,088 --> 00:05:53,953
(Go and solve it.)

96
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,239
(I have no particular reason.)

97
00:05:55,239 --> 00:05:56,339
(There's only me in this room.)

98
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:57,963
(If I like someone, I want to do it for them.)

99
00:05:58,187 --> 00:05:59,373
(Try to have some faith in yourself.)

100
00:06:01,767 --> 00:06:04,560
Wow!

101
00:06:06,805 --> 00:06:07,930
Concise.

102
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,575
Complete.

103
00:06:10,454 --> 00:06:11,187
Perfect.

104
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:15,319
I'll give you a full score.

105
00:06:16,385 --> 00:06:17,401
Give him a round of applause.

106
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:21,550
Good job.

107
00:06:21,831 --> 00:06:25,064
I noticed you barely answer questions in class.

108
00:06:25,307 --> 00:06:27,112
You are getting better.

109
00:06:27,112 --> 00:06:28,835
What is your name?

110
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,753
I'm Err.

111
00:06:30,753 --> 00:06:31,428
Err?

112
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:34,367
Give Err a round of applause.

113
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:36,178
Err, well done.

114
00:06:36,702 --> 00:06:38,209
Good job.

115
00:06:38,471 --> 00:06:40,248
Go back to your seat.

116
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:45,754
Good job.

117
00:06:46,876 --> 00:06:49,699
You've made your name.

118
00:06:51,389 --> 00:06:52,274
Nothing.

119
00:06:53,228 --> 00:06:53,994
I'm just happy.

120
00:06:53,994 --> 00:06:55,016
Happy.

121
00:06:55,502 --> 00:06:57,151
NO.5 ANANTACHAI KRAIKAEW

122
00:06:57,282 --> 00:06:59,749
Er, you're quite hungry for praise.

123
00:07:00,385 --> 00:07:02,183
You got praised by the teacher once.

124
00:07:02,183 --> 00:07:03,529
Now, you skip lunch to do the exercise instead.

125
00:07:04,053 --> 00:07:05,222
I ate a lot at breakfast.

126
00:07:05,222 --> 00:07:06,125
I don't feel hungry yet.

127
00:07:07,284 --> 00:07:09,334
Fine. I'm going to have lunch. I'm hungry.

128
00:07:20,864 --> 00:07:21,769
Aren't you hungry?

129
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:30,528
Both boxes are mine.

130
00:07:36,455 --> 00:07:37,139
Take it.

131
00:07:37,682 --> 00:07:38,721
I brought one for you.

132
00:07:44,558 --> 00:07:45,532
Why don't you go have lunch?

133
00:07:45,831 --> 00:07:47,158
Are the snack boxes enough for your appetite?

134
00:07:48,224 --> 00:07:49,712
I brought them in case you feel hungry.

135
00:07:58,104 --> 00:07:58,868
What else do you want?

136
00:07:59,972 --> 00:08:01,391
I already gave you a snack box.

137
00:08:07,976 --> 00:08:10,727
You can take this one, too.

138
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:45,717
Hey.

139
00:08:46,578 --> 00:08:47,527
Do you want to play with us?

140
00:08:50,408 --> 00:08:51,172
What?

141
00:08:51,378 --> 00:08:52,040
Come on.

142
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,991
Pornthep plays basketball every evening.

143
00:08:57,122 --> 00:08:57,893
Yes.

144
00:08:57,893 --> 00:08:58,483
Hey.

145
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:01,630
You have a plant, Mawin?

146
00:09:02,191 --> 00:09:03,102
It's Err's.

147
00:09:03,775 --> 00:09:05,190
Err is doing well.

148
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:06,320
His ranking is moving up every day.

149
00:09:07,106 --> 00:09:07,780
Do you want to eat it?

150
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:08,787
It might help you do well like Err.

151
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,099
Eating sashimi?

152
00:09:10,623 --> 00:09:11,562
Sashimi.

153
00:09:11,749 --> 00:09:12,249
Yes.

154
00:09:12,249 --> 00:09:13,086
It's pretty much the same.

155
00:09:21,526 --> 00:09:23,230
I started to feel hungry again
after solving your question.

156
00:09:23,473 --> 00:09:24,795
It's harder than our teachers' exercises.

157
00:09:27,451 --> 00:09:30,227
Having a plant on your desk,
does it really help?

158
00:09:32,303 --> 00:09:34,011
Plants have good energy.

159
00:09:34,965 --> 00:09:37,467
My older brother got this scholarship
because he got good energy from plants.

160
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,014
You want this scholarship
because of your brother?

161
00:09:41,586 --> 00:09:42,538
Not really.

162
00:09:42,819 --> 00:09:44,224
My family likes competitions.

163
00:09:44,411 --> 00:09:46,066
My mom was a beauty pageant contestant.

164
00:09:46,141 --> 00:09:48,850
My dad was a professor
who competed for research funds.

165
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,998
I guess my brother and I got that
from our parents.

166
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,256
My brother once won an eating competition
on Children's Day.

167
00:09:57,586 --> 00:09:59,459
That's why you want to win this scholarship?

168
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,977
That was my reason at first.

169
00:10:02,856 --> 00:10:03,752
But now,

170
00:10:04,444 --> 00:10:05,556
I'm not sure.

171
00:10:10,102 --> 00:10:12,801
To be honest, it's fun to be in this camp.

172
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:17,712
What about you?

173
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:20,190
Did you have fun spending time together?

174
00:10:24,446 --> 00:10:25,158
Yes.

175
00:10:25,794 --> 00:10:26,966
I like being with you.

176
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:50,200
What are you doing?

177
00:10:51,265 --> 00:10:52,598
Do you see my earphones?

178
00:10:55,228 --> 00:10:56,846
Can't you find them tomorrow morning?

179
00:10:57,263 --> 00:10:57,878
No.

180
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:10,722
I didn't see you use them since we got back.

181
00:11:11,745 --> 00:11:13,040
Did you leave them in the classroom?

182
00:11:19,999 --> 00:11:21,751
Why is a smart guy like you afraid of ghosts?

183
00:11:21,751 --> 00:11:23,661
Why do you need me
to come down with you every time?

184
00:11:24,788 --> 00:11:27,001
Ghosts don't check our grades
before they haunt us.

185
00:11:27,815 --> 00:11:28,536
Huh?

186
00:11:29,141 --> 00:11:31,549
But you listen to the ghost story show
every night.

187
00:11:33,114 --> 00:11:34,880
So I can learn how the ghosts haunt people.

188
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:37,141
Really?

189
00:11:39,979 --> 00:11:41,019
Why are you grinning?

190
00:11:43,106 --> 00:11:44,210
You don't act like yourself.

191
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,739
Anyone would find it funny
if they saw you act like this.

192
00:11:49,245 --> 00:11:50,478
How do I usually act?

193
00:11:55,768 --> 00:11:56,829
I'm Mawin.

194
00:11:57,309 --> 00:12:00,278
I've gotten straight A's,

195
00:12:00,382 --> 00:12:01,518
in every semester,

196
00:12:01,685 --> 00:12:02,586
every year.

197
00:12:07,866 --> 00:12:09,539
Hey, can I ask you for real?

198
00:12:09,852 --> 00:12:10,767
The morning will arrive in a few hours.

199
00:12:10,767 --> 00:12:11,922
Why do you need to find the earphones now?

200
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,046
It'll be several hours before dawn.
I can't sleep without them.

201
00:12:15,778 --> 00:12:17,245
You can borrow mine.

202
00:12:19,374 --> 00:12:20,726
I have to use my earphones.

203
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:22,665
You are quite choosy.

204
00:12:24,481 --> 00:12:25,523
I'm addicted to them.

205
00:12:25,523 --> 00:12:26,384
What do you want me to do?

206
00:12:29,473 --> 00:12:30,863
You should take off the earphones

207
00:12:31,322 --> 00:12:33,018
and talk to people.

208
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:35,457
Who can I talk to?

209
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:37,250
I get used to being alone.

210
00:12:37,709 --> 00:12:39,032
You have me.

211
00:12:39,512 --> 00:12:40,317
What song do you want to listen to?

212
00:12:40,317 --> 00:12:40,972
I'll sing it.

213
00:12:43,769 --> 00:12:47,289
♪ You're just too good to be true ♪

214
00:12:47,978 --> 00:12:51,133
♪ Can't take my eyes off of you ♪

215
00:12:51,446 --> 00:12:53,807
Are you making fun
of both me and Mr. Chuchuen?

216
00:12:54,162 --> 00:12:56,186
No, I'm just singing.

217
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:57,896
I try to help you end your addiction to earphones.

218
00:12:58,599 --> 00:13:00,281
Tell me what song you want to hear.

219
00:13:03,746 --> 00:13:06,640
♪ I love you, baby ♪

220
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,758
♪ And if it's quite alright, I need you ♪

221
00:13:12,012 --> 00:13:14,090
I didn't want to have a secret meeting like this.

222
00:13:15,175 --> 00:13:16,746
But we only have a few days
before the final exam.

223
00:13:17,602 --> 00:13:19,710
Don't you feel anything?

224
00:13:20,837 --> 00:13:21,781
Feel what?

225
00:13:24,432 --> 00:13:25,989
Since we arrived at this camp,

226
00:13:26,636 --> 00:13:29,374
Mawin has been dominating the ranking.

227
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,863
I'm asking you for real.

228
00:13:31,823 --> 00:13:33,256
What have we been doing?

229
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:41,479
I used to like singing karaoke with my mom.

230
00:13:41,479 --> 00:13:43,319
I sang every day.

231
00:13:43,528 --> 00:13:47,577
Later, I learned that I also like studying.

232
00:13:49,497 --> 00:13:50,528
It's 2 am.

233
00:13:50,632 --> 00:13:51,878
Why is someone still in the classroom?

234
00:13:54,069 --> 00:13:55,319
Mawin is a genius.

235
00:13:55,966 --> 00:13:58,299
He deserves to win this scholarship.

236
00:13:58,599 --> 00:13:59,846
I'm not saying that Mawin is wrong.

237
00:14:00,389 --> 00:14:02,119
I know he's a genius.

238
00:14:02,119 --> 00:14:05,265
I'm just talking about our feelings that…

239
00:14:05,265 --> 00:14:08,492
It feels like our efforts go to waste.

240
00:14:09,869 --> 00:14:13,168
Because none of us will win this scholarship.

241
00:14:16,599 --> 00:14:17,390
Hold on.

242
00:14:17,808 --> 00:14:18,910
You are making a big deal out of it.

243
00:14:19,453 --> 00:14:20,519
Our efforts don't go to waste.

244
00:14:21,354 --> 00:14:21,998
Huh?

245
00:14:22,415 --> 00:14:23,837
When you study, you gain knowledge.

246
00:14:24,401 --> 00:14:27,095
It's normal
to have winners and losers in competitions.

247
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:28,950
Can you enjoy it
like when you watch sports games?

248
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:30,121
How can I enjoy it?

249
00:14:30,434 --> 00:14:33,047
I've been preparing for this scholarship for years.

250
00:14:33,047 --> 00:14:35,754
So you are the only one
who deserves to get it?

251
00:14:35,754 --> 00:14:37,344
That's not what I mean.

252
00:14:37,532 --> 00:14:39,346
I just want to say that this is not fun.

253
00:14:40,473 --> 00:14:42,902
I think we all need to calm down.

254
00:14:43,319 --> 00:14:46,808
I understand both Mhee and Mangpor.

255
00:14:48,499 --> 00:14:51,757
It doesn't seem like Mawin put effort into it.

256
00:14:52,133 --> 00:14:53,948
But he can easily win it.

257
00:14:54,741 --> 00:14:56,546
Is that what you are trying to say, Mangpor?

258
00:14:56,859 --> 00:15:01,161
It's not right to say
that he doesn't put any effort into it.

259
00:15:01,599 --> 00:15:03,574
We all have our own way of studying.

260
00:15:03,574 --> 00:15:05,822
I no longer care what his way of studying is.

261
00:15:07,533 --> 00:15:09,199
I'm here to win.

262
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:11,371
Did you come here to lose?

263
00:15:11,371 --> 00:15:12,247
Miss Mangpor.

264
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:12,955
Ton.

265
00:15:14,353 --> 00:15:16,145
You should have known me the best.

266
00:15:17,836 --> 00:15:21,378
You know how long I've been preparing
for this scholarship.

267
00:15:21,566 --> 00:15:23,012
What are you going to do, Mangpor?

268
00:15:23,325 --> 00:15:24,777
We only have a few days before the exam.

269
00:15:24,777 --> 00:15:26,267
That's why I called for this meeting.

270
00:15:27,498 --> 00:15:28,441
I asked Err to spy on him.

271
00:15:28,441 --> 00:15:29,604
But Err didn't find anything useful.

272
00:15:30,251 --> 00:15:31,962
Mawin is Err's friend.

273
00:15:31,962 --> 00:15:32,799
He wouldn't do that.

274
00:15:32,882 --> 00:15:35,227
But aren't we all friends?

275
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:38,900
I think we shouldn't talk behind his back.

276
00:15:39,777 --> 00:15:41,255
Mawin is not my friend.

277
00:15:41,464 --> 00:15:42,569
He's my rival.

278
00:15:43,174 --> 00:15:44,417
Are you going to say it's not true?

279
00:16:10,278 --> 00:16:10,918
Move, please.

280
00:16:20,456 --> 00:16:21,361
What are you doing here?

281
00:16:23,406 --> 00:16:24,458
I should be the one asking you that.

282
00:16:27,046 --> 00:16:28,097
How could you…

283
00:16:29,516 --> 00:16:30,576
How could you do this?

284
00:16:31,286 --> 00:16:32,890
It's just a university scholarship.

285
00:16:33,808 --> 00:16:35,580
How can you go this low just to get it?

286
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,305
You need to get this straight, Mangpor.

287
00:16:48,515 --> 00:16:50,397
I never agreed to spy on him for you.

288
00:17:47,005 --> 00:17:48,465
You are not alone, Mawin.

289
00:17:57,774 --> 00:18:00,291
SEER, HOW CAN I FIX THIS?

290
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:03,346
I DON'T WANT TO SEE HIM FEEL BAD LIKE THIS.

291
00:18:09,044 --> 00:18:10,356
(It's just like other days.)

292
00:18:10,836 --> 00:18:13,806
(I wake up and
go out to compete with other horses.)

293
00:18:16,811 --> 00:18:19,177
(There's no time for an injured horse to rest.)

294
00:18:29,864 --> 00:18:31,503
Hey, how is he doing?

295
00:18:31,837 --> 00:18:32,743
Have you talked to him?

296
00:18:32,931 --> 00:18:33,871
No.

297
00:18:33,954 --> 00:18:35,366
When I went back to the room,
he had already fallen asleep.

298
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:39,245
What about this morning?

299
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:41,865
Did you have breakfast with him?

300
00:18:42,157 --> 00:18:43,469
He had already left the room when I woke up.

301
00:18:47,309 --> 00:18:48,414
Where the hell is he?

302
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:54,107
I didn't see him in the dining room.

303
00:18:55,693 --> 00:18:56,923
I was the last one leaving the room.

304
00:18:59,957 --> 00:19:00,570
Where is he?

305
00:19:01,134 --> 00:19:01,916
I'll go find him.

306
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:03,283
Where are you going?

307
00:19:03,659 --> 00:19:04,403
The class is about to start.

308
00:19:04,403 --> 00:19:04,903
Go to your seat.

309
00:19:13,127 --> 00:19:14,328
You can't miss this class.

310
00:19:15,163 --> 00:19:16,543
Your point will be deducted, Err.

311
00:19:19,584 --> 00:19:20,421
Where the hell is he?

312
00:19:26,724 --> 00:19:27,673
It's time for lunch break.

313
00:19:27,986 --> 00:19:28,799
Thank you.

314
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:29,518
See you.

315
00:19:29,518 --> 00:19:30,232
Go have your lunch.

316
00:19:30,232 --> 00:19:30,918
Err.

317
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:34,282
Why didn't Mawin attend the class?

318
00:19:35,555 --> 00:19:37,168
Was he very mad at us last night?

319
00:19:38,107 --> 00:19:41,441
Does he know that his point will be deducted
if he misses a class?

320
00:19:42,213 --> 00:19:42,882
I don't know.

321
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:44,946
I'm going to go look for him.

322
00:19:45,593 --> 00:19:46,597
We'll help you look for him.

323
00:19:55,843 --> 00:19:56,869
Where the hell is he?

324
00:20:08,099 --> 00:20:09,473
I'll go this way. You go that way.

325
00:20:09,473 --> 00:20:09,982
Sure.

326
00:20:25,578 --> 00:20:26,535
We can't find him.

327
00:20:26,702 --> 00:20:27,747
What do we do?

328
00:20:29,271 --> 00:20:30,681
No one found him?

329
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:31,568
No.

330
00:20:32,737 --> 00:20:33,628
What should we do?

331
00:20:33,837 --> 00:20:35,155
The afternoon class will begin soon.

332
00:20:36,157 --> 00:20:37,959
I'm worried about Mawin.

333
00:20:37,959 --> 00:20:40,790
But I can't miss this class.

334
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:42,971
You guys should go back to the class.

335
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,102
What about you?

336
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:45,169
I'll follow you.

337
00:20:45,628 --> 00:20:46,584
You should go.

338
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:48,620
Err, you can't miss the class.

339
00:20:49,204 --> 00:20:50,388
I got it. Go.

340
00:20:50,868 --> 00:20:51,712
I should go.

341
00:20:51,837 --> 00:20:52,651
See you.

342
00:20:55,114 --> 00:20:56,096
What should we do?

343
00:20:59,415 --> 00:21:00,281
What are you going to do?

344
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:02,635
You should go.

345
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:05,148
I'll skip the afternoon class to find him.

346
00:21:06,859 --> 00:21:08,640
It's just one class. It's not a big deal.

347
00:21:08,953 --> 00:21:10,406
It is a big deal.

348
00:21:11,199 --> 00:21:13,093
You don't have many points to be deducted
like Mawin.

349
00:21:13,844 --> 00:21:15,418
This scholarship is very important to you, isn't it?

350
00:21:15,856 --> 00:21:19,091
You can lose the scholarship
by just one point.

351
00:21:21,783 --> 00:21:23,417
Right now, I want to find him more than anything.

352
00:21:31,494 --> 00:21:33,617
(The last picture of the winner,)

353
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:37,843
(will it still be as beautiful as we've pictured it?)

354
00:22:08,462 --> 00:22:13,730
(Or will the winner have no one by his side
after he defeats others?)

355
00:22:14,648 --> 00:22:15,981
Why didn't you attend the class?

356
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:18,841
What are you doing here?

357
00:22:19,133 --> 00:22:20,526
Why did you run away?

358
00:22:20,526 --> 00:22:21,374
What are you thinking?

359
00:22:23,065 --> 00:22:24,483
You know that your point will be deducted, right?

360
00:22:24,796 --> 00:22:26,443
You could be disqualified from the final exam.

361
00:22:27,007 --> 00:22:27,740
What about you?

362
00:22:28,178 --> 00:22:29,736
You are skipping class like this.
Don't you worry about that?

363
00:22:30,529 --> 00:22:31,339
Yes, I do.

364
00:22:31,506 --> 00:22:33,190
I'm also worried about you.

365
00:22:36,049 --> 00:22:37,307
Are you mad at me about last night?

366
00:22:37,585 --> 00:22:38,937
Can't you give me a chance to explain it?

367
00:22:38,937 --> 00:22:40,159
It's not what you think.

368
00:22:40,368 --> 00:22:41,178
I'm not mad.

369
00:22:41,178 --> 00:22:42,638
Then why did you run away?

370
00:22:42,638 --> 00:22:43,749
I'm just hurt.

371
00:22:45,794 --> 00:22:48,121
It hurts that in the end, I still have no friends.

372
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:50,606
Mangpor was right.

373
00:22:51,587 --> 00:22:53,843
A guy like me should be alone.

374
00:22:54,678 --> 00:22:56,359
You shouldn't have looked for me.

375
00:23:00,554 --> 00:23:01,255
Yeah.

376
00:23:02,236 --> 00:23:02,970
I'm just being too nosy.

377
00:23:04,222 --> 00:23:05,317
That's not what I mean.

378
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:08,324
You don't need to care about me this much.

379
00:23:11,267 --> 00:23:13,556
You can see me as one of your schoolmates.

380
00:23:16,123 --> 00:23:19,327
If you were just a schoolmate to me,
why would I run around the hotel looking for you?

381
00:23:19,494 --> 00:23:20,467
Why would I do this to get my point deducted?

382
00:23:20,467 --> 00:23:21,656
My mom would scold me if she knew it.

383
00:23:21,656 --> 00:23:22,869
I'll miss my chance to win the scholarship.

384
00:23:23,787 --> 00:23:24,758
You know what?

385
00:23:25,238 --> 00:23:26,986
I also got pooped on by a bird.

386
00:23:32,974 --> 00:23:35,746
I did all these
because I only see you as my schoolmate.

387
00:23:36,067 --> 00:23:37,257
What the hell are you thinking, Mawin?

388
00:23:39,741 --> 00:23:42,761
Stop thinking that they don't like you.

389
00:23:43,533 --> 00:23:44,926
They are all worried about you.

390
00:23:44,926 --> 00:23:46,137
Everyone was looking for you everywhere.

391
00:23:48,892 --> 00:23:51,222
Yes, everyone was looking for you.

392
00:23:51,577 --> 00:23:54,060
I'm also looking for students who skip the class.

393
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:56,861
What the hell are you doing up here?

394
00:24:15,421 --> 00:24:16,598
Why did you skip the class?

395
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:19,702
If you have a problem,
why didn't you come to me?

396
00:24:22,512 --> 00:24:25,880
I told you I just want to rest. I feel tired.

397
00:24:27,275 --> 00:24:28,656
He followed me.

398
00:24:33,945 --> 00:24:38,240
According to the rules,
your point will be deducted.

399
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:43,537
But you have been well-behaved all this time.

400
00:24:44,267 --> 00:24:50,525
The Kaenpanya girl told me
that you two are having a hard time.

401
00:24:51,587 --> 00:24:54,963
So she asked me not to deduct your points.

402
00:24:56,092 --> 00:24:58,512
But you did violate the rule.

403
00:25:00,371 --> 00:25:02,096
I'll give you a punishment instead.

404
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,398
Today is laundry day.

405
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,923
Since you two won't attend
the afternoon class anyway.

406
00:25:08,923 --> 00:25:09,607
Right?

407
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,811
Collect your classmates' laundry

408
00:25:12,099 --> 00:25:13,519
and bring it to the laundry room.

409
00:25:15,179 --> 00:25:16,126
That's not all.

410
00:25:17,011 --> 00:25:20,292
Wait until the laundry is done
and bring it back to your classmates.

411
00:25:23,713 --> 00:25:24,302
See?

412
00:25:24,457 --> 00:25:25,185
You got yourself into trouble.

413
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,200
If you get sick, I'll laugh at you.

414
00:25:27,554 --> 00:25:30,203
Boys, you don't need to wait here.

415
00:25:30,203 --> 00:25:31,079
It will take a while.

416
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,532
You can come back to pick it up.

417
00:25:32,532 --> 00:25:33,284
Thank you.

418
00:25:33,904 --> 00:25:35,318
What is that on your shirt?

419
00:25:38,903 --> 00:25:39,835
It's so messy.

420
00:25:41,672 --> 00:25:42,374
See?

421
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:45,810
Use this to wipe it off for him.

422
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:46,538
Yes.

423
00:26:02,445 --> 00:26:03,857
Can I ask you for real?

424
00:26:04,565 --> 00:26:05,782
I know you're a genius.

425
00:26:06,092 --> 00:26:07,710
But aren't you worried about the point deduction?

426
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,252
If I say no, will you be mad at me?

427
00:26:17,378 --> 00:26:19,019
I don't want the scholarship.

428
00:26:19,948 --> 00:26:23,257
You know that I'm sent to this camp
because I got good grades.

429
00:26:25,204 --> 00:26:28,268
Mr. Jate never asked me
if I wanted to go study abroad.

430
00:26:29,197 --> 00:26:31,717
I think he saw you
compete in many academic competitions.

431
00:26:31,717 --> 00:26:32,899
So he might think you liked it.

432
00:26:33,319 --> 00:26:34,306
But isn't it a good thing?

433
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,396
If you win an award,
you can add it to your portfolio.

434
00:26:37,923 --> 00:26:39,688
But there are other students who really want it.

435
00:26:41,591 --> 00:26:43,506
After I heard what they said last night,

436
00:26:43,506 --> 00:26:44,638
I feel really bad.

437
00:26:48,621 --> 00:26:50,321
I feel like I'm stealing their spot.

438
00:26:52,025 --> 00:26:55,299
But everyone has a right to compete for it.

439
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,089
The exam is held so we can give it a try.

440
00:26:58,089 --> 00:26:59,628
So we will know if we like it or not.

441
00:26:59,849 --> 00:27:01,193
You don't need to feel bad.

442
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,125
You are only 18.

443
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:04,797
Just give it a try.

444
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,643
Don't you really want this scholarship?

445
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:15,114
If I get it, will you be mad at me?

446
00:27:15,711 --> 00:27:18,148
Probably.

447
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:19,888
I don't know.

448
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:22,058
You know what?

449
00:27:22,523 --> 00:27:25,262
I want this scholarship so bad
that I asked for advice from a fortune teller.

450
00:27:28,914 --> 00:27:30,446
What did he tell you to do?

451
00:27:33,456 --> 00:27:34,587
Don't laugh if I tell you.

452
00:27:36,335 --> 00:27:37,493
He told me…

453
00:27:38,644 --> 00:27:40,306
I need to make you like me.

454
00:27:44,223 --> 00:27:46,039
I told you not to laugh.

455
00:27:46,482 --> 00:27:47,893
When did you do that?

456
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:49,616
I didn't see it.

457
00:27:49,926 --> 00:27:51,179
It's because I didn't do it.

458
00:27:51,445 --> 00:27:52,729
How can I find time to do it?

459
00:27:52,928 --> 00:27:54,914
I'm busy studying all day.

460
00:27:56,729 --> 00:27:58,345
How can the fortune teller come up
with such advice?

461
00:27:58,611 --> 00:28:00,507
I will get the scholarship if I do that.

462
00:28:01,392 --> 00:28:03,649
Now, I believe that you really want it.

463
00:28:04,755 --> 00:28:07,136
To be honest, it's my life's goal right now.

464
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,337
Do you have any goals in your life?

465
00:28:21,734 --> 00:28:23,932
I just want to have a close friend
before graduating from high school.

466
00:28:26,322 --> 00:28:27,859
I've never had a friend, Err.

467
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:33,576
I work hard to get good grades.
I thought it would help me make some friends.

468
00:28:34,815 --> 00:28:37,143
But the better my grades are,
the harder it is for me to find a friend.

469
00:28:38,072 --> 00:28:39,954
I don't think it's about your grades.

470
00:28:40,441 --> 00:28:42,558
It's about you don't know how to socialize.

471
00:28:45,568 --> 00:28:46,256
It's true.

472
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:48,446
I'm suck at it.

473
00:28:50,504 --> 00:28:52,582
Why don't you ask for advice
from a fortune teller like I do?

474
00:29:00,086 --> 00:29:03,404
Doesn't it mean
you already achieved your first goal?

475
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:05,886
Because…

476
00:29:07,236 --> 00:29:08,559
you have me as your first friend.

477
00:29:16,027 --> 00:29:16,932
That's true.

478
00:29:18,968 --> 00:29:20,469
Even if I get the scholarship,

479
00:29:22,062 --> 00:29:24,473
I won't be as happy as
when I have you as my friend.

480
00:29:29,784 --> 00:29:31,224
Did you wipe all the bird poop off?

481
00:29:31,711 --> 00:29:32,406
Yes, sir.

482
00:29:33,291 --> 00:29:34,153
Good, bro.

483
00:29:34,264 --> 00:29:35,076
How much do I owe you?

484
00:29:36,492 --> 00:29:37,396
I don't want your money.

485
00:29:38,458 --> 00:29:39,872
Just let me do this.

486
00:29:52,553 --> 00:29:56,471
No scholarship will make me as happy as
when I have you, Err.

487
00:30:09,526 --> 00:30:10,707
Okay. Thank you.

488
00:30:17,744 --> 00:30:19,014
Everyone, sit down.

489
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,010
Do you know…

490
00:30:24,563 --> 00:30:26,007
what terrible thing we did last night?

491
00:30:27,888 --> 00:30:29,706
Just say what you want to say, Mhee.

492
00:30:29,706 --> 00:30:30,738
Stop beating around the bush.

493
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:32,209
Fine.

494
00:30:32,851 --> 00:30:34,634
I will stop beating around the bush, Sugus.

495
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,917
What I want to know is…

496
00:30:37,448 --> 00:30:39,479
What the hell is wrong with you guys?

497
00:30:39,855 --> 00:30:40,764
I want to ask you.

498
00:30:41,074 --> 00:30:43,456
Are you here to learn
or to be number one in this world?

499
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:45,542
You can't scold all of us like this, Mhee.

500
00:30:46,228 --> 00:30:49,930
Last night's meeting was Mangpor's idea.

501
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:52,193
I was only there to listen.

502
00:30:52,702 --> 00:30:54,104
I didn't do anything.

503
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,881
Because we didn't do anything.

504
00:30:56,324 --> 00:30:57,805
We should have stopped it.

505
00:30:57,805 --> 00:31:01,253
We let the nonsense talk keep going
until he heard it.

506
00:31:01,342 --> 00:31:02,257
Golf is right.

507
00:31:02,257 --> 00:31:04,005
We know what we did was wrong.

508
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:06,626
But we continued to talk behind his back

509
00:31:06,869 --> 00:31:08,186
until he walked in.

510
00:31:10,288 --> 00:31:12,346
Although some of us don't think he's a friend.

511
00:31:17,259 --> 00:31:20,953
If you see Mawin as your rival,

512
00:31:20,953 --> 00:31:22,954
then we're all your rivals too.

513
00:31:22,954 --> 00:31:24,835
If I top the ranking,

514
00:31:24,968 --> 00:31:27,837
will the rest of you
have a secret meeting without me?

515
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,590
This is what I want to say since last night.

516
00:31:30,033 --> 00:31:31,181
I admit that

517
00:31:31,181 --> 00:31:32,451
I didn't want to have a problem last night.

518
00:31:36,146 --> 00:31:37,980
I was also too afraid to say anything.

519
00:31:38,998 --> 00:31:43,345
But I didn't agree with you.
All of us here are competing for the scholarship.

520
00:31:43,345 --> 00:31:44,997
But none of us is as smart as Mawin.

521
00:31:45,794 --> 00:31:49,128
I know you all work hard for it.

522
00:31:49,128 --> 00:31:50,843
But we need to admit the truth.

523
00:31:51,263 --> 00:31:54,873
We all share an equal one-in-fifteen chance
of winning the scholarship.

524
00:31:55,271 --> 00:31:57,072
That's only 6.67 percent.

525
00:31:57,935 --> 00:31:59,818
It's not like we are going to die tomorrow.

526
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,146
I want this damn scholarship too.

527
00:32:02,566 --> 00:32:03,927
I hope that the 6 percent will be mine.

528
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:06,444
Aren't you having fun?

529
00:32:06,666 --> 00:32:08,640
To make new friends in this camp.

530
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,287
Am I the only one who has fun?

531
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:13,157
Huh?

532
00:32:14,795 --> 00:32:15,460
Mhee.

533
00:32:22,962 --> 00:32:24,095
I know…

534
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:27,570
you did it because you are stressed.

535
00:32:29,075 --> 00:32:32,474
You are not a bad person, Mangpor.

536
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,330
I'm sorry.

537
00:32:40,517 --> 00:32:42,399
I'm sorry to all of you…

538
00:32:43,019 --> 00:32:45,402
for making you feel guilty
because of what I did.

539
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:50,267
I've now realized that
this feeling is worse than failing an exam.

540
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:54,766
Why are you crying?

541
00:32:56,492 --> 00:32:57,747
Now I feel guilty.

542
00:32:59,274 --> 00:33:01,984
Then what should we do?

543
00:33:02,781 --> 00:33:07,041
I know what we did was wrong but…

544
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:11,548
Do you want us to apologize to him one by one?

545
00:33:11,548 --> 00:33:13,173
What do you want us to do?

546
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,747
I don't know.

547
00:33:15,475 --> 00:33:16,943
You guys are smart.

548
00:33:17,253 --> 00:33:18,727
You need to figure it out yourself.

549
00:33:25,963 --> 00:33:27,175
It's done.

550
00:33:27,175 --> 00:33:28,237
Thank you.

551
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:29,720
He wiped it all off.

552
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,845
Your friend did a good job.

553
00:33:30,845 --> 00:33:31,767
Thank you.

554
00:33:31,767 --> 00:33:32,311
Yeah.

555
00:33:33,949 --> 00:33:35,237
You return the laundry to them by yourself.

556
00:33:36,476 --> 00:33:37,931
Why can't you come with me?

557
00:33:38,528 --> 00:33:39,849
Didn't you say you aren't mad at them?

558
00:33:41,022 --> 00:33:42,730
I'm not mad at them but…

559
00:33:43,881 --> 00:33:45,238
I just don't know how to act around them.

560
00:33:46,367 --> 00:33:47,584
Just go see them.

561
00:33:48,004 --> 00:33:49,153
They are not terrible people.

562
00:34:09,457 --> 00:34:12,162
I'm sorry.

563
00:34:18,978 --> 00:34:20,294
This is an amulet.

564
00:34:20,294 --> 00:34:21,411
I got it from my senior at school.

565
00:34:21,411 --> 00:34:23,431
I'll give it to you.

566
00:34:23,431 --> 00:34:25,200
Please forgive me, Mawin.

567
00:34:27,369 --> 00:34:28,372
In case you feel hungry.

568
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:30,412
Here.

569
00:34:31,898 --> 00:34:33,614
Take it. It's delicious.

570
00:34:33,791 --> 00:34:35,508
It's Iticha's jersey.

571
00:34:35,508 --> 00:34:36,387
He's my favorite footballer.

572
00:34:39,352 --> 00:34:41,038
It's okay. I get it.

573
00:34:46,415 --> 00:34:48,101
Mawin, I'm sorry.

574
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,460
I'm sorry.

575
00:34:50,257 --> 00:34:51,358
Stop crying, Ton.

576
00:34:51,557 --> 00:34:54,726
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.

577
00:34:54,726 --> 00:34:55,567
That's enough. Come here.

578
00:34:56,851 --> 00:34:58,237
I didn't mean it.

579
00:35:12,759 --> 00:35:13,494
Wait.

580
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:21,688
Here.

581
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:27,272
These are the questions and the solutions
we learned in today's classes.

582
00:35:27,272 --> 00:35:28,440
I wrote it all down.

583
00:35:29,701 --> 00:35:34,680
Under the note is the textbook
from a tutor my school hired to teach us

584
00:35:35,211 --> 00:35:37,846
and the textbook my dad translated for me.

585
00:35:38,156 --> 00:35:39,457
My dad is a teacher.

586
00:35:41,183 --> 00:35:42,071
It's okay.

587
00:35:42,668 --> 00:35:44,133
You don't need to do this.

588
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:45,193
I'm not mad at you.

589
00:35:45,591 --> 00:35:47,482
Whether you are mad or not, just take it.

590
00:35:49,208 --> 00:35:50,886
I feel really bad for what I did to you.

591
00:35:57,746 --> 00:35:59,133
Are you really not mad at me?

592
00:36:01,877 --> 00:36:04,113
I really want to be your friend.

593
00:36:04,777 --> 00:36:06,759
If you are mad at me, just say it.
So I can make it up to you.

594
00:36:08,529 --> 00:36:09,558
I knew it.

595
00:36:09,956 --> 00:36:11,888
We helped her practice it.

596
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:14,922
You don't need to do that.

597
00:36:15,564 --> 00:36:16,797
I'm not mad at you.

598
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:19,256
Please tell this to other friends too.

599
00:36:21,469 --> 00:36:22,865
After the exam,

600
00:36:23,219 --> 00:36:25,096
let's invite Err to play board games with us.

601
00:36:28,194 --> 00:36:29,249
What are you doing here?

602
00:36:29,249 --> 00:36:30,033
Go in.

603
00:36:37,689 --> 00:36:38,321
Really?

604
00:36:38,786 --> 00:36:39,690
She cried?

605
00:36:39,978 --> 00:36:41,028
You did well, Mhee.

606
00:36:41,736 --> 00:36:45,371
(I told you they were only stressed
because the exam is coming.)

607
00:36:45,637 --> 00:36:47,032
(They are not terrible people.)

608
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:50,139
What you said is probably true.

609
00:36:51,577 --> 00:36:52,740
I've got to go.

610
00:36:52,829 --> 00:36:53,979
I think Mawin is back.

611
00:36:54,488 --> 00:36:55,561
Yeah. Bye.

612
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,360
Do you want to eat it?

613
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:00,866
Are you a monk receiving alms?

614
00:37:02,481 --> 00:37:04,991
Pornthep kissed me on the cheek.

615
00:37:06,363 --> 00:37:08,391
He really likes you.

616
00:37:10,139 --> 00:37:11,527
But not as much as Ton likes you.

617
00:37:11,705 --> 00:37:14,080
Every time he sees me,
he keeps talking about you.

618
00:37:14,434 --> 00:37:15,513
He praises you non-stop.

619
00:37:17,195 --> 00:37:18,394
Does he like me that much?

620
00:37:19,611 --> 00:37:20,570
Do you mean Ton?

621
00:37:21,522 --> 00:37:22,959
Yes, Ton.

622
00:37:23,756 --> 00:37:25,549
Yes, he really likes you.

623
00:37:27,784 --> 00:37:28,954
Ton likes me?

624
00:37:31,455 --> 00:37:32,485
Why are you smiling?

625
00:37:33,746 --> 00:37:34,787
What? I'm just smiling.

626
00:37:35,274 --> 00:37:36,278
Stop smiling.

627
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,930
Why can't I smile?

628
00:37:38,373 --> 00:37:39,269
Stop smiling.

629
00:37:39,512 --> 00:37:40,783
I'm smiling because of Ton.

630
00:37:41,137 --> 00:37:43,116
No, stop smiling.

631
00:37:43,116 --> 00:37:44,126
Then what do you want me to do?

632
00:37:44,126 --> 00:37:44,818
Stand still.

633
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:48,306
Yeah, stand still.

634
00:37:48,903 --> 00:37:49,850
No.

635
00:37:50,913 --> 00:37:51,966
Why are you hitting me?

636
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,186
Didn't you say you were going to finish this one?

637
00:38:10,435 --> 00:38:11,108
Hey.

638
00:38:12,347 --> 00:38:13,647
Can you show me how to solve it?

639
00:38:13,935 --> 00:38:14,756
I'm lost.

640
00:39:50,542 --> 00:39:51,240
Hey.

641
00:39:51,547 --> 00:39:52,959
It's great. Today is the last day of tutoring.

642
00:39:53,211 --> 00:39:54,179
We only have a class for half a day.

643
00:39:56,090 --> 00:39:57,401
What will we do in the afternoon?

644
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:58,867
I don't know.

645
00:40:00,075 --> 00:40:00,760
Ton.

646
00:40:00,976 --> 00:40:01,555
Yes.

647
00:40:01,663 --> 00:40:02,928
What is our schedule in the afternoon?

648
00:40:03,271 --> 00:40:04,866
I think we have an activity to do.

649
00:40:04,866 --> 00:40:05,954
But I'm not sure either.

650
00:40:09,092 --> 00:40:11,621
There will be a BBQ party at the pool.

651
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,290
Say it the way we've practiced.

652
00:40:19,952 --> 00:40:22,659
There will be a BBQ party at the pool.

653
00:40:22,659 --> 00:40:24,662
They will give us the camp's souvenir t-shirts.

654
00:40:31,027 --> 00:40:31,698
Ton.

655
00:40:32,491 --> 00:40:33,539
Stop pressuring me.

656
00:40:33,539 --> 00:40:34,860
This is how my natural voice sounds like.

657
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:40,333
Will you leave a message on my shirt?

658
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:56,728
What are you going to do?

659
00:40:58,477 --> 00:40:59,883
It is what it is.

660
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,540
Today is not my day.

661
00:41:01,666 --> 00:41:02,591
I'll try again tomorrow.

662
00:41:04,124 --> 00:41:06,310
There are other academic competitions for us.

663
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,439
Is that chocolate flavor?

664
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:26,536
Why am I fighting with my babe today?

665
00:41:26,879 --> 00:41:28,352
We have an exam tomorrow.

666
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,749
How can I work things out?

667
00:41:33,851 --> 00:41:34,592
What about you?

668
00:41:35,133 --> 00:41:35,913
Don't you have one?

669
00:41:38,113 --> 00:41:38,764
A babe?

670
00:41:40,585 --> 00:41:41,883
You have been with me for over ten days.

671
00:41:41,883 --> 00:41:43,559
Have you ever seen me talking on a phone
with someone else besides my mom?

672
00:41:45,218 --> 00:41:46,014
That's true.

673
00:41:48,376 --> 00:41:49,043
What about you?

674
00:41:49,566 --> 00:41:50,423
Don't you have one?

675
00:41:52,569 --> 00:41:54,342
Have you ever seen me
talking to anyone else but you?

676
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:03,580
What should I do?

677
00:42:12,849 --> 00:42:15,668
Two squared…

678
00:42:16,966 --> 00:42:17,732
Hey, Benz.

679
00:42:18,904 --> 00:42:19,916
How are you doing?

680
00:42:20,006 --> 00:42:21,578
I see you looking down all week.

681
00:42:21,578 --> 00:42:23,500
When will Err come back to school?

682
00:42:24,311 --> 00:42:25,585
He'll be back in a few days.

683
00:42:25,729 --> 00:42:26,284
Really?

684
00:42:26,284 --> 00:42:28,840
Do you remember Seer TK?

685
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,155
I shared his contact info with you.

686
00:42:30,425 --> 00:42:31,058
Of course.

687
00:42:31,491 --> 00:42:32,145
Why?

688
00:42:32,668 --> 00:42:35,806
You and I used to argue
whether he was a human or a bot.

689
00:42:36,131 --> 00:42:37,501
He's actually a human.

690
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,151
You are right.

691
00:42:39,512 --> 00:42:40,212
See?

692
00:42:40,284 --> 00:42:42,066
I told you he's not a bot.

693
00:42:42,445 --> 00:42:44,109
How can a bot give spot-on predictions?

694
00:42:44,722 --> 00:42:45,751
I also heard that…

695
00:42:46,058 --> 00:42:50,847
he might be one of the students in our school.

696
00:42:51,208 --> 00:42:51,708
Huh?

697
00:42:53,583 --> 00:42:55,645
Yes. That's what I heard.

698
00:42:56,474 --> 00:42:57,545
What do you think?

699
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:02,015
I think he's one of the senior students
based on how he talks.

700
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:04,711
That's what I think.

701
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,903
This camp is like a finite set.

702
00:43:08,165 --> 00:43:10,750
But your memories are like infinity.

703
00:43:12,409 --> 00:43:14,761
Our class,

704
00:43:15,645 --> 00:43:16,576
it's over.

705
00:43:20,092 --> 00:43:20,766
Alright.

706
00:43:21,415 --> 00:43:23,782
Since today is the last day of our class.

707
00:43:24,125 --> 00:43:26,703
I want to give you all my well wishes.

708
00:43:27,316 --> 00:43:31,604
I wish you the best of luck
on the path that you choose.

709
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:34,460
I don't know which one of you will be number one.

710
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:40,882
I hope all of you will be full of energy
to fight for what you want.

711
00:43:41,495 --> 00:43:44,089
Thank you for your hard work

712
00:43:44,287 --> 00:43:46,081
that brought you here together.

713
00:43:46,315 --> 00:43:46,956
Thank you.

714
00:43:48,254 --> 00:43:49,061
Err, help me.

715
00:43:58,568 --> 00:44:00,146
Is Mhee your friend from junior high?

716
00:44:01,643 --> 00:44:03,775
Yes, he studied at Baromavidya like us.

717
00:44:03,991 --> 00:44:06,031
He moved to attend high school
at the same school as his older brother.

718
00:44:06,553 --> 00:44:07,413
There.

719
00:44:07,413 --> 00:44:08,190
Here.

720
00:44:09,615 --> 00:44:11,114
All your friends are weird.

721
00:44:11,907 --> 00:44:12,579
I'm not surprised.

722
00:44:14,725 --> 00:44:15,431
Why?

723
00:44:18,533 --> 00:44:19,781
Don't you want to go play with them?

724
00:44:21,656 --> 00:44:22,341
No.

725
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:23,615
I'll sit here with you.

726
00:44:31,928 --> 00:44:33,115
Why are you so nice to me?

727
00:44:38,236 --> 00:44:39,311
You helped me a lot.

728
00:44:40,267 --> 00:44:42,344
Without your help, I wouldn't be ranked No. 4.

729
00:44:44,634 --> 00:44:45,773
You can do it.

730
00:44:47,089 --> 00:44:48,592
I always know you can do it.

731
00:44:49,782 --> 00:44:51,179
You just need to believe in yourself.

732
00:44:51,648 --> 00:44:52,883
Stop listening to others.

733
00:44:55,462 --> 00:44:57,816
You are the only one who tells me this.

734
00:44:59,258 --> 00:44:59,991
Tell you what?

735
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:05,154
You always tell me I can do it.

736
00:45:06,723 --> 00:45:08,110
I really think that.

737
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:10,985
It's okay if you don't believe in yourself.

738
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:12,296
But you can trust me.

739
00:45:14,956 --> 00:45:16,155
I believe that you can do it.

740
00:45:23,386 --> 00:45:25,498
You tell me the same thing
my fortune teller said to me.

741
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,484
The fortune teller who told you
that I need to fall for you?

742
00:45:30,566 --> 00:45:31,238
Yes.

743
00:45:31,905 --> 00:45:33,476
You talk like him.

744
00:45:35,856 --> 00:45:37,228
Are you the fortune teller?

745
00:45:39,175 --> 00:45:40,438
What if I were him?

746
00:45:41,177 --> 00:45:41,903
What would you do?

747
00:45:46,645 --> 00:45:47,722
All I need to do is fall for you, right?

748
00:45:50,787 --> 00:45:51,479
What?

749
00:45:53,314 --> 00:45:54,310
If I fall for you,

750
00:45:55,049 --> 00:45:56,359
you will get this scholarship, right?

751
00:46:03,269 --> 00:46:04,913
I'll fall for you right now.

752
00:46:08,177 --> 00:46:09,002
Are you crazy?

753
00:46:09,363 --> 00:46:10,617
What the fortune teller said is nonsense.

754
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:14,418
But I'm serious.

755
00:46:14,707 --> 00:46:15,427
I like you.

756
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:24,044
Do you like me, Err?

757
00:46:26,010 --> 00:46:27,494
Because I'm falling hard for you.

758
00:46:54,994 --> 00:46:56,427
Don't come near me.

759
00:46:56,571 --> 00:46:57,360
I can't swim.

760
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:58,694
Don't push me.

761
00:46:59,289 --> 00:47:00,035
Catch his legs.

762
00:47:00,828 --> 00:47:02,760
This is dangerous.

763
00:47:04,443 --> 00:47:05,549
Are you really on my side?

764
00:47:07,568 --> 00:47:09,092
I'm sad. I got dumped.

765
00:47:09,471 --> 00:47:10,291
What the heck?

766
00:47:12,888 --> 00:47:14,150
Where are Err and Mawin?

767
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:15,564
Right, where are they?

768
00:47:17,273 --> 00:47:17,773
Come here.

769
00:47:18,155 --> 00:47:20,377
Come and join us.

770
00:47:20,377 --> 00:47:21,779
Where have you been?

771
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:13,641
Do you really want to go?

772
00:48:13,822 --> 00:48:14,322
Go where?

773
00:48:14,539 --> 00:48:15,454
Go study abroad.

774
00:48:15,454 --> 00:48:17,025
If I submit a blank answer sheet tomorrow,

775
00:48:17,025 --> 00:48:17,868
you will get the scholarship.

776
00:48:17,868 --> 00:48:18,928
Why didn't you read my messages?

777
00:48:18,928 --> 00:48:19,909
This is a big deal.

778
00:48:19,909 --> 00:48:21,504
Seer TK that you've been chatting with…

779
00:48:21,504 --> 00:48:23,728
Before you went to the camp,
you two didn't like each other.

780
00:48:23,728 --> 00:48:25,605
But when you came back,
it looks like you hate each other.

781
00:48:25,605 --> 00:48:27,096
Aren't you going to explain it to me?

782
00:48:27,168 --> 00:48:28,120
Just say what is on your mind.

783
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:29,569
I've told you everything, Err.

784
00:48:29,569 --> 00:48:32,124
What I think, how I feel, I told you everything.

785
00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:33,144
Do you still like me?

786
00:48:33,144 --> 00:48:34,446
Can you continue to like me for another four years?

787
00:48:34,446 --> 00:48:35,864
Tell me what you want me to do.
I'll do anything.

788
00:48:35,864 --> 00:48:37,388
Do you want to be a fortune teller's boyfriend?
