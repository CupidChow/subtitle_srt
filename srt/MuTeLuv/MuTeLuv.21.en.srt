(Aisuru nara, zenryoku de)

6
00:00:36,775 --> 00:00:40,435
(If you love, do it with all you might.)

7
00:00:40,435 --> 00:00:42,680
PLEASE MAKE PAYU LOVE ME FOREVER.

8
00:00:52,016 --> 00:00:52,928
I don’t love you.

9
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,946
CURSE

10
00:01:55,702 --> 00:01:57,514
SEVERAL DAYS AGO, BANGKOK

11
00:01:58,638 --> 00:01:59,890
That’s cute.

12
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:04,100
When my boyfriend sits at the table, 
you can bring the cake to us.

13
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:04,968
Okay.

14
00:02:05,076 --> 00:02:06,103
Thank you.

15
00:02:09,561 --> 00:02:10,228
Sorry.

16
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:13,102
The traffic is so bad.

17
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,334
Did you see it?

18
00:02:14,507 --> 00:02:16,318
Luckily, I didn’t bump into him.

19
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:18,960
The cake for someone’s 3rd anniversary 
was almost damaged.

20
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,057
That cake.

21
00:02:32,229 --> 00:02:33,920
It’s for our 3rd anniversary.

22
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:34,780
Huh?

23
00:02:40,247 --> 00:02:41,679
Wishing you a lasting love.

24
00:02:43,903 --> 00:02:44,843
Yay!

25
00:02:46,312 --> 00:02:47,607
Yay!

26
00:02:49,098 --> 00:02:49,773
Yay!

27
00:02:57,864 --> 00:02:59,093
I’m so surprised.

28
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:01,840
I…

29
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,488
I’m kidding.

30
00:03:03,488 --> 00:03:06,008
Of course, I remember our 3rd anniversary.

31
00:03:06,008 --> 00:03:06,840
Thank you so much.

32
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,953
The cake is very cute.

33
00:03:09,401 --> 00:03:10,232
Are you sure?

34
00:03:11,183 --> 00:03:12,106
Of course.

35
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:18,248
Do you remember?

36
00:03:19,501 --> 00:03:23,179
What did you promise to do 
on our 3rd anniversary?

37
00:03:26,058 --> 00:03:26,558
Wait a sec.

38
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,258
Of course.

39
00:03:31,604 --> 00:03:33,783
I promised to take you on an aquarium date.

40
00:03:33,956 --> 00:03:35,395
I’ve planned everything.

41
00:03:35,395 --> 00:03:37,137
We can go after we finished from here.

42
00:03:40,608 --> 00:03:41,983
Oh, it’s not that.

43
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:45,811
Right.

44
00:03:46,697 --> 00:03:48,775
I promised to buy you a cat, right?

45
00:03:49,012 --> 00:03:50,125
Actually, I…

46
00:03:53,238 --> 00:03:54,329
Yes, I remember.

47
00:03:55,609 --> 00:03:56,877
Skydiving?

48
00:03:58,606 --> 00:04:01,553
I watched a video about it. It’s so romantic.

49
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:04,133
We fall from the sky and land on…

50
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:07,549
the sea.

51
00:04:08,089 --> 00:04:09,193
That’s not it.

52
00:04:15,157 --> 00:04:15,810
Wait.

53
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,199
Is it…

54
00:04:18,819 --> 00:04:21,598
propos…

55
00:04:24,105 --> 00:04:25,318
No!

56
00:04:26,831 --> 00:04:27,739
What a relief!

57
00:04:27,739 --> 00:04:29,154
If you don’t remember, just say it.

58
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:31,847
Both our anniversary and your promise.

59
00:04:32,884 --> 00:04:33,766
What?

60
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:36,734
If you remember, why didn’t you tell me?

61
00:04:37,296 --> 00:04:38,610
If you told me,

62
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:39,838
I would have done it for you.

63
00:04:39,838 --> 00:04:41,006
So we don’t need to fight like this.

64
00:04:41,006 --> 00:04:42,680
So I caused this fight?

65
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,953
You remember.

66
00:04:43,953 --> 00:04:47,026
If you told me a few days ahead, 
there wouldn’t have been any problem.

67
00:04:47,026 --> 00:04:48,328
So this is my fault?

68
00:04:48,825 --> 00:04:50,040
I remember it, but didn’t remind you.

69
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,326
That’s not what I said.

70
00:04:51,326 --> 00:04:52,658
That’s exactly what you said.

71
00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:55,953
How about this?

72
00:04:57,206 --> 00:04:59,890
What do you want? Just tell me.

73
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,757
Sure.

74
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,451
I want to break up with you.

75
00:05:22,115 --> 00:05:22,774
What?

76
00:05:24,827 --> 00:05:25,824
Why are you being so petty?

77
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,862
No, I’m not, Payu.

78
00:05:29,353 --> 00:05:30,264
Let’s break up.

79
00:05:41,502 --> 00:05:42,951
Don’t try to win me back.

80
00:05:43,599 --> 00:05:46,351
It’d be better 
if we never had to see each other again.

81
00:06:21,332 --> 00:06:22,015
Payu.

82
00:06:23,398 --> 00:06:25,429
Payu, hang in there, bro.

83
00:06:25,904 --> 00:06:27,041
Are you alright?

84
00:06:33,732 --> 00:06:34,494
Try it.

85
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,572
It’s delicious.

86
00:06:38,338 --> 00:06:39,041
What?

87
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:42,989
Your eyes are dry.

88
00:06:43,335 --> 00:06:45,062
I don’t see any tears.

89
00:06:46,985 --> 00:06:48,034
It means…

90
00:06:48,423 --> 00:06:49,701
you feel relieved to break up with her, right?

91
00:06:50,068 --> 00:06:52,752
Congratulations on being single again.

92
00:06:56,325 --> 00:06:57,052
Hey.

93
00:06:57,311 --> 00:06:58,125
You know what.

94
00:06:58,362 --> 00:07:01,580
Your breaking happened at the perfect time.

95
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:05,194
Our faculty is holding a party tonight.

96
00:07:05,756 --> 00:07:09,874
I think we should go 
and flirt with the freshman girls.

97
00:07:09,874 --> 00:07:10,528
Wait.

98
00:07:11,824 --> 00:07:13,356
I just broke up with my girlfriend.

99
00:07:13,464 --> 00:07:15,005
But you want me 
to jump into a new relationship?

100
00:07:15,804 --> 00:07:17,954
Shouldn’t I have time to feel sad 
about the breakup?

101
00:07:29,096 --> 00:07:30,273
Are you sad about it?

102
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,567
Hey.

103
00:07:43,799 --> 00:07:45,455
Do you see any girl that you like?

104
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:50,390
What about that girl?

105
00:07:55,292 --> 00:07:56,364
No.

106
00:08:00,092 --> 00:08:00,617
Hey.

107
00:08:01,771 --> 00:08:02,517
What about those girls?

108
00:08:03,647 --> 00:08:04,303
They are pretty hot.

109
00:08:08,214 --> 00:08:09,912
Not really. No.

110
00:08:16,481 --> 00:08:18,467
There’s no single girl here that you like?

111
00:08:18,467 --> 00:08:19,381
Seriously?

112
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:25,248
I’ll have one Bellini.

113
00:08:38,378 --> 00:08:39,582
I think I found one.

114
00:08:42,845 --> 00:08:45,276
That’s Ing-ing.

115
00:08:45,449 --> 00:08:46,843
She is…

116
00:08:47,686 --> 00:08:49,230
He doesn’t even listen to me, jerk.

117
00:08:58,862 --> 00:09:01,585
Are you Ing-ing?

118
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:02,529
Yes.

119
00:09:03,199 --> 00:09:04,927
You are…

120
00:09:05,489 --> 00:09:06,381
I’m Payu.

121
00:09:06,748 --> 00:09:08,600
Do I know you?

122
00:09:09,227 --> 00:09:12,916
My friend told me that 
the prettiest girl in our faculty is Ing-ing.

123
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:14,299
So I guess you are her.

124
00:09:14,299 --> 00:09:17,228
You are such a player, my friend.

125
00:09:17,228 --> 00:09:18,015
Do you know this?

126
00:09:19,182 --> 00:09:22,065
The cocktail that you order 
can tell your personality.

127
00:09:23,102 --> 00:09:25,993
What does Bellini…

128
00:09:27,376 --> 00:09:28,896
tell about my personality?

129
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,100
- I don’t know.
- What?

130
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,352
I only read the article title.

131
00:09:34,065 --> 00:09:35,797
I still have the link to the article.

132
00:09:35,797 --> 00:09:37,956
If you tell me your IG account, 
I’ll send it to you.

133
00:09:52,483 --> 00:09:53,174
Shit.

134
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,928
Can I have my phone back?

135
00:09:58,928 --> 00:09:59,643
I’ll be right back.

136
00:10:12,694 --> 00:10:16,257
How was it, Bro?

137
00:10:16,646 --> 00:10:17,871
Is May at this party?

138
00:10:18,757 --> 00:10:20,129
Are you crazy?

139
00:10:20,518 --> 00:10:22,124
Why would she be here?

140
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:24,150
This party is only for students at our faculty.

141
00:10:24,409 --> 00:10:25,686
Partners are not allowed.

142
00:10:25,686 --> 00:10:27,412
There’s no way your ex would be here.

143
00:10:28,882 --> 00:10:30,743
I probably saw someone who looked like her.

144
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:34,829
So how are things going with Ing-ing?

145
00:10:35,224 --> 00:10:36,542
Of course, it’s going smoothly.

146
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:39,914
Damn. It’s going smoothly.

147
00:10:39,914 --> 00:10:42,473
The veteran is back in the game.

148
00:10:43,229 --> 00:10:44,629
You are the real deal.

149
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,831
I’ll go back to Ing-ing.

150
00:10:47,831 --> 00:10:49,632
Okay. Go, my friend.

151
00:10:57,367 --> 00:10:59,158
What were we talking about?

152
00:11:01,081 --> 00:11:03,187
You asked for my IG account.

153
00:11:04,116 --> 00:11:05,696
Can I have it?

154
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,389
Shit.

155
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:19,263
What’s wrong?

156
00:11:19,868 --> 00:11:20,548
Nothing.

157
00:11:20,548 --> 00:11:21,668
Please keep typing.

158
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,864
Excuse me.

159
00:11:27,188 --> 00:11:29,952
I’ll be right back.

160
00:11:36,339 --> 00:11:37,017
May.

161
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:39,475
May.

162
00:11:40,854 --> 00:11:41,472
May.

163
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,206
May I help you?

164
00:11:48,864 --> 00:11:49,494
Sorry.

165
00:11:49,602 --> 00:11:51,398
Excuse me. I’ll be right back.

166
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,203
What’s going on?

167
00:11:56,283 --> 00:11:57,043
Shit.

168
00:11:57,043 --> 00:11:59,146
I think I saw May, but I can’t find her.

169
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,056
Payu.

170
00:12:00,402 --> 00:12:02,372
She can’t attend this party.

171
00:12:02,675 --> 00:12:05,998
Only students at our faculty 
can register to attend the party.

172
00:12:05,998 --> 00:12:08,050
But I really saw her.

173
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:09,543
She was staring at me.

174
00:12:10,105 --> 00:12:13,602
I think you need to stop overthinking.

175
00:12:17,538 --> 00:12:19,824
Why didn’t you call and ask her 
if you insist that you saw her?

176
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:22,653
If you secretly watched your ex,

177
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:24,278
would you tell her about it?

178
00:12:24,278 --> 00:12:26,828
May also blocked me on everything.

179
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:29,414
Fine.

180
00:12:29,781 --> 00:12:32,749
Hypothetically, she was here.

181
00:12:33,203 --> 00:12:34,259
Why do you need to be afraid?

182
00:12:36,194 --> 00:12:38,165
You and she have broken up.

183
00:12:38,468 --> 00:12:40,592
You can flirt with any girls you want.

184
00:12:40,938 --> 00:12:42,666
Am I right?

185
00:12:43,465 --> 00:12:46,034
Yes, you’re right.

186
00:12:46,034 --> 00:12:46,671
Right?

187
00:12:46,671 --> 00:12:47,640
I’m not with her anymore.

188
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,374
No, you’re not.

189
00:12:48,374 --> 00:12:49,447
I can flirt with any girls I want.

190
00:12:49,447 --> 00:12:49,994
Of course.

191
00:12:49,994 --> 00:12:50,724
I’m single.

192
00:12:50,724 --> 00:12:51,458
You’re single.

193
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:52,029
Okay.

194
00:12:52,029 --> 00:12:53,252
Go for it, Bro!

195
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,839
Wait, Ing-ing.

196
00:12:58,228 --> 00:12:59,129
I’m back.

197
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:02,444
So…

198
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,098
you now have time to flirt with me.

199
00:13:07,324 --> 00:13:09,012
I’m not going anywhere this time.

200
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:24,103
I’m single.

201
00:13:25,011 --> 00:13:26,645
It’s nothing. Please continue typing.

202
00:13:33,094 --> 00:13:33,833
Are you done?

203
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,519
Give me a sec.

204
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,445
My IG account is long.

205
00:13:47,052 --> 00:13:48,351
Why is it so long?

206
00:13:48,351 --> 00:13:49,114
Give me a sec.

207
00:13:49,114 --> 00:13:49,801
Are you done?

208
00:13:58,256 --> 00:13:59,386
Here. Done.

209
00:14:09,872 --> 00:14:11,073
Shit. What is this?

210
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:14,129
What the hell is wrong with you?

211
00:14:14,129 --> 00:14:15,159
Wait.

212
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:16,300
Calm down.

213
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,552
Wait.

214
00:14:34,343 --> 00:14:35,226
May?

215
00:14:39,091 --> 00:14:40,854
The only way to fix this.

216
00:14:41,048 --> 00:14:42,302
You need a new girlfriend.

217
00:14:42,302 --> 00:14:43,623
Are you having a date?

218
00:14:44,574 --> 00:14:45,827
I’m with May.

219
00:14:45,957 --> 00:14:47,242
Are you sure?

220
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,424
But she’s with me.
