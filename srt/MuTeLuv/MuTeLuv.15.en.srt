1
00:00:11,507 --> 00:00:12,617
Grandma.

2
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:18,222
I’m here to express my gratitude 
for the lottery you gave us the other day.

3
00:00:19,136 --> 00:00:23,013
Your power is now evident to me.

4
00:00:23,382 --> 00:00:25,084
Thank you, Grandma.

5
00:00:34,436 --> 00:00:35,858
What’s wrong?

6
00:00:36,859 --> 00:00:39,736
Why do you look so down 
like an abandoned puppy?

7
00:00:43,583 --> 00:00:44,083
Han.

8
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:46,366
At this shrine.

9
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:50,677
Can we make a wish for others?

10
00:00:52,223 --> 00:00:55,892
Don’t you see her power 
from the last time we prayed to her?

11
00:00:56,103 --> 00:00:58,050
How powerful she was.

12
00:01:03,549 --> 00:01:05,497
Yohan, my best friend.

13
00:01:06,059 --> 00:01:09,252
You don’t need to act like a good person 
and ask her to help me win the match.

14
00:01:09,621 --> 00:01:11,363
Don’t get too full of yourself.

15
00:01:11,644 --> 00:01:12,861
This time, I pray for myself.

16
00:01:14,003 --> 00:01:19,683
Grandma, you are the most powerful spirit here.

17
00:01:19,683 --> 00:01:22,642
Please send me a boyfriend.

18
00:01:23,064 --> 00:01:23,953
You can send anyone.

19
00:01:23,953 --> 00:01:26,397
I don’t mind as long as I get a boyfriend.

20
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,615
If you grant my wish, 
I will perform the best Thai dance for you.

21
00:01:31,037 --> 00:01:32,503
Amen.

22
00:01:33,381 --> 00:01:34,314
You haven’t learned the lesson, have you?

23
00:01:35,351 --> 00:01:37,260
Don’t be so picky.

24
00:01:37,401 --> 00:01:40,194
If it can be useful for us, just do it.

25
00:01:40,194 --> 00:01:43,478
We can perform a Thai dance for her later.

26
00:01:43,935 --> 00:01:44,435
Right?

27
00:01:44,558 --> 00:01:45,080
Yes.

28
00:01:46,977 --> 00:01:48,124
What about you?

29
00:01:49,846 --> 00:01:53,374
Why don’t you ask her to help you 
with your dream match?

30
00:02:12,982 --> 00:02:13,568
Grandma.

31
00:02:15,342 --> 00:02:18,256
I have a very important thing 
to ask for your help.

32
00:02:22,508 --> 00:02:24,311
Please help Malai pass the audition.

33
00:02:27,262 --> 00:02:30,779
Please help her get selected 
to be an artist under the new agency.

34
00:02:32,747 --> 00:02:33,903
You are acting like a hero.

35
00:02:34,465 --> 00:02:35,465
For me,

36
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:40,847
being able to box again is good enough.

37
00:02:42,604 --> 00:02:43,468
From now on,

38
00:02:44,733 --> 00:02:49,926
I will try to do it myself.

39
00:02:52,263 --> 00:02:53,348
For Malai,

40
00:02:55,562 --> 00:02:57,543
I see that she’s always tried her best.

41
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:04,593
So I want her 
to be blessed with good luck

42
00:03:05,911 --> 00:03:07,327
and receive a good opportunity

43
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:08,929
at least once in her life.

44
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,044
I’m begging you, Grandma.

45
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:15,760
Please help Malai.

46
00:03:18,378 --> 00:03:19,478
Just this once.

47
00:03:31,646 --> 00:03:34,030
You are so cool.

48
00:03:34,223 --> 00:03:38,588
I promise I will work hard with you.

49
00:03:39,923 --> 00:03:40,718
Let’s start.

50
00:03:41,298 --> 00:03:44,000
Tomorrow, you and I will go to Thammachak.

51
00:03:44,211 --> 00:03:46,358
There will be a player tryout.

52
00:03:46,358 --> 00:03:49,742
Those who are selected will appear 
in the press conference with you

53
00:03:49,742 --> 00:03:51,604
and take photos after the match.

54
00:03:52,675 --> 00:03:53,610
Are you ready?

55
00:03:54,383 --> 00:03:59,970
Ready to face Baby Shark 
as your opponent in the rematch?

56
00:04:01,094 --> 00:04:01,859
Bring it on.

57
00:04:02,948 --> 00:04:03,703
I’m super ready.

58
00:04:03,931 --> 00:04:05,911
Can you do it?

59
00:04:06,232 --> 00:04:08,552
I can do it.

60
00:04:09,886 --> 00:04:11,143
#JAMAREE-THAMMACHAKBOXING93

61
00:04:11,143 --> 00:04:12,886
BABY SHARK LOOKS SO COOL.

62
00:04:12,886 --> 00:04:15,959
I’M HERE FOR KLAIRUNG.
WILL THE MATCH BE BROADCAST LIVE?

63
00:04:21,739 --> 00:04:23,009
The cheer is so loud.

64
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:25,382
Baby Shark must knock out his opponent.

65
00:04:25,382 --> 00:04:26,748
I guess so.

66
00:04:27,222 --> 00:04:28,950
But no need to be scared.

67
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:32,781
You have me and your dad with you.

68
00:04:38,474 --> 00:04:40,979
Dad, whose side are you taking?

69
00:04:48,529 --> 00:04:51,261
Of course, I’m taking your side.

70
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,313
My admiration for Baby Shark is over.

71
00:04:54,471 --> 00:04:57,284
From now on, I only have Klairung,

72
00:04:57,688 --> 00:04:59,986
my beloved son.

73
00:05:00,214 --> 00:05:00,906
Fine.

74
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,455
I hope you mean what you said.

75
00:05:02,455 --> 00:05:03,308
Of course, I mean it.

76
00:05:03,993 --> 00:05:05,226
You’d better mean it.

77
00:05:10,584 --> 00:05:11,903
What’s going on?

78
00:05:12,184 --> 00:05:13,108
Let me see.

79
00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:14,739
Is this real?

80
00:05:14,739 --> 00:05:15,251
Is it possible?

81
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,173
Is this him?

82
00:05:20,172 --> 00:05:20,873
Yes.

83
00:05:23,734 --> 00:05:24,797
Okay.

84
00:05:38,195 --> 00:05:38,960
I can do it.

85
00:05:39,734 --> 00:05:40,423
Hit me.

86
00:05:40,599 --> 00:05:41,610
I can do it.

87
00:05:41,856 --> 00:05:42,810
Are you ready?

88
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,501
I’m going to take a video 
to upload to our channel.

89
00:05:45,501 --> 00:05:47,301
Sure. I’m ready.

90
00:05:47,582 --> 00:05:51,489
I’m now the fittest and readiest 
since I was born.

91
00:05:51,682 --> 00:05:54,335
Baby Shark, are you okay?

92
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,089
What happened?

93
00:05:59,736 --> 00:06:00,984
Were you not ready for the match?

94
00:06:00,984 --> 00:06:02,064
Hey.

95
00:06:02,064 --> 00:06:02,693
Baby Shark.

96
00:06:05,863 --> 00:06:06,966
What just happened?

97
00:06:20,678 --> 00:06:25,581
Surprise, mother, father.

98
00:06:29,534 --> 00:06:30,483
Sunrise.

99
00:06:37,844 --> 00:06:39,069
Good luck?

100
00:06:39,579 --> 00:06:40,223
A lottery ticket?

101
00:06:41,049 --> 00:06:41,803
Repay to the higher power?

102
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,365
So this is how it is.

103
00:06:47,997 --> 00:06:48,753
Grandma.

104
00:06:49,385 --> 00:06:50,870
If you are a powerful spirit like they said,

105
00:06:51,415 --> 00:06:55,050
please help me beat Baby Shark 
and become the university’s athlete.

106
00:06:55,472 --> 00:06:57,171
If you grant my wish,

107
00:06:57,294 --> 00:07:01,066
I will arrange a group of dancers 
to perform a Thai dance for you.

108
00:07:12,148 --> 00:07:17,000
I defeat the old and incompetent Baby Shark 
with my punches.

109
00:07:17,913 --> 00:07:22,431
It’s over, the legendary lethal left punch 
and deadly right punch.

110
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:24,958
Dad.

111
00:07:26,153 --> 00:07:28,457
Are you shocked?

112
00:07:29,019 --> 00:07:30,288
Don’t worry.

113
00:07:31,008 --> 00:07:33,565
You will be even more shocked.

114
00:07:34,022 --> 00:07:36,332
There’s another disgusting phony

115
00:07:37,579 --> 00:07:39,587
waiting to be crushed by me.

116
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,750
A real deal is not a big talker.

117
00:07:58,489 --> 00:07:59,916
If you think you are a real deal,

118
00:08:02,709 --> 00:08:03,894
then don’t let me beat you.

119
00:08:17,899 --> 00:08:22,266
The friendly boxing match is starting soon.

120
00:08:22,266 --> 00:08:23,292
What is he doing?

121
00:08:23,292 --> 00:08:24,620
I found a secret weapon.

122
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,264
It guarantees that I will defeat you.

123
00:08:29,846 --> 00:08:31,470
She is blacklisted by Biao’s agency.

124
00:08:31,681 --> 00:08:33,134
Because of your troubled past,

125
00:08:33,134 --> 00:08:34,831
it could cause us problems.

126
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,145
Grandma, how can you do this?

127
00:08:37,145 --> 00:08:38,448
You’ve never been fair.

128
00:08:38,536 --> 00:08:41,907
You help him take advantage 
of the person who has been working hard.

129
00:08:41,907 --> 00:08:43,490
What do you want?

130
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,000
Just tell me.
