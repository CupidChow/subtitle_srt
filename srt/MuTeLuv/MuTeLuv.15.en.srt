1
00:00:12,725 --> 00:00:13,376
Okay.

2
00:00:17,413 --> 00:00:20,525
Grandma, it’s the show date.

3
00:00:20,788 --> 00:00:24,435
Rung is ready to perform on stage 
as he has promised.

4
00:00:24,567 --> 00:00:26,935
A full Chuichai dance performance.

5
00:00:27,549 --> 00:00:28,114
Go.

6
00:00:32,831 --> 00:00:33,744
Klairung.

7
00:00:45,038 --> 00:00:46,057
Are you okay?

8
00:00:48,229 --> 00:00:49,076
Can you do it?

9
00:00:58,333 --> 00:01:00,243
Yes, I can.

10
00:01:10,269 --> 00:01:10,769
Han.

11
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,240
You will broadcast it to Mad-Oam fandom?

12
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:18,831
Hello, everyone.

13
00:01:19,007 --> 00:01:21,301
I’m going live a bit early today.

14
00:01:22,683 --> 00:01:25,398
Thank you, everyone who is watching this.

15
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,145
Today, I look a bit strange

16
00:01:29,518 --> 00:01:35,393
But it’s not that strange compared to 
all the chaos you’ve seen in the past two weeks.

17
00:01:36,292 --> 00:01:39,517
You probably notice 
that I’ve been acting strange.

18
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:43,178
And it’s affecting my work.

19
00:01:45,942 --> 00:01:47,165
It was my fault.

20
00:01:48,437 --> 00:01:49,931
I didn’t keep my promise.

21
00:01:53,463 --> 00:01:58,436
But today, I’m going to address 
my unfinished business.

22
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:00,809
I’m going to perform a Thai dance 
to the higher power.

23
00:02:02,564 --> 00:02:06,509
I’m doing the live-streaming 
because I want to show you.

24
00:02:07,321 --> 00:02:14,910
This dance is a result of my determination 
and hard work.

25
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:24,513
I hope that you will root for me 
by donating money.

26
00:02:25,149 --> 00:02:30,033
Your donation will be used 
to solve an agreement.

27
00:02:31,305 --> 00:02:35,844
Some agreements can only be solved 
with money.

28
00:02:41,373 --> 00:02:45,599
Malai needs money to solve her problem.

29
00:02:45,884 --> 00:02:49,132
I want to help and repay her.

30
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:50,117
Klairung.

31
00:02:51,587 --> 00:02:53,115
What are you doing?

32
00:02:56,121 --> 00:02:58,660
Malai is a very important person.

33
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,494
She helps me get through hard times.

34
00:03:07,048 --> 00:03:07,812
So…

35
00:03:11,147 --> 00:03:12,888
I want to do the same for her.

36
00:03:19,507 --> 00:03:20,604
Are you okay…

37
00:03:22,447 --> 00:03:23,356
with what I’m doing?

38
00:03:27,809 --> 00:03:28,649
Yes.

39
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:34,879
Give me a minute.

40
00:03:45,894 --> 00:03:47,812
I’ll dance with you.

41
00:03:48,119 --> 00:03:51,080
You are a master of Thai dance performance.

42
00:03:51,343 --> 00:03:52,135
Isn’t your outfit too simple?

43
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:55,632
I didn’t prepare a proper outfit with me.

44
00:03:55,786 --> 00:03:57,492
Though I don’t wear a proper outfit,

45
00:03:57,492 --> 00:03:58,718
I guarantee my dance will be perfect.

46
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:14,656
You did well.

47
00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:18,826
I think my grandma will approve of your dance.

48
00:06:48,858 --> 00:06:49,872
My hands are cured.

49
00:06:49,872 --> 00:06:51,467
I can fold my hands now.

50
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,507
My hands are cured.

51
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:00,161
Han.

52
00:07:00,512 --> 00:07:03,673
You don’t need to be that happy for me, 
my best friend.

53
00:07:04,265 --> 00:07:06,173
Yes, I’m happy.

54
00:07:06,173 --> 00:07:08,784
But I’m actually crying 
because of this.

55
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,645
What?

56
00:07:10,303 --> 00:07:14,195
We received over 30,000 baht in donations.

57
00:07:14,195 --> 00:07:15,766
Huh? 30,000?

58
00:07:16,841 --> 00:07:18,936
You don’t only reach your goal.

59
00:07:19,046 --> 00:07:20,626
But you’re exceeding your goal.

60
00:07:20,626 --> 00:07:22,080
What are you waiting for?

61
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,321
Malai, wire the cancellation fee to him.

62
00:07:24,321 --> 00:07:25,876
Let’s end it right here, right now.

63
00:07:29,584 --> 00:07:30,355
It’s over.

64
00:07:31,211 --> 00:07:32,473
It’s really over.

65
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:34,416
It’s finally over.

66
00:07:48,632 --> 00:07:50,674
I won’t let it end easily as you want.

67
00:07:56,883 --> 00:07:58,048
Hello, kiddos.

68
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,725
The last boss is here.

69
00:08:02,568 --> 00:08:03,249
Biao.

70
00:08:04,697 --> 00:08:07,384
I could have enjoyed the live stream at home.

71
00:08:07,998 --> 00:08:09,765
But I came all the way here.

72
00:08:10,862 --> 00:08:13,341
Because I’m increasing your cancellation fee, 
Malai.

73
00:08:16,654 --> 00:08:19,379
The additional fee is an opportunity cost.

74
00:08:20,498 --> 00:08:23,225
You need to pay me another 100,000 baht.

75
00:08:25,243 --> 00:08:26,064
100,000?

76
00:08:26,393 --> 00:08:28,007
How can you do this to her?

77
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:28,551
Yeah.

78
00:08:28,551 --> 00:08:30,989
Biao, are you crazy?

79
00:08:30,989 --> 00:08:32,945
How can I find that much money?

80
00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:34,972
I watched your live stream.

81
00:08:35,674 --> 00:08:37,462
You earned a lot of money from it.

82
00:08:38,186 --> 00:08:40,749
It’s not that hard for you to find the money.

83
00:08:41,451 --> 00:08:43,227
Stop celebrating her freedom.

84
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,746
Start finding money to pay me.

85
00:08:46,558 --> 00:08:48,065
I’ll be waiting, Malai.

86
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,396
What the heck?!

87
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:59,696
It’s not over because of your dishonesty.

88
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:05,405
I think my chance is over.

89
00:09:07,511 --> 00:09:08,284
Malai.

90
00:09:08,547 --> 00:09:10,452
If I can’t cancel this contract,

91
00:09:10,847 --> 00:09:12,680
I can’t sign a contract with a new agency.

92
00:09:14,698 --> 00:09:21,286
I can never find the money 
before the audition date.

93
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,896
What the hell is this?

94
00:09:32,335 --> 00:09:34,528
Your grandma’s shrine is right here.

95
00:09:34,528 --> 00:09:36,063
Aren’t you going to help her?

96
00:09:42,842 --> 00:09:44,800
Grandma, I’m begging you.

97
00:09:45,107 --> 00:09:46,716
Please send us 100,000 baht.

98
00:09:46,716 --> 00:09:52,795
I don’t care if it falls from the sky or 
through any magical or supernatural means.

99
00:09:52,795 --> 00:09:54,471
If you grant my wish, 
I will perform a beautiful dance for you.

100
00:09:54,471 --> 00:09:55,057
Han.

101
00:09:55,584 --> 00:09:56,443
Please.

102
00:09:56,816 --> 00:09:57,845
Help us end the problem.

103
00:09:57,955 --> 00:09:58,569
Stop it.

104
00:10:02,145 --> 00:10:04,939
If she could help Malai, 
she would have done it a long time ago.

105
00:10:08,954 --> 00:10:09,651
Yohan.

106
00:10:18,437 --> 00:10:19,117
Hey.

107
00:10:20,148 --> 00:10:21,043
It’s a lottery ticket.

108
00:10:21,043 --> 00:10:21,876
Wait.

109
00:10:22,139 --> 00:10:24,112
Did someone lose it around here?

110
00:10:26,701 --> 00:10:27,845
It’s written here.

111
00:10:27,845 --> 00:10:29,000
It doesn’t have an owner.

112
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,977
You can take it if you find it.

113
00:10:30,977 --> 00:10:31,869
Damn.

114
00:10:32,088 --> 00:10:34,465
Isn’t it too magical?

115
00:10:34,465 --> 00:10:36,920
The winning numbers were announced yesterday.

116
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:38,890
The ticket won the second prize.

117
00:10:39,153 --> 00:10:40,458
The prize money is 200,000 baht.

118
00:10:40,853 --> 00:10:41,870
It means…

119
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,778
Thank you, Grandma.

120
00:10:51,853 --> 00:10:53,397
Malai, I thought I was acting crazy.

121
00:10:53,573 --> 00:10:55,302
But your grandma is crazier than I am.

122
00:11:01,138 --> 00:11:01,967
What?

123
00:11:02,932 --> 00:11:04,675
She has the money to pay us?

124
00:11:04,938 --> 00:11:05,828
How is that possible?

125
00:11:05,828 --> 00:11:07,090
It’s been only a few hours.

126
00:11:07,309 --> 00:11:08,475
I don’t know.

127
00:11:09,923 --> 00:11:10,783
Good.

128
00:11:11,134 --> 00:11:14,785
Since she has the money to pay us, 
we just increase the cancellation fee.

129
00:11:15,487 --> 00:11:16,507
300,000 baht.

130
00:11:16,704 --> 00:11:18,849
Let’s see if she can pay it this time.

131
00:11:19,266 --> 00:11:21,885
I’ll tear the former notification letter.

132
00:11:28,467 --> 00:11:29,234
What the heck?!

133
00:11:29,673 --> 00:11:33,047
Why is it so hard to tear this paper?

134
00:11:41,186 --> 00:11:43,401
Why are you harassing my granddaughter?

135
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,780
Cancel her contract now!

136
00:11:50,914 --> 00:11:54,322
Biao has cancelled your contract.

137
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:58,511
Malai is now free.

138
00:11:59,849 --> 00:12:01,930
You seem to be more excited than I am.

139
00:12:02,961 --> 00:12:04,003
Of course.

140
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:06,097
Your contract is cancelled.

141
00:12:06,294 --> 00:12:08,980
I can start boxing again.

142
00:12:13,696 --> 00:12:14,627
What’s wrong?

143
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:18,146
I got cramps.

144
00:12:26,132 --> 00:12:27,921
We finally made it.

145
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,013
We got what we have been fighting for.

146
00:12:33,975 --> 00:12:36,838
Thank you, Miss con artist.

147
00:12:38,747 --> 00:12:39,247
Yeah.

148
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,346
You can call me that if you want.

149
00:12:43,671 --> 00:12:45,603
I’m just joking.

150
00:12:45,603 --> 00:12:46,986
Don’t be mad.

151
00:12:55,934 --> 00:12:58,568
So it’s time for us to go our separate ways.

152
00:13:05,676 --> 00:13:06,212
Hey.

153
00:13:07,177 --> 00:13:08,198
It’s not time yet.

154
00:13:09,076 --> 00:13:10,112
I…

155
00:13:11,516 --> 00:13:14,069
I still have the final boxing match.

156
00:13:15,232 --> 00:13:16,417
You will…

157
00:13:17,558 --> 00:13:18,801
…come to watch me, right?

158
00:13:23,562 --> 00:13:24,322
Why?

159
00:13:25,967 --> 00:13:27,645
You don’t want to watch my match?

160
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:30,852
Yes.

161
00:13:32,366 --> 00:13:33,764
But that day.

162
00:13:36,309 --> 00:13:37,603
The day when your match is held.

163
00:13:39,271 --> 00:13:41,263
It’s the same day as my audition.

164
00:13:53,392 --> 00:13:55,348
I worked hard to make this for you.

165
00:13:55,787 --> 00:13:57,453
I want you to wear it to the match.

166
00:13:57,958 --> 00:13:59,273
If you wear it,

167
00:13:59,558 --> 00:14:01,495
you will no longer be almost famous.

168
00:14:02,043 --> 00:14:03,543
This time, you will be famous for real.

169
00:14:09,905 --> 00:14:11,656
Good luck.

170
00:14:12,512 --> 00:14:14,412
You have worked hard.

171
00:14:14,588 --> 00:14:16,071
I know you can do it.

172
00:14:21,995 --> 00:14:24,000
Thank you.

173
00:14:25,755 --> 00:14:29,457
Good luck with your audition.

174
00:14:34,042 --> 00:14:35,391
I’ve got to go.

175
00:14:59,452 --> 00:15:02,580
KLAIRUNG: DISCIPLE OF YOHAN & MALAI

176
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,564
Can you do it?

177
00:15:12,564 --> 00:15:14,654
I can do it.
