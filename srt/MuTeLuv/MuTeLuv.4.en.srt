1
00:00:00,213 --> 00:00:02,205
We only spend a few days together.
How can I make him fall for me?

2
00:00:02,205 --> 00:00:04,022
It happens all the time in dramas.

3
00:00:04,195 --> 00:00:06,359
Did you have fun spending time together?

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:07,935
I like being with you.

5
00:00:07,935 --> 00:00:09,357
Mawin is not my friend.

6
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:10,567
He's my rival.

7
00:00:11,884 --> 00:00:13,350
You are not alone, Mawin.

8
00:00:13,572 --> 00:00:14,680
Where the hell is he?

9
00:00:15,672 --> 00:00:17,232
Mangpor was right.

10
00:00:17,232 --> 00:00:19,318
A guy like me should be alone.

11
00:00:19,318 --> 00:00:21,942
I did all these
because I only see you as my schoolmate.

12
00:00:21,942 --> 00:00:22,958
Does he like me that much?

13
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:25,855
THE LAST NIGHT BEFORE THE EXAM

14
00:01:31,552 --> 00:01:33,565
Why don't you sit at the desk and study?

15
00:01:34,345 --> 00:01:35,488
I want to change the environment.

16
00:01:38,217 --> 00:01:39,637
Are you feeling shy because we kissed?

17
00:01:46,763 --> 00:01:47,568
Why are you mentioning it?

18
00:01:48,694 --> 00:01:49,999
Why not?

19
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:51,292
We did kiss.

20
00:02:03,921 --> 00:02:04,677
You are smart.

21
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,036
Smart?

22
00:02:07,209 --> 00:02:08,389
Your question is so damn hard.

23
00:02:10,295 --> 00:02:11,452
But you solved it.

24
00:02:12,492 --> 00:02:14,492
If you have a bit more confidence,

25
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:16,605
you can beat Mangpor.

26
00:02:17,536 --> 00:02:19,040
Stop overpraising me like Benz does.

27
00:02:20,253 --> 00:02:21,053
I'm not.

28
00:02:21,595 --> 00:02:22,747
Math is logic.

29
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:25,382
If you understand it, you can solve it.

30
00:02:26,465 --> 00:02:27,803
And you understand it.

31
00:02:34,366 --> 00:02:35,715
Do you really want to go?

32
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:37,978
Go where?

33
00:02:39,863 --> 00:02:40,858
Go study abroad.

34
00:02:43,782 --> 00:02:44,631
I don't know.

35
00:02:46,169 --> 00:02:47,379
I'll think about it when I get the scholarship.

36
00:02:49,523 --> 00:02:50,570
What if?

37
00:02:51,155 --> 00:02:52,678
If I submit a blank answer sheet tomorrow,

38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,047
you surely will win the scholarship.

39
00:02:57,686 --> 00:02:58,908
That's not funny, Mawin.

40
00:03:00,944 --> 00:03:02,712
Don't do that ever.

41
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,711
I won't do it.

42
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:09,653
No matter how much I like you,

43
00:03:09,978 --> 00:03:11,791
I won't submit a blank answer sheet for you.

44
00:03:13,611 --> 00:03:14,883
Then stop bothering me.

45
00:03:15,923 --> 00:03:16,752
I want to focus on studying.

46
00:03:21,561 --> 00:03:22,573
Then I'll go to bed.

47
00:03:24,826 --> 00:03:25,919
Stay with me.

48
00:03:42,391 --> 00:03:45,298
[Tomorrow is the exam day.
But I don't feel stressed at all.]

49
00:03:48,785 --> 00:03:50,878
[Thank you for listening to me all this time.]

50
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,593
[You should go to bed.]

51
00:03:58,499 --> 00:04:00,958
[Tomorrow, you will get what you want.]

52
00:04:38,934 --> 00:04:39,614
Shit.

53
00:04:39,614 --> 00:04:40,850
Mawin, wake up.

54
00:04:41,478 --> 00:04:43,079
Were you in that hurry
and forgot to wake me up?

55
00:04:47,606 --> 00:04:49,488
You are almost late for the exam.

56
00:04:49,488 --> 00:04:50,440
Give me your phone.

57
00:04:51,566 --> 00:04:53,185
Anantachai, your seat is in the front row.

58
00:04:53,467 --> 00:04:54,192
Hurry up.

59
00:05:03,722 --> 00:05:05,495
Stop looking around.

60
00:05:05,495 --> 00:05:06,806
I'm serious today.

61
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,902
I'll remind you again.

62
00:05:08,902 --> 00:05:10,133
If you break any rules,

63
00:05:10,133 --> 00:05:11,931
you'll be eliminated immediately.

64
00:05:11,931 --> 00:05:14,255
The exam consists of ten questions.

65
00:05:14,753 --> 00:05:17,322
If you need more paper for calculations,

66
00:05:18,015 --> 00:05:19,001
please raise your hand.

67
00:05:19,472 --> 00:05:23,762
You have 4.5 hours to finish the exam.

68
00:05:23,979 --> 00:05:25,225
Spend the time well.

69
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:27,428
If you have no other questions,

70
00:05:28,706 --> 00:05:30,063
you can start now.

71
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:24,078
I feel like I'm going to die.

72
00:06:24,836 --> 00:06:27,219
My soul has left my body.

73
00:06:27,978 --> 00:06:30,280
Why didn't Mawin attend the exam?

74
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,926
He's probably still in the exam room.

75
00:06:36,655 --> 00:06:37,415
No.

76
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:42,098
I mean, why didn't he come to the exam room?

77
00:06:45,477 --> 00:06:46,701
What do you mean he wasn't in the exam room?

78
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,752
He left our room before me.

79
00:06:53,864 --> 00:06:55,301
He really wasn't in the exam room.

80
00:06:56,146 --> 00:06:58,954
His seat was next to mine.

81
00:07:03,503 --> 00:07:04,698
But he wasn't there.

82
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:06,686
The teachers were looking for him everywhere.

83
00:07:35,704 --> 00:07:36,550
What's up, Benz?

84
00:07:37,763 --> 00:07:39,078
(Why don't you read my messages?)

85
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:40,248
(I got big news.)

86
00:07:41,136 --> 00:07:42,663
I'm busy. I'll call you back.

87
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:45,575
(No, you need to listen to me.)

88
00:07:45,878 --> 00:07:50,828
(Seer TK, whom you've been chatting with,
is Mawin, your roommate at the camp.)

89
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,802
[Tomorrow, you will get what you want.]

90
00:08:07,795 --> 00:08:10,060
Is this what you chose?

91
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:24,203
No one can reach him even now?

92
00:08:26,174 --> 00:08:27,789
The teachers checked the CCTV.

93
00:08:27,789 --> 00:08:31,289
He left the hotel when we were taking the exam.

94
00:08:31,982 --> 00:08:33,237
What's wrong with him?

95
00:08:33,844 --> 00:08:35,217
He seemed fine yesterday.

96
00:08:35,824 --> 00:08:38,382
Err, you didn't fight with him, right?

97
00:08:41,977 --> 00:08:44,460
We've got to go.

98
00:08:45,782 --> 00:08:47,940
Mr. Mhee. Mr. Err. Get home safely.

99
00:08:49,846 --> 00:08:50,853
Let's meet up for a meal sometimes.

100
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:54,259
Come on.

101
00:09:00,822 --> 00:09:01,495
See you.

102
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:40,247
How was the exam?

103
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,874
It was so hard. I didn't do well.

104
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:47,751
Hey! Err, my friend.

105
00:09:47,751 --> 00:09:48,574
Stop playing around.

106
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:49,853
I'm not in the mood.

107
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:11,076
How was the camp?

108
00:10:11,857 --> 00:10:13,344
Mhee told me that

109
00:10:13,582 --> 00:10:15,506
you were one of the aces in the camp.

110
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:18,927
See? My friend is the best.

111
00:10:21,093 --> 00:10:22,714
That guy is Mawin.

112
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:24,037
Is he crazy?

113
00:10:24,037 --> 00:10:25,857
Why did he pretend to be the fortune teller?

114
00:10:25,857 --> 00:10:28,501
People consulted him on their problems.

115
00:10:28,869 --> 00:10:30,473
That's why everyone is scolding him.

116
00:10:30,473 --> 00:10:31,228
It serves him right.

117
00:10:31,445 --> 00:10:32,346
Suck it.

118
00:10:32,346 --> 00:10:33,151
Yeah.

119
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:41,688
Err.

120
00:10:42,576 --> 00:10:45,259
Everyone in the school is talking about Mawin.

121
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,347
(Did you see posts
of the football team members on Facebook?)

122
00:10:54,347 --> 00:10:55,607
(They all scolded him.)

123
00:10:55,607 --> 00:10:56,972
(If I were them, I would do it too.)

124
00:10:56,972 --> 00:10:59,000
(He did hurt their feelings.)

125
00:10:59,786 --> 00:11:03,536
(But at least, he didn't charge them any fees
for the advice.)

126
00:11:03,536 --> 00:11:06,050
(Otherwise, things could be worse.)

127
00:11:08,151 --> 00:11:10,205
Do you still have Seer TK's contact?

128
00:11:10,552 --> 00:11:11,938
I want to contact him.

129
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,870
Just leave him alone.

130
00:11:15,347 --> 00:11:16,713
I feel bad for him.

131
00:11:16,713 --> 00:11:17,723
Everyone is scolding him.

132
00:11:18,243 --> 00:11:20,209
I just want to tease him.

133
00:11:20,382 --> 00:11:22,815
I think he no longer uses the account.

134
00:11:26,237 --> 00:11:27,713
What's up with you?

135
00:11:28,644 --> 00:11:31,068
Before you went to the camp,
you two just didn't get along.

136
00:11:32,584 --> 00:11:35,679
But when you came back from the camp,
it looks like you hate each other.

137
00:11:36,632 --> 00:11:40,926
Mhee told me that he's not a bad person.

138
00:12:04,678 --> 00:12:05,429
We need to talk.

139
00:12:24,309 --> 00:12:25,464
Don't you feel anything?

140
00:12:27,392 --> 00:12:28,995
After hearing other students talk about you.

141
00:12:34,584 --> 00:12:36,362
What the hell is wrong with you?

142
00:12:37,467 --> 00:12:38,509
Just say what you are thinking.

143
00:12:41,671 --> 00:12:43,214
Will they listen to me if I tell them?

144
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,227
I have a right to be mad at you, right?

145
00:12:52,068 --> 00:12:52,706
Yes.

146
00:12:55,738 --> 00:12:57,546
Aren't you going to explain yourself?

147
00:12:57,871 --> 00:13:00,252
What you think, how you feel.

148
00:13:01,097 --> 00:13:02,177
Aren't you going to tell me?

149
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:08,373
I've told you everything, Err.

150
00:13:09,304 --> 00:13:10,956
What I think, how I feel.

151
00:13:12,386 --> 00:13:13,806
I've told you everything.

152
00:13:16,145 --> 00:13:17,248
You think it's enough?

153
00:13:18,504 --> 00:13:19,595
To make up for what I feel right now.

154
00:13:21,437 --> 00:13:22,709
You lied to me.

155
00:13:23,575 --> 00:13:24,596
Do you think I'm stupid?

156
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:25,936
Do you think you can fool me?

157
00:13:26,283 --> 00:13:27,555
Do you think you're smarter than me?

158
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,273
You know that's not what I think.

159
00:13:31,096 --> 00:13:32,366
Then why did you do that?

160
00:13:35,421 --> 00:13:36,780
You skipped the exam.

161
00:13:36,953 --> 00:13:38,200
Why the hell did you do that, Mawin?

162
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:41,212
Did you want to be a hero?

163
00:13:41,212 --> 00:13:43,227
If you skipped the exam,
I would have a higher chance of getting it.

164
00:13:43,227 --> 00:13:43,898
Is that what you think?

165
00:13:45,089 --> 00:13:46,504
What kind of friend are you?

166
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:58,455
Are you regretting being my friend?

167
00:14:07,976 --> 00:14:09,260
Then you can do whatever you want.

168
00:14:32,766 --> 00:14:35,167
(We have only one month left
before graduating from high school.)

169
00:14:37,933 --> 00:14:40,278
(We both went back to our normal lives.)

170
00:14:41,072 --> 00:14:43,022
(As if nothing happened at the camp.)

171
00:14:44,568 --> 00:14:45,395
Why? Is it not good?

172
00:14:46,656 --> 00:14:47,646
You know it, right?

173
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:48,708
FINAL EXAM OF 2ND SEMESTER OF 2024

174
00:14:48,871 --> 00:14:50,538
(We are just two horses
competing in the same race.)

175
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:53,165
(We just need to do our job.)

176
00:14:59,287 --> 00:15:05,768
We have spent the last six years together
at this school.

177
00:15:05,768 --> 00:15:08,351
(We completely live separate lives.)

178
00:15:10,222 --> 00:15:12,492
(I don't know what's going on in his life.)

179
00:15:19,346 --> 00:15:20,233
We are going to college.

180
00:15:20,233 --> 00:15:21,011
Aren't you happy?

181
00:15:21,255 --> 00:15:22,192
We graduated from high school.

182
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,914
(I don't want to know either.)

183
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:26,523
What are you going to study?

184
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:28,863
You will go to the same college?

185
00:15:29,473 --> 00:15:31,123
(Does the scholarship result come out?)

186
00:15:31,266 --> 00:15:32,901
(What's wrong with your internet, Mhee?)

187
00:15:33,069 --> 00:15:34,296
(We can't connect to the internet.)

188
00:15:34,296 --> 00:15:36,018
(Err, refresh the page.)

189
00:15:36,262 --> 00:15:37,330
(Shit, the result is out.)

190
00:15:38,144 --> 00:15:40,045
(What? Is it out?)

191
00:15:42,324 --> 00:15:42,987
Damn!

192
00:15:43,861 --> 00:15:45,219
THE WINNER IS ANANTACHAI KRAIKAEW.

193
00:15:45,382 --> 00:15:46,398
I got it.

194
00:15:49,286 --> 00:15:50,114
Well done.

195
00:15:51,069 --> 00:15:52,742
Good job.

196
00:15:53,067 --> 00:15:53,936
Whose son is this?

197
00:15:53,936 --> 00:15:54,786
I'm your son.

198
00:15:55,945 --> 00:15:57,096
(I need to move on.)

199
00:15:58,866 --> 00:16:02,723
Yay!

200
00:16:03,537 --> 00:16:04,869
Let's go celebrate at my house next time.

201
00:16:04,869 --> 00:16:06,683
I'll steal a bottle of my dad's booze.

202
00:16:06,683 --> 00:16:07,533
He won't notice it.

203
00:16:08,387 --> 00:16:09,096
Sure.

204
00:16:09,198 --> 00:16:10,472
How about the first week of next month?

205
00:16:10,676 --> 00:16:12,067
After my college admission is announced.

206
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:14,576
Are you so confident that you will get in?

207
00:16:15,369 --> 00:16:16,389
Hey!

208
00:16:16,633 --> 00:16:18,381
Don't underestimate me.

209
00:16:18,381 --> 00:16:20,402
I'm also a student in the gifted class.

210
00:16:22,253 --> 00:16:23,864
If you're going to celebrate next month,

211
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:24,964
I can't make it.

212
00:16:25,432 --> 00:16:27,021
Doesn't your school start in August?

213
00:16:27,163 --> 00:16:27,832
Why are you leaving so soon?

214
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:29,799
I need to take an English course first.

215
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:30,996
I'm leaving at the end of this month.

216
00:16:32,054 --> 00:16:33,962
Why are you hurry to move to Boston?

217
00:16:34,186 --> 00:16:35,107
We only have two weeks left.

218
00:16:36,388 --> 00:16:38,038
My friend is a real deal.

219
00:16:38,384 --> 00:16:39,711
Only one student across the country is selected.

220
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,376
But you got it.

221
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,186
True.

222
00:16:44,101 --> 00:16:46,155
Who would have thought
that you could beat Mangpor?

223
00:16:46,379 --> 00:16:47,073
Unbelievable.

224
00:16:47,724 --> 00:16:50,511
Are you talking about the tough girl
you met the other day?

225
00:16:52,749 --> 00:16:53,553
Mhee.

226
00:16:54,285 --> 00:16:57,332
Why did you meet up with Mangpor?

227
00:16:58,776 --> 00:16:59,725
Mhee.

228
00:17:00,803 --> 00:17:01,513
Benz.

229
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:03,483
You ruin my surprise.

230
00:17:05,273 --> 00:17:07,404
Give me your picture that I asked for.

231
00:17:07,404 --> 00:17:08,080
Here.

232
00:17:11,782 --> 00:17:12,978
What are you doing?

233
00:17:13,629 --> 00:17:15,113
It fits perfectly.

234
00:17:15,113 --> 00:17:16,214
You two are unbelievable.

235
00:17:17,048 --> 00:17:18,403
One, two, three.

236
00:17:18,973 --> 00:17:20,693
Tada!

237
00:17:21,913 --> 00:17:23,943
Mangpor and Ton came to Bangkok.

238
00:17:24,024 --> 00:17:25,448
They gave this to me.

239
00:17:25,631 --> 00:17:27,089
They worked so hard to make it.

240
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:29,999
They sent it across the country.

241
00:17:30,324 --> 00:17:30,857
Look.

242
00:17:32,149 --> 00:17:34,611
Only Mawin's message is missing.

243
00:17:35,445 --> 00:17:37,032
No one has his address.

244
00:17:37,174 --> 00:17:39,218
We can't ask the teachers for it
since it's personal information.

245
00:17:39,502 --> 00:17:41,116
He doesn't use any social media.

246
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:44,156
I asked our classmates.

247
00:17:44,827 --> 00:17:46,732
After the school semester ended,

248
00:17:46,935 --> 00:17:48,732
no one can contact him.

249
00:17:49,729 --> 00:17:51,936
We don't have his chat account.

250
00:17:52,567 --> 00:17:54,603
We only have Seer TK's account.

251
00:17:54,684 --> 00:17:56,583
He doesn't use the account anymore.

252
00:18:02,278 --> 00:18:05,308
But it still looks pretty. Look.

253
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,912
I have something to tell you.

254
00:18:09,069 --> 00:18:11,926
No, I have a gossip to share with you.

255
00:18:11,926 --> 00:18:12,574
What is it?

256
00:18:12,574 --> 00:18:15,222
Ton was my roommate.

257
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:16,727
I barely got any sleep.

258
00:18:17,113 --> 00:18:18,699
He cried every night.

259
00:18:18,699 --> 00:18:20,833
Because he missed his grandma and buffalo.

260
00:18:21,301 --> 00:18:22,175
Why?

261
00:18:22,358 --> 00:18:24,681
He suddenly cried
because he missed his grandma.

262
00:18:24,681 --> 00:18:26,123
I don't know why.

263
00:18:37,941 --> 00:18:38,626
Hey.

264
00:18:39,196 --> 00:18:41,546
When will you finish packing?

265
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:44,753
I have another ten days before I leave.

266
00:18:44,753 --> 00:18:45,903
I'll do it later.

267
00:18:49,524 --> 00:18:53,699
My other son is also following his dream.

268
00:18:55,245 --> 00:19:00,256
Do you think
getting the scholarship was his dream?

269
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:04,848
It was his dream at the time.

270
00:19:04,848 --> 00:19:06,932
But I still considered it his dream.

271
00:19:07,109 --> 00:19:11,446
Even now, he chose to open an online shop
after graduating.

272
00:19:14,192 --> 00:19:21,295
Have you wanted me or my brother
to be a smart researcher like Dad?

273
00:19:22,516 --> 00:19:23,871
No matter how smart he was,

274
00:19:24,169 --> 00:19:27,059
he died when you were only 10.

275
00:19:28,381 --> 00:19:29,684
I've never had that kind of plan.

276
00:19:30,091 --> 00:19:32,082
You can do whatever you want.

277
00:19:33,201 --> 00:19:37,042
If I refuse to go to America,
aren't you going to scold me?

278
00:19:37,347 --> 00:19:39,613
Why would I scold you?

279
00:19:41,545 --> 00:19:43,513
I just want to hold a celebratory party.

280
00:19:43,798 --> 00:19:46,697
Everyone tells me that I'm lucky.

281
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:49,801
Both my sons are excellent students.

282
00:19:51,069 --> 00:19:52,971
Stay still.

283
00:19:55,493 --> 00:19:56,795
But you know this, right?

284
00:19:57,873 --> 00:20:00,027
I feel proudest

285
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:04,222
when I see you and your brother are happy.

286
00:20:08,087 --> 00:20:09,382
There.

287
00:20:10,175 --> 00:20:13,616
There it is, ingrown hair.

288
00:20:13,616 --> 00:20:14,934
Look.

289
00:20:15,605 --> 00:20:17,513
What shampoo do you use?

290
00:20:17,513 --> 00:20:18,900
It hurts, Mom.

291
00:20:19,876 --> 00:20:21,391
Finish your packing.

292
00:20:33,069 --> 00:20:34,087
Clear tape.

293
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:06,885
(Fate likes to play a joke on me.)

294
00:21:08,024 --> 00:21:10,419
(When I thought
I was the smartest guy in the world,)

295
00:21:11,578 --> 00:21:12,845
(I found out…)

296
00:21:13,821 --> 00:21:16,767
(how clueless I am.)

297
00:21:35,879 --> 00:21:38,400
(You probably find this letter
after finishing the exam.)

298
00:21:38,888 --> 00:21:39,988
(That's a good thing.)

299
00:21:40,395 --> 00:21:42,130
(So you can focus on the exam.)

300
00:21:42,415 --> 00:21:44,967
(I'm not sure
how you will feel about my decision.)

301
00:21:45,292 --> 00:21:46,531
(But I want to explain myself.)

302
00:21:47,263 --> 00:21:48,418
(I want you to understand me.)

303
00:21:53,381 --> 00:21:56,230
Mawin is joining our class starting today.

304
00:21:57,226 --> 00:22:00,503
Please be nice to your new classmate.

305
00:22:01,805 --> 00:22:05,253
[Firstly, I'm Seer TK.]

306
00:22:08,284 --> 00:22:10,235
[You know I don't know how to make friends.]

307
00:22:11,354 --> 00:22:12,725
Does anyone know the answer?

308
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,642
The new student.

309
00:22:16,147 --> 00:22:16,953
What is the answer?

310
00:22:20,757 --> 00:22:21,647
68.

311
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:26,689
68.

312
00:22:28,581 --> 00:22:30,322
(No one wants to talk to me.)

313
00:22:31,726 --> 00:22:32,651
(But you know what.)

314
00:22:32,936 --> 00:22:35,891
(Being left alone gives me a special power.)

315
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:38,685
(You can say that I'm being nosy.)

316
00:22:39,069 --> 00:22:43,602
(But when I sit quietly,
I can hear other people clearly.)

317
00:22:43,602 --> 00:22:45,180
There's only you and me this evening.

318
00:22:45,973 --> 00:22:46,945
Pam bails on us again.

319
00:22:47,962 --> 00:22:48,798
She said she's sick.

320
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:51,352
I guess she wants to study without us.

321
00:22:51,494 --> 00:22:54,227
She also got full scores
on the chemistry quiz last time.

322
00:23:03,644 --> 00:23:08,547
(For many problems,
all they need to do is talk to each other.)

323
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:11,172
It's bad to watch him waste his talents.

324
00:23:12,006 --> 00:23:14,249
The principal is worried
about the school's image.

325
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:16,072
His grades are not good.

326
00:23:17,251 --> 00:23:19,549
(I don't have the courage
to walk in and give them advice.)

327
00:23:19,997 --> 00:23:21,596
(I'm afraid that they will tell me
to mind my own business.)

328
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:26,274
[I want to be drafted into a football team.
What do I do?]

329
00:23:26,274 --> 00:23:28,586
[Study hard and dress neatly.]

330
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:32,330
[What? I want to be on the football team.
They don't care about my grades.]

331
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:33,582
[Talk politely.]

332
00:23:35,596 --> 00:23:37,995
(So I created the fortune teller's account.)

333
00:23:38,422 --> 00:23:40,560
(My advice has nothing to do
with fortune-telling.)

334
00:23:40,723 --> 00:23:44,605
(I only tell them what they need to do
based on the stories I heard.)

335
00:23:51,927 --> 00:23:53,563
You have gastritis, Pam?

336
00:23:54,234 --> 00:23:55,062
Why didn't you tell me?

337
00:23:56,221 --> 00:23:58,578
If I didn't go to the infirmary,
I would never know you're sick.

338
00:23:58,781 --> 00:24:00,276
Why did you go to the infirmary?

339
00:24:01,029 --> 00:24:02,211
I went to get an herbal balm.

340
00:24:02,699 --> 00:24:04,211
Anyway.

341
00:24:04,269 --> 00:24:07,833
[My friend only cares about studying.
We are drifting apart.]

342
00:24:08,097 --> 00:24:09,547
[Fix it with an herbal balm.]

343
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:12,537
Are you sick?

344
00:24:12,537 --> 00:24:14,637
No, I just went there to get an herbal balm.

345
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:21,456
Let's try again.

346
00:24:26,948 --> 00:24:28,898
It hurts. Be careful with your serving.

347
00:24:28,898 --> 00:24:29,618
Fine.

348
00:24:31,632 --> 00:24:33,405
(I just wanted to help you.)

349
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:35,520
(I didn't mean to lie to you.)

350
00:24:35,927 --> 00:24:37,099
What kind of answer is this?

351
00:24:38,238 --> 00:24:43,265
He told you how to pick a good partner.

352
00:24:43,509 --> 00:24:44,850
How does that have anything to do with focus?

353
00:24:47,494 --> 00:24:50,642
Hey, look there.

354
00:24:50,642 --> 00:24:51,595
Come on.

355
00:24:51,639 --> 00:24:52,626
Come on, Err.

356
00:24:59,447 --> 00:25:00,090
Hey.

357
00:25:02,734 --> 00:25:04,061
Do you want to be my partner
for the badminton test?

358
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:07,301
(But you misinterpreted my advice.)

359
00:25:10,393 --> 00:25:11,857
(I had everything planned out.)

360
00:25:12,366 --> 00:25:16,229
(But spending twelve days with you at the camp
was not a part of my plan.)

361
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:44,340
(Who would have thought
you would interpret my advice in that way?)

362
00:25:45,154 --> 00:25:47,536
(I only told you to be nice to people around you.)

363
00:25:47,821 --> 00:25:49,337
(So you would have fun at the camp.)

364
00:25:49,622 --> 00:25:51,772
(I didn't tell you to make me fall for you.)

365
00:25:54,925 --> 00:25:56,047
(But you know it, right?)

366
00:25:58,109 --> 00:25:59,983
(You barely need to do anything.)

367
00:26:00,512 --> 00:26:03,504
(I already fell for you in just a few days.)

368
00:26:06,738 --> 00:26:07,855
(I like you.)

369
00:26:09,645 --> 00:26:12,938
(Even though the advice said otherwise,
I would still fall for you.)

370
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:13,701
Stop it.

371
00:26:13,701 --> 00:26:14,529
You started it.

372
00:26:28,331 --> 00:26:32,104
(You'll probably be mad at me
for skipping the exam.)

373
00:26:32,694 --> 00:26:34,810
(You told me that we are only 18.)

374
00:26:34,973 --> 00:26:36,920
(There are plenty of things waiting for us to try.)

375
00:26:37,368 --> 00:26:39,646
(I don't want to waste my time
on doing something I don't want to do.)

376
00:26:40,109 --> 00:26:43,320
(I didn't do this for you or anyone.)

377
00:26:43,971 --> 00:26:48,272
(I found what I like and want to do
because of you.)

378
00:26:48,699 --> 00:26:50,497
(I'm sorry if this will upset you.)

379
00:26:50,965 --> 00:26:54,640
(I hope you will understand me,
and things will not change between us.)

380
00:26:55,789 --> 00:26:57,703
(Because my feelings for you have not changed.)

381
00:27:11,607 --> 00:27:12,381
Dead, dead.

382
00:27:13,801 --> 00:27:15,329
Shit, I'm dead.

383
00:27:26,544 --> 00:27:29,117
The plant doesn't give me any good energy.

384
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:58,034
(Next is the news we need to talk about.)

385
00:27:58,034 --> 00:28:02,262
(A young actor is caught having an affair.)

386
00:28:02,827 --> 00:28:05,923
(Pilapia are different from other fish, Jirat.)

387
00:28:05,923 --> 00:28:10,299
(In my hometown, we need monks to perform
a ritual before we build a pond for them.)

388
00:28:10,299 --> 00:28:13,504
(When it's time to switch classrooms,
my friends usually don't wait for me, Tle.)

389
00:28:13,504 --> 00:28:14,375
(What should I do?)

390
00:28:14,375 --> 00:28:17,037
(Does it make you feel lonely or what?)

391
00:28:17,037 --> 00:28:18,389
Do you remember this?

392
00:28:21,442 --> 00:28:23,677
Wow!

393
00:28:26,798 --> 00:28:29,747
You look amazing.

394
00:28:34,183 --> 00:28:36,281
Thank you.

395
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:39,052
What the…why do you look surprised?

396
00:28:39,052 --> 00:28:40,888
This is my everyday look.

397
00:28:40,888 --> 00:28:42,027
This is just my nightwear.

398
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,237
Stop teasing me.

399
00:28:46,346 --> 00:28:48,852
Welcome to the class, students.

400
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:51,363
This is a conversational class.

401
00:28:51,363 --> 00:28:56,476
This class will be like talking
with your siblings or friends in English.

402
00:28:56,476 --> 00:28:59,547
Before your semester begins
in the next two months.

403
00:28:59,547 --> 00:29:03,504
From what I know,
most of you are high school graduates.

404
00:29:03,626 --> 00:29:10,230
I want to know the school or the major
you want to study in college.

405
00:29:11,962 --> 00:29:12,878
I'm Boy.

406
00:29:12,878 --> 00:29:13,907
I'm from Thepmongkol School.

407
00:29:13,907 --> 00:29:15,276
I want to study Architecture.

408
00:29:16,832 --> 00:29:18,278
An architect wannabe.

409
00:29:26,878 --> 00:29:28,140
I'm Mawin.

410
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:29,202
I graduated from Baromavidya.

411
00:29:29,886 --> 00:29:31,642
I'm waiting for the result of my application
to the School of Communication Arts.

412
00:29:31,885 --> 00:29:32,522
Communication Arts.

413
00:29:32,583 --> 00:29:33,907
Everyone, calm down.

414
00:29:33,907 --> 00:29:35,704
Don't be surprised.

415
00:29:35,886 --> 00:29:41,107
Most people expect Baromavidya kids
to attend a medical school.

416
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,541
Not all of us.

417
00:29:43,754 --> 00:29:44,580
I…

418
00:29:44,899 --> 00:29:45,762
I want to be a DJ.

419
00:29:48,482 --> 00:29:50,369
You must be smart
since you studied at Baromavidya.

420
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:52,386
I'm Boy.

421
00:29:53,769 --> 00:29:55,732
I already introduced myself.

422
00:29:56,249 --> 00:29:57,386
Can I talk casually to you?

423
00:29:57,553 --> 00:29:58,227
Do you mind?

424
00:29:58,907 --> 00:29:59,648
No.

425
00:30:01,076 --> 00:30:02,507
I got a new friend.

426
00:30:02,735 --> 00:30:03,686
Your time is over.

427
00:30:03,686 --> 00:30:04,186
Move.

428
00:30:04,292 --> 00:30:05,825
Hey, I'm Film.

429
00:30:05,977 --> 00:30:07,117
I'm going to study communications arts too.

430
00:30:07,466 --> 00:30:08,115
Really?

431
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:09,910
I'm waiting for the admission result.

432
00:30:10,229 --> 00:30:11,179
I didn't pass the portfolio admission.

433
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:12,198
I'm so sad.

434
00:30:13,398 --> 00:30:14,631
Do you want to grab something to eat after class?

435
00:30:17,487 --> 00:30:18,140
Good.

436
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:19,697
Boy will buy us a meal on the first day.

437
00:30:21,216 --> 00:30:21,943
I'm going.

438
00:30:21,943 --> 00:30:22,632
Thank you.

439
00:30:33,689 --> 00:30:34,189
Hey.

440
00:30:34,736 --> 00:30:35,898
Shall we visit a temple to pray to the gods?

441
00:30:38,237 --> 00:30:38,995
Good idea.

442
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:40,320
Shall we go swimming too?

443
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:42,524
Dipping into the water may help clear your head.

444
00:30:43,526 --> 00:30:44,624
I don't want to go out.

445
00:30:45,809 --> 00:30:47,174
Let me recap the situation.

446
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:49,374
Right now, you feel down

447
00:30:49,921 --> 00:30:52,926
because you found out the truth
after scolding him.

448
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:58,155
You feel bad and embarrassed.

449
00:30:58,397 --> 00:31:00,693
Because you acted crazy and unhinged
towards him.

450
00:31:00,876 --> 00:31:01,402
Am I right?

451
00:31:06,688 --> 00:31:09,312
Are you my friend or enemy?

452
00:31:11,909 --> 00:31:14,624
We should have parted on good terms.

453
00:31:15,171 --> 00:31:18,186
Instead, we ended things with hard feelings
because of my foolishness.

454
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,530
You are not foolish.

455
00:31:19,864 --> 00:31:20,947
You are the smartest.

456
00:31:24,228 --> 00:31:25,994
Open your mouth.

457
00:31:30,962 --> 00:31:32,449
How long are you going to stay at my house?

458
00:31:35,047 --> 00:31:37,060
You are leaving in three days.

459
00:31:37,637 --> 00:31:39,557
We want to spend time with you.

460
00:31:42,185 --> 00:31:43,883
I'm leaving in a few days.

461
00:31:44,707 --> 00:31:46,785
But I still don't know what to do with this.

462
00:31:49,823 --> 00:31:51,479
If you are so in love with Mawin,

463
00:31:51,844 --> 00:31:53,352
Why don't you cancel your plan
to go to America?

464
00:31:54,856 --> 00:31:55,556
Are you crazy?

465
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,546
I worked hard to get the scholarship.

466
00:31:59,673 --> 00:32:02,043
What the hell is wrong with you?

467
00:32:02,575 --> 00:32:04,118
You shoot down all of our suggestions.

468
00:32:05,455 --> 00:32:06,154
How about this?

469
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:08,063
You should apologize to him.

470
00:32:08,147 --> 00:32:09,192
That's right.

471
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:11,661
Are you going to apologize to him or us?

472
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:13,476
I'm getting tired of comforting you.

473
00:32:13,734 --> 00:32:15,464
Now, I start to feel upset.

474
00:32:15,464 --> 00:32:17,077
Right. You're getting annoying.

475
00:32:17,517 --> 00:32:18,017
True.

476
00:32:33,307 --> 00:32:36,350
[The shabu soup had tons of MSG.]

477
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:37,948
[I drank eight liters of water already.]

478
00:32:37,948 --> 00:32:39,149
[I'll be going to the bathroom all night.]

479
00:32:52,325 --> 00:32:53,466
SEER TK.

480
00:32:53,466 --> 00:32:54,591
ERR.

481
00:32:59,848 --> 00:33:02,628
[How do I start a convo with someone?]

482
00:33:02,885 --> 00:33:04,933
[If I want to make up with someone,
what should I do?]

483
00:33:05,207 --> 00:33:06,746
[Seer, I have nothing to update today.]

484
00:33:07,034 --> 00:33:09,361
[I suddenly have this confidence.]

485
00:33:09,482 --> 00:33:10,112
[I can do it.]

486
00:33:11,783 --> 00:33:13,542
[Tomorrow is the exam day.
But I don't feel stressed at all.]

487
00:33:13,542 --> 00:33:16,472
[Thank you for listening to me all this time.]

488
00:33:23,315 --> 00:33:26,023
[How could you do this to me, Mawin?]

489
00:34:00,934 --> 00:34:02,290
[Can you come to meet me tomorrow?]

490
00:34:11,956 --> 00:34:13,378
Hold on, Merlin.

491
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,642
How can you be sure that you can trust him?

492
00:34:20,656 --> 00:34:23,694
Because I see your true color.

493
00:34:23,694 --> 00:34:24,865
Reveal yourself.

494
00:34:24,865 --> 00:34:25,365
No.

495
00:34:25,905 --> 00:34:26,755
Assassin.

496
00:34:26,921 --> 00:34:27,565
No!

497
00:34:44,534 --> 00:34:45,388
How are you doing?

498
00:34:46,406 --> 00:34:47,116
Good.

499
00:34:47,781 --> 00:34:48,286
You?

500
00:34:49,201 --> 00:34:49,860
Good.

501
00:34:52,146 --> 00:34:53,327
Actually, not so good.

502
00:34:56,673 --> 00:34:57,708
I read your letter.

503
00:34:58,456 --> 00:35:00,373
I found it a few days ago.

504
00:35:03,137 --> 00:35:05,176
Why didn't you tell me
you wrote me a touching letter?

505
00:35:05,176 --> 00:35:06,099
How would I know about it?

506
00:35:06,099 --> 00:35:07,408
I put the notebook away when I got home.

507
00:35:07,408 --> 00:35:09,222
But you always took the notebook
with you everywhere.

508
00:35:09,222 --> 00:35:09,940
Are you crazy?

509
00:35:10,266 --> 00:35:11,654
Why would I take it with me
when the exam was over?

510
00:35:11,706 --> 00:35:14,172
Then you should have told me that
you wouldn't take it with you after the exam.

511
00:35:14,172 --> 00:35:14,846
So this is my fault?

512
00:35:15,095 --> 00:35:16,396
You just read it?

513
00:35:16,666 --> 00:35:17,889
I wrote a long letter to you.

514
00:35:18,928 --> 00:35:20,173
Why didn't you tell me about it?

515
00:35:20,173 --> 00:35:22,124
Why did you let me berate you like a mad dog?

516
00:35:22,124 --> 00:35:24,357
I thought you'd read the letter,
but you were still mad at me.

517
00:35:24,523 --> 00:35:25,661
So I didn't want to interrupt you.

518
00:35:25,661 --> 00:35:27,087
Among all the people I know,

519
00:35:27,087 --> 00:35:28,266
you are the smartest.

520
00:35:28,266 --> 00:35:29,073
How can you act like a fool about this?

521
00:35:29,073 --> 00:35:29,922
This is driving me crazy.

522
00:35:29,922 --> 00:35:32,382
Yes, it's driving me crazy, too.

523
00:35:41,586 --> 00:35:42,833
You know that I got the scholarship, right?

524
00:35:44,386 --> 00:35:45,411
I'm leaving for Boston.

525
00:35:45,951 --> 00:35:47,179
Why Boston?

526
00:35:47,803 --> 00:35:48,426
Do you like the city?

527
00:35:50,629 --> 00:35:51,309
I don't know.

528
00:35:51,642 --> 00:35:53,302
I did some research on the internet.

529
00:35:54,009 --> 00:35:55,463
My grades passed their qualifications.

530
00:35:55,712 --> 00:35:56,850
I don't know if I will like it or not.

531
00:35:57,183 --> 00:35:57,944
I'll go and give it a try.

532
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,297
Who knows,
I might run back home after a month.

533
00:36:02,604 --> 00:36:03,302
What about you?

534
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:04,463
What have you been doing?

535
00:36:04,962 --> 00:36:06,681
I'm taking an English course.

536
00:36:09,507 --> 00:36:10,219
Why?

537
00:36:10,593 --> 00:36:12,588
So I can speak English.

538
00:36:13,586 --> 00:36:15,350
In case I get a call from Boston.

539
00:36:22,999 --> 00:36:24,153
I'm leaving tomorrow night.

540
00:36:25,421 --> 00:36:26,844
I have one free day today.

541
00:36:29,691 --> 00:36:31,069
Can I spend it with you?

542
00:36:31,942 --> 00:36:33,105
I have to attend a class.

543
00:36:36,451 --> 00:36:37,492
Why don't you come with me?

544
00:36:50,585 --> 00:36:51,544
Are you sure I'm allowed to be in the class?

545
00:36:52,266 --> 00:36:52,957
Yes,

546
00:36:53,061 --> 00:36:55,225
I can invite a friend to sit in on the class.

547
00:36:56,264 --> 00:36:58,928
Hello.

548
00:36:58,928 --> 00:37:00,447
Applaud.

549
00:37:01,091 --> 00:37:04,355
When I walk into the class,
you need to give me a round of applause.

550
00:37:04,771 --> 00:37:08,429
I was told there's a sit-in student today.

551
00:37:08,429 --> 00:37:09,641
Where are you?

552
00:37:14,153 --> 00:37:15,995
There you are.

553
00:37:16,266 --> 00:37:18,573
Please introduce yourself, the new student.

554
00:37:18,968 --> 00:37:21,249
Hello, I'm Anantachai.

555
00:37:22,164 --> 00:37:23,639
No.

556
00:37:24,117 --> 00:37:25,666
Just tell me your nickname.

557
00:37:25,666 --> 00:37:27,145
I can't remember your first name anyway.

558
00:37:27,665 --> 00:37:28,443
I'm Err.

559
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:30,895
I graduated from Baromavidya School.

560
00:37:32,391 --> 00:37:34,586
Another Baromavidya student.

561
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:36,199
Err, can I ask you something?

562
00:37:36,386 --> 00:37:40,387
Is it true that
Baromavidya students study 20 hours a day?

563
00:37:40,657 --> 00:37:44,552
Is it true that they can solve complicated math
without a calculator?

564
00:37:44,822 --> 00:37:45,550
Isn't it something anyone can do?

565
00:37:47,275 --> 00:37:49,413
Students from Baromavidya are super smart.

566
00:37:51,595 --> 00:37:54,639
He's going to study abroad tomorrow.

567
00:37:55,657 --> 00:37:59,437
I invited him
so he can get used to the language.

568
00:37:59,666 --> 00:38:00,704
Where will you study?

569
00:38:02,034 --> 00:38:03,018
Massachusetts.

570
00:38:03,163 --> 00:38:05,122
Oh, Massachusetts.

571
00:38:05,247 --> 00:38:07,466
Why do you all look confused?

572
00:38:07,466 --> 00:38:08,251
Good.

573
00:38:08,251 --> 00:38:10,720
Let's get back to our lesson.

574
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,123
The class is going a bit faster today.

575
00:38:13,123 --> 00:38:18,293
Because Err needs to go back
and pack his bag.

576
00:38:25,943 --> 00:38:26,871
See you.

577
00:38:27,037 --> 00:38:29,040
Err, good luck. Have a safe flight.

578
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,193
See you.

579
00:38:31,544 --> 00:38:32,119
See you.

580
00:38:36,775 --> 00:38:37,595
Where are we going next?

581
00:38:38,343 --> 00:38:39,755
What do you usually do after class?

582
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:41,158
I usually go to have a meal with them.

583
00:38:42,031 --> 00:38:43,374
So you will have a meal with me today.

584
00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:45,276
Sure.

585
00:38:50,347 --> 00:38:51,285
You are getting better.

586
00:38:51,626 --> 00:38:52,574
You made new friends.

587
00:38:54,881 --> 00:38:56,537
Did you become an extrovert?

588
00:39:01,151 --> 00:39:02,566
They are friendly.

589
00:39:02,566 --> 00:39:03,731
So I'm not afraid to approach them.

590
00:39:04,833 --> 00:39:06,445
If everyone in the class were like Mangpor,

591
00:39:07,505 --> 00:39:08,859
I would sit alone and talk to no one.

592
00:39:11,436 --> 00:39:12,644
Since you mention her, I start to miss them.

593
00:39:13,413 --> 00:39:14,688
Luckily, I follow them on IG.

594
00:39:16,642 --> 00:39:18,520
You should use social media too.

595
00:39:19,164 --> 00:39:20,502
It's not bad to post a photo once in a while.

596
00:39:22,019 --> 00:39:23,627
Do you often post photos on social media?

597
00:39:25,394 --> 00:39:27,887
Every day, I post a story on IG.

598
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,016
I have to try to remember the password.

599
00:39:32,325 --> 00:39:34,289
Why? Are you going to follow me?

600
00:39:36,388 --> 00:39:37,339
Can't I do that?

601
00:39:38,254 --> 00:39:39,796
So I can see you often.

602
00:39:44,182 --> 00:39:45,681
I can call you.

603
00:39:48,071 --> 00:39:48,918
Every day?

604
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:54,451
I won't even call my mom every day.

605
00:39:57,444 --> 00:39:58,552
What about me?

606
00:39:59,467 --> 00:40:00,464
Will you call me every day?

607
00:40:08,793 --> 00:40:10,166
Have you been to America?

608
00:40:10,748 --> 00:40:11,499
No.

609
00:40:12,185 --> 00:40:13,546
But I know that it's very far from here.

610
00:40:14,918 --> 00:40:17,820
It will be the farthest country I've been to.

611
00:40:20,875 --> 00:40:21,957
To be honest, I'm scared.

612
00:40:23,059 --> 00:40:24,398
I'm going to live alone abroad.

613
00:40:27,412 --> 00:40:29,167
What are you afraid of?

614
00:40:32,139 --> 00:40:33,233
I'm not sure.

615
00:40:34,626 --> 00:40:37,725
I'm afraid that things will change.

616
00:40:38,889 --> 00:40:42,136
What do you think will change?

617
00:40:44,422 --> 00:40:45,050
I…

618
00:40:49,352 --> 00:40:50,257
Hello, Aunt Pen.

619
00:40:50,465 --> 00:40:51,776
Err.

620
00:40:51,776 --> 00:40:52,791
Are you here to see Mom?

621
00:40:52,791 --> 00:40:53,361
Yes.

622
00:40:53,361 --> 00:40:55,093
I'm going to ask your mom
to go to the market with me.

623
00:40:55,363 --> 00:40:57,635
I'm going to ask Aunt Taew, too.

624
00:40:58,266 --> 00:41:01,104
I plan to visit a shrine tomorrow morning.

625
00:41:01,894 --> 00:41:03,481
I have an appointment with a fortune teller.

626
00:41:04,063 --> 00:41:07,544
Is he the fortune teller you have a fling with?

627
00:41:07,544 --> 00:41:09,217
No, it's not a fling.

628
00:41:10,817 --> 00:41:11,873
We are dating.

629
00:41:11,873 --> 00:41:12,556
What?

630
00:41:13,159 --> 00:41:14,437
You are a real deal.

631
00:41:14,437 --> 00:41:15,502
You're dating a fortune teller.

632
00:41:20,407 --> 00:41:22,918
When I see you smile like this,
I really want to delete it from my sight.

633
00:41:27,948 --> 00:41:31,124
What does TK stand for?

634
00:41:31,664 --> 00:41:32,749
My fortune teller account?

635
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:36,723
Don't laugh if I tell you.

636
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:40,791
TK stands for Takkrab, as in say hi.

637
00:41:42,869 --> 00:41:45,718
This is the best name you can come up with.

638
00:41:46,591 --> 00:41:47,763
It's so outdated.

639
00:41:47,763 --> 00:41:49,069
It's probably older than my mom.

640
00:41:49,402 --> 00:41:51,716
You know I barely spend time on the internet.

641
00:42:03,152 --> 00:42:04,148
Have a safe flight.

642
00:42:04,564 --> 00:42:05,855
Take care of yourself.

643
00:42:06,125 --> 00:42:08,324
Work hard at school and enjoy your time there.

644
00:42:12,564 --> 00:42:13,636
Do you still like me?

645
00:42:16,671 --> 00:42:18,257
Can you like me for another four years?

646
00:42:18,746 --> 00:42:20,158
I'll call you every day.

647
00:42:20,387 --> 00:42:22,006
Whatever you want me to do, I'll do it.

648
00:42:25,041 --> 00:42:25,928
I like you.

649
00:42:26,697 --> 00:42:28,296
I'm sorry for only telling you today.

650
00:42:28,691 --> 00:42:30,000
I really like you.

651
00:42:37,389 --> 00:42:38,788
Do you feel relieved after saying it?

652
00:42:41,573 --> 00:42:42,281
Yes.

653
00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:45,959
Can I hold you?

654
00:42:54,461 --> 00:42:56,107
Take good care of yourself.

655
00:42:56,107 --> 00:42:57,246
Hurry back.

656
00:42:58,015 --> 00:42:59,106
Don't fall for anyone else.

657
00:42:59,397 --> 00:43:00,971
No, don't talk to anyone.

658
00:43:00,971 --> 00:43:01,750
Can you do that?

659
00:43:07,279 --> 00:43:07,986
What about you?

660
00:43:08,693 --> 00:43:10,970
Are you going to see someone
behind my back when you're in college?

661
00:43:11,635 --> 00:43:14,520
Your fortune teller account always
gets messages from dozens of people.

662
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:17,287
They send the messages
because they want to talk to the fortune teller.

663
00:43:18,118 --> 00:43:18,790
Just like you did.

664
00:43:30,016 --> 00:43:32,250
Will you be the fortune teller's boyfriend?

665
00:43:33,809 --> 00:43:35,085
Then I'll tell them

666
00:43:35,667 --> 00:43:36,652
that I can no longer talk to them.

667
00:43:42,077 --> 00:43:42,774
Okay.

668
00:43:43,605 --> 00:43:44,606
I'll be the fortune teller's boyfriend.

669
00:44:00,355 --> 00:44:03,419
Pen, wait for me.

670
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:05,209
Where is my bag?

671
00:44:05,906 --> 00:44:06,830
Keys.

672
00:44:06,934 --> 00:44:07,592
Umbrella.

673
00:44:08,215 --> 00:44:09,728
Am I forgetting something?

674
00:44:09,728 --> 00:44:10,514
I don't think so.

675
00:44:10,784 --> 00:44:11,890
I got everything.

676
00:44:13,906 --> 00:44:17,099
I'm coming. Wait for me.

677
00:44:23,812 --> 00:44:24,902
Do you feel shy if your mom sees us?

678
00:44:25,858 --> 00:44:26,593
Yes.

679
00:44:32,808 --> 00:44:34,831
Don't you get shy when you're with me?

680
00:44:35,683 --> 00:44:36,472
I…

681
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:38,471
I don't feel shy anymore.

682
00:44:39,531 --> 00:44:40,851
If I feel shy,
I can't be the fortune teller's boyfriend.

683
00:45:27,323 --> 00:45:29,771
I HAVE A BOYFRIEND. HAHA.

684
00:45:29,771 --> 00:45:31,725
DAMN!

685
00:45:31,725 --> 00:45:33,771
YOU'RE DATING A FORTUNE TELLER.
AWESOME!

686
00:45:33,771 --> 00:45:35,514
CAN I SEND THIS PHOTO TO TON?

687
00:45:35,514 --> 00:45:37,887
I'LL SEND IT TO THE CAMP'S GROUP CHAT.
THEY WILL TEASE YOU ABOUT IT.

688
00:45:37,887 --> 00:45:38,951
MHEE ADDS ME TO THE GROUP CHAT.

689
00:45:38,951 --> 00:45:40,871
IF THEY DARE TO TEASE MY FRIEND,
I'LL HIT THEM.

690
00:45:40,871 --> 00:45:43,780
DAMN, YOU'RE DATING YOUR FORTUNE TELLER.

691
00:45:49,725 --> 00:45:54,963
It all began when I fell in love.

692
00:45:55,794 --> 00:45:57,751
Phu is in his last year in college.

693
00:45:57,751 --> 00:46:00,826
Why don't you try the Chantharusati necklace?

694
00:46:00,826 --> 00:46:02,745
Fiat votum meum.

695
00:46:02,870 --> 00:46:05,569
I've been following the news about this cult.

696
00:46:05,569 --> 00:46:07,613
The cult is surely a scam.

697
00:46:07,613 --> 00:46:10,010
Although none of you agrees with me,

698
00:46:10,114 --> 00:46:11,697
At least I still have Ploy,

699
00:46:11,697 --> 00:46:14,988
who's willing to expose the Chantharisatu's scam.

700
00:46:14,988 --> 00:46:16,357
Chantharusati.

701
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:20,713
This is one of the ways our family practices meditation.

702
00:46:23,644 --> 00:46:25,483
STEP INTO A DANGEROUS CULT.

703
00:46:25,483 --> 00:46:27,830
STEP INTO A BIZARRE CULT.

704
00:46:28,599 --> 00:46:31,201
Exposing them is harder than I thought.

705
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:32,626
Got you.

706
00:46:32,626 --> 00:46:34,091
Father is manifesting his power.

707
00:46:34,091 --> 00:46:35,866
The power of Chantra is miraculous.

708
00:46:35,866 --> 00:46:39,720
Spiritual support is indispensable for our world.

709
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:41,425
This business is so shady.

710
00:46:42,402 --> 00:46:43,484
Heart racing…

711
00:46:43,484 --> 00:46:44,705
YOUR ASS!
