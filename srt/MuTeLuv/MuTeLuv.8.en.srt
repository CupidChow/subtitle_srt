1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,300
Comrade Phupar,

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000


3
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:03,900
you can take my place and be the new Father.

4
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:07,700
All you need to do is follow the guidelines
in this book and bring Ploy back.

5
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:09,340
Then everything will be perfect.

6
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,380
Father

7
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:20,420
Ploy, will you join me?

8
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:21,580
Right here.

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,590
Right now.

10
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:24,260
And forever.

11
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,930
Do you have a dream?

12
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:43,880
Everyone has different dreams.

13
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:48,430
Some of you may have big dreams.

14
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:53,060
Some want to be rich.

15
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:56,260
Some want to be famous.

16
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:00,000
But for some people.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,490
But for some people.

18
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,670
They only have small dreams.

19
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:08,200
They want to be loved.

20
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:25,010
[PLOY, ARE YOU OKAY?]
[I‘M OKAY. DON’T CONTACT ME AGAIN.]

21
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,630
Are you going through something?

22
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:33,840
Why don’t you join a cult?

23
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,784
I believe in magic power and sorcery.

24
00:01:37,808 --> 00:01:41,056
But I don’t believe in cults
that brainwash people, Boss.

25
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:44,296
I know it. I’m just kidding you.

26
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:50,984
It would be nice if everyone thought like you.

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,700
PHUPAR AND PLOYPAIRIN LAUNCH LASER MOON GROUP, AN ARTIST AGENCY

28
00:01:58,152 --> 00:02:00,000
PHUPAR AND PLOYPAIRIN LAUNCH LASER MOON GROUP, AN ARTIST AGENCY
PROMOTING A SPIRITUAL CULTURE.

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,416
PHUPAR AND PLOYPAIRIN LAUNCH LASER MOON GROUP, AN ARTIST AGENCY
PROMOTING A SPIRITUAL CULTURE.

30
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:22,328
Hurry up before the tickets are sold out.

31
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:23,928
Come on. Let’s go in.

32
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,264
It will bring you good luck.

33
00:02:40,288 --> 00:02:41,088
This one?

34
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:56,024
If you have a problem,

35
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,232
don’t be so quick to blame yourself.

36
00:02:58,272 --> 00:03:00,000
Why don’t you look around
and blame others for it first?

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,536
Why don’t you look around
and blame others for it first?

38
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:11,712
Daddy Phu.

39
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:16,520
If you want to join the Hi-touch event
with Daddy Phu in the afternoon,

40
00:03:16,568 --> 00:03:19,256
the tickets are selling out fast.

41
00:03:19,272 --> 00:03:23,552
If you still don’t have a ticket,
hurry and get your ticket.

42
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:27,040
The tickets are so expensive.

43
00:03:27,056 --> 00:03:28,500
Is he trying to raise money for a new building?

44
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,464
Hello, everyone.

45
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:11,552
Do you miss your daddy?

46
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:55,616
Mommy Ploy.

47
00:04:55,656 --> 00:04:58,432
Are you ready to receive power from the moon?

48
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:04,880
We are ready.

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,264

56
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:52,152
Hi, Comrade Wutkrai.

57
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:57,848
Hello, Comrade Yok.

58
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,000
Gosh, you remember me?

59
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,800
Gosh, you remember me?

60
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,800
Of course, Comrade Yok.

61
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:05,920
I remember you, too.

62
00:06:06,888 --> 00:06:10,408
I remember that you are a cop.

63
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,072
Let me go.

64
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,120
Don’t ever come back.

65
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,912
The security is very tight.

66
00:07:06,928 --> 00:07:08,216
How do I get in?

67
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,208
So true, bro.

68
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:16,712
- Fay.
- Officer.

69
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,632
You are a police officer.

70
00:07:19,664 --> 00:07:21,872
How could you let my friend
get into this trouble?

71
00:07:21,888 --> 00:07:23,870
But you are her friend.

72
00:07:23,904 --> 00:07:25,008
You are much closer to her.

73
00:07:25,032 --> 00:07:25,920
Why didn’t you stop her?

74
00:07:25,952 --> 00:07:28,144
She didn’t tell me
that she was going to do this.

75
00:07:28,168 --> 00:07:29,880
She didn’t tell me either.

76
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,264
Yeah, I can tell.

77
00:07:31,272 --> 00:07:33,288
Otherwise, we wouldn’t be arguing like this.

78
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,320
It’s useless for us to argue about it.

79
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:48,696
Can you tell me
everything you know about it?

80
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:57,888
(Last month,
Ploy was packing her stuff from our room.)

81
00:08:04,688 --> 00:08:06,690
(When I asked her where she was going,)

82
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,360
(she told me she was going to be with Phu.)

83
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:14,392
(At first, I didn’t think too much about it.)

84
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:18,368
(I was happy
that she finally got her dream guy.)

85
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:27,608
(The strange thing is that
she has never contacted me since that day.)

86
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:32,168
(She was missing classes more often.)

87
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,648
(I only saw her during the exam.)

88
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:41,792
(Her personality had been bland all her life.)

89
00:08:41,816 --> 00:08:43,912
(She didn’t like being the center of attention.)

90
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,048
(She suddenly has people
following her everywhere.)

91
00:08:47,088 --> 00:08:50,304
(She doesn’t seem to be bothered by it.)

92
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:57,232
(I think she is doing something in secret.)

93
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:00,000
(Because she always has reasons
when she does something.

94
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,368
(Because she always has reasons
when she does something.

95
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:05,432
You have to help my friend.

96
00:09:05,456 --> 00:09:08,992
I’m worried that
Phu is planning to do something to her.

97
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,288
I want to help your friend.

98
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,888
But right now,
I have no evidence to charge them.

99
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,856
If we let things go on like this,

100
00:09:20,888 --> 00:09:22,860
won’t it be more dangerous to Ploy?

101
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,360
Then this is the only way we've got.

102
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,824
We’ll solve the problem with money.

103
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,176
Next person.

104
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,512
Mommy Ploy

105
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:06,664
I feel like I haven’t given you everything.

106
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:09,120
I promise.

107
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:12,968
When I can sell my house and car,

108
00:10:12,992 --> 00:10:14,760
I’ll donate all the money to you.

109
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:19,160
Mister.

110
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:25,064
I don’t think
you should spend beyond your means.

111
00:10:25,232 --> 00:10:28,512
I can skip a meal for you.

112
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:31,312
But I can’t stand not seeing you.

113
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,144
Your time is up.

114
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,216
I’ll see you.

115
00:10:36,256 --> 00:10:37,200
Please follow me.

116
00:10:37,232 --> 00:10:38,216
Your time is up.

117
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,224
Next person.

118
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:56,512
I’m so happy to see you today, Mommy Ploy.

119
00:10:56,536 --> 00:11:00,000
I’m your big fan.

120
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,280
I’m your big fan.

121
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:07,328
I have something to give you.

122
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,592
You cannot do that.

123
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,736
But this is a predicted paper for her exam.

124
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,024
I noticed that you missed many classes.

125
00:11:17,048 --> 00:11:18,656
It’s still a No.

126
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:20,752
What?

127
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,664
I’m sorry, Mommy.

128
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:32,832
I don’t know I can’t give you gifts.

129
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,832
Please don’t be mad or hate me.

130
00:11:36,856 --> 00:11:38,064
Please.

131
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,328
Your time is up.

132
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:41,112
What the heck?!

133
00:11:41,152 --> 00:11:43,192
Why is the time so short?

134
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:44,152
Your time is up.

135
00:11:44,176 --> 00:11:45,872
I love you, Mommy.

136
00:11:45,896 --> 00:11:46,744
Please follow me.

137
00:11:46,768 --> 00:11:48,376
Don’t touch me. I can walk.

138
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:02,648
SEE YOU AT 10 P.M.

139
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,472
Be quiet.

140
00:12:24,496 --> 00:12:26,240
I’m here to help you get out of this place.

141
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:32,736
Wait.

142
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,896
I have something to tell you two.

143
00:12:36,704 --> 00:12:38,128
You can tell us later.

144
00:12:38,168 --> 00:12:40,912
Right now, we need to get out of here.

145
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:48,552
Hold on.

146
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:52,728
Don’t tell me you’re gathering evidence
for me to convict this cult.

147
00:12:52,784 --> 00:12:55,928
Gosh, Jued. I knew it.

148
00:12:55,976 --> 00:12:58,192
You are a super spy.

149
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:04,632
DADDY PHU’S TEACHING.

150
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:11,160
This is the intention of Phu and me
when we founded this cult.

151
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:16,400
People want Phu to be their spiritual anchor.

152
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:19,904
Phu wants me to be by his side.

153
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:23,896
So I’m not going to leave this place.

154
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:29,872
Ploy.

155
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,368
What the hell is wrong with you?

156
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:35,456
Didn’t you tell me
you don’t believe in superstitions?

157
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:39,888
Why are you getting involved in this cult?

158
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:44,408
Back then, I didn’t understand it.

159
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,528
Now, I get it.

160
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,888
It’s not wrong to start a cult.

161
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,890
If we do it in the right and legal way.

162
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,584
Phu and I share the same purpose.

163
00:13:55,470 --> 00:14:00,000
Laser Moon Group will be another option
for those who are looking for an answer in life.

164
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,832
Laser Moon Group will be another option
for those who are looking for an answer in life.

165
00:14:00,864 --> 00:14:02,072
That’s all we want.

166
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:03,896
Ploy.

167
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,944
How have you changed so much?

168
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,496
Right now, you become…

169
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,232
I don’t know who you are anymore.

170
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,176
I need to take you out of this place.

171
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,912
What are you doing?

172
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,440
Hey, are you a cop or a thief?

173
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:24,250
Let me go.

174
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,080
Be quiet, or your followers will rush here.

175
00:14:26,104 --> 00:14:27,544
Let me go.

176
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:28,704
Let me go.

177
00:14:28,728 --> 00:14:29,984
Let me down.

178
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,376
Let me go.

179
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:34,368
Let me go.

180
00:14:34,408 --> 00:14:35,952
Let me down.

181
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:43,624
Leave me and Phu alone.

182
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:51,712
Ploy.

183
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:58,824
Please ask yourself again
if this is what you really want.

184
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:02,976
Ploy that I know,

185
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:06,128
she’s not this kind of person.

186
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:28,936
Double security for Mommy Ploy,

187
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:30,432
Comrade Yok.

188
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,704
Sure, Daddy Phu.

189
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:40,616
(After that night,
I have never seen them again.)

190
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:45,896
(Our Laser Moon Group is growing every day.)

191
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,520
The tickets are sold out.

192
00:15:54,296 --> 00:15:56,128

00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:45,680
Do you know this?

201
00:16:45,712 --> 00:16:48,656
Our group reached the break-even point.

202
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:52,704
Thank you for always staying by my side.

203
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,208
To celebrate the success of Laser Moon,

204
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,000
I prepared a special event for you.

205
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,210
I prepared a special event for you.

206
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,760
Special event?

207
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,056
What is it?

208
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:24,600
Officer, do you have a plan to help my friend?

209
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,760
Wake up.

210
00:17:31,792 --> 00:17:33,304
My friend is in big trouble.

211
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:41,016
In my upcoming special event,

212
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:43,280
I…

213
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,912
I’m going to…

214
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,768
propose to her.

215
00:17:47,808 --> 00:17:49,112
[BIG NEWS OF MUTE-POP,
DADDY PHU REVEALS HIS BIG SURPRISE.]

216
00:17:49,136 --> 00:17:50,856
This shocks the entertainment industry.

217
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:58,024
Getting married is good news.

218
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,000
Officer, my friend is marrying
a leader of a weird cult.

219
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,880
Officer, my friend is marrying
a leader of a weird cult.

220
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:05,728
I don’t care.

221
00:18:05,744 --> 00:18:07,392
I want to file a report about this.

222
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,000
If you don’t take any action,

223
00:18:09,032 --> 00:18:11,272
I’ll file a complaint against you for…

224
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,720
neglecting her problem.

225
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:16,480
Do it.

226
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:19,336
You have no proof
that she has a problem with it.

227
00:18:20,216 --> 00:18:21,340
What a letdown!

228
00:18:21,376 --> 00:18:23,136
Didn’t you say you were going to rescue her?

229
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,392
You are so useless.

230
00:18:26,408 --> 00:18:27,432
Useless.

231
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:37,872
Lieutenant.

232
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,448
Can I ask you something?

233
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,120
You have feelings for Ploy, don’t you?

234
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,904
Come on. Tell me the truth.

235
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:57,608
You think I can’t read a young officer like you?

236
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,336
Yes.

237
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:11,432
Then you don’t want her
to marry that cult leader, do you?

238
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:15,224
Yes.

239
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,088
I’ll suspend you from duty.

240
00:19:21,128 --> 00:19:24,584
You’re unfit for duty
because of your personal problem.

241
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:29,384
Wait, Boss. I…

242
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:31,296
Are you going to disobey my order?

243
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,536
No.

244
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:42,488
Our job is to ensure
the public’s safety and well-being.

245
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,024
If you are not ready to do your job,

246
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:49,352
you should take a break from work.

247
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:58,744
Right now, you are just a civilian.

248
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:02,512
If you have something you want to do,

249
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:04,328
take this chance and do it.

250
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,984
Wait, Boss.

251
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:13,480
Are you saying…

252
00:20:36,376 --> 00:20:38,872
Please root for me, Great-grandfather.

253
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:49,872
This is the makeup and hairstyle
Daddy Phu chose for you.

254
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,000
Phu.

255
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,880
Phu.

256
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:04,256
Don’t you think the style is a bit too much?

257
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:07,160
No.

258
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,280
I chose the dress for you.

259
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,568
In tomorrow’s event,

260
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:16,352
I want you to look

261
00:21:16,384 --> 00:21:18,350
the most beautiful and perfect.

262
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,872
Fine.

263
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:31,312
Phu.

264
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,512
I have a favor to ask.

265
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:37,696
Sure.

266
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,512
What is it?

267
00:21:41,232 --> 00:21:43,230
Tomorrow…

268
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:48,408
Can I not wear lenses?

269
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,496
But I think you look better without glasses.

270
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,056
Is something bothering you?

271
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:14,096
You can tell me.

272
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,336
I’m alright.

273
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,728
What about you?

274
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,904
Do you have anything to tell me?

275
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:30,584
No.

276
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:39,576
Daddy Phu, it’s time to choose your outfit.

277
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,896
I’ll go choose my outfit.

278
00:23:31,304 --> 00:23:32,472
Why did the lights suddenly go off?

279
00:23:32,504 --> 00:23:33,672
I don’t know.

280
00:23:33,696 --> 00:23:35,272
Let’s check the electrical room.

281
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:56,816
I guess I need to use the unlocking spell.

282
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,496
It never fails me.

283
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:20,976
A vase again?

284
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:23,360
Wait.

285
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,448
It’s me, Wutkrai.

286
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,280
What the hell are you doing?

287
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,000
Now, you have decided to be a thief?

288
00:24:33,032 --> 00:24:33,808
Yes.

289
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,952
I have something I need to steal back.

290
00:24:35,992 --> 00:24:37,448
What? What is it?

291
00:24:37,472 --> 00:24:38,208
What do you want to steal?

292
00:24:38,232 --> 00:24:39,408
You.

293
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:52,360
You hear it clearly, don’t you?

294
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,192
Don’t marry him.

295
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:10,560
Let me take you out of here.

296
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,056
Wait a sec.

297
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:26,704
Here.

298
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:32,296
This is all the evidence
I’ve gathered about this cult.

299
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,144
Wait.

300
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:41,088
When did you gather all the evidence?

301
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:44,544
To tell you the truth,

302
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:47,672
Since I met you that night.

303
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:55,408
I thought Laser Moon Group
was a sincere support system for people.

304
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,888
But in the end,

305
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:06,608
Laser Moon Group does many illegal things.

306
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:08,760
They are a loan shark.

307
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:12,832
They threaten and use barbaric methods
to collect money from debtors.

308
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:16,392
They also launder dirty money for crime lords.

309
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,550
They are not different
from the Chantharusati Family.

310
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:26,256
At first, I planned to expose them
at the wedding tomorrow.

311
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:31,616
Since you are here, I’ll leave it to you.

312
00:26:34,064 --> 00:26:36,060
Right now, we need to get out of here.

313
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:17,672
Are you awake?

314
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,432
Hang tight.

315
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:23,880
Hey.

316
00:27:24,216 --> 00:27:26,220
Don’t you have a pocketknife?

317
00:27:26,256 --> 00:27:27,848
The one that police usually carry.

318
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:29,624
You watch movies too much.

319
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,840
Even if I had it,
they would have taken it away already.

320
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:36,160
But they don’t know
that I know the unleashing spell.

321
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:39,928
Stop it.

322
00:27:39,968 --> 00:27:41,930
It would be like when you tried
to stop your bleeding with a spell.

323
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,912
If the robe becomes tighter,
we will be dead meat.

324
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,560
I’m not afraid of death.

325
00:27:45,584 --> 00:27:47,400
You know I have hidden skills.

326
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,088
I don’t know.

327
00:27:50,128 --> 00:27:51,768
I have a poor memory.

328
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:54,568
Poor memory?

329
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:57,704
What about my love confession to you
last night?

330
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,912
Do you remember it?

331
00:27:58,968 --> 00:27:59,880
Huh?

332
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,664
What’s wrong with you?

333
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:04,392
Why are you mentioning it?

334
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:05,720
You don’t remember?

335
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,712
Do you want me to say it again?

336
00:28:09,736 --> 00:28:10,816
No.

337
00:28:10,848 --> 00:28:12,232
Why? You don’t like me?

338
00:28:12,248 --> 00:28:13,704
It’s not that.

339
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:16,352
So what is it?

340
00:28:16,384 --> 00:28:18,448
Gosh, I…

341
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,280
To be honest,

342
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,776
I…

343
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:48,152
Ploy.

344
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,024
Are you betraying me?

345
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,840
Didn’t you say you like me?

346
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,200
I’m your first love, ain’t I?

347
00:29:01,176 --> 00:29:02,192
Yes.

348
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,720
I like you.

349
00:29:07,656 --> 00:29:09,660
I used to like you.

350
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,712
But when I found out the truth,

351
00:29:16,336 --> 00:29:18,340
my feelings for you were gone.

352
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:22,384
The truth?

353
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,968
What truth?

354
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:28,976
The truth is that…

355
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:33,504
this cult was founded to scam people.

356
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:38,184
You exploit emotionally vulnerable people.

357
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:42,320
You also launder money for crime lords.

358
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:46,544
What you do is not different
from what Father did.

359
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,872
I’m so disappointed

360
00:29:56,890 --> 00:29:58,416
that you can’t see it.

361
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:05,176
Everyone is doing this kind of stuff.

362
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:14,824
I thought you would be smarter than this.

363
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:17,672
If other women were in your place,

364
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:22,824
they would be happy and proud.

365
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:25,848
You have everything that other women want.

366
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:29,432
What else do you want?

367
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,096
You may be right.

368
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:40,656
If other women were in my place,

369
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,680
they would be happy.

370
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:46,720
But for me,

371
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:52,352
I now know what I want.

372
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,624
Ploy, tell me.

373
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,192
Do you love him?

374
00:31:07,224 --> 00:31:09,416
Phu, what are you doing?

375
00:31:09,448 --> 00:31:10,200
Please don’t do it.

376
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:15,224
If you are gone, she will be mine.

377
00:31:22,144 --> 00:31:25,470
That knife cannot hurt me.

378
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:29,944
Phu, are you out of your mind?

379
00:31:29,976 --> 00:31:32,600
If I have to go crazy to make you mine,

380
00:31:32,632 --> 00:31:33,480
I’ll do it.

381
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:45,032
Are you losing your mind?

382
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,152
No.

383
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:49,560
I’m just buying some time.

384
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,320
Ouch.

385
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:06,480
Hello.

386
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:08,552
Ploy and the cop are running away.

387
00:32:08,568 --> 00:32:09,912
Don’t let them get away.

388
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:14,512
Follow them.

389
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,064
Hey.

390
00:32:19,088 --> 00:32:20,440
Why are the police here?

391
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,376
Everyone, look at this.

392
00:32:22,408 --> 00:32:25,016
This is the place where my friend is captured.

393
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:27,592
Officer, you are here.

394
00:32:27,632 --> 00:32:29,784
Thank you so much.

395
00:32:29,808 --> 00:32:30,920
We are here to arrest you.

396
00:32:30,968 --> 00:32:34,344
We got a report that
you are causing a disturbance here.

397
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:35,960
That’s not true.

398
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:36,960
I didn’t do anything wrong.

399
00:32:36,984 --> 00:32:37,896
Sergeant, arrest her.

400
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:41,072
The criminals are in the building, not me.

401
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,720
Mommy Ploy.

402
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:49,848
I’m very disappointed in you.

403
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:53,384
Daddy Phu loves you so much.

404
00:32:53,408 --> 00:32:55,608
How dare you betray him?

405
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:04,360
If you can’t be Mommy for Daddy Phu,

406
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,536
then I’ll do it.

407
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:18,400
Mommy Yok.

408
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,584

409
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,864

00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,560

418
00:33:58,010 --> 00:33:59,056
What are you waiting for?

419
00:33:59,088 --> 00:34:00,000
Run.

420
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:00,008
Run.

421
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:09,248
What are you doing?

422
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,520
Stay behind me.

423
00:34:10,552 --> 00:34:12,864
No, you stay away.

424
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,248
Phu won’t shoot me.

425
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:18,152
Ploy.

426
00:34:20,264 --> 00:34:22,260
Do you love him that much?

427
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:27,848
What about me?

428
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,568
What about me, Ploy?

429
00:34:30,992 --> 00:34:32,440
How will I live without you?

430
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:33,736
Phu.

431
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:36,816
Phu, calm down.

432
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:39,320
Put the gun down.

433
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,720
So we can talk.

434
00:34:45,890 --> 00:34:48,288
Since you no longer need me,

435
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:54,568
I’ll leave you.

436
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,472
Phu, no!

437
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:55,168
I think Phupar doesn’t know
how to shoot a gun.

438
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,280
Or you have a special power.

439
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:04,152
Hey.

440
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,488
Hold on.

441
00:36:11,808 --> 00:36:13,472
You can’t die.

442
00:36:21,136 --> 00:36:23,248
Stop looking at me like that.

443
00:36:26,352 --> 00:36:28,192
I have special power.

444
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:30,552
Don’t fall into sleep.

445
00:36:30,576 --> 00:36:31,632
Stay strong.

446
00:36:31,664 --> 00:36:33,120
I’ll go get help.

447
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,576
See?

448
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:48,240
You have special power.

449
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,440
The Pra Jiad armband I gave you.

450
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:05,040
I’m happy

451
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:10,104
that it helps keep you safe.

452
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,504
Ploy.

453
00:37:29,584 --> 00:37:31,580
How do you feel about me?

454
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:46,256
Are you not going to tell me?

455
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:58,448
I like you.

456
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,088
Good.

457
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,200
Hey.

458
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:13,312
Talk to me.

459
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,736
Phu.

460
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:04,960
This will be my last request to you.

461
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:12,016
Stop running.

462
00:39:15,304 --> 00:39:17,300
Surrender yourself to the police.

463
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,416
I did wrong too.

464
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,320
I understand you.

465
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,576
You are just weak.

466
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:39,584
You only look for emotional support.

467
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,392
That’s all.

468
00:40:02,096 --> 00:40:03,008
Ploy.

469
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,880
I’m sorry.

470
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:12,440
I didn’t mean things to turn out this way.

471
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:21,640
I got it now.

472
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:28,312
I got it now, Ploy.

473
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:36,344
I failed to manage the whole operation.

474
00:40:39,712 --> 00:40:40,488
Ploy.

475
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:42,592
Run away with me.

476
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:45,120
We will go to a place where no one knows us.

477
00:40:45,656 --> 00:40:47,104
After things die down,

478
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:48,616
we can come back and build a new cult.

479
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:53,352
I guarantee
I won’t make mistakes again this time.

480
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:56,288
Ploy.

481
00:40:57,340 --> 00:41:00,000
Thank you for making me realize it.

482
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:00,520
Thank you for making me realize it.

483
00:41:01,296 --> 00:41:03,300
Let’s start again together, Ploy.

484
00:41:17,392 --> 00:41:19,496
You can have a new start in jail, asshole.

485
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:46,592
Damn, I can see a ghost.

486
00:41:46,624 --> 00:41:48,376
I’m not a ghost.

487
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,896
I’m not dead.

488
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:59,072
The bullet only grazed me.

489
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,896
It’s because I have sorcery power.

490
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:04,752
What about the blood from your mouth?

491
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:07,680
That?

492
00:42:30,464 --> 00:42:31,992
Officer, this way.

493
00:42:32,024 --> 00:42:33,616
The criminal is in here.

494
00:42:44,048 --> 00:42:46,050
How long will you keep holding each other?

495
00:42:48,850 --> 00:42:52,928
That’s how Laser Moon Group
was closed down.

496
00:42:52,976 --> 00:42:55,896
The whole story is relayed through my book.

497
00:42:57,970 --> 00:43:00,000
Sangchan, how do you feel
that this book became a best-seller?

498
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,864
Sangchan, how do you feel
that this book became a best-seller?

499
00:43:02,864 --> 00:43:05,448
I’m very happy.

500
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:07,576
I want to thank my readers.

501
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:11,920
I think many people are curious about this.

502
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:17,168
What happened to the people in the book
after the story ended?

503
00:43:18,810 --> 00:43:22,248
I’ll start with Fay.

504
00:43:22,288 --> 00:43:26,792
After that live-streaming, she became viral.

505
00:43:26,808 --> 00:43:28,880
She gained hundreds of thousands
of new followers.

506
00:43:29,570 --> 00:43:34,520
For Officer Wutkrai,
his suspension from duty was extended.

507
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,616
But he is idolized
by the junior officers in his department.

508
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:39,620
He is a role model they want to follow.

509
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:45,888
Ploy, the owner of the story.

510
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,936
She went back to live her boring life.

511
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:53,816
She asked me to publish her story
for everyone to read.

512
00:43:54,320 --> 00:44:00,000
Sangchan, you did a wonderful job
in relaying this story in detail.

513
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,736
Sangchan, you did a wonderful job
in relaying this story in detail.

514
00:44:01,768 --> 00:44:06,344
It feels as if Ploy wrote the book herself.

515
00:44:06,368 --> 00:44:09,328
Yeah.

516
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:11,984
Before we wrap things up,

517
00:44:12,016 --> 00:44:15,112
do you have anything you want to say?

518
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:23,144
To be honest, I wrote this book

519
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:25,840
because I want it to be a lesson

520
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:29,864
for those who don’t have self-confidence

521
00:44:29,896 --> 00:44:31,820
and look for emotional support.

522
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:37,896
It’s not weird for us
to feel insecure sometimes.

523
00:44:38,272 --> 00:44:40,270
And we turn to a higher power for help.

524
00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:46,776
That’s not a bad thing
if you don’t blindly believe it.

525
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:49,008
If praying to a high power doesn’t work,

526
00:44:49,048 --> 00:44:51,010
then you should believe in yourself.

527
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,920
Learn to love yourself.

528
00:44:53,530 --> 00:44:56,144
That’s a beautiful ending.

529
00:44:56,184 --> 00:45:00,000
Thank you, Sangchan,
for giving your time to our interview.

530
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,096
Thank you, Sangchan,
for giving your time to our interview.

531
00:45:01,136 --> 00:45:03,136
Thank you for having me.

532
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:10,152
My girlfriend is so cool.

533
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:23,900
Are you sure about the pen name?

534
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:27,420
Why don’t you reveal
that you’re the real writer?

535
00:45:29,150 --> 00:45:30,264
This is the right decision.

536
00:45:31,150 --> 00:45:34,216
I don’t want people
to pay attention to my personal life.

537
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:42,568
The person I want the most attention from is…

538
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,408
You are so flirty.

539
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:45,656
Can you stop it?

540
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:54,368
For your next book,
why don’t you write about us?

541
00:45:57,656 --> 00:45:59,040
I’ll think about it.

542
00:46:00,610 --> 00:46:03,080
Then let’s go out on a date.

543
00:46:04,264 --> 00:46:05,632
Are you crazy?

544
00:46:06,290 --> 00:46:07,408
I’m exhausted.

545
00:46:07,424 --> 00:46:09,096
Fay, you can come with us.

546
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:11,376
Right.

547
00:46:11,408 --> 00:46:13,616
So I can play Extra #1 in your story?

548
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:15,656
I’ll go with you.

549
00:46:15,696 --> 00:46:17,552
Thank you for inviting me.

550
00:46:17,576 --> 00:46:19,144
Why are you playing along with him?

551
00:46:19,176 --> 00:46:21,640
I want new content for my channel.

552
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:22,648
Let’s go.

553
00:46:22,672 --> 00:46:23,104
Get up.

554
00:46:23,128 --> 00:46:23,768
Come on.

555
00:46:23,792 --> 00:46:24,544
No.

556
00:46:24,568 --> 00:46:25,312
Come on.

557
00:46:25,336 --> 00:46:25,920
No.

558
00:46:28,230 --> 00:46:29,608
Do you want to go to the beach?

559
00:46:29,656 --> 00:46:31,176
I want to lie down.

560
00:46:31,216 --> 00:46:32,376
Oh, you want to lie down on the beach?

561
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:33,392
Sure.

562
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:34,784
Don’t force me to use the last resort.

563
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:35,768
I want to lie down here.

564
00:46:37,890 --> 00:46:38,872
Stop it.

565
00:46:53,888 --> 00:46:57,032
We are Air Dolls.

566
00:46:57,060 --> 00:46:59,024
We are pretty.

567
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:00,000
We are chic.

568
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:00,256
We are chic.

569
00:47:00,288 --> 00:47:02,728
We are stylish, but we are not popular.

570
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,568
Why don’t we pray to gods for help?

571
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:05,464
Deal.

572
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:08,584
How will we know that the deva is powerful?

573
00:47:08,616 --> 00:47:10,000
You need to have faith.

574
00:47:10,390 --> 00:47:11,928
Our subscribers have almost reached 100,000.

575
00:47:13,930 --> 00:47:14,888
Congratulations.

576
00:47:14,904 --> 00:47:16,360
Thank you, the deva.

577
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:20,728
THEY DISRESPECT THE DEVA.

578
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:22,730
I am…

579
00:47:23,050 --> 00:47:23,864
the deva.

580
00:47:24,496 --> 00:47:25,904
SO THE DIVAS ARE IN TROUBLE.

581
00:47:25,928 --> 00:47:27,544
I’ll curse you.

582
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:30,752
Your life will be full of bad luck.

583
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:32,776
Run.
