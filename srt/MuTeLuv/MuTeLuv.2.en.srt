1
00:00:00,335 --> 00:00:03,135
Mawin is joining our class starting today.

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:09,101
I will also send Mawin
to the qualifying exam for the math camp.

3
00:00:09,101 --> 00:00:10,868
Just seeing Mawin's face,

4
00:00:10,868 --> 00:00:12,160
I already lost my confidence.

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,154
Why don't you seek advice from a fortune teller?

6
00:00:14,154 --> 00:00:15,457
Ask him how you can defeat Mawin.

7
00:00:15,457 --> 00:00:16,491
Just get to the point.

8
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,351
I have a fortune teller to recommend to you.

9
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:19,927
His predictions are very accurate.

10
00:00:19,927 --> 00:00:23,313
It means you need to
make someone close to you fall for you.

11
00:00:23,313 --> 00:00:24,668
How can I make him like me?

12
00:00:24,668 --> 00:00:26,295
Just sharing the room with him
is already too hard.

13
00:01:35,461 --> 00:01:36,427
(Dark horse.)

14
00:01:36,975 --> 00:01:38,583
(No matter how fast it can run.)

15
00:01:39,215 --> 00:01:40,388
(If it wakes up late,)

16
00:01:41,125 --> 00:01:43,129
(it will fall behind other horses.)

17
00:02:15,847 --> 00:02:17,588
Please enjoy your sleep until dusk.

18
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,969
(In a competition, nothing is more important
than knowing your rivals.)

19
00:02:27,043 --> 00:02:28,774
(Especially those who are hard to read.)

20
00:02:29,448 --> 00:02:30,588
(They are the most dangerous ones.)

21
00:02:30,862 --> 00:02:31,910
What the heck!?

22
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,489
He follows no one.

23
00:02:37,049 --> 00:02:38,337
Morning, Err.

24
00:02:39,348 --> 00:02:40,432
Morning, Dan.

25
00:02:41,169 --> 00:02:41,823
What's up?

26
00:02:42,602 --> 00:02:44,220
Are you solving a math question
while walking?

27
00:02:44,346 --> 00:02:45,267
What math question?

28
00:02:45,267 --> 00:02:46,217
I'm scrolling through IG.

29
00:02:52,831 --> 00:02:53,871
Err, did you have breakfast?

30
00:02:54,082 --> 00:02:55,084
No, Plawan.

31
00:02:56,047 --> 00:02:56,933
Let's go have breakfast.

32
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,640
He doesn't even post his photo.

33
00:03:01,946 --> 00:03:03,174
Is this his finsta?

34
00:03:04,649 --> 00:03:06,160
A guy like him has a finsta?

35
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:06,935
It's unlikely.

36
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:11,943
Hey.

37
00:03:11,943 --> 00:03:12,723
You just came down now.

38
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,460
Yes.

39
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,207
You should hurry and have breakfast

40
00:03:14,713 --> 00:03:16,360
before the food runs out.

41
00:03:16,882 --> 00:03:17,382
Okay.

42
00:03:22,667 --> 00:03:23,433
Err.

43
00:03:26,911 --> 00:03:27,583
Shit.

44
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:28,875
I'm sorry.

45
00:03:29,675 --> 00:03:30,590
I forgot to bring a toast for you.

46
00:03:30,927 --> 00:03:32,767
Do you know what happened yesterday?

47
00:03:32,872 --> 00:03:33,997
Do you remember Ton?

48
00:03:34,418 --> 00:03:36,614
I barely got any sleep.
He was crying to me until 3 am

49
00:03:36,614 --> 00:03:39,194
because he missed his grandma.

50
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,275
I told him to stop crying.

51
00:03:42,275 --> 00:03:44,709
He said he also missed the buffalo
that his grandma raises.

52
00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:47,000
He missed both of them.

53
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,589
He has only 90ish friends on Facebook.

54
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:54,457
The person you need to make fall for you

55
00:03:55,005 --> 00:03:56,090
is Mawin?

56
00:03:57,691 --> 00:03:58,578
How did you know that?

57
00:03:59,484 --> 00:04:02,997
Benz told me about Seer TK.

58
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:05,224
From what I saw yesterday,

59
00:04:05,835 --> 00:04:07,372
are you sure it's about Mawin?

60
00:04:09,078 --> 00:04:10,981
Right? I'm not sure either.

61
00:04:11,571 --> 00:04:13,028
I think Benz's guess is ridiculous.

62
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:15,200
So is the fortune teller's advice.

63
00:04:15,727 --> 00:04:16,429
How about this?

64
00:04:16,429 --> 00:04:19,235
I usually don't believe in this kind of stuff.

65
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:21,623
But from what Benze told me,
this fortune teller's advice is spot-on.

66
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,620
I guess so, or it could be just a fluke.

67
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,593
I'm not sure either.

68
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,853
Can I ask you for real?

69
00:04:30,106 --> 00:04:31,280
Apart from this,

70
00:04:31,765 --> 00:04:34,561
do you have other ways to defeat him?

71
00:04:41,133 --> 00:04:43,372
Where is Mawin?

72
00:04:43,857 --> 00:04:45,694
When I went to have breakfast,
I didn't see him either.

73
00:04:46,431 --> 00:04:47,529
Is he still sleeping?

74
00:04:47,529 --> 00:04:48,683
The class will begin in five minutes.

75
00:04:52,138 --> 00:04:53,563
Just let him sleep.

76
00:04:54,722 --> 00:04:56,562
It'd be great if he wakes up at 3 pm.

77
00:05:00,438 --> 00:05:01,521
Are you crazy?

78
00:05:03,532 --> 00:05:06,485
I felt bad to see him crying
because he missed his buffalo.

79
00:05:06,591 --> 00:05:08,527
He was on his knees and begged me.

80
00:05:08,527 --> 00:05:13,388
I was comforting him until 3 am.

81
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:14,625
Oh.

82
00:05:16,247 --> 00:05:17,633
Didn't you say he was sleeping?

83
00:05:18,391 --> 00:05:19,070
Huh?

84
00:05:19,618 --> 00:05:21,144
Did he crawl through vents to get here?

85
00:05:22,829 --> 00:05:23,817
How is this possible?

86
00:05:25,966 --> 00:05:26,813
You must get it wrong.

87
00:05:27,129 --> 00:05:27,759
Let's go.

88
00:05:45,433 --> 00:05:46,130
Okay.

89
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:48,003
Do you see the difference?

90
00:05:48,193 --> 00:05:49,828
On the left, he didn't give the full process.

91
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:53,041
Showing your solution to the question
is very important.

92
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:55,440
It doesn't matter
if your explanation is short or long.

93
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,761
But it needs to be…

94
00:05:56,761 --> 00:05:57,423
…complete.

95
00:05:57,423 --> 00:05:58,191
That's right.

96
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,922
I'll give Sugus one point for this question.

97
00:05:59,922 --> 00:06:01,605
Meanwhile, Mangpor will get two points.

98
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:02,379
Good job.

99
00:06:02,379 --> 00:06:03,090
Give them a round of applause.

100
00:06:04,206 --> 00:06:04,931
Excellent.

101
00:06:06,342 --> 00:06:08,079
The next question is a bit harder.

102
00:06:08,248 --> 00:06:08,886
Try to solve it.

103
00:06:10,024 --> 00:06:10,666
Go.

104
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,086
Can you solve it?

105
00:06:19,466 --> 00:06:22,084
If you think you have the answer,
raise your hand.

106
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:24,690
I'll give eight points

107
00:06:26,122 --> 00:06:28,666
if you find the correct answer.

108
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,271
Hey.

109
00:06:32,494 --> 00:06:34,231
The boy at the back wearing a grey hoodie.

110
00:06:35,748 --> 00:06:36,708
Did you solve the problem?

111
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:38,082
Can you solve it?

112
00:06:39,536 --> 00:06:40,471
Yes.

113
00:06:44,158 --> 00:06:44,857
Good.

114
00:06:45,552 --> 00:06:47,562
Can you come out and show how you solve it?

115
00:07:05,756 --> 00:07:06,507
Do I need to write it down?

116
00:07:07,687 --> 00:07:10,001
Just show how you solve it.
It doesn't have to be detailed.

117
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:12,172
Are you sure he's smart?

118
00:07:12,909 --> 00:07:14,067
If he can't do it, it will be embarrassing.

119
00:07:17,374 --> 00:07:18,480
I can write it down.

120
00:07:19,091 --> 00:07:21,590
Can you help clean the board first?

121
00:07:24,982 --> 00:07:25,698
Huh?

122
00:07:27,257 --> 00:07:27,920
Bring it here.

123
00:07:28,257 --> 00:07:29,000
Okay.

124
00:07:31,423 --> 00:07:33,723
If that board doesn't have enough space,
you can continue on this board.

125
00:07:42,334 --> 00:07:43,692
Is your friend a monster?

126
00:07:45,104 --> 00:07:45,876
Damn.

127
00:07:47,372 --> 00:07:50,583
[Is Mawin the person close to you
mentioned in the fortune teller's advice?]

128
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:51,553
[That's what Mhee told me.]

129
00:07:51,995 --> 00:07:54,347
[Do you have to make him fall for you?]

130
00:07:54,726 --> 00:07:55,559
[Damn.]

131
00:07:55,728 --> 00:07:58,360
[I know you can do it. You are the best.]

132
00:07:59,413 --> 00:08:00,595
[I want to block you.]

133
00:08:08,939 --> 00:08:09,493
Err.

134
00:08:09,493 --> 00:08:10,058
What?

135
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,698
Why don't you sit with him?

136
00:08:13,847 --> 00:08:14,480
No.

137
00:08:16,081 --> 00:08:17,233
What are you afraid of?

138
00:08:17,654 --> 00:08:20,211
Seriously, do you want the scholarship?

139
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:21,897
If you don't talk to him,

140
00:08:22,066 --> 00:08:23,078
how will he fall for you?

141
00:08:23,478 --> 00:08:24,587
Nonsense.

142
00:08:24,861 --> 00:08:26,760
Benz's guess could be wrong.

143
00:08:27,476 --> 00:08:29,775
Whether his guess is right or wrong,
it doesn't hurt to start a convo with him.

144
00:08:32,008 --> 00:08:33,280
Try to befriend him.

145
00:08:33,491 --> 00:08:35,282
You are his roommate.

146
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:43,662
Can I sit with you?

147
00:08:45,368 --> 00:08:46,459
My friend skips lunch.

148
00:08:57,542 --> 00:08:58,236
(Get lost.)

149
00:09:02,934 --> 00:09:03,885
I brought water for you.

150
00:09:12,569 --> 00:09:14,981
When did you leave the room this morning?

151
00:09:14,981 --> 00:09:16,297
How did you arrive at the class before me?

152
00:09:16,297 --> 00:09:18,024
I took a shortcut through the pool.

153
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:20,003
Is that route shorter?

154
00:09:20,319 --> 00:09:22,283
Based on the displacement, it's much shorter.

155
00:09:26,285 --> 00:09:27,999
You were awesome earlier.

156
00:09:28,273 --> 00:09:29,491
Did you attend a tutoring class?

157
00:09:29,491 --> 00:09:32,011
Mr. Suea took a picture of your solution.

158
00:09:33,528 --> 00:09:34,527
Do you know that?

159
00:09:36,591 --> 00:09:37,361
Yes.

160
00:09:41,553 --> 00:09:42,249
Excuse me.

161
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:09,448
Err.

162
00:10:10,327 --> 00:10:10,869
What?

163
00:10:17,194 --> 00:10:18,089
Why are you here?

164
00:10:18,574 --> 00:10:20,040
They want to know about Mawin.

165
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:22,855
I'm not that curious.

166
00:10:23,466 --> 00:10:24,453
Don't overstate it.

167
00:10:27,149 --> 00:10:28,779
Are you close with him?

168
00:10:30,085 --> 00:10:32,498
Mawin is freaking smart.

169
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:34,349
He can answer all my questions.

170
00:10:34,349 --> 00:10:35,680
But all he does in class is zone out.

171
00:10:35,806 --> 00:10:37,514
True. He's a genius.

172
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:39,642
Petch's jaws dropped while watching him.

173
00:10:40,379 --> 00:10:41,899
I'm not close to him.

174
00:10:42,153 --> 00:10:43,251
He and I only go to the same school.

175
00:10:43,251 --> 00:10:43,865
Mr. Err.

176
00:10:44,286 --> 00:10:46,556
Your schoolmate is a real genius.

177
00:10:46,556 --> 00:10:47,904
He's like a scientist.

178
00:10:48,683 --> 00:10:51,798
I think Mawin will be one of the top 3 this year.

179
00:10:52,598 --> 00:10:54,523
Not only the top 3,

180
00:10:54,523 --> 00:10:57,434
I think he will win the scholarship.

181
00:10:57,624 --> 00:10:59,989
At first, I thought Mangpor would get it.

182
00:11:00,789 --> 00:11:01,757
I'm Mangpor.

183
00:11:01,926 --> 00:11:02,935
Okay, Mangpor.

184
00:11:03,525 --> 00:11:04,269
I'm Err.

185
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,846
You are close with Mawin, aren't you?

186
00:11:06,331 --> 00:11:07,480
You are his roommate, right?

187
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,128
Yes, we are roommates but…

188
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:11,596
Then you know everything about him.

189
00:11:11,828 --> 00:11:13,962
What does his study schedule look like?

190
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:15,425
Which cram school does he attend?

191
00:11:15,594 --> 00:11:16,596
Who is his tutoring partner?

192
00:11:16,806 --> 00:11:17,775
Which textbook does he read?

193
00:11:17,944 --> 00:11:19,726
You need to tell us everything.

194
00:11:20,758 --> 00:11:22,780
I only shared a room with him for one night.

195
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:24,030
And…

196
00:11:24,873 --> 00:11:26,000
I don't know…

197
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,760
I don't care.

198
00:11:27,076 --> 00:11:29,300
You need to find all the info about him tonight.

199
00:11:30,164 --> 00:11:31,123
I'm not sure.

200
00:11:31,376 --> 00:11:33,237
I don't want to pry into his personal business.

201
00:11:33,237 --> 00:11:34,036
You can't do that.

202
00:11:34,036 --> 00:11:37,671
Don't you see he is topping the chart for two days?

203
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,644
even though he barely answers any questions?

204
00:11:48,733 --> 00:11:50,759
[How do I start a convo with someone?]

205
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,030
[Start from getting to know that person.]

206
00:11:54,389 --> 00:11:57,213
[Find things that they like or enjoy.]

207
00:11:59,151 --> 00:11:59,925
Right?

208
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:01,300
What does he enjoy?

209
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:06,347
Is he secretly working on math questions?

210
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:17,474
Is he listening to a lesson summary?

211
00:13:18,809 --> 00:13:19,701
What are you doing?

212
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:02,342
[Should I forget about the mission?]

213
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:04,171
[I'm afraid that Mawin will find out
about the fortune teller.]

214
00:14:05,556 --> 00:14:06,816
[If he finds out, so what?]

215
00:14:06,816 --> 00:14:09,196
[You won't see him again
if you get the scholarship.]

216
00:14:09,196 --> 00:14:09,937
[Why do you need to be scared of him?]

217
00:14:10,619 --> 00:14:12,293
[But he's really scary, Benz.]

218
00:14:14,938 --> 00:14:17,775
[He's a human like you.
Why are you so afraid of him?]

219
00:14:19,945 --> 00:14:22,221
[He's so reserved and weird.]

220
00:14:22,221 --> 00:14:23,999
[It's like he eats math questions
instead of meals.]

221
00:14:25,983 --> 00:14:26,701
Hey.

222
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:30,341
Where is the kitchen?

223
00:14:31,374 --> 00:14:32,261
I'm hungry.

224
00:14:40,196 --> 00:14:41,074
Give it to me to put the pot on.

225
00:14:45,434 --> 00:14:46,596
No, it might get a burn mark.

226
00:14:47,195 --> 00:14:48,442
Isn't it just a rough notebook?

227
00:14:49,227 --> 00:14:50,284
Can't I use it?

228
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,291
Come on. It's hot.

229
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:17,161
Say it.

230
00:15:18,917 --> 00:15:19,599
What?

231
00:15:20,322 --> 00:15:22,341
Didn't you try to start a convo with me
earlier today?

232
00:15:23,498 --> 00:15:24,192
So talk to me.

233
00:15:32,913 --> 00:15:34,190
Does your name have a meaning?

234
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,945
Yes, it's a Mandarin word.

235
00:15:39,358 --> 00:15:40,212
It means “two”, right?

236
00:15:41,101 --> 00:15:42,075
Does your brother's name mean “one”?

237
00:15:43,811 --> 00:15:44,519
Yes.

238
00:15:44,932 --> 00:15:45,990
My grandma gave us the names.

239
00:15:50,681 --> 00:15:51,922
What about you?

240
00:15:52,335 --> 00:15:53,417
Don't you have a nickname?

241
00:15:53,975 --> 00:15:56,687
My name is easier to pronounce
than Prik-Klua.

242
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,963
What is the name of the boy with a broken arm?

243
00:16:06,745 --> 00:16:07,414
Mara.

244
00:16:09,563 --> 00:16:11,527
There are thousands of vegetables and fruits,

245
00:16:11,816 --> 00:16:12,907
but he is named Mara, as in bitter melon.

246
00:16:19,788 --> 00:16:21,056
You are a genius.

247
00:16:21,325 --> 00:16:23,161
Everyone in the class complimented you to me.

248
00:16:24,732 --> 00:16:27,693
I told you I know that.

249
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:35,050
Don't you want to eat it?

250
00:16:38,315 --> 00:16:39,213
No,

251
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:41,444
it has too much MSG.
If I eat it, I'll keep feeling thirsty.

252
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:43,565
If you feel thirsty, then drink water.

253
00:16:44,474 --> 00:16:46,115
If I drink a lot of water,
I'll have to go to the bathroom often.

254
00:16:46,384 --> 00:16:47,483
It'll interrupt my focus while studying.

255
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:50,238
Is it that big of a deal?

256
00:16:53,338 --> 00:16:54,863
I'm not a genius like you.

257
00:16:58,665 --> 00:16:59,452
I won't eat it.

258
00:17:00,632 --> 00:17:01,799
I eat only food that is beneficial for me.

259
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:06,648
If you eat it,

260
00:17:08,322 --> 00:17:11,410
I'll tell you
what I've been listening to all this time.

261
00:17:15,481 --> 00:17:16,860
Is this beneficial for you?

262
00:17:33,382 --> 00:17:34,272
Err.

263
00:17:35,037 --> 00:17:38,763
Did you find out how your friend studies?

264
00:17:38,908 --> 00:17:40,342
What workbook does he use?

265
00:17:40,631 --> 00:17:42,020
Which cram school does he attend?

266
00:17:43,239 --> 00:17:44,340
I don't know.

267
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:47,159
He didn't tell me anything.

268
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,823
How can you know nothing?

269
00:17:49,195 --> 00:17:51,108
You've been with him for two nights.

270
00:17:53,815 --> 00:17:55,308
Are you secretly studying like him?

271
00:17:56,548 --> 00:17:58,568
No, why would I do that?

272
00:17:58,568 --> 00:18:00,514
He really didn't tell me anything.

273
00:18:04,488 --> 00:18:06,229
What were you talking about Mawin?

274
00:18:06,766 --> 00:18:08,312
It was so loud that I could hear it from the door.

275
00:18:22,697 --> 00:18:24,630
CREATE AN EQUILATERAL TRIANGLE
WITH A COMPASS AND A STRAIGHTEDGE.
(Many of you are worried about geometry.)

276
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:25,867
(Many of you are worried about geometry.)

277
00:18:25,867 --> 00:18:27,688
(Don't worry.)

278
00:18:27,688 --> 00:18:31,389
(If you know how to use a compass well,
you can solve any questions.)

279
00:18:31,389 --> 00:18:33,799
(A compass is your weapon.)

280
00:18:34,371 --> 00:18:35,971
Mhee, I'll go get my compass.

281
00:18:35,971 --> 00:18:36,540
Yeah.

282
00:18:42,326 --> 00:18:43,365
I'm done using it.

283
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:24,613
You heard it, didn't you?

284
00:19:25,584 --> 00:19:26,852
My conversation with Mangpor.

285
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:29,408
I'm sorry.

286
00:19:38,893 --> 00:19:39,572
About what?

287
00:19:40,895 --> 00:19:42,601
I didn't mean to do that.

288
00:19:43,118 --> 00:19:44,159
Those guys complimented you to me.

289
00:19:44,159 --> 00:19:45,814
They asked me about your secrets
to doing well in class.

290
00:19:47,178 --> 00:19:49,589
I wasn't trying to be your friend
because I wanted to know your secrets.

291
00:19:52,007 --> 00:19:53,067
I'm not mad at you.

292
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:55,140
If I were mad, I wouldn't lend it to you.

293
00:19:55,822 --> 00:19:56,428
Hey.

294
00:19:57,799 --> 00:19:58,638
Do you want to have dinner with me?

295
00:20:00,725 --> 00:20:01,895
I'll eat later.

296
00:20:02,226 --> 00:20:03,993
If I go now, other kids will feel uncomfortable.

297
00:20:04,654 --> 00:20:05,921
Why do you need to care about them?

298
00:20:06,396 --> 00:20:07,135
Just come with me.

299
00:20:08,272 --> 00:20:09,569
I'll eat MSG food with you.

300
00:20:12,297 --> 00:20:14,460
I'm not hungry. I want to rest.

301
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:34,240
[If I want to make up with someone,
what should I do?]

302
00:20:36,823 --> 00:20:39,970
[Find the thing that person wants
and give it to him.]

303
00:20:41,582 --> 00:20:42,949
The thing that he wants?

304
00:20:50,681 --> 00:20:51,622
Thanks.

305
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:52,580
Put it there.

306
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,981
I'll eat it after taking a shower.

307
00:21:00,239 --> 00:21:01,902
I'm not bringing only your meal.

308
00:21:02,832 --> 00:21:03,802
I bring two meal boxes.

309
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:10,065
Let's eat together.

310
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:23,126
♪ I can't take my eyes off you ♪

311
00:21:23,663 --> 00:21:27,194
♪ Ta da da da du ♪

312
00:21:27,401 --> 00:21:30,781
♪ Du du du du du ♪

313
00:21:31,318 --> 00:21:34,745
♪ Du du du du du ♪

314
00:21:34,879 --> 00:21:38,389
♪ Today, you came to study with me ♪

315
00:21:39,092 --> 00:21:40,897
Make some noise.

316
00:21:42,674 --> 00:21:45,230
Why are you frowning?

317
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:46,431
Smile.

318
00:21:46,431 --> 00:21:50,727
We need to get vitamins from sunlight, too.

319
00:21:50,727 --> 00:21:53,776
Can't we sit at our desk and study?

320
00:21:54,251 --> 00:21:56,307
This is so uncomfortable.

321
00:21:56,307 --> 00:21:57,723
It's not uncomfortable.

322
00:21:57,971 --> 00:22:00,285
This class is very simple.

323
00:22:00,285 --> 00:22:01,938
You don't need to do anything.

324
00:22:01,938 --> 00:22:07,959
What I want you to do is set up teams of five.

325
00:22:08,336 --> 00:22:09,482
Start.

326
00:22:10,618 --> 00:22:12,339
Teacher, teams of five.

327
00:22:12,339 --> 00:22:13,126
Are we going to play games?

328
00:22:14,696 --> 00:22:16,002
How did you know it?
It's just my guess.

329
00:22:18,151 --> 00:22:19,530
It'll be fun.

330
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:20,258
Does it require swimming?

331
00:22:20,258 --> 00:22:21,031
I want to swim.

332
00:22:21,031 --> 00:22:22,110
The pool will be part of the game.

333
00:22:23,577 --> 00:22:24,337
Really?

334
00:22:27,457 --> 00:22:28,465
There are three of us.

335
00:22:29,312 --> 00:22:29,949
We need two more.

336
00:22:31,685 --> 00:22:32,185
Ton.

337
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:32,830
Yes.

338
00:22:33,305 --> 00:22:34,042
Do you want to join our team?

339
00:22:35,013 --> 00:22:35,864
Miss Mangpor.

340
00:22:36,133 --> 00:22:36,717
What about this team?

341
00:22:37,936 --> 00:22:38,833
We'll join you.

342
00:22:41,417 --> 00:22:42,371
Mawin, hello.

343
00:22:43,859 --> 00:22:45,469
This girl is so annoying.

344
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:48,131
Alright, everyone.

345
00:22:48,338 --> 00:22:49,562
Today,

346
00:22:49,996 --> 00:22:53,284
this class is about easy basic math questions.

347
00:22:53,883 --> 00:22:58,250
You'll have 20 seconds to answer each question.

348
00:22:58,374 --> 00:23:00,462
In each round,

349
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:02,297
one of the team members will be a hostage.

350
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:05,960
If your team fails to answer in time,

351
00:23:06,291 --> 00:23:07,931
the hostage will go into the water.

352
00:23:09,997 --> 00:23:15,385
First, find who will be the hostage of your team.

353
00:23:16,316 --> 00:23:17,209
The first hostage.

354
00:23:17,788 --> 00:23:18,450
Who will it be?

355
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:25,172
Listen.

356
00:23:25,668 --> 00:23:28,010
20 seconds seems like enough time.
But it's actually not.

357
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:29,916
It doesn't seem like enough time.
It's a very short time.

358
00:23:29,916 --> 00:23:31,887
If you get the answer, just say it.

359
00:23:31,887 --> 00:23:34,237
Wait for another two votes supporting it
before answering.

360
00:23:34,237 --> 00:23:35,967
So we won't get it wrong. Okay?

361
00:23:35,967 --> 00:23:36,874
That sounds good.

362
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:37,699
What do you think?

363
00:23:38,629 --> 00:23:41,575
With the time that we have,
we can only calculate it once.

364
00:23:42,392 --> 00:23:44,081
We need to listen to the majority's votes.

365
00:23:44,081 --> 00:23:44,740
Okay?

366
00:23:45,339 --> 00:23:46,643
What if the votes are tied?

367
00:23:47,263 --> 00:23:49,147
You have to find the answer too and tell us.

368
00:23:49,994 --> 00:23:50,557
Yes.

369
00:23:51,383 --> 00:23:52,342
Let's do it this way.

370
00:23:52,879 --> 00:23:53,742
What about our team's name?

371
00:23:54,527 --> 00:23:56,837
Right. He told us to come up with a team name.

372
00:23:58,614 --> 00:23:59,773
Speedy math.

373
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:01,930
Are you living in the Bronze Age?

374
00:24:02,137 --> 00:24:03,602
Don't you have a cool name?

375
00:24:03,602 --> 00:24:04,557
Quick math.

376
00:24:04,908 --> 00:24:07,008
You don't need to follow your boss every step.

377
00:24:10,066 --> 00:24:10,828
You need to suggest a name, too.

378
00:24:11,242 --> 00:24:12,208
I have no idea.

379
00:24:13,551 --> 00:24:15,081
You need to come up with a name, too.

380
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:16,766
You're our team's ace.

381
00:24:22,655 --> 00:24:23,717
I read this on the internet.

382
00:24:24,668 --> 00:24:25,870
My love multiplies.

383
00:24:28,391 --> 00:24:29,382
Does it sound too tacky?

384
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:33,832
My love multiplies.

385
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:36,066
It's not divided?

386
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:37,568
Cool name.

387
00:24:40,547 --> 00:24:41,579
Alright.

388
00:24:41,827 --> 00:24:44,868
The first team, My Love Multiplies.

389
00:24:45,199 --> 00:24:47,586
I'll remind you again.

390
00:24:47,937 --> 00:24:50,879
You have 20 seconds for each question.

391
00:24:50,879 --> 00:24:51,523
Are you ready?

392
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:52,599
Are you ready, the hostage?

393
00:24:53,095 --> 00:24:54,061
Okay.

394
00:24:54,557 --> 00:24:55,493
The first question.

395
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:59,445
Three times log base 27 of 64 equals what?

396
00:24:59,445 --> 00:24:59,945
4.

397
00:24:59,945 --> 00:25:00,795
My answer is also 4.

398
00:25:00,795 --> 00:25:01,420
4.

399
00:25:03,238 --> 00:25:03,825
4.

400
00:25:04,156 --> 00:25:04,826
Correct.

401
00:25:05,322 --> 00:25:06,342
Good job.

402
00:25:06,342 --> 00:25:08,587
You passed the first question.

403
00:25:08,897 --> 00:25:10,131
The second question.

404
00:25:10,358 --> 00:25:14,057
Sine 15 degrees plus sine 75 degrees
equals what?

405
00:25:14,057 --> 00:25:15,232
√6 / 2

406
00:25:15,397 --> 00:25:16,306
√6 / 2

407
00:25:16,699 --> 00:25:17,896
-√6 / 2

408
00:25:19,301 --> 00:25:20,258
√6 / 2

409
00:25:20,795 --> 00:25:21,840
√6 / 2

410
00:25:22,336 --> 00:25:22,927
Well done.

411
00:25:22,927 --> 00:25:23,503
Correct.

412
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,340
Why can't you say it faster?

413
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,578
Right. Why didn't you say it?

414
00:25:27,239 --> 00:25:28,820
The next question, ready?

415
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,116
The next question.

416
00:25:30,281 --> 00:25:37,915
The definite integral from -3 to 3 of
x2025 + x, with respect to x, equals what?

417
00:25:38,762 --> 00:25:39,539
0?

418
00:25:40,254 --> 00:25:41,199
My answer is also 0.

419
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:42,264
I don't know.

420
00:25:42,843 --> 00:25:43,434
0.

421
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:44,313
Good job.

422
00:25:44,313 --> 00:25:44,892
Correct.

423
00:25:48,281 --> 00:25:49,567
The last question.

424
00:25:50,373 --> 00:25:54,397
The square root of 5 minus
2 times the square root of 6 equals what?

425
00:25:54,397 --> 00:25:55,535
√3 - √2

426
00:25:56,816 --> 00:25:58,461
But my answer is √2 - √3.

427
00:25:58,647 --> 00:26:00,010
Isn't it √3 - √2?

428
00:26:00,217 --> 00:26:01,272
√3 - √2.

429
00:26:01,272 --> 00:26:02,320
Shall I answer?

430
00:26:02,733 --> 00:26:04,010
Wait. Let me calculate again.

431
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:05,435
Mangpor, we don't have time.
Just answer.

432
00:26:05,435 --> 00:26:07,370
It's √3 - √2. Tell him.

433
00:26:09,126 --> 00:26:10,584
√3 - √2.

434
00:26:12,051 --> 00:26:13,246
Correct.

435
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:15,661
You almost didn't answer it in time.

436
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:20,314
Well done.

437
00:26:20,314 --> 00:26:21,328
- Give them a round of applause.
- Ton.

438
00:26:21,493 --> 00:26:22,972
You are safe.

439
00:26:22,972 --> 00:26:24,660
He almost didn't make it.

440
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:25,564
Let me give you a hug.

441
00:26:25,564 --> 00:26:26,945
The next team, come here.

442
00:26:26,945 --> 00:26:31,300
The Unafraid of Division team.

443
00:26:31,547 --> 00:26:33,261
Ton, why didn't you say it faster?

444
00:26:33,261 --> 00:26:34,003
We almost didn't get it in time.

445
00:26:34,003 --> 00:26:35,353
They must read the same website as you.

446
00:26:35,932 --> 00:26:36,698
What do you mean?

447
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:38,109
Unafraid of division.

448
00:26:38,605 --> 00:26:40,060
You are making fun of me again.

449
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,042
I don't spend much time on the internet.

450
00:26:42,166 --> 00:26:43,087
I believe you.

451
00:26:43,273 --> 00:26:44,775
This joke was played ten years ago.

452
00:26:48,109 --> 00:26:49,769
Did you see Ton's face?

453
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,256
His face went pale.

454
00:26:51,987 --> 00:26:52,628
It was so funny.

455
00:26:52,628 --> 00:26:54,725
Mr. Mhee, can I sit with you?

456
00:26:56,712 --> 00:26:58,666
Mr. Ton, please have a seat.

457
00:26:58,891 --> 00:27:00,171
Thank you.

458
00:27:00,621 --> 00:27:03,186
We are the “My Love Multiplies” team.

459
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:06,372
Mawin, the name is dope and modern.

460
00:27:06,897 --> 00:27:08,972
I won't help you create a team name next time.

461
00:27:08,972 --> 00:27:10,383
Mr. Mhee, stop teasing him.

462
00:27:10,552 --> 00:27:12,777
My dad used this joke
when hitting on my mom.

463
00:27:13,696 --> 00:27:15,520
Your dad was so cool.

464
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,337
Of course, he was cool.

465
00:27:18,337 --> 00:27:20,132
He was romantic.

466
00:27:20,132 --> 00:27:23,796
I think he's as romantic as Mr. Mawin.

467
00:27:24,752 --> 00:27:25,252
Hey.

468
00:27:30,838 --> 00:27:31,773
Did you have fun today?

469
00:27:33,348 --> 00:27:33,978
Yeah.

470
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:48,296
We are now friends.

471
00:27:49,271 --> 00:27:50,450
I also had a lot of fun today.

472
00:28:30,928 --> 00:28:32,532
Can you solve this question?

473
00:28:32,832 --> 00:28:33,520
You can do it.

474
00:28:38,677 --> 00:28:39,669
Anyone?

475
00:28:41,375 --> 00:28:42,936
Be confident. Raise your hand.

476
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:50,125
NO.8 ANANTACHAI KRAIKAEW

477
00:28:56,123 --> 00:28:56,980
Have you had the answer?

478
00:29:02,735 --> 00:29:03,513
So?

479
00:29:04,488 --> 00:29:06,634
Why does it take you so long?

480
00:29:07,009 --> 00:29:09,119
Other students outside the camp
probably got it by now.

481
00:29:14,743 --> 00:29:16,858
NO.6 ANANTACHAI KRAIKAEW

482
00:29:18,676 --> 00:29:19,745
What?

483
00:29:20,251 --> 00:29:22,036
Why didn't you tell me?

484
00:29:22,036 --> 00:29:23,033
Let me have a bite.

485
00:29:23,033 --> 00:29:25,535
Mhee.

486
00:29:26,697 --> 00:29:27,264
Mhee.

487
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:28,152
Mhee.

488
00:29:55,821 --> 00:29:56,956
Class dismissed.

489
00:29:57,106 --> 00:29:57,929
Thank you.

490
00:29:59,166 --> 00:29:59,956
Guys.

491
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,777
The probability questions in today's class
are very difficult.

492
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:04,080
Shall we study more together?

493
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:06,319
Hey.

494
00:30:07,481 --> 00:30:08,542
Do you want to study with us?

495
00:30:09,292 --> 00:30:09,898
Sure.

496
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:21,323
This question was in this camp's exam
five years ago.

497
00:30:21,454 --> 00:30:22,561
Is there anyone who wants to solve it?

498
00:30:45,433 --> 00:30:45,978
Mawin.

499
00:30:47,665 --> 00:30:48,688
Can you go help Mhee?

500
00:30:51,125 --> 00:30:52,512
Let him do it.

501
00:31:07,584 --> 00:31:08,099
Everyone.

502
00:31:11,398 --> 00:31:12,674
Let's change the way we study.

503
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:25,159
Sister, are you saying I'm the culprit?

504
00:31:27,708 --> 00:31:30,754
Didn't you attack my boyfriend in the last round?

505
00:31:31,691 --> 00:31:35,841
I survived because of your love, Lady Petch.

506
00:31:36,028 --> 00:31:37,107
Honey.

507
00:31:38,607 --> 00:31:41,567
Which one of you did it?

508
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:43,142
Who is the culprit?

509
00:31:43,404 --> 00:31:45,695
I told you Petch is the culprit.

510
00:31:46,164 --> 00:31:47,344
Miss Mangpor.

511
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:57,445
I told you.

512
00:31:57,839 --> 00:32:01,087
You cannot trust Lady Petch.

513
00:32:01,087 --> 00:32:02,592
Is it because I'm just a maid?

514
00:32:02,592 --> 00:32:04,155
So none of you believe me.

515
00:32:06,442 --> 00:32:07,135
Gardener.

516
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,239
Tell them that I'm telling the truth.

517
00:32:18,042 --> 00:32:21,273
There's a high chance
that Lady Petch is the culprit.

518
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:25,250
But I think we should suspect the doctor.

519
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:26,771
How insolent!

520
00:32:27,108 --> 00:32:28,554
You're just a gardener.

521
00:32:28,554 --> 00:32:29,647
How dare you judge me?

522
00:32:29,647 --> 00:32:32,123
I brought this doctor from Bangkok.

523
00:32:32,123 --> 00:32:33,647
Actually, I'm a doctor.

524
00:32:33,947 --> 00:32:35,901
I saved Prik-klua's life last night.

525
00:32:36,313 --> 00:32:39,078
The fake doctor and Grandma,

526
00:32:39,078 --> 00:32:40,784
you two are the culprits.

527
00:32:41,196 --> 00:32:42,834
Hold on.

528
00:32:42,984 --> 00:32:45,597
Hold on. You guys are being fooled by him.

529
00:32:45,709 --> 00:32:48,058
I'm the real doctor. He's not.

530
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,219
I saved his life in the last round.

531
00:32:51,175 --> 00:32:51,816
Wait.

532
00:32:52,266 --> 00:32:54,294
Didn't you say that Mawin was the culprit?

533
00:32:54,631 --> 00:32:55,953
Then why did you save his life?

534
00:32:56,309 --> 00:32:58,157
I had to make my choice at the moment.

535
00:32:58,757 --> 00:32:59,924
But I also suspected him.

536
00:32:59,924 --> 00:33:01,338
Everyone,

537
00:33:01,338 --> 00:33:03,550
I think we should vote Mhee out in this round.

538
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:05,181
We can vote Golf out in the next round.

539
00:33:05,481 --> 00:33:06,623
It's time to vote.

540
00:33:06,698 --> 00:33:08,388
I'll count to three, then you cast your vote.

541
00:33:08,688 --> 00:33:11,131
One, two, three, vote.

542
00:33:16,923 --> 00:33:19,489
Are you sure
you're the top talents of the nation?

543
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:20,928
I can't believe it.

544
00:33:26,646 --> 00:33:27,542
It must be him.

545
00:33:28,536 --> 00:33:29,880
I think it's Mawin.

546
00:33:30,161 --> 00:33:31,433
I don't know.

547
00:33:31,808 --> 00:33:33,894
Hold on. Weren't you on my side?

548
00:33:34,794 --> 00:33:35,867
Is Mawin the culprit?

549
00:33:35,867 --> 00:33:36,490
Right?

550
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,907
Why do you put a wet towel on the bedhead?

551
00:34:03,938 --> 00:34:04,564
That?

552
00:34:07,638 --> 00:34:08,782
My throat often feels dry.

553
00:34:08,876 --> 00:34:11,672
My mom put a wet towel on my bedhead.

554
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:12,873
It helps.

555
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:14,716
Really?

556
00:34:15,166 --> 00:34:16,035
You should try it too.

557
00:34:16,185 --> 00:34:18,733
I saw you often coughing at night.

558
00:34:21,151 --> 00:34:21,703
Hey.

559
00:34:22,865 --> 00:34:24,488
It was so funny to gang up on Mhee
during the game today.

560
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:26,891
At first, I was going to kill him.

561
00:34:27,547 --> 00:34:28,992
But Mangpor said we should spare him.

562
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:30,461
Because no one paid attention to him anyway.

563
00:34:34,379 --> 00:34:35,529
Did you have fun?

564
00:34:36,804 --> 00:34:37,420
Yes.

565
00:34:38,057 --> 00:34:38,608
What about you?

566
00:34:39,264 --> 00:34:41,430
I love board games.

567
00:34:41,936 --> 00:34:43,459
When I was young,

568
00:34:43,459 --> 00:34:44,880
I often went to a board game café.

569
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,011
I had my go-to place.

570
00:34:46,161 --> 00:34:47,785
Many board game pros went to this place.

571
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,401
I love playing with them.

572
00:34:50,401 --> 00:34:53,246
Next time, you, Benz, Mhee, and I
should go there together.

573
00:34:53,246 --> 00:34:53,781
Do you want to go?

574
00:35:02,974 --> 00:35:04,354
I like board games too.

575
00:35:06,172 --> 00:35:07,611
But I don't have any friends to play with.

576
00:35:09,992 --> 00:35:10,973
Thank you so much.

577
00:35:11,554 --> 00:35:12,792
I had a great time today.

578
00:35:16,316 --> 00:35:16,880
Right.

579
00:35:18,098 --> 00:35:21,222
I haven't told you the answer in exchange
for you eating the instant noodles.

580
00:35:25,946 --> 00:35:27,320
The secret thing that you were listening to?

581
00:35:28,201 --> 00:35:28,749
Yes.

582
00:35:30,305 --> 00:35:32,590
I'll let you guess what I was listening to.

583
00:35:33,621 --> 00:35:35,839
I think it's a lesson summary,

584
00:35:37,001 --> 00:35:41,615
Maybe a foreign tutor teaches equilibrium theory?

585
00:35:43,396 --> 00:35:46,087
Were you listening to Mozart?

586
00:35:47,437 --> 00:35:49,000
What is it? I ran out of ideas.

587
00:35:49,619 --> 00:35:52,004
(But he's really quick on my IG stories.)

588
00:35:52,004 --> 00:35:53,264
(Aren't you reading too much into it?)

589
00:35:53,545 --> 00:35:55,918
(I'm also quick on IG stories of Korean stars.)

590
00:35:56,274 --> 00:35:57,543
(You need to understand…)

591
00:35:57,918 --> 00:36:00,178
Is this Once More with Stories by Tle?

592
00:36:01,603 --> 00:36:02,646
You are listening to the radio?

593
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,002
While we were listening to the teacher,

594
00:36:07,302 --> 00:36:08,697
you were listening to the radio?

595
00:36:10,928 --> 00:36:11,974
It's very fun.

596
00:36:12,274 --> 00:36:13,934
Shows are rotating all day.

597
00:36:14,234 --> 00:36:15,761
People say whatever they want.

598
00:36:17,636 --> 00:36:19,070
I can't believe it.

599
00:36:20,195 --> 00:36:22,100
There are many fun shows.

600
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:26,506
In the afternoon, there are shows
about agriculture and housework.

601
00:36:26,693 --> 00:36:28,429
At night, there's a ghost story show.

602
00:36:28,541 --> 00:36:31,283
I listen to it and fall asleep.

603
00:36:31,283 --> 00:36:33,024
There's a news show in the morning.

604
00:36:33,605 --> 00:36:34,702
They are very fun.

605
00:36:38,564 --> 00:36:41,135
This is the first time
I heard you say something this long.

606
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:46,695
(He's quick on your IG stories and asks you
to work with him on a school assignment…)

607
00:36:46,845 --> 00:36:48,002
You seem to really like it.

608
00:36:50,008 --> 00:36:51,398
(But that's not all.)

609
00:36:52,204 --> 00:36:53,263
(When he looks at me.)

610
00:36:53,694 --> 00:36:55,010
(When our eyes meet.)

611
00:36:55,441 --> 00:36:57,204
(Though it's only a few seconds long,)

612
00:36:57,504 --> 00:36:59,089
(I can really feel it, Tle.)

613
00:37:00,832 --> 00:37:02,448
(I don't know what he thinks of me.)

614
00:37:02,842 --> 00:37:03,998
(But I think there's something between us.)

615
00:37:04,729 --> 00:37:06,225
(My heart is racing.)

616
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,637
(I don't know how to act.)

617
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:10,257
(My head goes blank.)

618
00:37:11,644 --> 00:37:13,474
(Do you think I have feelings for him?)

619
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,563
(I feel shy talking about it.)

620
00:37:16,557 --> 00:37:19,347
(Tle, do you think I have feelings for him?)

621
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:27,505
(Gosh, I'm blushing listening to you.)

622
00:37:39,953 --> 00:37:42,476
(Today's weather is unstable.)

623
00:37:42,476 --> 00:37:44,956
(Heavy rain is expected in the morning.)

624
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:46,854
(Blazing hot weather is expected
in the afternoon.)

625
00:37:47,065 --> 00:37:48,734
(Breezy weather is expected in the evening.)

626
00:37:49,051 --> 00:37:52,612
(The weather is unstable and unpredictable.)

627
00:37:57,642 --> 00:37:58,142
Hey.

628
00:37:59,057 --> 00:38:00,809
Are you going to eat it while standing,
like when you drink cocktails?

629
00:38:03,641 --> 00:38:04,360
Go take a seat.

630
00:38:07,122 --> 00:38:08,177
Can you sit with him?

631
00:38:08,986 --> 00:38:09,999
I have to talk to Pornthep.

632
00:38:13,478 --> 00:38:14,125
What's wrong with him?

633
00:38:20,633 --> 00:38:22,338
Win, can I sit with you?

634
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:24,657
What's wrong with Err?

635
00:38:26,072 --> 00:38:27,621
Why are you listening to music all the time?

636
00:38:38,244 --> 00:38:39,466
Well done, Mangpor.

637
00:38:39,677 --> 00:38:40,788
Your question is excellent.

638
00:38:41,069 --> 00:38:42,250
But it's really hard, right?

639
00:38:45,205 --> 00:38:47,831
You told me to create a difficult question.

640
00:38:48,675 --> 00:38:50,512
Sugus's question is also hard.

641
00:38:51,427 --> 00:38:52,598
Difficult questions are good.

642
00:38:53,354 --> 00:38:55,020
Everyone, check your answer.

643
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:56,486
If your answer is close to this, you did well.

644
00:38:58,333 --> 00:39:01,135
You came up with questions
for your classmates to solve.

645
00:39:01,364 --> 00:39:02,421
Did you have fun?

646
00:39:03,001 --> 00:39:03,749
It's fun, right?

647
00:39:03,855 --> 00:39:04,983
I had fun too.

648
00:39:05,282 --> 00:39:06,134
Who will be next?

649
00:39:06,609 --> 00:39:08,315
Top student, Mawin, come out.

650
00:39:09,511 --> 00:39:10,134
Come here.

651
00:39:21,443 --> 00:39:23,509
The mission given by your fortune teller,

652
00:39:24,089 --> 00:39:24,850
how does it go?

653
00:39:27,879 --> 00:39:28,868
It's not going anywhere.

654
00:39:30,169 --> 00:39:31,090
I get it.

655
00:39:31,424 --> 00:39:33,801
Your friend is scary smart.

656
00:39:33,801 --> 00:39:35,708
I won't play games with him anymore.

657
00:39:35,866 --> 00:39:37,477
How can he be good at everything?

658
00:39:39,552 --> 00:39:42,070
Are you sure they can solve your question?

659
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,726
Everyone, give it a try.

660
00:40:20,263 --> 00:40:20,885
Yes?

661
00:40:21,361 --> 00:40:22,864
The answer is 138.

662
00:40:23,356 --> 00:40:24,202
138?

663
00:40:25,274 --> 00:40:26,115
Mawin, reveal the answer.

664
00:40:27,522 --> 00:40:29,002
The answer is 138.

665
00:40:29,987 --> 00:40:30,667
Correct.

666
00:40:34,888 --> 00:40:36,542
Well done.
Mawin, go back to your seat.

667
00:40:38,406 --> 00:40:39,778
Who will be next?

668
00:40:41,836 --> 00:40:42,392
Win.

669
00:40:43,307 --> 00:40:45,022
If you're going to create such a difficult question,

670
00:40:45,128 --> 00:40:46,837
no one can solve it.

671
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:50,268
Mawin, if you're going to study abroad,
will you come back and work as a teacher?

672
00:40:50,444 --> 00:40:51,256
I'm rooting for you.

673
00:40:53,595 --> 00:40:55,162
It's good to be a genius.

674
00:40:55,707 --> 00:40:56,730
Do you have other difficult questions?

675
00:40:57,715 --> 00:40:58,446
Can you share them with me?

676
00:40:58,833 --> 00:41:00,470
When I can solve it,
they will compliment me too.

677
00:41:01,473 --> 00:41:02,443
Are you serious?

678
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:03,424
Yes.

679
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:05,021
You promise.

680
00:41:06,235 --> 00:41:07,178
You promise, Mhee?

681
00:41:07,178 --> 00:41:07,678
Yes.

682
00:41:08,874 --> 00:41:09,825
You promise.

683
00:41:10,476 --> 00:41:11,498
You need to keep your word.

684
00:41:12,659 --> 00:41:14,433
I don't care if you two are from Boromavidya.

685
00:41:14,433 --> 00:41:18,595
I also got A's
in both core and selective mathematics.

686
00:41:18,595 --> 00:41:21,536
It's so easy, chill, and simple.

687
00:41:35,512 --> 00:41:37,948
Damn, it's freaking hard.

688
00:41:41,536 --> 00:41:42,536
I knew it.

689
00:41:49,008 --> 00:41:50,331
Your question is hard.

690
00:41:50,331 --> 00:41:51,507
No one can solve it.

691
00:41:52,949 --> 00:41:54,850
But you are the first who solve it.

692
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:55,909
Why didn't you raise your hand to answer?

693
00:41:58,670 --> 00:41:59,421
I don't know.

694
00:41:59,421 --> 00:42:00,404
I was afraid I might be wrong.

695
00:42:03,236 --> 00:42:04,130
If you're wrong, so what?

696
00:42:07,426 --> 00:42:08,189
I don't know.

697
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,538
When we played the game at the pool,

698
00:42:11,259 --> 00:42:12,562
I was afraid to say the answer first.

699
00:42:12,562 --> 00:42:13,832
I waited until a team member said it first.

700
00:42:14,201 --> 00:42:17,161
I didn't feel confident in my answer.

701
00:42:20,327 --> 00:42:21,724
You believe in everyone,

702
00:42:25,031 --> 00:42:26,073
but yourself.

703
00:42:30,224 --> 00:42:31,496
Try to have some faith in yourself.

704
00:42:33,677 --> 00:42:35,102
If you get it wrong, just do it again.

705
00:42:37,775 --> 00:42:38,555
It's not a big deal.

706
00:42:43,237 --> 00:42:44,058
Go and solve it.

707
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:53,380
There's only me in this room.

708
00:42:56,018 --> 00:42:57,085
You don't need to worry about getting it wrong.

709
00:44:38,208 --> 00:44:41,672
(For racing horses, waking up early or late,)

710
00:44:42,006 --> 00:44:43,694
(or stop to have some fun along the way,)

711
00:44:44,943 --> 00:44:46,636
(it's not a big deal.)

712
00:44:54,181 --> 00:44:57,233
(Even when they get the answer wrong,)

713
00:44:58,816 --> 00:44:59,741
(it's okay.)

714
00:45:23,272 --> 00:45:24,805
(When we are running together,)

715
00:45:25,086 --> 00:45:27,055
(it can be more joyful
than reaching the finish line.)

716
00:45:29,148 --> 00:45:31,829
[Seer, I have nothing to update today.]

717
00:45:31,970 --> 00:45:34,721
[I suddenly have this confidence.]

718
00:45:35,442 --> 00:45:36,712
[I can do it.]

719
00:45:56,009 --> 00:45:58,392
Are you following the fortune teller's advice?

720
00:45:58,814 --> 00:46:00,555
If you really want this scholarship,

721
00:46:00,555 --> 00:46:02,533
you need to make him fall for you.

722
00:46:02,533 --> 00:46:03,588
We only spend a few days together.

723
00:46:03,588 --> 00:46:04,611
There's no way he will fall for me.

724
00:46:04,611 --> 00:46:06,782
If I fall for you, you will win this scholarship, right?

725
00:46:06,782 --> 00:46:08,669
It happens all the time in drama series.

726
00:46:08,669 --> 00:46:11,494
You should take off the earphones and talk to people.

727
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:12,826
Who can I talk to?

728
00:46:12,949 --> 00:46:13,902
You have me.

729
00:46:14,113 --> 00:46:15,975
Attending this camp is quite fun.

730
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:16,863
How about you?

731
00:46:17,813 --> 00:46:19,280
Do you have fun spending time with me?

732
00:46:19,491 --> 00:46:20,088
