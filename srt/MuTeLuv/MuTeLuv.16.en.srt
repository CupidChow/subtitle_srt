1
00:00:06,328 --> 00:00:08,138
I’ll take it down.

2
00:00:08,886 --> 00:00:11,421
This is your place.

3
00:00:16,152 --> 00:00:19,343
(Sponsored by Shake Shake protein drink.)

4
00:00:22,455 --> 00:00:23,418
We are back.

5
00:00:23,418 --> 00:00:25,641
We are still with Klairung and Yohan.

6
00:00:25,641 --> 00:00:29,852
Yohan, may I ask 
how long you have been Klairung’s manager?

7
00:00:29,852 --> 00:00:30,924
It’s been a while.

8
00:00:30,924 --> 00:00:33,392
We’ve been friends for years.

9
00:00:33,392 --> 00:00:35,040
If you want to hire him, please contact us.

10
00:00:35,121 --> 00:00:37,160
Klairung is now famous.

11
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,337
He’s now famous.

12
00:00:38,337 --> 00:00:40,746
Klairung, can you tell me 
your secret to success?

13
00:00:40,746 --> 00:00:45,003
My dad told me that 
we all have our own strong points.

14
00:00:45,165 --> 00:00:47,076
Some have good luck.

15
00:00:47,319 --> 00:00:48,693
Some are hardworking.

16
00:00:49,178 --> 00:00:51,811
But he told me my strong point is…

17
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:54,056
my support system.

18
00:00:55,531 --> 00:00:57,377
Your dad’s words are well-spoken.

19
00:00:57,377 --> 00:00:58,226
Hello.

20
00:00:58,671 --> 00:00:59,377
What’s your name?

21
00:00:59,903 --> 00:01:01,193
Nawa.

22
00:01:01,314 --> 00:01:02,580
For Nawa.

23
00:01:03,227 --> 00:01:04,060
Thank you.

24
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:05,263
Go home safely.

25
00:01:07,285 --> 00:01:07,785
Hey.

26
00:01:07,785 --> 00:01:08,498
Hello.

27
00:01:08,498 --> 00:01:09,246
Hello.

28
00:01:09,246 --> 00:01:09,934
What’s your name?

29
00:01:10,136 --> 00:01:10,848
Kenji.

30
00:01:10,848 --> 00:01:11,593
Kenji.

31
00:01:11,714 --> 00:01:13,269
I’ll write a pretty autograph for you.

32
00:01:14,118 --> 00:01:14,818
Done.

33
00:01:15,222 --> 00:01:18,001
Rung, you are my idol.

34
00:01:18,789 --> 00:01:19,492
Really?

35
00:01:19,896 --> 00:01:20,649
Yes.

36
00:01:20,649 --> 00:01:22,627
Did you know how to box 
since you were born?

37
00:01:39,146 --> 00:01:40,419
Wow.

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,015
Kenji, listen to me.

39
00:01:44,662 --> 00:01:46,416
No one is born an expert.

40
00:01:46,416 --> 00:01:47,896
Everyone needs to learn and practice.

41
00:01:47,896 --> 00:01:49,166
How long have you practiced?

42
00:01:50,177 --> 00:01:51,227
You want to know it?

43
00:01:51,712 --> 00:01:53,834
If you want to know it, 
you need to study hard.

44
00:01:53,834 --> 00:01:56,163
When you grow up, you can join my club.

45
00:01:56,547 --> 00:02:00,798
I will train you. Okay?

46
00:02:00,798 --> 00:02:02,167
Yay!

47
00:02:02,652 --> 00:02:03,696
Mom.

48
00:02:03,696 --> 00:02:05,747
Klairung will teach me boxing.

49
00:02:05,747 --> 00:02:07,379
You must be happy.

50
00:02:16,443 --> 00:02:17,209
Yeah.

51
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,898
Yeah.

52
00:02:19,522 --> 00:02:20,513
Yeah

53
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,490
Go, faster.

54
00:02:22,591 --> 00:02:23,575
Faster.

55
00:02:23,575 --> 00:02:24,217
Okay.

56
00:02:24,217 --> 00:02:25,182
Okay.

57
00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:26,617
Yeah.

58
00:02:39,196 --> 00:02:39,916
Shit.

59
00:02:40,078 --> 00:02:40,773
Klairung.

60
00:02:43,502 --> 00:02:44,530
Are you okay?

61
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:45,221
Rung.

62
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,629
Are you alright?

63
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:49,489
Rung.

64
00:02:49,489 --> 00:02:50,416
I’m fine.

65
00:02:50,416 --> 00:02:51,567
I’m just tired.

66
00:02:52,355 --> 00:02:55,211
Fan signing is more tiring than boxing.

67
00:02:56,525 --> 00:02:57,214
Yeah.

68
00:02:57,497 --> 00:03:00,927
They came to meet you 
because they wanted to see you.

69
00:03:01,048 --> 00:03:04,293
The support you get comes from them.

70
00:03:04,293 --> 00:03:06,016
I know. I know.

71
00:03:06,016 --> 00:03:07,037
I’m not saying it’s a bad thing.

72
00:03:07,037 --> 00:03:08,199
It’s just a bit tiring.

73
00:03:09,169 --> 00:03:11,066
This is a good experience.

74
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:13,118
You’re a boxer and an influencer.

75
00:03:13,118 --> 00:03:14,655
You need to learn how to handle the crowd.

76
00:03:15,585 --> 00:03:17,610
Come to think about it.

77
00:03:18,641 --> 00:03:20,582
I’m curious how Sunrise is doing.

78
00:03:23,048 --> 00:03:23,880
Him?

79
00:03:24,244 --> 00:03:26,314
I think he has lost his mind.

80
00:03:26,476 --> 00:03:27,140
Look.

81
00:03:27,896 --> 00:03:30,424
This house is haunted.

82
00:03:30,424 --> 00:03:35,255
People said that an old man's spirit 
lives here to guard the house.

83
00:03:35,255 --> 00:03:37,828
He refused to move on to the next life.

84
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,156
I’m not Sunrise.

85
00:03:47,762 --> 00:03:50,575
I’m Grandpa Chanting.

86
00:03:53,345 --> 00:03:55,513
Everyone, he is very scary.

87
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,903
I’ll eat your liver.

88
00:03:57,903 --> 00:03:59,151
Help me.

89
00:04:00,971 --> 00:04:03,453
Thais are always wrapped up 
in paranormal events.

90
00:04:03,453 --> 00:04:04,430
But it’s good for them.

91
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:07,874
They look happy.

92
00:04:07,874 --> 00:04:08,677
Do you want water?

93
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,374
They will probably leave us alone now.

94
00:04:10,374 --> 00:04:11,007
You can have it.

95
00:04:11,795 --> 00:04:13,296
No, you should drink it.

96
00:04:13,296 --> 00:04:14,234
You should drink it.

97
00:04:14,234 --> 00:04:15,830
You were handing water to the boxers.
You should drink it.

98
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,771
I saved the last one for you.

99
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,786
Water.

100
00:04:19,574 --> 00:04:20,613
Will you drink it?

101
00:04:22,817 --> 00:04:25,429
I think the water could turn sweet.

102
00:04:25,952 --> 00:04:26,891
You are so sugary.

103
00:04:28,589 --> 00:04:30,382
You’re taking too much.

104
00:04:30,382 --> 00:04:31,526
Go wherever you want.

105
00:04:31,728 --> 00:04:32,392
Fine.

106
00:04:32,392 --> 00:04:33,266
Go away, Han.

107
00:04:33,408 --> 00:04:34,923
Fine, I’m leaving.

108
00:04:34,923 --> 00:04:40,489
Boys, please help me clear 
the signing booth outside.

109
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:42,625
I’ll buy you barbecue pork later this evening.

110
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:44,296
Barbecue pork?

111
00:04:44,296 --> 00:04:47,162
I’m coming. Get out of my way.

112
00:04:55,509 --> 00:04:56,118
Right.

113
00:04:56,381 --> 00:04:59,825
When will you join your agency’s training camp?

114
00:05:01,281 --> 00:05:02,771
Next week.

115
00:05:02,933 --> 00:05:04,705
I’ll go to Korea for training next month.

116
00:05:14,115 --> 00:05:14,811
Malai.

117
00:05:14,811 --> 00:05:15,476
Yes.

118
00:05:16,062 --> 00:05:18,186
I have something to ask you.

119
00:05:21,825 --> 00:05:22,858
Umm…

120
00:05:23,687 --> 00:05:25,069
The two of us.

121
00:05:29,638 --> 00:05:31,083
We should get into the talking stage.

122
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:32,225
But we are regularly talking to each other.

123
00:05:33,195 --> 00:05:34,474
Not that kind of talk.

124
00:05:34,717 --> 00:05:35,386
I mean…

125
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,126
The other kind of talk.

126
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,337
What kind?

127
00:05:39,995 --> 00:05:40,598
Umm.

128
00:05:44,681 --> 00:05:45,345
I…

129
00:05:48,276 --> 00:05:50,584
I mean the talking stage in relationships.

130
00:05:50,968 --> 00:05:51,629
No.

131
00:05:56,158 --> 00:05:58,067
We’ve been in the talking stage for some time.

132
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,529
We should be dating now.

133
00:06:03,016 --> 00:06:03,751
Dating?

134
00:06:04,135 --> 00:06:04,833
What?

135
00:06:05,884 --> 00:06:06,910
Do you mean it?

136
00:06:08,123 --> 00:06:08,862
Are you sure?

137
00:06:09,307 --> 00:06:10,060
Absolutely.

138
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,193
You are not lying, right?

139
00:06:11,476 --> 00:06:12,707
I mean it.

140
00:06:13,981 --> 00:06:15,012
Will you date me?

141
00:06:15,214 --> 00:06:16,104
Yes.

142
00:06:21,984 --> 00:06:23,554
Klairung.

143
00:06:28,028 --> 00:06:28,720
Hey.

144
00:06:29,286 --> 00:06:31,905
You can’t take it back later.

145
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,239
Then call me…

146
00:06:35,845 --> 00:06:39,486
My beautiful Malai.

147
00:06:41,306 --> 00:06:42,257
Come on.

148
00:06:42,762 --> 00:06:43,797
Say it.

149
00:06:44,747 --> 00:06:46,158
My beautiful Malai.

150
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,431
I didn’t hear it.

151
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:51,873
Beautiful Malai.

152
00:06:55,925 --> 00:06:57,008
What are you guys doing here?

153
00:06:58,807 --> 00:06:59,742
A swoon-worthy moment.

154
00:07:01,096 --> 00:07:02,519
You little pups.

155
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:05,037
What did you just do?

156
00:07:05,037 --> 00:07:07,527
You look so smitten.

157
00:07:08,902 --> 00:07:11,313
Malai, help me. They are teasing me.

158
00:07:12,445 --> 00:07:15,554
It looks like I need to perform Thai dance 
for Grandma again.

159
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:17,713
What do you mean?

160
00:07:17,713 --> 00:07:22,747
I asked her to help you two be together.

161
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:23,643
What?

162
00:07:24,533 --> 00:07:27,017
You two kept acting coy around each other.

163
00:07:27,017 --> 00:07:28,195
When would you end up together?

164
00:07:29,489 --> 00:07:32,890
That time when you prayed to her, 
didn’t you ask her to send you a boyfriend?

165
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:36,769
I already got my wish for some time.

166
00:07:39,444 --> 00:07:40,569
Damn.

167
00:07:41,762 --> 00:07:42,746
Why did you keep it a secret?

168
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:43,928
Anyway.

169
00:07:44,171 --> 00:07:47,773
You two haven’t performed the dance for her 
the last time.

170
00:07:47,773 --> 00:07:50,361
Then we should perform it together.

171
00:07:51,089 --> 00:07:52,415
I’ll go with you.

172
00:07:52,415 --> 00:07:53,525
I also play to her.

173
00:07:53,525 --> 00:07:55,246
I mean, I also pray to her.

174
00:07:56,136 --> 00:07:57,015
Me too.

175
00:07:57,015 --> 00:07:57,941
Me too.

176
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,721
Everyone in this club probably prayed to her.

177
00:08:02,894 --> 00:08:05,273
Then let’s perform the dance together.

178
00:08:05,273 --> 00:08:06,591
Come on.

179
00:08:06,813 --> 00:08:10,108
Malai’s grandma is probably watching 
Thai dance all day long.

180
00:08:25,415 --> 00:08:28,680
(Thank you, Grandma, 
for granting everyone’s wishes.)

181
00:08:29,105 --> 00:08:31,953
(But from now on, 
you should be a bit more picky.)

182
00:08:32,074 --> 00:08:34,490
(You should only grant wishes 
of those who are good people.)

183
00:08:34,712 --> 00:08:36,801
(Your main focus should be on Malai and me.)

184
00:08:36,801 --> 00:08:38,683
(Since we are your grandchildren.)

185
00:08:38,683 --> 00:08:39,863
(I’m her granddaughter.)

186
00:08:40,025 --> 00:08:42,169
(But how come you call yourself her grandson?)

187
00:08:42,492 --> 00:08:43,249
(I don’t know.)

188
00:08:43,896 --> 00:08:44,922
(Can I be her grandson-in-law?)

189
00:08:56,809 --> 00:08:59,592
(Now, I get it.)

190
00:08:59,835 --> 00:09:03,504
(We all have our own ways 
to reach our destination.)

191
00:09:03,827 --> 00:09:05,203
(Some take a bus.)

192
00:09:05,688 --> 00:09:06,602
(Some drive a car.)

193
00:09:07,229 --> 00:09:10,593
(Some have a shortcut that helps them 
get to the destination faster.)

194
00:09:11,907 --> 00:09:15,107
(Whether the road is easy or tough,)

195
00:09:15,329 --> 00:09:16,983
(we are the only ones…)

196
00:09:17,286 --> 00:09:19,288
(who can take us to the destination.)

197
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:32,092
(What Malai said is true.)

198
00:09:32,901 --> 00:09:35,890
(Hard work never betrays you.)

199
00:09:37,325 --> 00:09:41,101
(If it betrays me, I will kick its ass.)

200
00:09:43,358 --> 00:09:46,645
MUTELUV: FOOT FIST FUSION
FINAL EP: CAN YOU DO IT? WE CAN DO IT! 

201
00:09:50,386 --> 00:09:57,224
It all began with my belief 
that what you do determines your life.

202
00:09:57,709 --> 00:09:58,435
Am I right?

203
00:09:58,617 --> 00:10:00,773
You encounter misfortunes every other day.

204
00:10:00,773 --> 00:10:02,618
Yesterday, you were trapped in an elevator.

205
00:10:02,618 --> 00:10:04,620
Last week, you were pickpocketed

206
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:05,376
Last month…

207
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:06,070
Ouch.

208
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,814
Misfortunes are not a big deal.

209
00:10:11,137 --> 00:10:12,522
But what’s happening to me right now,

210
00:10:12,522 --> 00:10:14,228
I’m not sure it’s a misfortune or karma.

211
00:10:14,228 --> 00:10:17,141
My crush has never paid attention to me.

212
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:20,821
Nine can ask any pretty girls out.

213
00:10:20,821 --> 00:10:22,386
I told you to change your number.

214
00:10:22,608 --> 00:10:23,524
Then what?

215
00:10:23,645 --> 00:10:26,504
How can a new phone number help?

216
00:10:26,969 --> 00:10:27,872
Pick a number.

217
00:10:29,206 --> 00:10:31,512
LUCKY PHONE NUMBERS FOR LOVE

218
00:10:37,193 --> 00:10:38,051
Taew.

219
00:10:38,213 --> 00:10:38,721
Yes.

220
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:39,971
This is my new number.

221
00:10:39,971 --> 00:10:42,622
How is it? Do you become more desirable?

222
00:10:42,622 --> 00:10:43,581
My name is Leemhai.

223
00:10:44,289 --> 00:10:45,121
What’s your name?

224
00:10:48,113 --> 00:10:48,869
Now, I believe it.

225
00:10:49,414 --> 00:10:51,336
My life has totally changed 
after I changed my number.

226
00:10:51,336 --> 00:10:55,596
I feel that I can totally be myself 
when I’m with you.

227
00:10:57,072 --> 00:10:58,781
I want to be your friend too.

228
00:10:58,781 --> 00:11:00,805
When we feel lonely,

229
00:11:00,906 --> 00:11:02,475
we can pretend to be someone else again.

230
00:11:03,142 --> 00:11:04,205
Na.

231
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:05,646
I like you too.

232
00:11:06,819 --> 00:11:07,863
Congratulations,

233
00:11:07,863 --> 00:11:09,937
your crush finally asked you out.

234
00:11:09,937 --> 00:11:11,694
What’s going on with you?

235
00:11:11,694 --> 00:11:15,300
Why are a man and a woman fighting for you?

236
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:20,231
If you want to know whom to choose, 
you need to perform the ritual with both present.

237
00:11:20,231 --> 00:11:22,579
Na, when you smile, you look cute.

238
00:11:22,579 --> 00:11:25,235
The thing is, we have feelings for each other.

239
00:11:25,235 --> 00:11:26,403
Sorry, Nine.

240
00:11:26,403 --> 00:11:28,934
You are the one 
who needs to step out of our relationship.

241
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,409
Nine, I have something important to tell you.

242
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:37,799
Just accept it, and your life will be much easier.

243
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:40,696
The number helps boost your charms,

244
00:11:40,696 --> 00:11:42,792
but not your intellect.

245
00:11:42,792 --> 00:11:44,641
Na, are you hiding something from me?

246
00:11:44,641 --> 00:11:46,281
Stop pressuring me.

247
00:11:46,281 --> 00:11:49,225
I think Na said it clearly that she picked you.

248
00:11:49,225 --> 00:11:51,167
I don’t like women. I don’t like women.
