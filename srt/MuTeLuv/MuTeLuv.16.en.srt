Viewer discretion is advised.

4
00:00:13,535 --> 00:00:18,127
The cancellation fee is so expensive.

5
00:00:18,467 --> 00:00:20,432
The cancellation fee is only 30,000 baht.

6
00:00:20,432 --> 00:00:23,093
Biao always takes advantage of me.

7
00:00:23,093 --> 00:00:25,045
I lost my temper and kicked him.

8
00:00:25,045 --> 00:00:28,205
I now have to pay him 
another 20,000 baht as compensation.

9
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,800
If you are a powerful spirit like they said,

10
00:00:29,924 --> 00:00:33,762
please help me beat Baby Shark 
and become the university’s athlete.

11
00:00:36,522 --> 00:00:37,202
Sunrise.

12
00:00:37,459 --> 00:00:38,845
If you think you are the real deal,

13
00:00:39,433 --> 00:00:40,698
then don’t let me beat you.

14
00:00:47,961 --> 00:00:52,401
(The match between Baby Shark and 
Sunrise, the son of Sol, has begun.)

15
00:00:52,881 --> 00:00:55,143
(Sunrise keeps running away.)

16
00:00:55,143 --> 00:00:56,512
(He doesn’t fight back.)

17
00:00:56,512 --> 00:00:58,849
(Baby Shark is pressing forward.)

18
00:00:58,926 --> 00:01:00,528
(What will Baby Shark do next?)

19
00:01:00,528 --> 00:01:02,192
(Will he keep pressing forward?)

20
00:01:03,507 --> 00:01:04,529
(What is happening?)

21
00:01:04,684 --> 00:01:07,485
(Baby Shark is peeing on himself.)

22
00:01:07,593 --> 00:01:09,703
(This is the chance for Sunrise to attack.)

23
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,097
(He’s attacking Baby Shark.)

24
00:01:11,097 --> 00:01:12,126
(Baby Shark is running away.)

25
00:01:12,126 --> 00:01:14,782
(Baby Shark is too embarrassed. 
He runs out of the ring.)

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,286
(The winner is Sunrise, the son of Sol.)

27
00:01:19,595 --> 00:01:22,201
(This is a big twist for Baby Shark.)

28
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,370
You really live up to your ring name, 
Sunrise, the son of Sol.

29
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:27,672
You look very handsome in person.

30
00:01:27,672 --> 00:01:28,846
You can be a celebrity.

31
00:01:29,279 --> 00:01:29,825
Really?

32
00:01:30,676 --> 00:01:31,774
You’re too kind.
CLASSY AND SOPHISTICATED.

33
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,276
I heard that you’re an influencer.

34
00:01:34,276 --> 00:01:35,941
What kind of content do you make?

35
00:01:36,065 --> 00:01:40,402
It’s truth-seeking content.

36
00:01:40,541 --> 00:01:42,547
I always go full force when doing something.

37
00:01:43,305 --> 00:01:46,798
I think 
there are many boxing bandwagoners lately.

38
00:01:47,169 --> 00:01:52,034
I want to show them 
what a real boxer looks like.

39
00:01:53,225 --> 00:01:56,396
This is what a real boxer looks like.

40
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,548
Have you watched Sunrise’s interview?

41
00:02:04,213 --> 00:02:08,526
I think Sunrise’s win 
must be your grandma’s help.

42
00:02:09,748 --> 00:02:10,942
I think so too.

43
00:02:11,716 --> 00:02:13,686
How did things blow out of proportion like this?

44
00:02:13,779 --> 00:02:17,877
It should have already worked out 
and ended happily.

45
00:02:18,109 --> 00:02:18,810
Right?

46
00:02:19,212 --> 00:02:23,061
Who would have thought Sunrise would be 
this competitive with Klairung?

47
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:26,640
He must really resent me.

48
00:02:27,243 --> 00:02:29,173
That’s why he’s willing to do anything to win.

49
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:33,568
Don’t feel so discouraged.

50
00:02:33,846 --> 00:02:35,332
If he can ask my grandma for help,

51
00:02:35,332 --> 00:02:36,866
so can you.

52
00:02:37,206 --> 00:02:39,268
You should go ask her 
to help you win the match.

53
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:41,061
This way, both of you will be even.

54
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,069
I need to go practice now.

55
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:45,666
You need to work hard on your practice, too.

56
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:46,800
Okay.

57
00:02:47,682 --> 00:02:50,832
Good luck with your audition.

58
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:52,417
I’m rooting for you.

59
00:02:53,082 --> 00:02:53,786
You can do it.

60
00:02:57,995 --> 00:02:59,342
Good luck with your match too.

61
00:03:01,663 --> 00:03:04,481
Then I’ll pray that…

62
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,853
I will have a boyfriend soon.

63
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,207
Bye, Malai.

64
00:03:11,516 --> 00:03:12,260
I’ve got to go.

65
00:03:18,456 --> 00:03:23,242
Aren’t you going to tell her 
that you prayed for her successful audition?

66
00:03:24,062 --> 00:03:24,642
No.

67
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:26,603
No need to tell her.

68
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,489
If I told her, she would feel pressured.

69
00:03:35,312 --> 00:03:35,977
What’s going on?

70
00:03:36,828 --> 00:03:38,327
Why do you look stressed?

71
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:41,634
To be honest, Dad.

72
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,542
I don’t get it.

73
00:03:44,718 --> 00:03:47,537
Why does someone get a shortcut 
to their success?

74
00:03:48,233 --> 00:03:52,786
But those who don’t have it 
need to work so hard to achieve it.

75
00:03:53,405 --> 00:03:55,546
This is how competitions work.

76
00:03:56,134 --> 00:03:58,272
Everyone has their own strong points.

77
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:00,913
Some have good luck.

78
00:04:01,284 --> 00:04:03,716
Some work hard.

79
00:04:04,582 --> 00:04:09,128
I think your strong point is your support system.

80
00:04:11,448 --> 00:04:15,948
This is your strongest weapon.

81
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:26,412
Alright.

82
00:04:27,186 --> 00:04:28,598
I will no longer waste my time.

83
00:04:29,031 --> 00:04:30,292
I’ll just go for it.

84
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,761
WE CAN DO IT.

85
00:05:32,944 --> 00:05:33,820
Let’s start.

86
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:36,722
I carefully select your sparmates for today.

87
00:06:05,695 --> 00:06:06,850
Show me what you got, Saennoi.

88
00:06:07,376 --> 00:06:08,103
No need to go easy on me.

89
00:06:08,598 --> 00:06:10,192
I’ll cater to you.

90
00:06:59,651 --> 00:07:00,329
Here.

91
00:07:06,257 --> 00:07:06,863
Okay.

92
00:07:06,863 --> 00:07:08,454
Please wait for your queue to be called.

93
00:07:09,135 --> 00:07:09,903
Thank you.

94
00:07:10,414 --> 00:07:10,914
Yes.

95
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:15,889
This is the girl who is blacklisted by Biao.

96
00:07:16,616 --> 00:07:18,071
She still has the nerve to join the audition.

97
00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:21,124
Doesn’t she know that 
everyone knows about her attack on Biao?

98
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:22,041
Right?

99
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,750
With your bad rap, 
we could have a problem if we debut you.

100
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,120
Please give me a chance.

101
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,582
I have a secret weapon.

102
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,633
It guarantees that I will defeat you.
