Viewer discretion is advised.

4
00:00:13,201 --> 00:00:14,785
After I gave you the number,

5
00:00:15,226 --> 00:00:16,574
my life has been going downhill.

6
00:00:16,574 --> 00:00:20,450
I don’t think 
it has anything to do with the number.

7
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:22,854
This time, you can’t deny it happened.

8
00:00:22,854 --> 00:00:24,802
We are no longer just friends.

9
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,459
As soon as you can accept it,

10
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,822
your life will be easier.

11
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,351
About that.

12
00:00:30,591 --> 00:00:31,651
Can you pretend…

13
00:00:31,651 --> 00:00:32,893
I like you too.

14
00:00:33,153 --> 00:00:34,936
I booked a restaurant for us tomorrow.

15
00:00:34,936 --> 00:00:37,545
Let’s celebrate our second day together.

16
00:00:37,545 --> 00:00:39,400
Na, are you hiding something from me?

17
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:40,619
What is this?

18
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,607
I’m so screwed.

19
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,866
I don’t want the discount.

20
00:01:34,026 --> 00:01:34,921
I want to pay the full price.

21
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,656
Na.

22
00:01:36,398 --> 00:01:37,195
Calm down.

23
00:01:37,195 --> 00:01:38,988
Can’t I pay the full price? Please.

24
00:01:38,988 --> 00:01:39,856
What is this?

25
00:01:41,698 --> 00:01:42,957
What is going on, Na?

26
00:01:42,957 --> 00:01:44,175
Why are you with Leemhai?

27
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,076
You haven’t told him about us?

28
00:01:50,076 --> 00:01:50,975
About us?

29
00:01:52,317 --> 00:01:53,293
What does it mean?

30
00:01:56,017 --> 00:01:57,787
Leemhai, are you jealous of me?

31
00:01:57,787 --> 00:01:59,168
Because I’m dating Na.

32
00:01:59,288 --> 00:02:02,167
Are you threatening Na to break up with me?

33
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:05,855
Stop imagining things, Nine.

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,551
No one is jealous of you.

35
00:02:09,814 --> 00:02:12,734
The thing is, we have feelings for each other.

36
00:02:13,315 --> 00:02:14,711
I’m sorry.

37
00:02:14,891 --> 00:02:17,578
But you are the one 
who needs to step out of our relationship.

38
00:02:17,578 --> 00:02:19,101
Leemhai, you like women?

39
00:02:19,942 --> 00:02:24,252
Is that why you rejected me?

40
00:02:24,252 --> 00:02:25,469
No.

41
00:02:27,051 --> 00:02:29,535
If thinking that way makes you feel better,

42
00:02:29,675 --> 00:02:30,520
then go ahead.

43
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,386
But right now, Na is my girlfriend.

44
00:02:32,606 --> 00:02:34,264
It’s a mistake.

45
00:02:34,264 --> 00:02:35,749
Na doesn’t feel comfortable dating you.

46
00:02:35,749 --> 00:02:36,686
What are you talking about?

47
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,192
Do you really want me to say it?

48
00:02:39,782 --> 00:02:41,983
Your big event at the hospital.

49
00:02:42,103 --> 00:02:43,181
Seriously.

50
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,659
Who advised you to do that?

51
00:02:44,779 --> 00:02:45,854
It’s so lame.

52
00:02:46,034 --> 00:02:47,682
Your taste is terrible.

53
00:02:47,682 --> 00:02:49,599
You were pressuring her to say yes.

54
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,851
Who knows, she might want to say no.

55
00:02:51,851 --> 00:02:52,456
That’s not true.

56
00:02:53,117 --> 00:02:54,318
I can tell Na liked it.

57
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:56,392
Am I right?

58
00:02:57,914 --> 00:03:03,240
Na, tell him how uncomfortable you feel 
when you’re with him.

59
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,612
Na, tell her how much you like me.

60
00:03:07,952 --> 00:03:10,764
But I’m the one who makes you happy.

61
00:03:11,064 --> 00:03:11,937
Right?

62
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,053
Leemhai.

63
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,289
You are the one who rejected me.

64
00:03:15,389 --> 00:03:19,028
You can’t hold a grudge against me 
and try to destroy my relationship with her.

65
00:03:19,028 --> 00:03:19,728
Nine!

66
00:03:20,008 --> 00:03:21,435
Stop being so full of yourself.

67
00:03:21,775 --> 00:03:23,143
Because you are acting like this.

68
00:03:23,143 --> 00:03:24,755
Has anyone you asked out ever said yes?

69
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,789
Your looks and profile become useless

70
00:03:27,789 --> 00:03:29,171
if your attitude is still outdated like this.

71
00:03:29,171 --> 00:03:29,671
Hey!

72
00:03:29,671 --> 00:03:30,296
Hey, what?

73
00:03:30,296 --> 00:03:31,065
How could you say that?

74
00:03:31,065 --> 00:03:31,616
Do you want me to continue?

75
00:03:31,616 --> 00:03:33,960
Arghhhh!

76
00:03:58,209 --> 00:03:59,332
It’s good you’re calling.

77
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:02,203
I just woke up from a nightmare.

78
00:04:02,443 --> 00:04:03,301
Really?

79
00:04:03,521 --> 00:04:04,778
What is the nightmare?

80
00:04:04,998 --> 00:04:06,684
In the dream, I was stuck in the middle.

81
00:04:07,265 --> 00:04:10,286
While two people are fighting for me.

82
00:04:10,286 --> 00:04:13,976
One of those two is Nine, isn’t it?

83
00:04:14,356 --> 00:04:15,006
Yes.

84
00:04:15,346 --> 00:04:17,422
The other is Leemhai, right?

85
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,875
Who did you know?

86
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:20,172
It’s not a bad dream.

87
00:04:20,472 --> 00:04:21,934
It really happened.

88
00:04:25,378 --> 00:04:28,029
Na, tell her how much you like me.

89
00:04:28,029 --> 00:04:29,892
You suddenly became viral.

90
00:04:30,433 --> 00:04:31,117
No.

91
00:04:31,297 --> 00:04:32,067
No, what?

92
00:04:32,668 --> 00:04:34,469
Do you see how many times 
the video has been shared?

93
00:04:37,873 --> 00:04:39,253
606 K.

94
00:04:40,815 --> 00:04:43,447
Damn, 606 K shares.

95
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,279
What is going on with you?

96
00:04:47,741 --> 00:04:51,691
Why are a man and a woman 
fighting for you?

97
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:54,605
I don’t know how it happened.

98
00:04:55,646 --> 00:04:57,308
How can you not know?

99
00:04:58,009 --> 00:05:01,093
So, are you and Nine dating?

100
00:05:02,675 --> 00:05:03,646
Yes.

101
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,731
Hold on.

102
00:05:07,111 --> 00:05:11,103
Didn’t you say 
that woman was your love rival?

103
00:05:11,724 --> 00:05:14,225
You even tried take the number back from her.

104
00:05:14,786 --> 00:05:17,843
How come she ended up 
having feelings for you?

105
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:27,045
What’s really going on?

106
00:05:28,775 --> 00:05:31,680
Yes, I’m dating Nine.

107
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,978
He asked me out the other day.

108
00:05:33,978 --> 00:05:35,765
But when I started to date him,

109
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,415
things weren’t as good 
as I thought they would be.

110
00:05:38,176 --> 00:05:39,192
About Leemhai.

111
00:05:40,013 --> 00:05:41,974
At first, I only saw her as a friend.

112
00:05:42,515 --> 00:05:43,575
But I…

113
00:05:52,665 --> 00:05:53,555
You what?

114
00:05:55,237 --> 00:05:55,737
I…

115
00:05:55,737 --> 00:05:56,237
You…

116
00:05:57,278 --> 00:05:58,292
It’s nothing.

117
00:05:59,213 --> 00:05:59,713
It’s…

118
00:06:00,274 --> 00:06:01,643
It’s just a misunderstanding.

119
00:06:01,643 --> 00:06:02,776
What is the misunderstanding?

120
00:06:07,462 --> 00:06:09,900
Why are you pressing me to answer it?

121
00:06:10,601 --> 00:06:13,604
I’m already stressed enough 
with my own problem.

122
00:06:13,704 --> 00:06:15,917
Why do I need to deal 
with your excessive curiosity, too?

123
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:20,088
Na.

124
00:06:20,689 --> 00:06:21,780
We just worry about you.

125
00:06:22,821 --> 00:06:23,518
Worry about me?

126
00:06:24,359 --> 00:06:25,328
Do you really worry about me?

127
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:28,101
Drop your act.

128
00:06:28,502 --> 00:06:30,154
I know you too well.

129
00:06:30,154 --> 00:06:32,598
You just want a new story to gossip about.

130
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:36,812
You always find my misery entertaining.

131
00:06:39,796 --> 00:06:40,481
Na.

132
00:06:41,142 --> 00:06:43,106
We are your friends.

133
00:06:43,567 --> 00:06:44,266
Friends?

134
00:06:44,947 --> 00:06:46,019
Yes, you’re my friends.

135
00:06:46,299 --> 00:06:48,584
Friends who enjoy watching my misfortunes.

136
00:06:48,884 --> 00:06:50,357
What kind of friend is that?

137
00:06:56,244 --> 00:06:58,771
At first, Ly and I want to talk to you.

138
00:06:59,772 --> 00:07:01,849
Because we thought you might need our help.

139
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:04,271
But after hearing what you said,

140
00:07:05,312 --> 00:07:07,180
I guess you don’t need our help.

141
00:07:07,581 --> 00:07:09,217
Ly, let’s go.

142
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:13,525
Help?

143
00:07:14,086 --> 00:07:16,513
You’re talking 
as if you’d ever been a great help to me.

144
00:07:25,204 --> 00:07:26,258
What?

145
00:07:26,258 --> 00:07:28,093
You want to change your number again?

146
00:07:28,193 --> 00:07:29,197
Why?

147
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,168
Look at my life right now.

148
00:07:31,168 --> 00:07:32,556
It’s so chaotic.

149
00:07:32,556 --> 00:07:35,041
Besides changing my number, 
what do you suggest I do?

150
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:39,920
Doesn’t the number you are using 
make your life any better?

151
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,822
It was good at first.

152
00:07:41,822 --> 00:07:43,098
But after a while,

153
00:07:43,899 --> 00:07:44,761
it’s getting weird.

154
00:07:45,502 --> 00:07:46,969
Weird? How?

155
00:07:46,969 --> 00:07:50,324
Your grade is improving.
Your work is going well.

156
00:07:50,484 --> 00:07:51,206
About love.

157
00:07:51,206 --> 00:07:52,800
You are now dating someone, aren’t you?

158
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,761
Two people want to date me 
at the same time.

159
00:07:56,962 --> 00:08:02,051
Let’s view it as you have choices.

160
00:08:02,992 --> 00:08:07,760
You are those who have had bad luck 
all your life.

161
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,300
Now, you just don’t know 
how to deal with the change of luck.

162
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:12,467
It’s like a poor man winning a lottery jackpot.

163
00:08:12,467 --> 00:08:14,427
He doesn’t know how to manage 
a large amount of money.

164
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:17,559
You can slowly learn to live with it.

165
00:08:17,559 --> 00:08:18,233
But…

166
00:08:18,674 --> 00:08:21,862
things are coming at me all at once.

167
00:08:21,982 --> 00:08:24,595
I can’t handle it.

168
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,954
I told you. You need to calm down.

169
00:08:27,575 --> 00:08:29,706
You need to pull yourself together.

170
00:08:30,928 --> 00:08:31,577
Yes.

171
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:32,927
Pull myself together.

172
00:08:34,529 --> 00:08:36,553
I need to pull myself together.

173
00:08:40,378 --> 00:08:41,306
Nine.

174
00:08:42,307 --> 00:08:43,788
I have something important to tell you.

175
00:08:44,249 --> 00:08:45,168
Leemhai.

176
00:08:46,329 --> 00:08:47,688
I have something important to tell you.

177
00:08:47,688 --> 00:08:48,935
I like you, Nine.

178
00:08:48,935 --> 00:08:50,042
I like you, Leemhai.

179
00:08:50,042 --> 00:08:52,205
Nine, you are perfect in every way.

180
00:08:52,305 --> 00:08:55,716
At first, I saw you as my rival.

181
00:08:56,877 --> 00:08:58,381
But as time passed,

182
00:08:58,761 --> 00:09:00,917
I caught feelings for you.

183
00:09:00,917 --> 00:09:02,743
I want to become someone like you.

184
00:09:03,284 --> 00:09:04,625
I want to be as good as you.

185
00:09:04,925 --> 00:09:06,867
You opened a whole new world for me.

186
00:09:07,928 --> 00:09:09,773
I got to do things I never did.

187
00:09:10,955 --> 00:09:12,984
I got to see things I never saw.

188
00:09:12,984 --> 00:09:14,477
When we are dating,

189
00:09:14,918 --> 00:09:18,000
I feel like my dream has come true.

190
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,052
I can be myself every time I’m with you.

191
00:09:22,052 --> 00:09:25,596
You always work hard 
to plan events to surprise me.

192
00:09:25,596 --> 00:09:28,112
When I’m going through a hard time,

193
00:09:28,292 --> 00:09:30,497
but every time when I’m with you,

194
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:34,342
you always make the problems seem smaller 
and make me feel surprisingly relaxed.

195
00:09:34,342 --> 00:09:35,759
I want to tell you this.

196
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:36,846
Right now.

197
00:09:36,846 --> 00:09:38,805
I want to go back to focus on things 
that are important in my life.

198
00:09:38,805 --> 00:09:40,696
I want to be a good extern.

199
00:09:40,696 --> 00:09:42,585
I need to prepare for my medical license exam.

200
00:09:42,585 --> 00:09:43,514
I want to finish my degree.

201
00:09:43,514 --> 00:09:45,535
I want to take a break from you.

202
00:09:45,976 --> 00:09:48,263
I want to take a break from you.

203
00:10:12,316 --> 00:10:13,900
Why do you ask me to meet you?

204
00:10:15,402 --> 00:10:16,357
Leemhai.

205
00:10:16,818 --> 00:10:18,263
I have something important to tell you.

206
00:10:21,247 --> 00:10:22,053
Nine.

207
00:10:22,834 --> 00:10:23,910
I have something important to tell you.

208
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:24,523
Sure.

209
00:10:25,004 --> 00:10:27,144
But I have something to give you.

210
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:35,425
Rose quartz, the stone of love.

211
00:10:37,127 --> 00:10:38,815
It looks expensive.

212
00:10:38,815 --> 00:10:40,151
No, it’s not.

213
00:10:40,371 --> 00:10:42,690
It didn’t hurt my wallet at all.

214
00:10:43,331 --> 00:10:47,040
When a fire element person like me wears it, 
it calms me down.

215
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,161
When an earth element person like you wears it,

216
00:10:49,161 --> 00:10:51,245
it helps you open up more.

217
00:10:51,245 --> 00:10:57,805
The rose quartz will help our love 
stay strong and lasting.

218
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,254
I’ll put it on you.

219
00:11:13,418 --> 00:11:16,512
I knew that it would fit you well.

220
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,649
You also wear it.

221
00:11:34,414 --> 00:11:36,646
First, I have something to give you.

222
00:11:53,403 --> 00:11:56,039
You help inspire my creativity.

223
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,672
I want to do something to repay you.

224
00:12:08,955 --> 00:12:09,944
Do you like it?

225
00:12:10,925 --> 00:12:12,174
I spent all day making them.

226
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:20,997
It’s cute.

227
00:12:22,844 --> 00:12:23,857
Thank you.

228
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,694
The misfortune dispel ceremony 
that you told me about.

229
00:12:41,295 --> 00:12:42,117
I want to do it.

230
00:12:42,878 --> 00:12:44,311
Are you sure?
