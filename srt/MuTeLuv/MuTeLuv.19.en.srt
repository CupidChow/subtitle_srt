Viewer discretion is advised.

4
00:00:12,918 --> 00:00:14,686
This number helps boost your charms.

5
00:00:14,912 --> 00:00:16,911
Can you smile for me?

6
00:00:16,911 --> 00:00:17,845
When is your birthday?

7
00:00:17,845 --> 00:00:19,720
But not your presence of mind.

8
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,655
You did this over this trivial problem?

9
00:00:21,655 --> 00:00:23,012
I’ll buy the number.

10
00:00:23,012 --> 00:00:23,966
I sold it.

11
00:00:23,966 --> 00:00:24,468
What?

12
00:00:24,468 --> 00:00:27,403
This woman bought your lucky number.

13
00:00:27,403 --> 00:00:29,828
Nine is also asking her out.

14
00:00:29,828 --> 00:00:30,697
Do you need a ride?

15
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:33,121
Are you going to get the number back?

16
00:00:34,378 --> 00:00:35,500
I’ll give her a ride home.

17
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,599
Do you like Nine?

18
00:00:36,599 --> 00:00:38,030
He’s using you.

19
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:39,549
Are you jealous of him?

20
00:00:39,549 --> 00:00:40,271
No.

21
00:00:40,271 --> 00:00:41,397
Then why are you angry?

22
00:00:41,397 --> 00:00:42,525
Because I’m jealous of you.

23
00:00:54,213 --> 00:00:55,534
I mean…

24
00:00:56,238 --> 00:00:57,300
I’m worried about you.

25
00:00:58,230 --> 00:00:59,500
You are my friend.

26
00:01:00,103 --> 00:01:01,826
I feel comfortable when I’m with you.

27
00:01:02,127 --> 00:01:04,206
Did you approach me because of Nine?

28
00:01:04,382 --> 00:01:06,249
What are you talking about?

29
00:01:06,375 --> 00:01:07,601
I’m confused.

30
00:01:13,709 --> 00:01:14,570
Do you know…

31
00:01:16,154 --> 00:01:17,453
that Nine doesn’t have feelings for you?

32
00:01:23,464 --> 00:01:24,205
Yes.

33
00:01:24,431 --> 00:01:25,185
Yes, I know.

34
00:01:25,989 --> 00:01:28,667
I know that he really likes you.

35
00:01:29,421 --> 00:01:31,461
Because you are pretty,

36
00:01:31,863 --> 00:01:34,095
charming, and perfect in every way.

37
00:01:34,447 --> 00:01:37,280
If I could, I would want to live your life.

38
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:40,216
To tell you the truth,

39
00:01:40,543 --> 00:01:42,478
I didn’t approach you because of him.

40
00:01:43,307 --> 00:01:44,341
The truth is…

41
00:01:44,592 --> 00:01:47,570
I just want your number.

42
00:01:47,849 --> 00:01:48,468
Huh?

43
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:50,705
What are you talking about?

44
00:01:51,962 --> 00:01:55,881
Your number, the fortune teller told me 
it would bring me good luck.

45
00:01:55,881 --> 00:01:57,498
But you bought it.

46
00:01:57,498 --> 00:01:58,809
I want it back.

47
00:02:00,342 --> 00:02:01,400
Hold on, Na.

48
00:02:02,908 --> 00:02:03,793
Are you serious?

49
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,663
When I said

50
00:02:12,141 --> 00:02:15,170
people who believe in fate are insecure.

51
00:02:16,201 --> 00:02:18,232
The truth is…

52
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:19,518
I lied.

53
00:02:20,172 --> 00:02:21,574
I lied that I was talented.

54
00:02:22,228 --> 00:02:25,556
The truth is that I’m a loser.

55
00:02:25,933 --> 00:02:26,977
I’m so insecure.

56
00:02:27,429 --> 00:02:31,557
I can’t do anything to make my life better 
without relying on luck.

57
00:02:32,914 --> 00:02:33,915
Na.

58
00:02:35,046 --> 00:02:36,043
Calm down.

59
00:02:39,386 --> 00:02:40,430
I’m tired.

60
00:02:40,857 --> 00:02:44,862
I’m so tired of trying so hard,

61
00:02:46,069 --> 00:02:50,013
but things never get any better.

62
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,012
Look at me.

63
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:57,255
I’m so sad.

64
00:02:58,411 --> 00:03:00,454
I want to cry but…

65
00:03:02,088 --> 00:03:02,779
But…

66
00:03:02,955 --> 00:03:05,438
But tears won’t come out.

67
00:03:12,738 --> 00:03:13,627
Okay.

68
00:03:15,638 --> 00:03:17,312
If you get my number,

69
00:03:18,418 --> 00:03:20,084
will you feel better?

70
00:03:22,924 --> 00:03:24,171
What do you mean?

71
00:03:24,623 --> 00:03:25,701
Are you saying…

72
00:03:26,128 --> 00:03:27,280
you will give me your number?

73
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,078
Take it.

74
00:03:31,723 --> 00:03:32,873
What?

75
00:03:34,658 --> 00:03:35,711
The number.

76
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:38,783
If you want it, I’ll give it to you.

77
00:03:42,352 --> 00:03:43,899
Is it that easy?

78
00:03:44,226 --> 00:03:44,940
Yes.

79
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,729
It’s just a number.

80
00:03:49,287 --> 00:03:51,645
If it’s going to make you happy,

81
00:03:52,651 --> 00:03:53,722
you can have it.

82
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:01,290
Thank you, Leemhai.

83
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:02,244
Thank you.

84
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,222
Hello, Taew.

85
00:05:15,735 --> 00:05:17,065
Hello, Na.

86
00:05:17,592 --> 00:05:18,920
You look bubbly today.

87
00:05:19,976 --> 00:05:23,113
It’s because I have the feeling 
that things will go well today.

88
00:05:24,302 --> 00:05:26,255
I can’t believe you would ever feel that way.

89
00:05:30,386 --> 00:05:31,369
Sorry.

90
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,143
You don’t need to apologize.

91
00:05:34,143 --> 00:05:36,806
You can joke around with me.

92
00:05:36,806 --> 00:05:39,903
I’m not that uptight.

93
00:05:40,129 --> 00:05:40,890
Yeah.

94
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,800
This is my new number.

95
00:05:43,454 --> 00:05:44,535
Within a month,

96
00:05:44,862 --> 00:05:46,333
you have changed your number three times.

97
00:05:46,559 --> 00:05:48,286
This will be the last time.

98
00:05:48,286 --> 00:05:51,986
A fortune teller told me 
this number is the best match for my luck.

99
00:05:52,906 --> 00:05:54,239
So you changed it for good luck?

100
00:05:58,153 --> 00:05:59,362
It’s true, Aim.

101
00:05:59,638 --> 00:06:02,460
Na told me she changed her number 
for good luck.

102
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:05,267
I can’t believe 
that she believes in this kind of stuff.

103
00:06:05,468 --> 00:06:06,508
Right?

104
00:06:06,634 --> 00:06:08,202
Why did she bother to change her number?

105
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:09,612
She should have changed her personality.

106
00:06:12,226 --> 00:06:13,450
Can you buy me a coffee?

107
00:06:15,637 --> 00:06:18,486
Are you talking to me?

108
00:06:20,447 --> 00:06:21,998
I can buy it for you.

109
00:06:24,738 --> 00:06:25,440
It’s okay.

110
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,982
Aren’t you busy?

111
00:06:28,968 --> 00:06:30,395
Now, do I need to say again

112
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:33,017
who I asked to do it?

113
00:06:33,947 --> 00:06:34,711
Me?

114
00:07:02,837 --> 00:07:04,886
The weather is nice, Taew.

115
00:07:19,386 --> 00:07:20,136
Na.

116
00:07:21,946 --> 00:07:22,781
Nine.

117
00:07:26,803 --> 00:07:27,848
Do you want to eat grilled pork?

118
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:30,616
It’s okay.

119
00:07:30,968 --> 00:07:32,159
I already had dinner.

120
00:07:38,031 --> 00:07:38,945
That’s true.

121
00:07:39,171 --> 00:07:40,643
I don’t hear your stomach growling.

122
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,844
Nine.

123
00:07:52,866 --> 00:07:54,633
Do you like grilled pork?

124
00:07:55,588 --> 00:07:57,497
I saw you had it for breakfast the other day.

125
00:07:57,497 --> 00:07:58,957
Now, you are having it for dinner.

126
00:07:58,957 --> 00:07:59,659
No.

127
00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:02,058
I bought it to eat for breakfast.

128
00:08:02,561 --> 00:08:04,503
But I haven’t eaten it.
So I’m eating it now.

129
00:08:05,534 --> 00:08:07,494
Why? Are you busy?

130
00:08:09,681 --> 00:08:10,863
I lost my appetite.

131
00:08:14,417 --> 00:08:16,510
Nine, are you alright?

132
00:08:19,325 --> 00:08:20,364
I think…

133
00:08:21,269 --> 00:08:23,146
I’m going to give up on Leemhai.

134
00:08:24,327 --> 00:08:26,636
I guess she doesn’t like me.

135
00:08:27,164 --> 00:08:29,586
She unfollows me on Instagram.

136
00:08:33,231 --> 00:08:34,616
I guess it’s true.

137
00:08:35,094 --> 00:08:37,576
When a fire element person 
is with a wind element person,

138
00:08:38,028 --> 00:08:39,118
things tend not to go well.

139
00:08:40,928 --> 00:08:42,240
I think so too.

140
00:08:45,632 --> 00:08:49,544
You should find someone 
who is a better match for you.

141
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:50,710
Right?

142
00:09:00,725 --> 00:09:02,146
I can’t eat it.

143
00:09:05,213 --> 00:09:06,521
Are you still sad about her?

144
00:09:07,778 --> 00:09:09,191
I bought it this morning.

145
00:09:09,191 --> 00:09:10,139
It no longer tastes good.

146
00:09:23,473 --> 00:09:24,290
Na.

147
00:09:25,044 --> 00:09:27,620
When you smile, you look cute.

148
00:09:31,642 --> 00:09:32,442
Why?

149
00:09:32,769 --> 00:09:34,278
No one ever told you that?

150
00:09:38,881 --> 00:09:40,221
Now you know,

151
00:09:40,221 --> 00:09:42,182
you should smile often.

152
00:09:49,323 --> 00:09:50,674
I’ve got to go.

153
00:09:51,177 --> 00:09:52,872
I’ll see you around. Bye.

154
00:10:07,251 --> 00:10:10,325
[How is it, the number that I gave you?]

155
00:10:11,054 --> 00:10:12,526
[It’s amazing.]

156
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,867
[When are you free? Let’s meet up and talk.]

157
00:10:34,941 --> 00:10:35,811
Really?

158
00:10:36,515 --> 00:10:39,851
Just change your number, 
and your life has totally changed?

159
00:10:41,686 --> 00:10:42,634
Yes.

160
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,785
I can’t believe it myself.

161
00:10:45,539 --> 00:10:47,954
Just like people say,

162
00:10:48,331 --> 00:10:50,131
if I hadn’t experienced it myself,

163
00:10:51,011 --> 00:10:52,123
I wouldn’t have believed it.

164
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:57,426
It might be a result of the law of attraction.

165
00:10:58,054 --> 00:11:00,580
You believe that 
the number will make your life better.

166
00:11:01,158 --> 00:11:03,429
So you attract good things into your life.

167
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:05,824
It doesn’t matter what the reason is.

168
00:11:05,824 --> 00:11:08,400
I’m happy with my life right now. 
That’s all that matters.

169
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:24,193
What about you?

170
00:11:25,048 --> 00:11:26,332
Are you okay?

171
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,057
Why are you asking me that?

172
00:11:32,012 --> 00:11:33,875
Do I not look okay?

173
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:39,359
Nine told me that 
you cut your contact with him.

174
00:11:42,803 --> 00:11:46,979
Someone told me 
I should be honest with him.

175
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:53,269
I followed the advice.

176
00:12:02,377 --> 00:12:04,280
You need to buy me drinks tonight.

177
00:12:04,632 --> 00:12:07,333
To repay that I gave you the lucky number.

178
00:12:07,534 --> 00:12:08,268
Okay?

179
00:12:10,153 --> 00:12:11,222
Okay?

180
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,659
Hey, hey.

181
00:12:20,067 --> 00:12:21,196
Easy.

182
00:12:21,623 --> 00:12:22,908
I should take full advantage of it.

183
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,063
I can buy you ten more drinks.

184
00:12:26,754 --> 00:12:28,056
Easy.

185
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,243
Make yourself at home.

186
00:12:49,705 --> 00:12:51,008
I’ll get you some water.

187
00:12:52,592 --> 00:12:54,322
I don’t want to drink water.

188
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:57,450
Okay.

189
00:12:57,802 --> 00:12:59,279
Let’s make a night of it.

190
00:13:28,273 --> 00:13:29,234
I’m sorry.

191
00:13:29,234 --> 00:13:30,600
I didn’t mean to pry.

192
00:13:34,295 --> 00:13:35,174
It’s okay.

193
00:13:35,802 --> 00:13:37,514
I’m not trying to hide it.

194
00:13:38,947 --> 00:13:40,131
She is my ex.

195
00:13:48,756 --> 00:13:50,498
Do I make you feel uncomfortable?

196
00:13:52,508 --> 00:13:53,632
No.

197
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,431
Why would I feel uncomfortable?

198
00:13:55,431 --> 00:13:56,830
You…

199
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:00,000
You like women.

200
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,639
It doesn’t mean you will like me, right?

201
00:14:12,884 --> 00:14:13,912
Right?

202
00:14:27,109 --> 00:14:28,222
Slow down.

203
00:14:29,102 --> 00:14:31,349
My blood sugar drops.

204
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:37,666
It tastes a bit odd.

205
00:14:39,928 --> 00:14:41,051
I made it.

206
00:14:41,403 --> 00:14:43,080
I’m still not good at it.

207
00:14:44,949 --> 00:14:45,975
That’s right.

208
00:15:15,989 --> 00:15:16,908
Aren’t you bored?

209
00:15:20,226 --> 00:15:21,353
I’m having a good time.

210
00:15:22,509 --> 00:15:25,942
Just listening to music, is it that good?

211
00:15:28,179 --> 00:15:31,012
At one point in life,

212
00:15:32,269 --> 00:15:35,490
I learned that I don’t need big things.

213
00:15:36,244 --> 00:15:40,276
I just want to sit and think of nothing.

214
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,968
I haven’t done this for a long time.

215
00:15:50,322 --> 00:15:52,223
Why are you talking like an old lady?

216
00:15:52,424 --> 00:15:54,547
As if you have been living for a long time.

217
00:15:56,206 --> 00:15:57,793
It’s true.

218
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,030
When I was in junior high,

219
00:16:00,734 --> 00:16:08,906
I was focusing on 
how to get into a reputable high school.

220
00:16:08,906 --> 00:16:10,912
After I got into high school,

221
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,614
I needed to figure out 
what I wanted to study in college.

222
00:16:17,022 --> 00:16:19,943
When I knew that I wanted to be a doctor,

223
00:16:20,798 --> 00:16:25,670
I was worried about 
how to get into a med school.

224
00:16:26,349 --> 00:16:27,414
That’s not all.

225
00:16:27,866 --> 00:16:29,755
When I got into the med school,

226
00:16:30,409 --> 00:16:34,726
I had to figure out 
how to make it through med school.

227
00:16:35,706 --> 00:16:36,475
Believe me.

228
00:16:37,028 --> 00:16:39,902
Just sitting here with you and doing nothing,

229
00:16:40,204 --> 00:16:43,812
it’s one of the best moments in my life lately.

230
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:53,614
When you are with Nine,

231
00:16:56,228 --> 00:16:57,976
isn’t it also a good time for you?

232
00:17:04,411 --> 00:17:05,293
No.

233
00:17:07,027 --> 00:17:08,771
When I’m with him,

234
00:17:08,771 --> 00:17:11,592
I feel more nervous than when I’m working.

235
00:17:15,061 --> 00:17:15,993
Why?

236
00:17:18,255 --> 00:17:19,751
I’m worried

237
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,848
if I look too worn out

238
00:17:25,602 --> 00:17:28,917
or if I wear too much makeup.

239
00:17:30,802 --> 00:17:34,147
I’m worried about my tone of voice 
when I talk.

240
00:17:35,881 --> 00:17:40,678
I’m worried that I might do something 
that he doesn’t like.

241
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,193
It’s not like when I’m with you.

242
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:51,485
I have never felt this comfortable 
with anyone but you.

243
00:19:52,892 --> 00:19:54,676
I said I like Nine.
