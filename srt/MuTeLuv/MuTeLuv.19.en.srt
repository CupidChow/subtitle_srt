1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,894
Huh?

2
00:00:06,391 --> 00:00:08,093
You are going on a date with both of them.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,947
Why didn’t you say no to one of them?

4
00:00:12,947 --> 00:00:14,334
(I can’t say no to either of them.)

5
00:00:14,334 --> 00:00:15,358
(What should I do?)

6
00:00:15,726 --> 00:00:17,794
(Please help me.)

7
00:00:19,376 --> 00:00:20,172
Alright.

8
00:00:21,128 --> 00:00:22,192
Calm down.

9
00:00:22,799 --> 00:00:24,853
I’ll check your luck.

10
00:00:30,223 --> 00:00:31,717
Listen carefully.

11
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:36,056
Tomorrow is your auspicious day.

12
00:00:36,755 --> 00:00:39,105
But there’s something

13
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:43,669
you need to be careful of.
Avoid the number 4.

14
00:00:44,405 --> 00:00:46,384
More importantly,

15
00:00:47,396 --> 00:00:51,503
stay away from the number 06.

16
00:00:51,797 --> 00:00:55,097
Otherwise, you will be doomed.

17
00:00:58,279 --> 00:00:59,559
I’ll have Ta Daeng chili paste.

18
00:00:59,724 --> 00:01:01,690
One beef turmeric curry.

19
00:01:02,665 --> 00:01:04,348
One roast pork red curry with canned lychee.

20
00:01:04,348 --> 00:01:06,166
And two servings of rice.

21
00:01:06,442 --> 00:01:07,050
Thank you.

22
00:01:09,165 --> 00:01:12,989
We finally have our first date.

23
00:01:13,302 --> 00:01:16,167
I asked for Table 36.

24
00:01:16,756 --> 00:01:20,303
Because I saw that the number 
is a part of your phone number.

25
00:01:20,818 --> 00:01:24,600
Number 36 helps boost your charms 
and is a lucky number for love.

26
00:01:26,899 --> 00:01:27,551
Really?

27
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:31,174
I never knew its meaning before.

28
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,875
I chose this number 
because I thought it looked good.

29
00:01:38,512 --> 00:01:42,459
But you seem to have luck with love 
without the number.

30
00:01:45,512 --> 00:01:48,745
Excuse me. I want to go to the bathroom.

31
00:01:49,186 --> 00:01:49,757
Sure.

32
00:02:31,638 --> 00:02:32,930
I’m starving.

33
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,489
Can we move to another table?

34
00:02:42,261 --> 00:02:43,098
Why?

35
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,235
I always sit at Table 4.

36
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:46,936
It’s my lucky number.

37
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,188
But number 4 is my unlucky number.

38
00:02:52,354 --> 00:02:54,862
But we sat at Table 4 together before.

39
00:02:55,763 --> 00:02:58,762
That’s true, but…

40
00:03:04,174 --> 00:03:05,210
Okay.

41
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:08,336
We can move to any table that you want.

42
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,282
As long as I’m sitting with you.

43
00:03:22,303 --> 00:03:23,003
Excuse me.

44
00:03:23,593 --> 00:03:24,774
Can we move to another table?

45
00:03:24,774 --> 00:03:25,391
Sure.

46
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,164
Hey.

47
00:03:44,176 --> 00:03:46,577
I need to go to the bathroom.

48
00:04:03,203 --> 00:04:05,536
Wow! It looks yummy.

49
00:04:05,702 --> 00:04:07,953
I’ll dig in.

50
00:04:07,953 --> 00:04:08,979
Wait a moment, Na.

51
00:04:09,365 --> 00:04:09,972
Huh?

52
00:04:09,972 --> 00:04:11,885
We are dating.

53
00:04:12,014 --> 00:04:14,437
We should eat as couples do.

54
00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:17,619
Aaah.

55
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,416
Aaah.

56
00:04:25,685 --> 00:04:26,653
It’s my turn.

57
00:04:27,407 --> 00:04:27,981
Good.

58
00:04:27,981 --> 00:04:29,936
Aaah.

59
00:04:30,488 --> 00:04:33,000
Why don’t we just eat it by ourselves?

60
00:04:34,177 --> 00:04:35,520
I’m very hungry.

61
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,414
Na, you don’t want to spoon-feed me?

62
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,823
Aaah.

63
00:04:48,414 --> 00:04:51,009
Na, I have something to tell you.

64
00:04:51,009 --> 00:04:54,074
My parents are opening a new hospital.

65
00:04:54,295 --> 00:04:56,796
They want me to run it.

66
00:04:58,764 --> 00:04:59,887
That’s great.

67
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:06,031
Since we started dating, 
many good things have happened in my life.

68
00:05:06,031 --> 00:05:09,204
I think our birth stars 
must have a synergistic effect.

69
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,287
Just wait and see.

70
00:05:11,526 --> 00:05:16,314
As we continue dating, 
our success will be unstoppable.

71
00:05:17,969 --> 00:05:18,903
That’s great.

72
00:05:18,903 --> 00:05:19,589
Yes.

73
00:05:20,582 --> 00:05:22,023
I can’t wait for it.

74
00:05:22,284 --> 00:05:23,456
Now, it’s my turn.

75
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:24,604
Please feed me.

76
00:05:24,806 --> 00:05:25,860
Sure.

77
00:05:27,478 --> 00:05:29,684
Aaah.

78
00:05:31,854 --> 00:05:34,748
Excuse me. I need to go to the bathroom.

79
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,670
Hey.

80
00:05:56,534 --> 00:05:57,898
You look so starved.

81
00:05:59,406 --> 00:06:00,113
Yes, I am.

82
00:06:00,591 --> 00:06:02,713
I was examining patients all day.

83
00:06:02,713 --> 00:06:05,601
This is my lunch and dinner.

84
00:06:09,816 --> 00:06:10,372
Here.

85
00:06:14,308 --> 00:06:14,851
Hey.

86
00:06:15,568 --> 00:06:16,697
You spill the sauce on your dress.

87
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,090
Thank you.

88
00:06:32,378 --> 00:06:34,265
Na, are you hiding something from me?

89
00:06:37,447 --> 00:06:38,492
No.

90
00:06:38,749 --> 00:06:39,639
Why?

91
00:06:42,324 --> 00:06:45,277
I feed you properly.

92
00:06:45,847 --> 00:06:47,032
I didn’t spill anything on you.

93
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:48,015
You did.

94
00:06:49,689 --> 00:06:52,093
The stain happened when you fed me.

95
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:53,384
No.

96
00:06:53,881 --> 00:06:56,446
The stain isn’t caused by the food on this table.

97
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:58,369
It happened at this table.

98
00:07:00,171 --> 00:07:01,952
Did you secretly go somewhere else to eat?

99
00:07:05,281 --> 00:07:06,049
No.

100
00:07:10,224 --> 00:07:12,523
I need to go to…

101
00:07:12,523 --> 00:07:13,856
Go to the bathroom again?

102
00:07:17,282 --> 00:07:18,038
Yes.

103
00:07:28,559 --> 00:07:30,191
Why do you go to the bathroom so often?

104
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:34,513
It’s nothing.

105
00:07:34,513 --> 00:07:37,064
I just drank a lot of water today.

106
00:07:40,981 --> 00:07:42,656
Are you hiding something from me?

107
00:07:46,095 --> 00:07:46,928
No.

108
00:07:48,933 --> 00:07:51,488
I think we should go home.

109
00:07:53,566 --> 00:07:54,235
Sure.

110
00:07:54,235 --> 00:07:55,589
I already asked for the check.

111
00:07:57,667 --> 00:08:00,142
The bill is 606 baht.

112
00:08:01,006 --> 00:08:01,696
Huh?

113
00:08:02,468 --> 00:08:03,634
Why does the bill have the number?

114
00:08:04,204 --> 00:08:05,599
The actual bill is higher than this.

115
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,249
But we are offering a discount.
So this is the final number.

116
00:08:08,249 --> 00:08:09,285
I don’t want the discount.

117
00:08:09,414 --> 00:08:10,441
I want to pay the full price.

118
00:08:10,827 --> 00:08:11,643
Why?

119
00:08:12,011 --> 00:08:13,569
Why do you want to pay a higher price?

120
00:08:13,845 --> 00:08:17,084
But the number is 606.

121
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:21,483
Number 6 means hardship.

122
00:08:21,612 --> 00:08:24,773
Number 0 means loss and emptiness.

123
00:08:24,773 --> 00:08:26,786
When they are together,

124
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:29,174
606 means uncertainty.

125
00:08:29,321 --> 00:08:33,940
It will bring never-ending problems 
and hardship.

126
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:34,682
Na.

127
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,900
We already issued your bill.

128
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:37,946
You need to pay at this price.

129
00:08:37,946 --> 00:08:39,351
I’ll pay the full price.

130
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:40,379
Na.

131
00:08:40,747 --> 00:08:42,160
Na, calm down.

132
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,648
Tell him that we are paying the full price.

133
00:08:44,648 --> 00:08:46,244
Na, calm down.

134
00:08:46,244 --> 00:08:48,164
Can’t I pay the full price? Please.

135
00:08:48,164 --> 00:08:49,044
What is this?

136
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,182
I’m so screwed.

137
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,344
What is going on with you?

138
00:09:21,344 --> 00:09:25,559
Why are a man and a woman fighting for you?

139
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:26,461
Nine.

140
00:09:27,418 --> 00:09:28,787
I have something important to tell you.

141
00:09:29,228 --> 00:09:32,680
I think Na has said it clearly that she chose me.

142
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:34,279
Why didn’t you tell me

143
00:09:34,794 --> 00:09:35,954
that we are coming to Nine’s house?

144
00:09:36,193 --> 00:09:39,026
What? You want to change your number again?

145
00:09:39,173 --> 00:09:41,188
The luck enhancement ritual you told me about,

146
00:09:41,648 --> 00:09:42,400
I want to do it.
