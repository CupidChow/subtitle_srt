Viewer discretion is advised.

4
00:00:49,603 --> 00:00:54,838
I heard that you are heavy-handed, 
just like when you season your noodles.

5
00:00:57,593 --> 00:00:58,583
You’re not wrong.

6
00:00:59,805 --> 00:01:00,702
Do you want to try me?

7
00:01:02,715 --> 00:01:03,531
I’m always up to it.

8
00:01:07,389 --> 00:01:10,066
No boxing gloves. No ring.

9
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,736
No 10 count.

10
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,646
Good.

11
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:19,776
We will find out how good you are, Klairung.

12
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:42,329
(Real boxers respect the rules.)

13
00:01:42,712 --> 00:01:44,975
(But if you want to fight me outside the ring,)

14
00:01:45,382 --> 00:01:46,292
(I don’t mind.)

15
00:01:46,915 --> 00:01:48,378
(Remember my name.)

16
00:01:48,666 --> 00:01:52,393
(I’m Klairung, the vice president 
of Jamaree University's boxing club.)

17
00:01:54,861 --> 00:01:59,715
(Do you believe 
that one video can change your entire life?)

18
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,398
(That’s right. This is one of those videos.)

19
00:02:02,398 --> 00:02:06,188
(We were just shooting it for fun.)

20
00:02:07,051 --> 00:02:09,388
ONE MONTH EARLIER

21
00:02:09,388 --> 00:02:11,639
Let me see the video.

22
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:13,255
How is it?

23
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:15,979
I finished editing the video.

24
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,953
I think…

25
00:02:19,846 --> 00:02:21,461
it’s freaking good, Han.

26
00:02:22,947 --> 00:02:25,364
Please add the word ‘Yo’ 
to the front of my name.

27
00:02:25,508 --> 00:02:27,903
Show some respect to the beauty of my face.

28
00:02:27,903 --> 00:02:28,836
Beauty?

29
00:02:28,836 --> 00:02:29,336
Yes.

30
00:02:29,815 --> 00:02:33,762
Fine, Miss Yo…han.

31
00:02:35,607 --> 00:02:37,860
What should we do with the video?

32
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,233
Why do you need to ask?

33
00:02:39,233 --> 00:02:40,518
We’ve come this far.

34
00:02:40,518 --> 00:02:42,251
We need to post it.

35
00:02:42,467 --> 00:02:44,573
The video is GOAT.

36
00:02:44,573 --> 00:02:45,552
What are you waiting for?

37
00:02:45,552 --> 00:02:46,633
Upload it.

38
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:50,638
The next viral video is here.

39
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:54,395
One, two, three.

40
00:02:54,395 --> 00:02:59,249
(The truth is, I’m just a member 
of a small university boxing club.)

41
00:02:59,369 --> 00:03:02,406
(What happened in the video is all set up.)

42
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:06,261
(The video was shot by Yohan, 
the president of our boxing club.)

43
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:07,995
YOHAN, THE CLUB’S PRESIDENT.

44
00:03:07,995 --> 00:03:10,951
(The man who picked a fight with me

45
00:03:10,951 --> 00:03:12,710
is Saennoi, the club member.) 
SAENNOI, THE CLUB MEMBER.

46
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,890
(Me, I’m a boxer 
who enjoys creating content for fun.)

47
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:19,216
KLAIRUNG, THE CLUB’S VICE PRESIDENT AND CONTENT CREATOR.

48
00:03:30,237 --> 00:03:31,831
(I’d never thought…)

49
00:03:32,382 --> 00:03:37,811
(one of my videos would go viral.)

50
00:03:42,278 --> 00:03:43,158
Shit.

51
00:03:46,441 --> 00:03:48,385
Han, where are you going?

52
00:03:50,422 --> 00:03:51,235
Yohan.

53
00:03:51,882 --> 00:03:53,613
I’m going to the local government office.

54
00:03:53,613 --> 00:03:55,911
I’m going to register your birth as a star.

55
00:03:55,911 --> 00:03:59,458
Yeah, my master is now a celeb.

56
00:04:00,296 --> 00:04:01,537
Yay!

57
00:04:01,537 --> 00:04:06,358
(The video makes me a rising star on TikTok.)

58
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:08,938
(But the overnight fame,)

59
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:13,075
(it comes with big responsibilities.)

60
00:04:15,158 --> 00:04:17,180
If you want to be muscular like me,

61
00:04:17,372 --> 00:04:23,442
drink Shake Shake, 
my no.1 whey protein drink.

62
00:04:24,496 --> 00:04:26,851
Woo!

63
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,031
The client wired us the money.

64
00:04:33,238 --> 00:04:37,167
Yay!

65
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,902
We got the money. We got the money.

66
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,607
Thank you guys so much.

67
00:04:53,757 --> 00:04:55,246
We’ve been together for four years.

68
00:04:55,246 --> 00:04:56,749
We finally have this day.

69
00:04:58,019 --> 00:05:01,971
The golden era of our boxing club has arrived.

70
00:05:03,145 --> 00:05:04,707
Jamaree.

71
00:05:05,162 --> 00:05:06,556
Jamaree.

72
00:05:06,868 --> 00:05:08,350
Jamaree.

73
00:05:08,566 --> 00:05:09,972
Jamaree.

74
00:05:09,972 --> 00:05:13,956
Jamaree.

75
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,716
PRESENT

76
00:05:19,011 --> 00:05:20,858
JAMAREE BOXING CLUB

77
00:05:20,858 --> 00:05:23,280
DO NOT DISTURB. 
NO ONE IS AT THE CLUB.

78
00:05:24,273 --> 00:05:31,814
MUTELUV: FIST FOOT FUSION
EP1 – IS THIS…KLAIRUNG?

79
00:05:31,814 --> 00:05:32,531
Saennoi.

80
00:05:32,723 --> 00:05:33,983
Did you check it?

81
00:05:34,798 --> 00:05:38,337
Trust me, no one sees us coming here.

82
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,949
Are you sure?

83
00:05:40,476 --> 00:05:41,380
I don’t want us to get caught.

84
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,153
Did you check if there are any CCTV cameras?

85
00:05:43,321 --> 00:05:44,984
How could it have one?

86
00:05:44,984 --> 00:05:47,498
We didn’t have the money to install it.

87
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,801
It took us so long to come back here.

88
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:52,828
The club is so messy.

89
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,041
Guys.

90
00:05:56,736 --> 00:05:57,687
I don’t get it.

91
00:05:57,951 --> 00:05:59,646
This is our club.

92
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,774
Why do we need to sneak in?

93
00:06:02,205 --> 00:06:05,345
Come on, let’s be safe rather than sorry.

94
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:11,489
Back then, you were so hyped 
about the soon-to-be viral video.

95
00:06:11,609 --> 00:06:12,951
Post it.

96
00:06:13,214 --> 00:06:13,911
Now, look what happened.

97
00:06:13,911 --> 00:06:16,837
It was your fault, Saennoi.

98
00:06:16,957 --> 00:06:18,499
Why? Why? Why?

99
00:06:18,499 --> 00:06:20,352
Why are you blaming me?

100
00:06:20,352 --> 00:06:22,868
We were all happy about it, weren’t we?

101
00:06:22,868 --> 00:06:25,280
You were so happy 
when you saw the skyrocketing views.

102
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,830
How would I know 
the viral video would put us in trouble?

103
00:06:29,046 --> 00:06:29,626
Right?

104
00:06:32,454 --> 00:06:35,828
(The video that made me a star 
can also ruin our lives.)

105
00:06:37,098 --> 00:06:39,308
(No, why do we need to blame ourselves…)

106
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,094
(…when we can blame it on others?)

107
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,843
(It’s Sunrise’s fault.)

108
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,149
Are you ready, babe?

109
00:06:49,437 --> 00:06:50,328
Yes.

110
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:55,243
Surprise, mother, father.

111
00:06:57,927 --> 00:06:59,608
Wait, where are you going?

112
00:07:00,111 --> 00:07:02,837
Sunrise starts following you.

113
00:07:05,551 --> 00:07:08,555
Wow, he has less than 1,000 baht 
in his bank account.

114
00:07:08,555 --> 00:07:11,120
His watch, gold necklace, and car are fake.

115
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,530
He doesn’t have the money

116
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:15,498
but you use fake photos 
to create an image of a rich man.

117
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:19,406
So what? People admire wealthy people.

118
00:07:19,406 --> 00:07:20,236
What’s wrong if I want to look rich?

119
00:07:20,236 --> 00:07:22,627
You are not rich, but try to fool others.

120
00:07:25,215 --> 00:07:26,347
FAKE.
I can’t stand it.

121
00:07:27,593 --> 00:07:33,475
Because I was born to expose all lies 
and reveal the truth.

122
00:07:34,098 --> 00:07:36,000
Sunrise, well done, baby.

123
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,401
Don’t forget to share, like, and subscribe.

124
00:07:40,072 --> 00:07:42,028
(This guy is Sunrise.)

125
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:43,264
(He’s an influencer who exposes others.)

126
00:07:43,264 --> 00:07:45,946
(His partner is Lipsync. 
She helps him with his channel.)

127
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:52,527
(There’s a thin line between exposing lies 
and harassing people in what he does.)

128
00:07:52,815 --> 00:07:55,488
(He became famous 
after exposing other people’s lies.)

129
00:07:55,847 --> 00:07:57,679
(Influencers are also his targets.)

130
00:07:57,679 --> 00:08:00,447
Hey, where are you going?

131
00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:02,665
From all the names you have suggested,

132
00:08:02,665 --> 00:08:05,241
I picked my next target.

133
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,076
This handsome boxer.

134
00:08:08,244 --> 00:08:10,753
The more I dig, 
the more suspicious he seems.

135
00:08:10,753 --> 00:08:12,000
Don’t worry.

136
00:08:12,303 --> 00:08:15,041
I’ll go surprise him in one week.

137
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:18,944
Watch your back, Mr. Klairung.

138
00:08:19,088 --> 00:08:22,315
Sunrise starts following you.

139
00:08:24,695 --> 00:08:27,325
Luckily, I don’t use social media.

140
00:08:27,325 --> 00:08:28,688
So he can’t dig into me.

141
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,793
Yeah.

142
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,486
But what I’m most worried about right now 
is our client.

143
00:08:33,702 --> 00:08:36,860
I promised to send the content to him tomorrow.

144
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:39,748
But we’re worried that Sunrise will show up 
at our club to expose us.

145
00:08:43,199 --> 00:08:46,301
I think luck is on our side.

146
00:08:46,301 --> 00:08:48,050
He’s not in Thailand.

147
00:08:48,289 --> 00:08:50,898
I can see Mount Fuji like the reviews said.

148
00:08:50,898 --> 00:08:54,073
Congratulations to Thai Sommai Airlines.

149
00:08:55,031 --> 00:08:56,320
He’s going to Japan.

150
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,583
Now, we can shoot our video.

151
00:08:58,583 --> 00:08:59,593
Let’s go.

152
00:08:59,593 --> 00:09:00,776
What are you waiting for?

153
00:09:00,776 --> 00:09:01,783
Go, go.

154
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:03,820
Yohan, get the camera ready.

155
00:09:04,496 --> 00:09:05,241
You look great.

156
00:09:05,241 --> 00:09:05,803
Yeah?

157
00:09:05,803 --> 00:09:06,303
Yes.

158
00:09:07,698 --> 00:09:08,987
He’s doing pushups.

159
00:09:11,886 --> 00:09:13,364
He’s so skillful.

160
00:09:13,364 --> 00:09:13,920
Great.

161
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,430
Don’t get tired yet. Hold it.

162
00:09:15,742 --> 00:09:17,746
Good. That’s looking good.

163
00:09:17,746 --> 00:09:19,064
You look hot.

164
00:09:19,064 --> 00:09:20,864
Look at his muscles.

165
00:09:20,864 --> 00:09:23,051
He’s my master.

166
00:09:23,051 --> 00:09:24,021
Amazing.

167
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:28,778
A viewer requests you to punch the camera 
as if you’re punching him.

168
00:09:28,778 --> 00:09:29,936
You want to be punched?

169
00:09:30,391 --> 00:09:31,325
You can handle it, right?

170
00:09:31,325 --> 00:09:32,417
Yes.

171
00:09:41,584 --> 00:09:43,839
Your punch is so strong, Klairung.

172
00:09:44,294 --> 00:09:48,884
You are no longer afraid of Sunrise?

173
00:09:51,568 --> 00:09:53,109
Sunrise?

174
00:09:54,571 --> 00:09:57,393
To be honest, I’ve never been afraid of him.

175
00:09:57,561 --> 00:10:00,102
The truth is, our club is under renovation.

176
00:10:00,102 --> 00:10:01,184
So we can’t come here to do live streaming.

177
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:01,900
Right?

178
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:02,647
Yes.

179
00:10:02,647 --> 00:10:03,851
I’m telling you this.

180
00:10:04,522 --> 00:10:07,005
If he wants to meet me,

181
00:10:07,868 --> 00:10:09,043
this is my answer.

182
00:10:11,176 --> 00:10:12,882
I’m ready to see him anytime.

183
00:10:14,871 --> 00:10:17,776
Klairung is also live-streaming.

184
00:10:19,046 --> 00:10:20,093
Are you sure?

185
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:23,397
He’s live-streaming at his club.

186
00:10:24,427 --> 00:10:25,288
Really?

187
00:10:26,414 --> 00:10:29,649
Someone told him 
that we’re going live at our club.

188
00:10:29,865 --> 00:10:30,900
Why are you worried?

189
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,473
He’s not in the country.

190
00:10:32,593 --> 00:10:35,783
The window looks very familiar.

191
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:37,223
I think I saw it before.

192
00:10:39,212 --> 00:10:43,227
Surprise, mother, father.

193
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,368
Now, I knew why it looked familiar.

194
00:10:47,368 --> 00:10:50,695
It looks like my toilet seat.

195
00:10:53,115 --> 00:10:54,721
You are so stupid.

196
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:56,550
Can’t you tell?

197
00:10:56,838 --> 00:10:57,507
Calm down.

198
00:10:57,651 --> 00:10:59,087
Don’t freak out. He’s live-streaming.

199
00:10:59,446 --> 00:11:02,216
I won’t let you keep hiding from me.

200
00:11:02,575 --> 00:11:08,084
I came up with the plan 
to expose you, Mr. Klairung.

201
00:11:10,217 --> 00:11:15,574
Excuse me. You’re trespassing.

202
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:21,677
Luckily, I already received permission 
from the university.

203
00:11:24,552 --> 00:11:27,117
I did my homework.

204
00:11:27,548 --> 00:11:31,349
I know who you are.

205
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,428
Yohan, you were a rising boxer.

206
00:11:37,428 --> 00:11:39,060
But you wanted to be a pretty woman.

207
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,282
So you decided to retire from boxing.

208
00:11:41,097 --> 00:11:43,217
Klairung, you are just a talker.

209
00:11:43,217 --> 00:11:45,307
Since you joined this club,

210
00:11:45,307 --> 00:11:47,971
you have never fought in the ring.

211
00:11:50,056 --> 00:11:54,795
About that, I just want my junior 
to have real experience.

212
00:11:55,011 --> 00:11:58,825
I don’t care. I don’t want to hear or listen.

213
00:11:59,256 --> 00:12:01,878
That’s the famous Saennoi.

214
00:12:01,974 --> 00:12:04,022
About Saennoi,

215
00:12:04,022 --> 00:12:07,142
I found evidence 
that you’ve been a member of this club.

216
00:12:08,196 --> 00:12:11,816
So the viral video at the noodle shop 
must be…

217
00:12:11,816 --> 00:12:12,316
Stop.

218
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:17,400
After Saennoi lost to Klairug, 
he applied to join our club.

219
00:12:18,119 --> 00:12:19,838
You are lying.

220
00:12:19,838 --> 00:12:21,596
Look at this document.

221
00:12:21,596 --> 00:12:24,237
The application date was changed.

222
00:12:24,237 --> 00:12:25,318
10 MARCH 2023

223
00:12:25,318 --> 00:12:26,465
10 JANUARY 2025

224
00:12:28,295 --> 00:12:30,257
Yohan, you’re so reckless.

225
00:12:31,599 --> 00:12:32,387
Alright.

226
00:12:33,202 --> 00:12:35,462
To prove the truth,

227
00:12:36,277 --> 00:12:40,228
Klairung just needs to show his boxing skills.

228
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,336
The Jamaree–Thammachak boxing event 
is coming soon.

229
00:12:44,887 --> 00:12:50,292
If you compete and win a spot 
as the university’s representative.

230
00:12:50,795 --> 00:12:52,488
I will give up.

231
00:12:53,351 --> 00:12:58,412
I’ll admit that you are a real deal.

232
00:12:58,412 --> 00:12:59,668
Time out.

233
00:13:04,364 --> 00:13:07,125
I think this can be good for us.

234
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:09,689
Usually, no one applies 
to be a university athlete.

235
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,582
Last year, Saennoi was the only applicant.

236
00:13:12,582 --> 00:13:16,283
If Saennoi reapplies this year, 
we can arrange it so he loses to you.

237
00:13:16,283 --> 00:13:17,453
Then our problem is solved.

238
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:19,291
You’re right.

239
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:22,631
We are lucky that Sunrise is stupid.

240
00:13:22,631 --> 00:13:24,815
He won’t see it coming.

241
00:13:37,395 --> 00:13:38,201
Sure.

242
00:13:39,231 --> 00:13:43,714
I’ll compete in the match 
and prove your allegation wrong.

243
00:13:47,045 --> 00:13:50,346
You finally fall into my trap.

244
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:53,762
I prepared opponents for you.

245
00:13:59,034 --> 00:14:03,535
They just applied to your club.

246
00:14:03,655 --> 00:14:05,698
Their applications are approved 
by your club advisor.

247
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:14,266
Let’s see if Klairung can do what he said.

248
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:18,148
If you lose,

249
00:14:18,603 --> 00:14:24,197
you need to admit that you’re…

250
00:14:26,114 --> 00:14:26,994
fake.

251
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,457
Let’s go, honey.

252
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:42,330
Damn it.

253
00:14:42,929 --> 00:14:44,773
Why does this always happen to me?

254
00:14:48,391 --> 00:14:50,619
Don’t think that you will lose.

255
00:14:50,619 --> 00:14:52,748
You are pretty talented.

256
00:14:52,748 --> 00:14:54,188
That’s right.

257
00:14:56,632 --> 00:14:59,302
I think I’m pretty talented, too.

258
00:15:00,213 --> 00:15:03,600
You haven’t fought in the ring 
for several years.

259
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,185
I think your stage fright is gone.

260
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:09,792
You think so?

261
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:11,064
Yes.

262
00:15:14,467 --> 00:15:15,740
You are probably right.

263
00:15:16,363 --> 00:15:21,354
My stage fright is not as bad as it used to be.

264
00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:25,411
You have been practicing every day lately.

265
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:29,343
I think your skills have become unbeatable.

266
00:15:37,454 --> 00:15:38,677
He must be thirsty.

267
00:15:39,133 --> 00:15:39,865
He’s chewing the ice, too.

268
00:15:42,669 --> 00:15:44,313
You are right, Han.

269
00:15:44,888 --> 00:15:48,770
My face can handle all kinds of pain.

270
00:15:49,082 --> 00:15:51,518
No punch can hurt me.

271
00:16:02,195 --> 00:16:04,779
I’m such a loser.

272
00:16:04,779 --> 00:16:06,559
That slap is not that hard.

273
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:08,218
But I already fell off my chair.

274
00:16:09,033 --> 00:16:11,152
You are drunk.

275
00:16:11,152 --> 00:16:12,568
That’s why you can’t handle it.

276
00:16:13,838 --> 00:16:14,495
Han.

277
00:16:15,813 --> 00:16:16,788
Why?

278
00:16:17,363 --> 00:16:19,103
I’ve tried so hard.

279
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:21,112
But why can’t I get good results 
like others do?

280
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:28,033
What are the differences between 
those who are talented and those who aren’t?

281
00:16:29,111 --> 00:16:30,013
I don’t know.

282
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:32,935
Maybe it’s because of your fate.

283
00:16:36,554 --> 00:16:37,955
My fate?

284
00:16:39,776 --> 00:16:43,712
Maybe your effort is not enough.

285
00:16:45,126 --> 00:16:47,968
Why don’t you ask a higher power for help?

286
00:17:00,199 --> 00:17:01,440
I’ll give it a try.

287
00:17:14,353 --> 00:17:17,718
The higher power in the shrine.

288
00:17:18,652 --> 00:17:21,102
My name is Klairung.

289
00:17:22,156 --> 00:17:30,000
Please help me win the boxing match 
and become a university athlete.

290
00:17:30,671 --> 00:17:32,810
So I can shut that asshole, Sunrise, up.

291
00:17:34,248 --> 00:17:36,014
If you grant my wish,

292
00:17:36,445 --> 00:17:41,492
I will arrange 
a Thai traditional dance performance for you.

293
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,835
Amen.

294
00:18:00,809 --> 00:18:05,862
Dad, it’s me, Klairung.
I’ll show you that I can easily win the match.

295
00:18:08,306 --> 00:18:09,658
Can you do it?

296
00:18:10,281 --> 00:18:11,321
I can do it.
