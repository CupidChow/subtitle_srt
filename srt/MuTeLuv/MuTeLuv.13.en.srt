1
00:00:05,221 --> 00:00:06,713
The price is still 5,000 baht.

2
00:00:06,832 --> 00:00:08,853
No service charge. No VAT.

3
00:00:12,368 --> 00:00:13,031
Okay.

4
00:00:13,286 --> 00:00:13,786
Deal.

5
00:00:19,643 --> 00:00:21,463
Han, can you grab my pants?

6
00:00:34,781 --> 00:00:35,523
Wait.

7
00:00:36,491 --> 00:00:37,928
How can I be sure…

8
00:00:38,268 --> 00:00:42,198
that if I pay you to perform the dance,

9
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:44,105
my hands will go back to normal?

10
00:00:44,733 --> 00:00:46,532
You can hire someone else.

11
00:00:47,058 --> 00:00:47,805
I don’t mind.

12
00:00:48,671 --> 00:00:49,845
I’m not trying the pot.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,499
I ask because I really want to know.

14
00:00:51,822 --> 00:00:53,186
Don’t worry.

15
00:00:53,509 --> 00:00:54,808
Grandma is hard to please,

16
00:00:54,808 --> 00:00:56,385
but she always keeps her promises.

17
00:00:57,285 --> 00:00:58,226
She is so smart.

18
00:00:59,618 --> 00:01:00,219
Can I ask you something?

19
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,418
Do you have answers for every question?

20
00:01:03,793 --> 00:01:04,715
Of course.

21
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,456
Because…

22
00:01:08,103 --> 00:01:09,569
I’m her granddaughter.

23
00:01:12,679 --> 00:01:14,065
Real or fake?

24
00:01:14,252 --> 00:01:15,309
Is it cake?

25
00:01:16,956 --> 00:01:17,575
It’s true.

26
00:01:18,356 --> 00:01:20,170
I’m willing to take a DNA test if you want.

27
00:01:24,567 --> 00:01:25,460
What’s your name?

28
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,458
You need to tell me.

29
00:01:29,358 --> 00:01:31,603
I have to say your name 
when I perform the dance.

30
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:34,378
Otherwise, she won’t know 
that the dance is from you.

31
00:01:34,616 --> 00:01:35,298
Klairung.

32
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:38,320
Just like the meaning of your name,

33
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:40,267
you’re almost famous.

34
00:01:42,331 --> 00:01:43,579
You really don’t know me?

35
00:01:44,054 --> 00:01:45,821
I’m a famous influencer.

36
00:01:46,551 --> 00:01:47,840
Don’t you have access to the internet?

37
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,516
Yes, I have.

38
00:01:49,127 --> 00:01:50,844
But I don’t have time 
to know everyone in the world.

39
00:02:00,706 --> 00:02:02,331
Is being homeless a trend now?

40
00:02:02,586 --> 00:02:03,933
Why is she living in a tent?

41
00:02:04,765 --> 00:02:07,260
Maybe this is for her content.

42
00:02:07,464 --> 00:02:09,685
Everyone is presenting weird content.

43
00:02:10,721 --> 00:02:11,511
Unlike us.

44
00:02:13,718 --> 00:02:14,218
Han.

45
00:02:15,712 --> 00:02:16,502
Our content is weird, too.

46
00:02:26,145 --> 00:02:26,822
Grandma.

47
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:30,262
I’m performing this dance 
on behalf of Klairung.

48
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:33,374
I will do my best, like always.

49
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,449
I hope you will like it.

50
00:03:06,149 --> 00:03:19,625
♪ Chuichai is so beautiful ♪

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,969

52
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,819
Done.

53
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,646
Don’t forget to thank Grandma.

54
00:04:51,338 --> 00:04:53,427
Thank you, Grandma.

55
00:05:17,228 --> 00:05:18,194
My hands are working fine now.

56
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:27,390
Let’s go, Han.

57
00:05:38,176 --> 00:05:39,080
Hey.

58
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,056
Can you turn on Quick Share?

59
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,955
I’m sorry

60
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:59,559
for calling you a con artist.

61
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:07,084
Your dance is beautiful.

62
00:06:10,751 --> 00:06:13,020
I know I’m a good dancer.

63
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,570
Next time, let someone else say that.

64
00:06:18,996 --> 00:06:19,668
I’m leaving.

65
00:06:27,147 --> 00:06:28,453
KLAIRUNG

66
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:32,175
KLAIRUNG PAYAP

67
00:06:33,982 --> 00:06:35,904
(So cute.)

68
00:06:46,953 --> 00:06:48,028
It’s finally over.

69
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,042
What are you going to do next?

70
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,212
Will you start practicing for the next match?

71
00:06:53,384 --> 00:06:54,489
We still have time for it.

72
00:06:54,489 --> 00:06:55,126
We can think about it later.

73
00:06:55,534 --> 00:06:58,416
Right now, we should focus on the work 
for our clients.

74
00:06:58,942 --> 00:06:59,602
That’s true.

75
00:07:00,655 --> 00:07:01,911
Money is the most important thing.

76
00:07:02,539 --> 00:07:05,642
Of course, money can knock out everything.

77
00:07:07,832 --> 00:07:08,332
Thank you.

78
00:07:13,834 --> 00:07:16,612
Rung, why are you so clumsy?

79
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:26,836
Shit, the curse is back.

80
00:07:27,142 --> 00:07:28,004
Damn it.

81
00:07:28,225 --> 00:07:30,105
But we already arranged 
a dance performance for her.

82
00:07:31,022 --> 00:07:31,893
I knew it.

83
00:07:32,097 --> 00:07:35,703
She’s a con artist.

84
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,582
Why are your hands still not working?

85
00:07:40,701 --> 00:07:43,470
I should be the one who asks you that.

86
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:44,640
It even got worse.

87
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,870
Did you promise her something else?

88
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,039
Not the dance?

89
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,980
It’s been several days.

90
00:07:50,252 --> 00:07:52,125
When will you do what you’ve promised me?

91
00:07:52,227 --> 00:07:55,426
I will not give in to that old Titan Grandma.

92
00:07:56,343 --> 00:07:57,581
I’ll defeat her.

93
00:07:59,805 --> 00:08:01,632
It’s me, Klairung.

94
00:08:06,556 --> 00:08:07,473
Grandma, no!
