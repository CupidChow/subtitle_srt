4
00:00:13,083 --> 00:00:14,445
I told you to change your phone number.

5
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:16,129
Then what?

6
00:00:16,327 --> 00:00:19,012
How can a new phone number help?

7
00:00:19,012 --> 00:00:20,227
One americano.

8
00:00:20,648 --> 00:00:22,184
I want to drink green tea today.

9
00:00:23,075 --> 00:00:24,084
I changed my number,

10
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:25,543
but my life doesn’t get any better.

11
00:00:25,543 --> 00:00:27,392
Why didn’t you consult with me first?

12
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:29,958
Which area do you want to be lucky in?

13
00:00:29,958 --> 00:00:30,991
Work.

14
00:00:31,857 --> 00:00:32,691
Finances.

15
00:00:33,508 --> 00:00:34,240
Love.

16
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,934
I want to have a meal with you.

17
00:00:36,132 --> 00:00:37,268
Hello, Na.

18
00:00:37,268 --> 00:00:38,835
You remember my name?

19
00:00:39,157 --> 00:00:41,983
Now, I believe it.
The new number has totally changed my life.

20
00:01:51,281 --> 00:01:52,618
Do you want to check your luck today?

21
00:02:04,733 --> 00:02:05,992
You have to pay the full price today.

22
00:02:07,873 --> 00:02:08,993
I told you.

23
00:02:09,414 --> 00:02:11,862
I need to sit at Table no.4 to be lucky.

24
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,828
The table is already reserved.

25
00:02:31,429 --> 00:02:32,736
Is the seat available?

26
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:34,694
Yes.

27
00:02:36,228 --> 00:02:39,807
Can I sit with you?

28
00:02:52,025 --> 00:02:53,043
Do you come here often?

29
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:56,863
I’m a regular customer.

30
00:02:57,061 --> 00:02:58,272
If I have free time, I usually come here.

31
00:03:01,886 --> 00:03:04,449
Don’t you feel lonely when drinking alone?

32
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:09,336
No.

33
00:03:10,079 --> 00:03:11,355
I’ll have a Long Run.

34
00:03:11,751 --> 00:03:13,048
I’ll go to the bathroom.

35
00:03:13,271 --> 00:03:14,260
I’ll be right back.

36
00:03:34,108 --> 00:03:36,195
My friend booked a table at another bar.

37
00:03:38,992 --> 00:03:39,971
Why don’t you come with me?

38
00:03:40,368 --> 00:03:41,349
No.

39
00:03:42,661 --> 00:03:43,669
You should come with me.

40
00:03:44,337 --> 00:03:47,243
When a woman drinks alone, it looks pitiful.

41
00:03:48,803 --> 00:03:51,962
When men make a tasteless move on a girl,

42
00:03:52,383 --> 00:03:53,852
it looks even more pathetic.

43
00:03:56,352 --> 00:03:57,658
How dare you say that to me?

44
00:03:58,128 --> 00:03:58,992
Let me go.

45
00:03:59,141 --> 00:04:01,328
If you don’t want to go, 
you can just decline the offer nicely.

46
00:04:01,328 --> 00:04:02,565
No need for the insult.

47
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:14,043
Can you please leave me alone?

48
00:04:14,612 --> 00:04:16,481
I don’t want to go with you.

49
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:18,235
Happy?

50
00:04:22,072 --> 00:04:23,102
Let me go.

51
00:04:23,374 --> 00:04:24,859
Hey, stop it.

52
00:04:25,082 --> 00:04:26,018
What are you doing?

53
00:04:26,018 --> 00:04:27,156
It’s none of your business.

54
00:04:27,552 --> 00:04:28,488
Who are you?

55
00:04:28,661 --> 00:04:29,818
Who said it’s not my business?

56
00:04:29,818 --> 00:04:30,545
Who are you?

57
00:04:30,545 --> 00:04:31,045
I…

58
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:32,518
I…

59
00:04:33,286 --> 00:04:34,186
I am…

60
00:04:34,978 --> 00:04:35,511
I’m…

61
00:04:37,962 --> 00:04:39,189
She’s my girlfriend.

62
00:04:39,189 --> 00:04:40,039
Do you have a problem with that?

63
00:05:09,794 --> 00:05:10,776
Is it clear now?

64
00:05:24,502 --> 00:05:25,236
Hey.

65
00:05:26,523 --> 00:05:27,563
I’m sorry.

66
00:05:28,108 --> 00:05:30,236
I didn’t know what to do.

67
00:05:30,236 --> 00:05:31,350
So I…

68
00:05:34,098 --> 00:05:36,229
I just wanted to get rid of him.

69
00:05:37,194 --> 00:05:40,093
Instead, I ended up crossing a line with you.

70
00:05:40,712 --> 00:05:41,549
Umm…

71
00:05:43,826 --> 00:05:44,958
Forget about it.

72
00:05:46,146 --> 00:05:47,373
It’s good that he’s gone.

73
00:06:10,592 --> 00:06:11,689
Are you okay?

74
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,168
I got the table for you.

75
00:06:20,825 --> 00:06:21,784
I’m okay.

76
00:06:22,502 --> 00:06:23,436
Thank you.

77
00:06:42,822 --> 00:06:44,136
Did you come here alone?

78
00:06:46,438 --> 00:06:47,537
Do you want to sit with me?

79
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:50,587
No.

80
00:06:50,587 --> 00:06:53,045
I’m meeting someone.

81
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:54,275
I’m waiting for him.

82
00:07:02,147 --> 00:07:02,933
Hello.

83
00:07:03,552 --> 00:07:04,593
(I’m so sorry.)

84
00:07:04,593 --> 00:07:06,407
(I’m shooting a music video.)

85
00:07:06,556 --> 00:07:08,929
(The shooting is running late.
We haven’t finished it.)

86
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:10,402
Oh.

87
00:07:10,402 --> 00:07:12,840
When will it be finished?

88
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,985
(Around 2 a.m.)

89
00:07:14,985 --> 00:07:16,154
2 a.m.?

90
00:07:16,154 --> 00:07:17,443
(Yes.)

91
00:07:17,443 --> 00:07:20,266
(I miscalculated my schedule. 
I’m so sorry for missing our date.)

92
00:07:20,464 --> 00:07:24,787
(I really wanted to meet you.
I’m so sorry. I really do.)

93
00:07:54,118 --> 00:07:55,407
My name is Leemhai.

94
00:07:56,001 --> 00:07:56,962
What’s your name?

95
00:07:58,249 --> 00:07:59,115
I’m Na.

96
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:00,205
Na?

97
00:08:01,517 --> 00:08:02,729
Just Na?

98
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:05,793
Not Nana or Nanaa?

99
00:08:06,709 --> 00:08:08,153
Just Na.

100
00:08:08,673 --> 00:08:11,494
It comes from my first name, Nararat.

101
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:14,867
Why don’t you change your name to Nara?

102
00:08:15,238 --> 00:08:16,529
So it sounds a bit more unique.

103
00:08:17,494 --> 00:08:18,228
Why?

104
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,977
My name was Mhai.

105
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:25,702
But it sounds boring.

106
00:08:26,098 --> 00:08:28,045
So I added the word ‘Lee’.

107
00:08:28,045 --> 00:08:29,834
Now my name is Leemhai.

108
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,850
Doesn’t it sound unique?

109
00:08:33,533 --> 00:08:34,842
I’m telling you.

110
00:08:34,842 --> 00:08:37,645
After I changed my name, my life changed.

111
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:42,120
Nara?

112
00:08:47,517 --> 00:08:49,242
That sounds good. It sounds snobby.

113
00:08:52,987 --> 00:08:53,933
I’m sorry.

114
00:08:55,022 --> 00:08:57,096
I thought I was talking to my friends.

115
00:08:59,027 --> 00:09:00,675
You don’t have to apologize.

116
00:09:00,824 --> 00:09:01,998
What are you apologizing for?

117
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:05,599
I want to be your friend too.

118
00:09:19,298 --> 00:09:23,048
One day, when we feel lonely, 
we can get together and act fancy.

119
00:09:33,588 --> 00:09:34,285
Cheers.

120
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:08,849
Do you want to dance?

121
00:10:15,334 --> 00:10:16,214
No.

122
00:10:16,446 --> 00:10:17,232
No.

123
00:10:17,232 --> 00:10:17,900
Come on.

124
00:10:18,766 --> 00:10:19,355
No.

125
00:10:19,355 --> 00:10:20,672
Come on. Let’s dance.

126
00:10:20,672 --> 00:10:21,421
No.

127
00:10:22,215 --> 00:10:23,205
No.

128
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:06,237
Did you have fun today?

129
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:13,571
Watch your step.

130
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:47,630
So…

131
00:12:48,175 --> 00:12:49,891
your date is not coming?

132
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,463
He said he can come around 2 a.m.

133
00:12:56,636 --> 00:13:00,431
So I told him to go home 
if he was going to come at that hour.

134
00:13:04,293 --> 00:13:05,207
That’s true.

135
00:13:08,004 --> 00:13:09,410
What about you?

136
00:13:10,524 --> 00:13:11,795
Coming to a bar alone, don’t you feel afraid?

137
00:13:13,033 --> 00:13:13,893
Afraid of what?

138
00:13:15,403 --> 00:13:16,423
Afraid of…

139
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,638
running into that kind of man.

140
00:13:22,584 --> 00:13:24,148
No need to be afraid of them.

141
00:13:26,153 --> 00:13:29,032
The bar has a secret menu.

142
00:13:29,428 --> 00:13:32,940
If you come here alone and 
a man makes an unwanted move on you,

143
00:13:33,188 --> 00:13:35,174
you just order a Long Run to the bartender.

144
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:37,543
They will move you to another table.

145
00:13:38,186 --> 00:13:39,034
Really?

146
00:13:39,034 --> 00:13:39,650
Yes.

147
00:13:39,873 --> 00:13:45,087
If you are here and encounter a crisis 
that you don’t know what to do,

148
00:13:45,384 --> 00:13:47,263
just order a Magic Moment.

149
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:50,445
The bouncers will drag him out.

150
00:13:51,336 --> 00:13:52,212
Really?

151
00:13:52,212 --> 00:13:52,942
Yes.

152
00:13:53,239 --> 00:13:55,353
I didn’t know they had this kind of service.

153
00:13:57,185 --> 00:13:59,418
You don’t go to the nightclub much, do you?

154
00:14:02,611 --> 00:14:03,381
No.

155
00:14:03,381 --> 00:14:06,840
I’m busy with work.

156
00:14:10,306 --> 00:14:11,301
What is your job?

157
00:14:12,687 --> 00:14:14,302
I’m a med student.

158
00:14:15,045 --> 00:14:16,610
I’m an extern at a hospital.

159
00:14:19,482 --> 00:14:20,092
Oh.

160
00:14:22,493 --> 00:14:23,431
What about you?

161
00:14:25,808 --> 00:14:28,075
I’m an artist.

162
00:14:28,273 --> 00:14:30,146
My work is experimental art.

163
00:15:13,899 --> 00:15:15,494
Do you believe in fate?

164
00:15:17,796 --> 00:15:18,888
Why?

165
00:15:20,596 --> 00:15:26,863
I’m curious about 
how people in scientific fields view it.

166
00:15:34,587 --> 00:15:35,638
I…

167
00:15:36,405 --> 00:15:40,201
I just changed my phone number 
to a lucky number.

168
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,041
Really?

169
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:46,473
Is it good?

170
00:15:48,775 --> 00:15:50,593
I’m not sure.

171
00:15:50,841 --> 00:15:52,284
It’d better be good

172
00:15:52,383 --> 00:15:53,647
because I paid a fortune for it.

173
00:15:55,677 --> 00:15:57,382
Don’t you think that

174
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:01,882
if we believe in superstition, 
it may make us look insecure?

175
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:09,680
If we pay a fortune teller 
and they tell us our life is getting better.

176
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:14,719
But actually, our life will be good or bad; 
it rather depends on our actions, right?

177
00:16:19,918 --> 00:16:21,172
What if…

178
00:16:22,286 --> 00:16:24,345
What if we have a bad day

179
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:26,532
and blame it on bad luck.

180
00:16:26,755 --> 00:16:28,561
So we won’t feel bad about ourselves.

181
00:16:28,957 --> 00:16:29,957
For example,

182
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:33,537
Why am I so unlucky today?

183
00:16:48,822 --> 00:16:51,646
Right now, a man is hitting on me.

184
00:16:52,191 --> 00:16:53,360
He’s a doctor like you.

185
00:17:01,901 --> 00:17:02,656
This man.

186
00:17:02,953 --> 00:17:03,778
Do you know him?

187
00:17:12,863 --> 00:17:15,949
Yes, he’s my senior at the hospital.

188
00:17:15,949 --> 00:17:17,115
Really?

189
00:17:17,709 --> 00:17:19,058
It’s such a small world.

190
00:17:21,933 --> 00:17:23,180
So…

191
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,511
do you like him?

192
00:17:25,774 --> 00:17:27,243
Do I like him?

193
00:17:29,001 --> 00:17:30,713
I’m not sure.

194
00:17:31,159 --> 00:17:33,767
He’s cute.

195
00:17:33,767 --> 00:17:35,715
He seems to be really into me.

196
00:17:36,706 --> 00:17:37,979
But…

197
00:17:42,806 --> 00:17:43,860
He’s calling.

198
00:17:58,725 --> 00:17:59,761
Aren’t you going to answer it?

199
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:00,749
No.

200
00:18:01,318 --> 00:18:02,053
It’s late.

201
00:18:02,424 --> 00:18:03,440
I’ll call him back tomorrow.

202
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,010
Yes.

203
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,380
It’s late.

204
00:18:05,801 --> 00:18:07,082
I should go home.

205
00:18:08,345 --> 00:18:08,955
Right.

206
00:18:09,673 --> 00:18:10,890
Where do you live?

207
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:11,832
Do you want me to give you a ride?

208
00:18:11,832 --> 00:18:13,606
No. I want to ride a motorcycle.

209
00:18:13,606 --> 00:18:14,269
I’ve got to go.

210
00:18:48,806 --> 00:18:50,560
[ARE YOU STILL UP, NINE?]

211
00:19:00,959 --> 00:19:03,803
You don’t need to tell me how pathetic I am.

212
00:19:04,298 --> 00:19:05,514
I know it.

213
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:10,478
My crush doesn’t return my feelings.

214
00:19:10,998 --> 00:19:12,807
Is it because of my fate or something else?

215
00:19:19,639 --> 00:19:20,428
Hello, Madam Maew.

216
00:19:20,428 --> 00:19:21,656
I’m going to buy it.

217
00:19:21,656 --> 00:19:23,812
I’ll buy the number 
that you said was perfect for me.
