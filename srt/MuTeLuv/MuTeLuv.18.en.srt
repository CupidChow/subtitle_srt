1
00:00:24,283 --> 00:00:25,621
I didn’t know that…

2
00:00:26,552 --> 00:00:28,128
you were close with Na

3
00:00:38,044 --> 00:00:41,561
Na works as an extern 
at the same hospital as me.

4
00:00:42,492 --> 00:00:46,091
I adore her as if she were my sister.

5
00:00:48,505 --> 00:00:49,350
Right, Na?

6
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:51,570
Yes.

7
00:00:59,271 --> 00:01:00,421
Leemhai, try this.

8
00:01:00,421 --> 00:01:01,453
I’m allergic to nuts.

9
00:01:02,747 --> 00:01:03,412
Is that so?

10
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:05,009
I’m sorry.

11
00:01:05,956 --> 00:01:07,146
I’ll eat it.

12
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:09,969
I’m not allergic to nuts.

13
00:01:10,916 --> 00:01:11,993
I like nuts.

14
00:01:13,113 --> 00:01:13,914
Is that so?

15
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:15,928
Here, Na.

16
00:01:26,027 --> 00:01:29,042
It’s good that Na came with us today.

17
00:01:29,642 --> 00:01:34,149
If I asked you to come with me alone, 
you would have said no, right?

18
00:01:35,995 --> 00:01:38,534
When will you give me a chance to…

19
00:01:38,534 --> 00:01:39,394
Are you alright?

20
00:01:39,394 --> 00:01:40,015
Are you okay?

21
00:01:51,217 --> 00:01:51,727
Thank you.

22
00:02:32,399 --> 00:02:33,255
Do you need a ride?

23
00:02:42,121 --> 00:02:43,202
I drove here.

24
00:02:46,358 --> 00:02:46,996
Is that so?

25
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,255
Nine, you should give Na a ride home.

26
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:04,682
I’ll do that.

27
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,017
Let’s go, Na.

28
00:03:10,074 --> 00:03:10,727
Wait.

29
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:16,306
I changed my mind.

30
00:03:17,774 --> 00:03:18,929
I’ll give her a ride home.

31
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:22,524
I just remember 
that I have something to tell you.

32
00:03:24,102 --> 00:03:25,599
Nine, thank you for today.

33
00:03:29,355 --> 00:03:30,212
Leemhai.

34
00:03:30,622 --> 00:03:31,308
Leemhai.

35
00:04:23,503 --> 00:04:24,488
Are you alright?

36
00:04:26,855 --> 00:04:27,871
Do you like Nine?

37
00:04:35,614 --> 00:04:36,231
No.

38
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,244
Don’t lie to me.

39
00:04:39,096 --> 00:04:40,380
Your actions say it all.

40
00:04:41,011 --> 00:04:41,606
I can tell.

41
00:04:46,859 --> 00:04:47,999
If you already knew, 
then why are you asking me?

42
00:04:49,577 --> 00:04:51,476
Yes, I like him.

43
00:04:51,949 --> 00:04:52,568
Why?

44
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:53,743
Can’t I do that?

45
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:56,489
You are not that interested in him, are you?

46
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:59,472
You are just flirting with him.

47
00:04:59,472 --> 00:05:00,587
So he will fall for you.

48
00:05:02,512 --> 00:05:03,559
How could you say that to me?

49
00:05:04,411 --> 00:05:05,417
Why are you saying like I’m in the wrong?

50
00:05:06,743 --> 00:05:08,472
If a man falls for me

51
00:05:08,977 --> 00:05:11,224
but I don’t feel the same way, 
is that my fault?

52
00:05:11,224 --> 00:05:12,491
Why didn’t you tell him that?

53
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,770
You just use him 
to make you feel attractive, right?

54
00:05:20,117 --> 00:05:20,958
Gosh, Na.

55
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:22,949
Don’t you think that’s too harsh?

56
00:05:27,951 --> 00:05:28,826
What about you?

57
00:05:29,536 --> 00:05:30,470
Don’t you know…

58
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:33,860
that he’s using you?

59
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,875
What do you mean?

60
00:05:38,305 --> 00:05:41,712
He’s using you to make me jealous.

61
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:43,537
Are you jealous of him?

62
00:05:43,537 --> 00:05:44,037
No.

63
00:05:44,037 --> 00:05:45,307
Then why are you angry?

64
00:05:45,307 --> 00:05:47,522
Because I’m jealous of you.

65
00:06:29,058 --> 00:06:30,437
After I gave the number to you,

66
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:32,442
my life has been going downhill.

67
00:06:33,089 --> 00:06:36,145
I don’t think it has anything to do with the number.

68
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:37,152
Do I make you feel uncomfortable?

69
00:06:37,152 --> 00:06:38,521
You like women.

70
00:06:38,521 --> 00:06:40,104
It doesn’t mean you will like me, right?

71
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,115
I think…

72
00:06:42,715 --> 00:06:44,481
I’m going to give up on Leemhai.

73
00:06:44,655 --> 00:06:47,917
Trust me. Sitting here with you and doing nothing,

74
00:06:48,343 --> 00:06:52,004
it’s one of the best moments in my life lately.
