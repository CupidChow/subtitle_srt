4
00:00:13,071 --> 00:00:14,335
Hey, Fews and Ingky.

5
00:00:14,335 --> 00:00:15,553
I didn’t know you would be here.

6
00:00:21,175 --> 00:00:23,703
I think we need to do everything
to help me pass into the next round.

7
00:00:23,703 --> 00:00:24,653
I can’t take it anymore.

8
00:00:24,653 --> 00:00:26,880
From now on,
we won’t follow your orders anymore.

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,914
I’m here to apologize to you.

10
00:00:28,243 --> 00:00:32,268
So we need to work together to bring her back.

11
00:00:32,268 --> 00:00:34,628
They are not my friends anymore.

12
00:00:49,554 --> 00:00:50,225
P’Pat.

13
00:00:50,663 --> 00:00:52,563
P’Ingky, what are you doing here?

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,740
I…

15
00:00:54,981 --> 00:00:57,621
I called my makeup artist.

16
00:00:57,621 --> 00:00:58,580
She’s on her way.

17
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,728
Okay.

18
00:00:59,728 --> 00:01:03,043
I just went to pick up my dress.

19
00:01:03,043 --> 00:01:04,048
I’m heading back to get dressed.

20
00:01:04,245 --> 00:01:05,556
Let me help you carry it.

21
00:01:05,688 --> 00:01:06,711
So you won’t be tired.

22
00:01:09,166 --> 00:01:10,333
Thank you.

23
00:01:15,331 --> 00:01:19,549
P’Pat, you’re always so nice
to me and my friends.

24
00:01:20,272 --> 00:01:21,301
I guess…

25
00:01:22,024 --> 00:01:24,027
you must have a crush on one of us, right?

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,889
Am I right?

27
00:01:28,993 --> 00:01:30,194
I like you.

28
00:01:35,455 --> 00:01:36,176
What?

29
00:01:37,798 --> 00:01:39,043
I like you, P’Ingky.

30
00:01:44,808 --> 00:01:46,453
P’Pat, what do you mean?

31
00:01:47,133 --> 00:01:48,588
You’re kidding me, aren’t you?

32
00:01:50,868 --> 00:01:52,933
What would you do if I had a heart attack?

33
00:01:54,774 --> 00:01:55,948
I mean it.

34
00:02:24,731 --> 00:02:25,405
Hey.

35
00:02:27,203 --> 00:02:27,884
Ing.

36
00:02:29,847 --> 00:02:30,722
Ing.

37
00:02:32,914 --> 00:02:33,890
Ing.

38
00:02:36,367 --> 00:02:37,329
What’s wrong?

39
00:02:37,767 --> 00:02:38,428
Girls.

40
00:02:38,603 --> 00:02:39,545
We have a problem.

41
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,351
Did you know?

42
00:02:42,337 --> 00:02:45,276
Ingky, from the look on your face.

43
00:02:45,451 --> 00:02:46,904
You knew, didn’t you?

44
00:02:46,904 --> 00:02:48,024
What the hell did you know?

45
00:02:48,309 --> 00:02:49,430
Tell me.

46
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,819
She knows that I will defeat you.

47
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,374
THE BODICE OF GODDESS DALOP

48
00:03:09,374 --> 00:03:12,736
That’s the bodice, one of the magical items.

49
00:03:15,343 --> 00:03:16,786
How did you get it?

50
00:03:16,961 --> 00:03:18,840
Aren’t you supposed to get the crown first?

51
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:20,848
Idiot.

52
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,270
Why do I need to get it myself?

53
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,001
I have many followers.

54
00:03:25,001 --> 00:03:26,386
I ordered them to find it for me.

55
00:03:26,386 --> 00:03:32,719
Now, the three of you can no longer stop me.

56
00:04:37,441 --> 00:04:39,079
What should we do?

57
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,557
If Kat wins the crown,

58
00:04:40,952 --> 00:04:41,957
what are we going to do?

59
00:04:42,242 --> 00:04:42,993
I think…

60
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:46,267
we need to steal the crown.

61
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,889
It’s easier said than done.

62
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:51,136
But how?

63
00:04:51,136 --> 00:04:52,592
How are you going to steal it?

64
00:04:54,718 --> 00:04:56,634
I have an idea.

65
00:05:02,115 --> 00:05:04,209
EDITH PROOF
FOUNDER OF MISS GOLDEN FLOWER
I have a boyfriend.

66
00:05:04,209 --> 00:05:06,843
But he’s not living in Thailand.

67
00:05:06,843 --> 00:05:08,870
He lives in Zimbabwe.

68
00:05:09,177 --> 00:05:10,786
I have never met him.

69
00:05:10,786 --> 00:05:12,505
But we talk to each other all the time.

70
00:05:12,505 --> 00:05:15,422
What about your sex life?

71
00:05:15,422 --> 00:05:18,701
Can you make it work without sex?

72
00:05:18,854 --> 00:05:21,535
Who said we don’t have sex?

73
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,346
We have virtual sex.

74
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:27,941
Hi, baby.

75
00:05:27,941 --> 00:05:31,049
Hi, Nigel. How are you?

76
00:05:31,049 --> 00:05:33,228
I want to f*ck you so bad.

77
00:05:33,447 --> 00:05:34,838
She is so raunchy.

78
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:36,262
Isn’t it too racy?

79
00:05:36,262 --> 00:05:37,534
What a disgrace!

80
00:05:37,534 --> 00:05:38,516
It’s too much.

81
00:05:38,516 --> 00:05:39,016
That’s enough.

82
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,775
Let’s follow the plan.

83
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:43,810
You get what I mean, right?

84
00:05:44,073 --> 00:05:45,219
Yeah.

85
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:47,453
This is an important mission.

86
00:05:48,286 --> 00:05:48,982
So…

87
00:05:51,152 --> 00:05:52,623
Let’s do our team routine.

88
00:05:56,376 --> 00:05:56,876
Come on.

89
00:05:58,082 --> 00:05:59,777
Transformation.

90
00:05:59,777 --> 00:06:05,703
Doll Power, make up!

91
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:19,120
I’m the pretty guardian.

92
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,409
The protector of beauty and glamor.

93
00:06:24,745 --> 00:06:27,011
Lunar Guardian.

94
00:06:31,834 --> 00:06:33,688
I’m the knowledgeable guardian.

95
00:06:33,688 --> 00:06:36,684
The protector of books and podcasts.

96
00:06:38,306 --> 00:06:41,326
Aqua Guardian.

97
00:06:46,786 --> 00:06:48,449
I’m the fiery queen.

98
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:50,273
The protector of power and authority.

99
00:06:53,501 --> 00:06:56,345
Amber Guardian.

100
00:06:58,493 --> 00:07:03,048
In the name of the itch, we will punish you.

101
00:07:08,616 --> 00:07:10,069
Do we need to do it too?

102
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:15,630
No.

103
00:07:29,638 --> 00:07:30,837
Hello.

104
00:07:31,342 --> 00:07:32,786
(Hello, darling.)

105
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,946
(It’s me, Nigel.)

106
00:07:35,385 --> 00:07:38,137
(I came to Thailand to cheer you on.)

107
00:07:38,422 --> 00:07:41,890
(Can you come to the bathroom
at the back of the resort to meet me?

108
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:44,382
(I prepared a surprise for you.)

109
00:07:44,952 --> 00:07:45,833
Sure.

110
00:07:46,008 --> 00:07:48,100
Yes, of course.

111
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,629
See you later, my darling.

112
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,453
Darling.

113
00:07:54,935 --> 00:07:55,891
I’m coming.

114
00:07:55,891 --> 00:07:56,909
I’m here.

115
00:07:58,685 --> 00:07:59,879
Look.

116
00:08:00,975 --> 00:08:04,821
You still love playing hide and seek.

117
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:10,457
Darling, I’m coming.

118
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,141
I don’t see my man.

119
00:08:13,141 --> 00:08:14,325
There are only poops.

120
00:08:15,476 --> 00:08:16,739
Gosh.

121
00:08:21,471 --> 00:08:23,908
Please come out.

122
00:08:23,908 --> 00:08:29,533
You are still as playful as ever, darling.

123
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:32,321
Hello, darling.

124
00:08:37,516 --> 00:08:39,092
The eagle is in the nest.

125
00:08:39,092 --> 00:08:41,414
Repeat, the eagle is in the nest.

126
00:08:43,672 --> 00:08:44,523
I’m here.

127
00:08:45,334 --> 00:08:47,146
Where the hell are you wearing?

128
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,175
It’s a regular outfit.

129
00:08:48,175 --> 00:08:48,913
Where is the keycard?

130
00:08:48,913 --> 00:08:49,715
Did you have it?

131
00:08:49,715 --> 00:08:50,617
Don’t worry.

132
00:08:50,727 --> 00:08:51,563
I got a dozen of them.

133
00:08:51,563 --> 00:08:52,297
Let’s go.

134
00:08:56,309 --> 00:08:56,980
Watch your step.

135
00:08:58,427 --> 00:08:59,845
I think there must be some security system.

136
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:05,037
Why did you blow the powder?

137
00:09:06,286 --> 00:09:08,026
There might be a laser sensor.

138
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:12,994
Oops.

139
00:09:13,805 --> 00:09:15,503
I guess it doesn’t have one.

140
00:09:30,146 --> 00:09:31,487
I think I found it.

141
00:09:32,868 --> 00:09:34,204
You found the crown?

142
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:35,568
No.

143
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,861
But I’m certain that the crown is in this safe.

144
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,030
What?

145
00:09:44,806 --> 00:09:45,912
Who are you?

146
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,927
What do you want from me?

147
00:09:47,146 --> 00:09:47,833
Shut up.

148
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:49,572
Damn, Bruce Wayne.

149
00:09:49,572 --> 00:09:51,184
Tell us the combination to your safe.

150
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,519
Why will I do that?

151
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:53,425
I won’t tell you.

152
00:09:53,425 --> 00:09:54,085
Go.

153
00:09:54,392 --> 00:09:55,103
What?

154
00:09:55,388 --> 00:09:56,652
Stay still.

155
00:09:56,652 --> 00:09:57,588
What?

156
00:09:58,909 --> 00:10:00,143
I’ll make a twisted face

157
00:10:00,143 --> 00:10:01,357
so you can’t unlock my phone.

158
00:10:01,357 --> 00:10:02,325
Don’t move.

159
00:10:03,706 --> 00:10:04,406
Stay still.

160
00:10:07,346 --> 00:10:11,491
(Oh, easy. It’s tickling.)

161
00:10:14,598 --> 00:10:17,558
Tell us, or we will leak your sex video.

162
00:10:19,312 --> 00:10:20,638
I looked great in the video.

163
00:10:20,638 --> 00:10:21,406
You can release it.

164
00:10:21,647 --> 00:10:24,009
I can’t wait for it to be released.

165
00:10:24,009 --> 00:10:28,367
Look, I’ll send insulting messages
to all your friends.

166
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,280
They will cut you off.

167
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,722
They have cut me off.

168
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,732
They already unfriended me.

169
00:10:35,521 --> 00:10:36,210
Shit.

170
00:10:36,626 --> 00:10:37,547
She’s definitely bluffing.

171
00:10:37,656 --> 00:10:38,901
I’m not bluffing.

172
00:10:39,647 --> 00:10:43,224
I have no weak points for you to attack me.

173
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,992
I have no weak points
except that I use fake luxury goods.

174
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:47,788
What?

175
00:10:48,402 --> 00:10:49,640
You use fake luxury goods?

176
00:10:52,249 --> 00:10:53,034
Did I say that?

177
00:10:53,034 --> 00:10:54,629
Yes, you did.

178
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:57,214
Tell us, or I will expose you.

179
00:10:57,367 --> 00:10:58,290
Do it.

180
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:00,420
You can expose that I use fake luxury goods.

181
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:03,740
I’m not scared as long as
you don’t tell anyone that I’m broke.

182
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:06,242
Huh? You are broke?

183
00:11:08,478 --> 00:11:09,959
Did I say that?

184
00:11:10,682 --> 00:11:11,686
Don’t tell anyone.

185
00:11:11,686 --> 00:11:12,319
No!

186
00:11:12,319 --> 00:11:13,386
Hold her head still.

187
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:15,076
No.

188
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:22,989
This is why you can’t afford
to book the hotel for another night.

189
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,205
You can’t take us on a cruise.

190
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:28,391
Because you are broke.

191
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,343
Here.

192
00:11:30,343 --> 00:11:31,703
What do you want me to do?

193
00:11:42,748 --> 00:11:43,248
Girls.

194
00:11:43,818 --> 00:11:45,480
P’Kat is going somewhere.

195
00:11:45,897 --> 00:11:47,066
I’m following her.

196
00:11:48,359 --> 00:11:50,157
You can go ahead.

197
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:51,834
I’ll follow you after I’m done.

198
00:11:52,535 --> 00:11:53,737
Yes, Goddess.

199
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:08,853
P’Pat.

200
00:12:09,818 --> 00:12:10,895
Where are you going?

201
00:12:11,377 --> 00:12:12,495
Don’t say anything.

202
00:12:13,657 --> 00:12:14,265
P’Kat.

203
00:12:15,602 --> 00:12:16,822
What a coincidence.

204
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,866
There’s no such thing as a coincidence.

205
00:12:22,685 --> 00:12:24,978
You are following me.

206
00:12:24,978 --> 00:12:27,242
Do you think I don’t know
what you are thinking?

207
00:12:27,527 --> 00:12:28,744
Okay.

208
00:12:29,408 --> 00:12:31,249
I’ll do it quickly.

209
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:41,098
P’Pat, don’t be shy.

210
00:12:48,377 --> 00:12:49,200
P’Pat.

211
00:12:49,901 --> 00:12:50,896
Stay still.

212
00:12:51,334 --> 00:12:52,332
Stay still.

213
00:12:52,924 --> 00:12:55,034
You can’t run away from me.

214
00:12:58,432 --> 00:12:59,479
No.

215
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,228
I’m following you
because Nevia told me to keep an eye on you

216
00:13:02,228 --> 00:13:03,834
while they are stealing the crown.

217
00:13:04,207 --> 00:13:04,887
What?

218
00:13:09,029 --> 00:13:09,765
Guys.

219
00:13:10,225 --> 00:13:11,719
Please let me go.

220
00:13:12,136 --> 00:13:13,038
I’m begging you.

221
00:13:13,038 --> 00:13:14,989
You can do anything to me.

222
00:13:14,989 --> 00:13:17,880
But you can’t tell anyone that I’m broke.

223
00:13:18,318 --> 00:13:20,167
You can’t do that.

224
00:13:20,693 --> 00:13:22,751
Please help me since we both are queers.

225
00:13:23,299 --> 00:13:24,458
Who said I’m a queer?

226
00:13:24,611 --> 00:13:26,574
I’m not a queer.

227
00:13:26,574 --> 00:13:28,479
Who are you trying to fool?

228
00:13:28,479 --> 00:13:30,397
Look at your nails and earrings.

229
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,777
I can tell from the sound of your breath
that you are a queer.

230
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,929
I don’t care.

231
00:13:34,929 --> 00:13:37,892
If you don’t tell us,
you will not only lose the crown

232
00:13:38,462 --> 00:13:40,714
but also everything.

233
00:13:41,832 --> 00:13:42,949
Alright.

234
00:13:42,949 --> 00:13:47,641
Five, three, eight, one.

235
00:13:48,539 --> 00:13:49,453
Kat is coming here.

236
00:13:51,251 --> 00:13:51,896
We've got to go.

237
00:13:51,896 --> 00:13:52,663
What are you waiting for?

238
00:13:52,663 --> 00:13:53,212
What?

239
00:13:53,212 --> 00:13:54,340
Where are you going?

240
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,166
Hey!

241
00:13:55,298 --> 00:13:57,086
Come back and untie me.

242
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:57,962
Come back.

243
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:58,829
I’m here to help you.

244
00:13:58,829 --> 00:14:01,122
Ghost! Ghost in Thai traditional dress.

245
00:14:01,122 --> 00:14:01,891
Hey!

246
00:14:01,891 --> 00:14:02,656
I’m not a ghost.

247
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,921
Untie me.

248
00:14:06,294 --> 00:14:07,333
Help her, now.

249
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:08,289
I’ll untie you.

250
00:14:08,289 --> 00:14:09,647
Hurry up. Help her.

251
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,831
I don’t trust anyone.

252
00:14:19,831 --> 00:14:20,900
Turn back.

253
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:22,756
Do it.

254
00:14:40,195 --> 00:14:43,352
From now on, you need to do everything
to protect the crown.

255
00:14:43,352 --> 00:14:45,551
Lock the door and chain it.

256
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:48,021
No one is allowed to come into this room.

257
00:14:48,898 --> 00:14:49,854
Who are you talking to?

258
00:14:50,117 --> 00:14:52,776
I’m talking to my staff.
None of them is here?

259
00:14:53,095 --> 00:14:54,822
Where the hell are they?

260
00:14:55,984 --> 00:14:57,353
Who the hell are you?

261
00:14:58,274 --> 00:15:00,064
Why the hell are you here? Get out.

262
00:15:00,064 --> 00:15:00,676
Go away.

263
00:15:08,421 --> 00:15:13,440
The six finalists are…

264
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:34,177
What happened?

265
00:15:34,491 --> 00:15:37,690
I was almost caught.

266
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:38,953
Kat suddenly rushed to the bathroom.

267
00:15:38,953 --> 00:15:40,851
I almost couldn’t get change.

268
00:15:40,851 --> 00:15:42,129
There are three of them.

269
00:15:42,129 --> 00:15:45,316
- What kind of people are they?
- How could they do this to me?

270
00:15:50,104 --> 00:15:50,808
Stop.

271
00:15:52,407 --> 00:15:55,145
Miss Edith, they are the thieves.

272
00:15:55,145 --> 00:15:56,266
Thieves?

273
00:15:56,564 --> 00:15:57,251
We didn’t steal anything.

274
00:15:57,251 --> 00:15:58,204
You have no proof.

275
00:15:58,204 --> 00:16:00,454
Wait, I’ll show you the proof.

276
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:02,465
Security.

277
00:16:04,745 --> 00:16:05,323
Yes.

278
00:16:09,016 --> 00:16:11,450
Wait, the security is also a queer.

279
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:12,180
No.

280
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,782
Who are you trying to fool?

281
00:16:14,336 --> 00:16:16,116
It’s obvious.
Why are you still asking me that?

282
00:16:18,162 --> 00:16:22,884
Security, do you have the footage?

283
00:16:24,461 --> 00:16:25,468
No.

284
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,887
You don’t have the CCTV footage?

285
00:16:28,143 --> 00:16:28,964
No, we don’t have CCTV cameras.

286
00:16:31,543 --> 00:16:32,419
What is that?

287
00:16:32,419 --> 00:16:33,755
It’s a fake camera.

288
00:16:33,811 --> 00:16:36,001
I’m the surveillance.

289
00:16:36,222 --> 00:16:37,166
Is that so?

290
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:39,011
Will I get my stuff back?

291
00:16:39,011 --> 00:16:40,315
Good job.

292
00:16:40,976 --> 00:16:41,651
P’Pat.

293
00:16:43,505 --> 00:16:46,619
Didn’t you tell me
that they were stealing the crown?

294
00:16:53,184 --> 00:16:54,268
I don’t know.

295
00:16:54,609 --> 00:16:55,947
I don’t know anything.

296
00:16:55,947 --> 00:16:56,666
What?

297
00:16:56,858 --> 00:16:57,491
See?

298
00:16:57,491 --> 00:16:58,599
Stop scaring him.

299
00:16:59,233 --> 00:17:00,919
How is this possible?

300
00:17:01,068 --> 00:17:04,491
It must be one of them. Tell me.

301
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:07,410
I want to tell you, but I don’t know who it was.

302
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:08,392
It’s me.

303
00:17:12,144 --> 00:17:13,528
My friend and I did it.

304
00:17:14,551 --> 00:17:16,125
Shit, Bank.

305
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:18,891
Why didn’t you change your clothes
before you came here?

306
00:17:18,891 --> 00:17:19,913
What the f*ck!

307
00:17:20,254 --> 00:17:21,766
I’m here for her to catch me.

308
00:17:22,214 --> 00:17:23,242
No, it’s not you.

309
00:17:24,883 --> 00:17:26,119
Do you really not remember?

310
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:27,199
It’s not them.

311
00:17:27,251 --> 00:17:30,484
I remember. One of them is a queer.

312
00:17:30,484 --> 00:17:31,807
That’s true.

313
00:17:36,283 --> 00:17:38,081
That’s right. We are queers.

314
00:17:38,081 --> 00:17:38,799
Right?

315
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:39,482
Right?

316
00:17:41,931 --> 00:17:42,959
Show them.

317
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:50,370
They are mocking our community.

318
00:17:50,711 --> 00:17:52,521
Then it’s them.

319
00:17:52,521 --> 00:17:53,612
Security, catch them.

320
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:54,830
Hold on.

321
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:57,966
It’s not them. It’s these girls.

322
00:17:57,966 --> 00:17:58,685
What?

323
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:02,690
- Edith just said it’s them.
- It’s not them.

324
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:03,190
Hey!

325
00:18:03,361 --> 00:18:04,756
Stop.

326
00:18:04,969 --> 00:18:05,703
Stop.

327
00:18:05,811 --> 00:18:07,577
Enough.

328
00:18:08,472 --> 00:18:09,429
Security.

329
00:18:09,429 --> 00:18:09,929
Yes.

330
00:18:09,929 --> 00:18:10,429
Catch them.

331
00:18:10,941 --> 00:18:12,456
What?

332
00:18:12,456 --> 00:18:13,382
What?

333
00:18:13,382 --> 00:18:14,565
Catch them.

334
00:18:14,565 --> 00:18:15,891
You, get back to the contest.

335
00:18:15,891 --> 00:18:16,924
Yes, it’s time to remove the hair rollers.

336
00:18:16,924 --> 00:18:17,595
Go!

337
00:18:18,362 --> 00:18:19,385
We should go.

338
00:18:20,088 --> 00:18:21,145
Go.

339
00:18:21,614 --> 00:18:22,880
I told you to go.

340
00:18:23,946 --> 00:18:25,464
Let’s go.

341
00:19:52,926 --> 00:19:56,703
This is the time you're all waiting for.

342
00:19:57,065 --> 00:20:02,032
The six finalists are…

343
00:20:04,057 --> 00:20:05,994
They are…

344
00:20:07,102 --> 00:20:09,293
They are…

345
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:14,689
Huh?

346
00:20:15,094 --> 00:20:16,224
We are running out of time?

347
00:20:17,077 --> 00:20:17,769
Dang it.

348
00:20:18,878 --> 00:20:19,537
We are running out of time.

349
00:20:19,537 --> 00:20:20,678
I’ll announce it now.

350
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:25,420
The six finalists are Khaimen, Pailin,
and the four members of Air Dolls.

351
00:20:26,421 --> 00:20:27,659
Yes, you.

352
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:28,875
The rest are eliminated.

353
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:31,778
Go.

354
00:20:50,576 --> 00:20:55,592
If you didn’t win Miss Golden Flower this year.

355
00:20:56,061 --> 00:20:58,986
Because they say you weren’t pretty enough.

356
00:20:59,135 --> 00:21:00,575
You were ugly.

357
00:21:00,809 --> 00:21:02,284
You looked hideous.

358
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:04,907
What would you say to them?

359
00:21:05,251 --> 00:21:10,316
If I didn’t win Miss Golden Flower,

360
00:21:10,316 --> 00:21:13,540
I would compete in other pageants.

361
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,412
I believe that

362
00:21:15,412 --> 00:21:17,679
beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

363
00:21:17,828 --> 00:21:21,151
Those losers would never dare
to say it to my face.

364
00:21:21,151 --> 00:21:22,706
Thank you.

365
00:21:23,409 --> 00:21:28,196
It says language is a door to the world.

366
00:21:28,851 --> 00:21:35,371
If you need to teach a Thai proverb
to foreigners,

367
00:21:35,371 --> 00:21:37,126
what proverb will you teach them?

368
00:21:37,411 --> 00:21:40,284
The Thai language is not that difficult.

369
00:21:40,703 --> 00:21:42,463
No need to understand.

370
00:21:42,697 --> 00:21:43,409
Just feel it.

371
00:21:43,622 --> 00:21:44,858
Thank you.

372
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:51,255
If you could tell everyone in the world
to change one habit,

373
00:21:51,681 --> 00:21:52,916
what would you tell them?

374
00:21:54,643 --> 00:21:56,133
Stop being so full of yourself.

375
00:21:56,304 --> 00:21:57,052
Thank you.

376
00:21:58,251 --> 00:22:02,902
If you woke up and found that
you were the daughter of an ambassador.

377
00:22:03,073 --> 00:22:07,931
But the embassy was located
in the middle of the Amazon.

378
00:22:08,357 --> 00:22:09,580
What would you do?

379
00:22:10,859 --> 00:22:12,037
That’s easy.

380
00:22:12,442 --> 00:22:16,980
I would find alliances
and join King Kong’s government.

381
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,639
Then I will…

382
00:22:28,411 --> 00:22:31,757
Now, it’s time that
everyone has been waiting for.

383
00:22:32,098 --> 00:22:37,561
The fifth runner-up of Miss Golden Flower is…

384
00:22:40,417 --> 00:22:42,714
We are running out of time again?

385
00:22:42,714 --> 00:22:44,001
How much time do we have?

386
00:22:44,001 --> 00:22:45,350
Ten minutes?

387
00:22:45,491 --> 00:22:46,580
I’m sorry.

388
00:22:47,092 --> 00:22:49,211
We only have 30 minutes left.

389
00:22:49,211 --> 00:22:50,454
Otherwise, I will have to pay overtime wages.

390
00:22:50,454 --> 00:22:51,779
I’ll hurry and announce it.

391
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:57,635
All the members of Air Dolls
didn’t win the crown.

392
00:22:58,731 --> 00:23:00,663
I’ll announce the winner now.

393
00:23:00,663 --> 00:23:01,430
Get the crown here.

394
00:23:01,899 --> 00:23:03,087
No.

395
00:23:03,251 --> 00:23:04,496
It’s not true.

396
00:23:04,624 --> 00:23:06,637
Do you want to see the crown?

397
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:14,025
What?

398
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:15,944
The crown is gone.

399
00:23:16,797 --> 00:23:18,035
The crown?!

400
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:20,874
Kat.

401
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:24,691
Did you steal it?

402
00:23:24,691 --> 00:23:25,593
Yes.

403
00:23:25,593 --> 00:23:26,566
No.

404
00:23:26,673 --> 00:23:27,675
What should we do?

405
00:23:28,187 --> 00:23:29,452
Let’s run.

406
00:23:29,793 --> 00:23:30,686
Run?

407
00:23:32,231 --> 00:23:37,383
Catch them.

408
00:23:51,604 --> 00:23:53,766
You didn’t expect this, did you?

409
00:23:58,413 --> 00:24:00,371
Five, three, eight, eight, zero.

410
00:24:00,968 --> 00:24:04,155
You didn’t think I would be this smart, right?

411
00:24:04,155 --> 00:24:06,044
You can give up now.

412
00:24:06,257 --> 00:24:08,964
I’m holding the ceremony right now.

413
00:24:09,433 --> 00:24:13,008
I’m not waiting for you to take revenge on me.

414
00:24:13,179 --> 00:24:14,712
Bye.

415
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:21,762
Girls.

416
00:24:22,295 --> 00:24:23,759
She double-crossed us.

417
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:24,846
What do we do?

418
00:24:31,331 --> 00:24:32,531
P’Pat.

419
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,742
How are you doing?

420
00:24:34,573 --> 00:24:35,498
I’m okay.

421
00:24:36,435 --> 00:24:37,791
How are you?

422
00:24:38,388 --> 00:24:39,742
I thought you would have been caught.

423
00:24:41,532 --> 00:24:43,913
We are doing okay. Everything is good.

424
00:24:51,373 --> 00:24:52,256
P’Ingky.

425
00:24:53,663 --> 00:24:55,524
Can I talk to you in private?

426
00:25:11,067 --> 00:25:12,675
I confessed that I like you.

427
00:25:12,675 --> 00:25:13,956
What do you think about it?

428
00:25:17,811 --> 00:25:19,567
You are avoiding me.

429
00:25:20,356 --> 00:25:21,792
It makes me feel anxious.

430
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:29,249
Pat.

431
00:25:31,907 --> 00:25:33,466
I’m really sorry.

432
00:25:33,956 --> 00:25:35,568
I can’t accept your feelings.

433
00:25:35,568 --> 00:25:36,246
Huh?

434
00:25:46,221 --> 00:25:46,890
I…

435
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:48,751
I really like you.

436
00:25:49,284 --> 00:25:50,938
I have had a crush on you for a long time.

437
00:25:51,251 --> 00:25:52,534
You are good-looking.

438
00:25:52,641 --> 00:25:53,750
You are kind.

439
00:25:53,878 --> 00:25:55,561
Your hair is cool.

440
00:25:55,561 --> 00:25:58,101
You are also very nice to us.

441
00:25:58,996 --> 00:26:01,566
But we are too different.

442
00:26:02,162 --> 00:26:03,408
It’s like we live in two different worlds.

443
00:26:03,557 --> 00:26:04,742
I think it will never work out between us.

444
00:26:05,765 --> 00:26:06,963
I’m very sorry.

445
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:19,687
Okay, I get it.

446
00:26:21,051 --> 00:26:23,246
I’ve got to go.

447
00:27:02,971 --> 00:27:05,141
Queers, come out.

448
00:27:11,665 --> 00:27:12,650
Idiot.

449
00:27:12,863 --> 00:27:15,396
Do you know
what a huge mistake you just made?

450
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:16,447
What mistake?

451
00:27:17,086 --> 00:27:17,872
No.

452
00:27:18,469 --> 00:27:19,319
I didn’t make any mistakes.

453
00:27:19,511 --> 00:27:21,150
If I dated him, that would be a mistake.

454
00:27:21,555 --> 00:27:22,765
Imagine this.

455
00:27:22,765 --> 00:27:25,088
If his fans found out, they would stab me

456
00:27:25,088 --> 00:27:26,757
because they were jealous
of our perfect couple.

457
00:27:27,013 --> 00:27:28,286
I would have to die because of this?

458
00:27:28,286 --> 00:27:29,898
Stop imagining things, idiot.

459
00:27:30,111 --> 00:27:31,838
You can date him secretly.

460
00:27:33,251 --> 00:27:34,209
Are you crazy?

461
00:27:34,209 --> 00:27:35,796
I’m just saying no to him for the time being.

462
00:27:36,372 --> 00:27:37,789
It’s not the right time.

463
00:27:38,087 --> 00:27:39,835
When it’s the right time for you,

464
00:27:39,984 --> 00:27:42,687
he would have moved on from you, idiot.

465
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:54,351
P’Pat.

466
00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:56,085
P’Pat.

467
00:27:57,129 --> 00:27:57,858
P’Pat.

468
00:28:01,482 --> 00:28:03,657
What? Why are you calling me?

469
00:28:10,116 --> 00:28:10,976
P’Pat.

470
00:28:11,871 --> 00:28:13,265
I’ve been thinking about it.

471
00:28:14,245 --> 00:28:16,127
I think if we are dating,

472
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:19,161
it will be the best thing in my life.

473
00:28:19,523 --> 00:28:20,422
I’m sorry.

474
00:28:20,721 --> 00:28:22,037
I already got over you.

475
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:24,596
What?

476
00:28:25,193 --> 00:28:26,367
If you have nothing else to say,

477
00:28:26,516 --> 00:28:28,169
excuse me.

478
00:28:31,728 --> 00:28:32,352
Huh?

479
00:28:34,338 --> 00:28:35,175
P’Pat.

480
00:28:35,729 --> 00:28:37,163
How can you get over me so quickly?

481
00:28:37,717 --> 00:28:38,393
P’Pat.

482
00:28:39,352 --> 00:28:40,713
P’Pat.

483
00:28:41,424 --> 00:28:43,044
It’s okay.

484
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:46,386
It’s okay.

485
00:28:48,269 --> 00:28:49,247
It’s okay.

486
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:51,722
P’Pat.

487
00:28:54,042 --> 00:28:55,834
Ingky.

488
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:58,141
It’s okay.

489
00:28:58,375 --> 00:28:59,499
He’s gone.

490
00:29:00,202 --> 00:29:02,175
Now, let’s focus on Kat.

491
00:29:03,667 --> 00:29:04,902
You’re right.

492
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:07,238
Kat is holding the ceremony tonight.

493
00:29:08,048 --> 00:29:09,555
Is there nothing we can do?

494
00:29:15,012 --> 00:29:15,859
Hello.

495
00:29:16,051 --> 00:29:17,811
(Hello, P’Nevia.)

496
00:29:17,811 --> 00:29:19,251
(Where are you?)

497
00:29:19,592 --> 00:29:20,582
Who is this?

498
00:29:21,562 --> 00:29:23,433
(It’s me.)

499
00:29:24,009 --> 00:29:25,132
Lookjeab.

500
00:29:25,345 --> 00:29:26,530
(Yes.)

501
00:29:26,701 --> 00:29:28,620
(So where are you?)

502
00:29:30,155 --> 00:29:33,443
(Okay, I’ll come to see you.)

503
00:29:35,851 --> 00:29:36,561
What?

504
00:29:37,731 --> 00:29:39,629
You are fake.

505
00:29:39,629 --> 00:29:41,050
Who is the fake goddess?

506
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:44,390
I found the real goddess.

507
00:30:15,743 --> 00:30:17,779
She was as pretty as a flower.

508
00:30:17,859 --> 00:30:19,742
She was as delicate as a stream.

509
00:30:20,542 --> 00:30:25,819
This is the real picture of the Queen Dalop
of the Funan Empire from 100 years ago.

510
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:31,339
It’s proof of her story
that no one ever told you.

511
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:40,284
She was very beautiful and talented.

512
00:30:40,419 --> 00:30:45,811
She was ruling the kingdom peacefully
for over 20 years.

513
00:30:49,911 --> 00:30:51,837
Many people loved her. But some hated her.

514
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:54,850
Her servants were jealous of her.

515
00:30:55,639 --> 00:30:58,445
The group was led by
the evil sorceress, Barai.

516
00:31:05,215 --> 00:31:06,908
Her close servant betrayed her.

517
00:31:07,091 --> 00:31:09,262
She and other servants staged a revolt.

518
00:31:09,262 --> 00:31:14,288
They killed the queen and seized all her power.

519
00:31:18,312 --> 00:31:21,528
Are you saying the spirit possesses Kat…

520
00:31:21,528 --> 00:31:25,619
Yes, the spirit that possesses her
is the evil sorceress.

521
00:31:25,809 --> 00:31:28,390
Med used black magic to make everyone
believe that she was the goddess.

522
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:34,740
Damn.

523
00:31:35,374 --> 00:31:36,757
She looks exactly like Kat.

524
00:31:37,859 --> 00:31:38,679
I knew it.

525
00:31:39,712 --> 00:31:42,136
The goddess wouldn’t have
such a terrible manner as hers.

526
00:31:42,536 --> 00:31:43,142
That’s right.

527
00:31:43,859 --> 00:31:46,851
If Kat is under the black magic,

528
00:31:46,851 --> 00:31:48,289
how will we defeat her?

529
00:31:48,939 --> 00:31:50,423
Don’t worry.

530
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:54,263
Wait.

531
00:31:54,659 --> 00:31:56,402
How many photos will you print out?

532
00:31:57,402 --> 00:31:59,717
Your printer is working so well.

533
00:32:07,318 --> 00:32:07,966
Awesome.

534
00:32:08,083 --> 00:32:09,553
So damn pretty.

535
00:32:09,553 --> 00:32:10,850
Of course.

536
00:32:10,983 --> 00:32:14,078
Divas like us always make everything clear.

537
00:32:14,311 --> 00:32:17,190
No hiding, no secrets.

538
00:32:18,573 --> 00:32:19,567
Do you want more?

539
00:32:19,984 --> 00:32:20,710
That’s enough.

540
00:32:26,061 --> 00:32:28,324
Not long after the queen died.

541
00:32:28,457 --> 00:32:31,461
Her loyal servants came back
to take revenge for her.

542
00:32:31,461 --> 00:32:36,862
They used the sacred wooden stick
to destroy Barai’s black magic.

543
00:32:37,062 --> 00:32:41,344
If you hit Kat’s head with this stick,
it will be over.

544
00:32:42,611 --> 00:32:43,228
And…

545
00:32:43,828 --> 00:32:45,689
where can I find the stick?

546
00:32:45,689 --> 00:32:46,414
Here.

547
00:32:50,897 --> 00:32:53,843
I’ll never let you down.

548
00:32:53,843 --> 00:32:57,753
Luckily, I have the magical stick.

549
00:32:57,753 --> 00:33:01,405
I’m willing to sell it to you at a special price.

550
00:33:03,705 --> 00:33:04,590
5,000 baht.

551
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:06,311
You can pay via QR code payment.

552
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:09,686
You seem to have so much fun.

553
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,350
You are fake.

554
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:44,551
How dare you come here?

555
00:33:46,385 --> 00:33:47,307
Shut up.

556
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:49,254
You are fake.

557
00:33:49,854 --> 00:33:54,929
I know you and Med work together
to lie to everyone here.

558
00:33:56,179 --> 00:33:56,947
What?

559
00:33:57,247 --> 00:33:58,205
Who is lying?

560
00:33:58,405 --> 00:34:00,462
You can’t groundlessly accuse us.

561
00:34:00,679 --> 00:34:01,889
Are you crazy, Nevia?

562
00:34:02,272 --> 00:34:03,670
Who is the fake goddess?

563
00:34:03,903 --> 00:34:09,623
Everyone, have you wondered
why our revered Goddess Dalop

564
00:34:09,623 --> 00:34:13,506
chose this trashy body?

565
00:34:22,658 --> 00:34:23,394
Done.

566
00:34:28,162 --> 00:34:28,768
Gosh!

567
00:34:30,302 --> 00:34:31,957
Is this real?

568
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:33,699
This is nasty.

569
00:34:34,782 --> 00:34:40,916
The spirit in this body
is not our beloved Goddess Dalop.

570
00:34:40,916 --> 00:34:42,777
Actually, it’s the evil servant, Barai.

571
00:34:44,523 --> 00:34:46,133
You can’t say that.

572
00:34:46,299 --> 00:34:47,963
I spent hundreds of thousands of baht on her.

573
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,071
Are you saying I’m worshipping a servant?

574
00:34:50,259 --> 00:34:53,259
No, she’s not a servant.

575
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:54,498
Yes, she is.

576
00:34:58,915 --> 00:35:00,460
Can you stop spinning?

577
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:09,216
This is the picture from a real historical record.

578
00:35:09,339 --> 00:35:14,785
The record said
Queen Dalop was backstabbed by Barai.

579
00:35:15,185 --> 00:35:17,400
This cunning Med.

580
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:20,536
I mean Medtubtim.

581
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:25,172
She disguised Barai as the goddess
and sold black magic to you.

582
00:35:25,572 --> 00:35:26,619
What?

583
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:29,716
I’m the real goddess.

584
00:35:31,383 --> 00:35:34,427
How could you be the real goddess?

585
00:35:35,419 --> 00:35:36,794
When…

586
00:35:38,878 --> 00:35:42,402
I found the real goddess.

587
00:35:55,246 --> 00:35:59,526
The real goddess is here.

588
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,691
Applause.

589
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:24,750
She was as pretty as a flower.

590
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:29,911
She was as delicate as a stream.

591
00:36:32,028 --> 00:36:36,908
This is how the goddess was described.

592
00:36:42,486 --> 00:36:44,333
We are very lucky

593
00:36:45,333 --> 00:36:52,830
the real goddess chose to possess our friend.

594
00:36:53,397 --> 00:36:55,923
Who would believe you?

595
00:36:55,923 --> 00:36:57,379
You are pulling this stunt.

596
00:36:57,379 --> 00:36:58,357
Shh!

597
00:37:01,224 --> 00:37:02,233
It’s okay.

598
00:37:03,516 --> 00:37:08,238
Even a broken clock is right twice a day.

599
00:37:09,438 --> 00:37:13,867
Although you are tricked
into worshiping Barai, my servant,

600
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:15,625
it doesn’t matter.

601
00:37:26,098 --> 00:37:30,027
In the end, no one believes you, Idiot.

602
00:37:30,577 --> 00:37:31,077
Bitch.

603
00:37:31,077 --> 00:37:31,577
Stop.

604
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:35,158
Stop calling me names.

605
00:37:35,925 --> 00:37:36,482
Bitch.

606
00:37:38,049 --> 00:37:41,788
This time, I will teach you a lesson, servant.

607
00:37:43,522 --> 00:37:47,332
I prepared a sacred weapon to hit you.

608
00:37:50,509 --> 00:37:53,148
I’ll hit you until I can destroy your evil spirit.

609
00:37:53,398 --> 00:37:54,599
Get ready to die.

610
00:37:56,533 --> 00:37:57,222
No.

611
00:37:58,305 --> 00:37:59,497
You will actually hit me.

612
00:37:59,497 --> 00:38:00,488
You dodge it?

613
00:38:00,488 --> 00:38:01,145
I’ll hit you.

614
00:38:03,019 --> 00:38:03,933
Bitch.

615
00:38:05,417 --> 00:38:06,927
Where is she?

616
00:38:07,019 --> 00:38:07,713
Follow her.

617
00:38:08,296 --> 00:38:08,926
Go.

618
00:38:10,326 --> 00:38:11,228
Stop right there, bitch.

619
00:38:11,511 --> 00:38:14,870
Everyone, stay calm.

620
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:17,024
The goddess is real.

621
00:38:17,024 --> 00:38:17,645
Old lady.

622
00:38:18,278 --> 00:38:19,223
Is the goddess real?

623
00:38:19,306 --> 00:38:20,243
Of course.

624
00:38:20,426 --> 00:38:21,204
When was she born?

625
00:38:22,938 --> 00:38:24,905
Why do you want to know?

626
00:38:24,905 --> 00:38:25,866
I’m curious.

627
00:38:25,866 --> 00:38:27,618
Her shrine has been around
for more than ten years.

628
00:38:27,618 --> 00:38:28,997
Why are you suddenly interested in her?

629
00:38:28,997 --> 00:38:29,638
Ten years?

630
00:38:29,638 --> 00:38:30,454
I have never seen it before.

631
00:38:30,454 --> 00:38:31,201
Don’t lie to me.

632
00:38:31,201 --> 00:38:33,461
- I don’t believe you.
- Why weren’t you curious about it before?

633
00:38:33,461 --> 00:38:35,677
Barai, give my friend’s body back.

634
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:37,138
No matter what you do,

635
00:38:37,471 --> 00:38:38,832
it’s a waste of time.

636
00:38:38,832 --> 00:38:41,712
But right now, I need to hit you first, Barai.

637
00:38:56,099 --> 00:38:58,213
Kat.

638
00:38:58,633 --> 00:38:59,371
Barai.

639
00:39:00,083 --> 00:39:01,196
Shit, it’s a dead end.

640
00:39:01,488 --> 00:39:02,690
Yes, it’s a dead end.

641
00:39:08,862 --> 00:39:11,024
Barai, give my friend’s body back.

642
00:39:11,353 --> 00:39:11,920
Yes.

643
00:39:12,212 --> 00:39:13,453
You should give up.

644
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:15,872
Your punishment will lessen.

645
00:39:16,037 --> 00:39:16,630
Right.

646
00:39:16,776 --> 00:39:18,202
How are you going to stop me?

647
00:39:18,494 --> 00:39:19,657
It’s too late.

648
00:39:19,931 --> 00:39:23,613
I will use the magical stick to hit your head,
just like 100 years ago.

649
00:39:24,727 --> 00:39:25,744
Stop.

650
00:39:26,858 --> 00:39:28,287
No matter what you do,

651
00:39:28,579 --> 00:39:29,961
it’s a waste of time.

652
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:34,042
Because I successfully took over
your friend’s body.

653
00:39:37,872 --> 00:39:38,828
Stop.

654
00:39:39,558 --> 00:39:41,116
If you don’t stop,

655
00:39:41,499 --> 00:39:43,901
you will go back to being my servants.

656
00:39:43,901 --> 00:39:46,569
The goddess will curse you again.

657
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:48,217
Really?

658
00:39:50,207 --> 00:39:51,103
That’s enough.

659
00:39:51,724 --> 00:39:53,692
Have you ever cared about Kat’s feelings?

660
00:39:54,349 --> 00:39:55,028
Huh?

661
00:39:58,259 --> 00:39:58,849
Huh?

662
00:40:02,208 --> 00:40:06,129
Do you know
what she goes through every day?

663
00:40:07,334 --> 00:40:12,551
Because of how you treat her,
she even feels glad that I possess her body.

664
00:40:14,139 --> 00:40:15,823
You are assholes.

665
00:40:18,214 --> 00:40:20,443
Yes, we know that.

666
00:40:26,102 --> 00:40:28,598
Kat is always important to us.

667
00:40:30,204 --> 00:40:30,863
That’s why…

668
00:40:32,104 --> 00:40:34,053
we are trying to get her back.

669
00:40:35,386 --> 00:40:37,171
So we can treat her better.

670
00:40:53,637 --> 00:40:54,280
Let’s do it.

671
00:40:55,302 --> 00:40:56,312
But right now,

672
00:40:56,823 --> 00:40:58,556
I need to hit you first, Barai.

673
00:40:59,615 --> 00:41:00,308
Stop.

674
00:41:01,385 --> 00:41:03,091
I’m not possessed, bitch.

675
00:41:04,472 --> 00:41:05,250
What?

676
00:41:06,108 --> 00:41:08,213
Don’t try to fool me, Barai.

677
00:41:08,797 --> 00:41:10,432
I won’t fall for your lie again.

678
00:41:10,432 --> 00:41:12,091
Nevia, hit her.

679
00:41:12,091 --> 00:41:13,018
Wait.

680
00:41:14,789 --> 00:41:16,193
I am not possessed.

681
00:41:16,193 --> 00:41:16,940
Let me go.

682
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,208
No, I don’t believe you.

683
00:41:19,555 --> 00:41:21,623
Then why have you been acting strange
in the past month?

684
00:41:21,787 --> 00:41:24,886
I was pretending to be the goddess.

685
00:41:26,832 --> 00:41:27,999
Why did you talk to yourself?

686
00:41:28,711 --> 00:41:29,814
It was acting.

687
00:41:30,051 --> 00:41:32,677
Fews, why are you surprised?
You helped me rehearse lines before.

688
00:41:33,535 --> 00:41:34,162
That’s true.

689
00:41:34,965 --> 00:41:37,417
But you cursed us.

690
00:41:37,746 --> 00:41:39,082
And we encountered many misfortunes.

691
00:41:40,567 --> 00:41:42,275
That was just your bad luck.

692
00:41:42,275 --> 00:41:43,457
My words didn’t have any curse power.

693
00:41:44,205 --> 00:41:47,281
So you aren’t possessed by Barai
like Lookjeab said?

694
00:41:49,472 --> 00:41:51,665
You are so stupid.
Lookjeab has fooled you.

695
00:41:52,432 --> 00:41:53,793
Look closely.

696
00:41:53,793 --> 00:41:55,940
The pictures she showed you
are generated by AI.

697
00:41:58,057 --> 00:41:59,421
It has seven fingers.

698
00:41:59,969 --> 00:42:00,827
Do you believe me now?

699
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:06,926
If you are not Barai,
then you are the goddess?

700
00:42:10,139 --> 00:42:11,741
You are so thick-headed.

701
00:42:12,106 --> 00:42:13,734
You are such a dumbass.

702
00:42:14,172 --> 00:42:15,945
I have never been possessed.

703
00:42:16,529 --> 00:42:17,290
I mean it.

704
00:42:18,221 --> 00:42:20,141
Why the hell did you do that?!

705
00:42:20,688 --> 00:42:21,629
Calm down.

706
00:42:22,743 --> 00:42:24,165
I just wanted to have some fun.

707
00:42:24,165 --> 00:42:27,445
Have you thought about the consequences?

708
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:28,696
I have.

709
00:42:30,083 --> 00:42:32,610
But I never thought
you would hit me with the stick.

710
00:42:32,993 --> 00:42:33,767
What next?

711
00:42:34,223 --> 00:42:35,316
What do you want me to say?

712
00:42:36,028 --> 00:42:36,920
Say it.

713
00:42:37,952 --> 00:42:40,407
You made our lives chaotic
for the past month.

714
00:42:44,113 --> 00:42:45,910
Apologize to us, idiot.

715
00:42:46,713 --> 00:42:48,074
Apologize, your ass.

716
00:42:49,626 --> 00:42:51,483
You are the one
who needs to apologize to me.

717
00:42:51,483 --> 00:42:53,927
If you didn’t scold me about vomiting,

718
00:42:54,548 --> 00:42:55,638
I wouldn’t have done this.

719
00:42:57,317 --> 00:42:58,014
You are…

720
00:42:58,014 --> 00:42:59,422
Hold on, Nevia.

721
00:43:00,262 --> 00:43:01,266
That’s enough.

722
00:43:01,266 --> 00:43:01,953
Calm down.

723
00:43:02,866 --> 00:43:03,979
Let’s forget it.

724
00:43:04,344 --> 00:43:06,697
You should feel bad for her, brat.

725
00:43:06,953 --> 00:43:08,669
You can tell from her face
that she has complexes.

726
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:10,419
This is the only way she can express herself.

727
00:43:10,875 --> 00:43:12,641
I didn’t have any complexes.

728
00:43:12,641 --> 00:43:13,639
I just wanted to have fun.

729
00:43:13,968 --> 00:43:15,407
You are the only one who has fun, bitch.

730
00:43:16,959 --> 00:43:18,159
It’s okay, Kat.

731
00:43:18,159 --> 00:43:19,487
We are not mad at you.

732
00:43:19,779 --> 00:43:21,469
We know your brain is undeveloped.

733
00:43:21,816 --> 00:43:25,255
You cannot restrain yourself
from doing bad things.

734
00:43:25,255 --> 00:43:26,909
You are like Neanderthal.

735
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:33,656
With your brain and looks,
I guess this is all you can do.

736
00:43:34,131 --> 00:43:34,769
Fine.

737
00:43:35,572 --> 00:43:36,748
I’m sorry.

738
00:43:37,277 --> 00:43:39,189
I thought the goddess was pretty.

739
00:43:39,472 --> 00:43:41,984
The first time I saw her picture,

740
00:43:43,098 --> 00:43:47,196
I knew I wanted to be her for once.

741
00:43:47,470 --> 00:43:50,042
After that, I just went with the flow.

742
00:43:50,553 --> 00:43:51,439
You went too far.

743
00:43:53,374 --> 00:43:56,285
But I was happy to live that life for once.

744
00:43:57,453 --> 00:43:58,949
You guys are so stupid.

745
00:43:59,472 --> 00:44:01,236
I have fooled you for over a month.

746
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,051
More importantly,

747
00:44:03,653 --> 00:44:05,143
you were fooled by Lookjeab.

748
00:44:05,435 --> 00:44:06,961
You are such an idiot.

749
00:44:08,586 --> 00:44:09,945
We are idiots?

750
00:44:09,945 --> 00:44:10,995
What?

751
00:44:10,995 --> 00:44:13,020
Then we will teach you a lesson today.

752
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:13,656
Wait.

753
00:44:14,550 --> 00:44:16,072
You think you can hit me?

754
00:44:17,514 --> 00:44:19,271
You are underestimating her.

755
00:44:19,399 --> 00:44:20,565
Bring it on, Nevia.

756
00:44:22,846 --> 00:44:23,874
Brace yourself for it.

757
00:44:23,983 --> 00:44:26,113
One, two, three.

758
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:28,224
See?

759
00:44:35,529 --> 00:44:36,869
Damn.

760
00:44:41,016 --> 00:44:44,045
(This is how we live.)

761
00:44:44,155 --> 00:44:46,604
(This is how stupid we were.)

762
00:44:46,712 --> 00:44:51,160
(The true identity of the goddess
remains a mystery.)

763
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:53,072
Goddess Dalop is with me only.

764
00:44:53,223 --> 00:44:55,108
My shrine has been around
for over ten years.

765
00:44:55,108 --> 00:44:56,861
Hundreds of people came here
to pay respect to her.

766
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:58,121
How dare you argue with me?

767
00:44:58,194 --> 00:44:59,704
I have dozens of proofs.

768
00:44:59,814 --> 00:45:00,836
What proof?

769
00:45:00,927 --> 00:45:04,226
Your pictures were exposed
to be generated by AI, bitch.

770
00:45:04,628 --> 00:45:07,725
(I don’t know why
we fell for her acting back then.)

771
00:45:07,798 --> 00:45:10,050
(I guess her acting was really good.)

772
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:15,728
(Right now,
her short drama is a big hit on social media.)

773
00:45:15,728 --> 00:45:17,322
Aren’t you being too harsh on me?

774
00:45:17,778 --> 00:45:19,702
KTR DRAMA EP.35 (3/5)

775
00:45:20,503 --> 00:45:24,631
(Fews becomes a bit more confident.)

776
00:45:24,704 --> 00:45:29,360
(After her cat fight with Ingky went viral,)

777
00:45:29,592 --> 00:45:32,591
(many juniors in our school are afraid of her.)

778
00:45:32,591 --> 00:45:35,160
(She’s now holding a talk show.)

779
00:45:35,343 --> 00:45:40,069
(For Ingky, after joining the pageant,
she fell in love with it.)

780
00:45:40,069 --> 00:45:42,388
(So she has been participating
in every pageant.)

781
00:45:42,388 --> 00:45:44,868
(After she lied that she was the goddess,

782
00:45:44,868 --> 00:45:47,682
many people still believe it.)
GODDESS, I’M ROOTING FOR YOU.

783
00:45:48,232 --> 00:45:51,333
(But she still can’t get over her mistake.)

784
00:45:51,333 --> 00:45:53,987
(Her story became the epitome of stupidity
among the queers in our school.)

785
00:45:54,206 --> 00:45:56,660
(She let P’Pat, who is like a jackpot,
slip away.)

786
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:59,912
(He is now going higher and higher.)

787
00:45:59,912 --> 00:46:01,882
(Now, he’s out of Ingky’s reach.)

788
00:46:01,882 --> 00:46:03,973
For me, Nevia,

789
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:07,628
I will make great videos for you to watch.

790
00:46:07,811 --> 00:46:10,178
If we find anything fun,

791
00:46:10,178 --> 00:46:15,022
I will definitely update you.

792
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:16,718
Don’t forget to subscribe to my channel.

793
00:46:16,718 --> 00:46:17,824
This is it for today.

794
00:46:18,353 --> 00:46:20,772
Bye.

795
00:46:34,582 --> 00:46:35,265
Girls.

796
00:46:38,343 --> 00:46:39,732
I found a new goddess.

797
00:46:45,793 --> 00:46:47,188
Forget it.

798
00:46:57,948 --> 00:47:00,046
When will you fulfill your promise to me?

799
00:47:00,119 --> 00:47:02,688
You need to perform a dance for me right now.

800
00:47:02,688 --> 00:47:05,101
Argh!

801
00:47:05,101 --> 00:47:06,980
I’m Klairung,

802
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:09,501
the most famous boxing influencer in the country.

803
00:47:10,888 --> 00:47:13,703
But I have a problem.

804
00:47:14,123 --> 00:47:16,920
Surprise, mother, father.

805
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:20,117
The more I dig into this handsome boxer,
the more suspicious he seems.

806
00:47:20,117 --> 00:47:22,143
You are fake.

807
00:47:22,272 --> 00:47:24,544
Why don’t you pray to a higher power for help?

808
00:47:26,992 --> 00:47:28,284
You went to ask for help from the spirit, didn’t you?

809
00:47:28,284 --> 00:47:30,563
I’m her biological granddaughter.

810
00:47:30,563 --> 00:47:31,712
You are surely a con artist.

811
00:47:31,712 --> 00:47:32,949
You will be sorry.

812
00:47:34,952 --> 00:47:36,207
Damn.

813
00:47:36,590 --> 00:47:37,800
Did you change your mind?

814
00:47:37,832 --> 00:47:40,455
I will do everything to perform a dance for her.

815
00:47:44,472 --> 00:47:47,353
Hard work never betrays you.

816
00:47:47,682 --> 00:47:51,096
If it betrays me, I will kick its ass.
