Viewer discretion is advised.

4
00:00:47,748 --> 00:00:50,758
We hit 1000,000 subscribers.

5
00:00:54,661 --> 00:00:56,217
Damn it.

6
00:00:56,616 --> 00:00:57,382
We shot it 10 times.

7
00:00:57,382 --> 00:00:58,307
You ruined it every single time.

8
00:00:58,706 --> 00:00:59,677
It’s your fault, Kat.

9
00:01:00,285 --> 00:01:01,303
Did you just blame me?

10
00:01:02,268 --> 00:01:03,260
No.

11
00:01:03,428 --> 00:01:06,526
I blamed the fan, the curtain, and the lamp.

12
00:01:06,967 --> 00:01:08,091
Of course, I blamed you, idiot.

13
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:10,811
You kept blocking my face.

14
00:01:10,811 --> 00:01:12,073
Calm down.

15
00:01:12,556 --> 00:01:14,259
Don’t be so harsh on her.

16
00:01:14,427 --> 00:01:16,197
No one wanted to ruin their own video.

17
00:01:16,595 --> 00:01:18,371
Only idiots would do that.

18
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:23,216
Just reshoot it.

19
00:01:23,845 --> 00:01:25,626
Come to think about it.

20
00:01:25,857 --> 00:01:28,214
I think we need to emphasize in the video

21
00:01:28,445 --> 00:01:31,176
that we are smart.

22
00:01:32,603 --> 00:01:34,436
We don’t have time to reshoot it.

23
00:01:34,436 --> 00:01:38,144
I’m going to release this video
as soon as we hit 100,000 subscribers.

24
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,754
Will we get to that point?

25
00:01:41,027 --> 00:01:42,435
Of course, we will.

26
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:43,216
Look.

27
00:01:43,894 --> 00:01:44,580
See?

28
00:01:44,853 --> 00:01:46,022
We only need around 6,000 new subscribers.

29
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,903
But the number has been stuck
for over a month.

30
00:01:51,022 --> 00:01:51,905
Girls.

31
00:01:54,213 --> 00:01:55,846
Why don’t we ask a higher power to help us?

32
00:01:57,076 --> 00:01:57,724
Higher power?

33
00:01:58,731 --> 00:02:00,874
To increase our subscribers,

34
00:02:02,825 --> 00:02:04,630
why don’t we pray to gods for help?

35
00:02:12,704 --> 00:02:13,565
Airhead.

36
00:02:14,614 --> 00:02:16,000
Stop talking nonsense.

37
00:02:16,189 --> 00:02:16,927
So superstitious.

38
00:02:16,927 --> 00:02:17,536
Hey.

39
00:02:22,089 --> 00:02:24,347
What the hell are you doing here?
Why didn’t you go down to take photos?

40
00:02:25,249 --> 00:02:25,938
Photos?

41
00:02:26,693 --> 00:02:27,436
What photos?

42
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:29,402
Our class photos.

43
00:02:29,591 --> 00:02:30,734
Everyone is waiting for you.

44
00:02:31,405 --> 00:02:32,093
Shit.

45
00:02:32,366 --> 00:02:33,591
We are doing it today?

46
00:02:34,325 --> 00:02:35,209
We need to touch up our makeup first.

47
00:02:35,209 --> 00:02:35,709
Wait a sec.

48
00:02:36,213 --> 00:02:36,840
We need to touch up our makeup first.

49
00:02:36,987 --> 00:02:38,781
Nevia, my lipstick is fading.

50
00:02:38,865 --> 00:02:39,627
Hurry up.

51
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:45,864
It’s not the time for a makeup touch-up.

52
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:47,935
Butt out!

53
00:02:51,403 --> 00:02:53,626
Nevia, my lipstick is smudged.

54
00:02:55,116 --> 00:02:55,838
Can you help me with this?

55
00:03:27,905 --> 00:03:28,554
This way.

56
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,979
They are all here.

57
00:03:32,217 --> 00:03:33,084
Ready?

58
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,260
One.

59
00:03:34,512 --> 00:03:35,205
Two.

60
00:03:35,478 --> 00:03:36,194
Three.

61
00:04:33,415 --> 00:04:35,760
(They said God created the world.)

62
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,161
(But it’s us, queers, who run the world.)

63
00:04:38,413 --> 00:04:42,152
(We have power, houses, cars, and crowns.)

64
00:04:42,152 --> 00:04:43,733
(We have been around throughout history.)

65
00:04:43,733 --> 00:04:46,120
(Now, it’s our time.)

66
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,961
Hello.

67
00:04:49,066 --> 00:04:49,953
I’m Nevia.

68
00:04:50,289 --> 00:04:51,284
I’m Fews.

69
00:04:51,326 --> 00:04:53,538
I’m Ingky.

70
00:04:53,706 --> 00:04:56,057
I’m Katrina.

71
00:04:58,617 --> 00:04:59,642
We are…

72
00:04:59,768 --> 00:05:03,322
Air Dolls.

73
00:05:05,064 --> 00:05:06,695
(We have four members.)

74
00:05:06,695 --> 00:05:07,664
Hello.

75
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:10,232
I’m Darunee Laohongyokfah.

76
00:05:10,379 --> 00:05:12,303
(This is Ingky.)

77
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:16,799
(Her dream is to become
the next Miss International Queen.)

78
00:05:16,799 --> 00:05:20,652
The winner of this year is…

79
00:05:22,058 --> 00:05:25,195
Ingky from Grade 12 Class 2.

80
00:05:25,195 --> 00:05:27,368
Please give her a round of applause.

81
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:29,379
(She’s a bit annoying sometimes.)

82
00:05:29,484 --> 00:05:32,827
(But I have to admit that she’s pretty.)

83
00:05:32,827 --> 00:05:33,632
What a brat!

84
00:05:37,386 --> 00:05:43,060
If we are not active as an environmentalist,

85
00:05:43,396 --> 00:05:46,202
We are responsible for…

86
00:05:46,202 --> 00:05:47,386
(This is Fews.)

87
00:05:47,386 --> 00:05:50,314
(She is the academic and
walking encyclopedia in our group.)

88
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,532
(She knows everything.
She’s an expert on everything.)

89
00:05:52,532 --> 00:05:53,685
(She is a know-it-all.)

90
00:05:53,685 --> 00:05:57,541
(Her life’s goal is to get a hot boyfriend.)

91
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:03,020
(Do you think all the knowledge she has
is helpful for her goal?)

92
00:06:03,377 --> 00:06:04,909
(That’s…)

93
00:06:08,245 --> 00:06:12,144
(The next member is Kat, Katrina.)

94
00:06:13,088 --> 00:06:16,506
(She said her parents gave her the name
when she was born.)

95
00:06:16,632 --> 00:06:19,474
(But we all know that it’s a lie.)

96
00:06:19,936 --> 00:06:21,565
(From my speculation,)

97
00:06:22,111 --> 00:06:24,206
(She is a fan of Katriona Gray.)

98
00:06:25,192 --> 00:06:27,542
(But she was stupid and
forgot to write the letter O in her name.)

99
00:06:27,542 --> 00:06:30,450
(So her name ended up
with the spelling Katrina.)

100
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:32,726
(What kind of person is she?)

101
00:06:32,873 --> 00:06:35,068
(I’ll let you see for yourself.)

102
00:06:49,956 --> 00:06:53,833
(The last member is me, Nevia.)

103
00:06:56,561 --> 00:06:57,749
(I’m the face of this group.)

104
00:06:57,749 --> 00:06:59,829
(I’m both pretty and smart.)

105
00:06:59,829 --> 00:07:02,717
(I’m the one
who holds the Air Dolls members together.)

106
00:07:02,717 --> 00:07:07,193
(I’m also the group’s leader.)

107
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:08,118
Bitch.

108
00:07:08,118 --> 00:07:10,660
You’re such a liar.

109
00:07:11,352 --> 00:07:12,042
True.

110
00:07:12,042 --> 00:07:13,884
You only talk trash about us.

111
00:07:13,884 --> 00:07:17,112
But when it comes to yourself,
you compliment and speak well of yourself.

112
00:07:17,112 --> 00:07:19,375
I’m just telling the truth.

113
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,667
I just answered their question.

114
00:07:21,667 --> 00:07:22,402
Hey!

115
00:07:22,402 --> 00:07:23,482
What?!

116
00:07:23,671 --> 00:07:24,743
P’Pat is watching our live.

117
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:26,772
P’Pat?

118
00:07:26,772 --> 00:07:27,625
P’Pat?

119
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:29,879
P’Pat, you watch all our live streams.

120
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:31,211
Do you have a crush on us?

121
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:36,000
Someone wants to join our live.

122
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,920
Hurry up.

123
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,637
Five.

124
00:07:39,973 --> 00:07:40,581
Four.

125
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:41,591
Three.

126
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:43,881
P’Pat is here.

127
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,640
Hello, girls.

128
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,539
You are so cute, P’Pat.

129
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,276
I’m here to answer your question.

130
00:07:54,276 --> 00:07:55,524
Of course, I like you.

131
00:07:55,713 --> 00:07:56,733
I absolutely adore you.

132
00:07:58,684 --> 00:08:01,017
(This is P’Pat.)

133
00:08:01,017 --> 00:08:03,258
(He’s our adorable junior at school.)

134
00:08:03,908 --> 00:08:07,211
(Why do we call him P’Pat?)

135
00:08:07,211 --> 00:08:10,477
(Because we want to call him that
even though he’s younger.)

136
00:08:10,477 --> 00:08:11,693
(Stop asking about it.)

137
00:08:20,418 --> 00:08:26,115
(He’s like a lottery jackpot
that all of us dream of winning.)

138
00:08:26,954 --> 00:08:28,712
(It’s a once-in-a-lifetime dream.)

139
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,111
If P’Pat asks me for a favor,

140
00:08:37,804 --> 00:08:40,197
I’ll do everything he wants me to do.

141
00:08:40,617 --> 00:08:42,395
If he tells me to lick his foot,

142
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,019
I’ll do it.

143
00:08:48,677 --> 00:08:50,381
His feet are cleaner than your face.

144
00:08:51,829 --> 00:08:53,553
Since you talk about him,

145
00:08:53,826 --> 00:08:55,425
After P’Pat joined our live,

146
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:58,235
the number of our subscribers
has been increasing

147
00:08:58,739 --> 00:09:01,421
We will definitely hit 100,000 subscribers.

148
00:09:03,393 --> 00:09:05,793
We will get to release
our celebratory video soon.

149
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:13,200
But I think we should do something
more special than releasing the video.

150
00:09:18,781 --> 00:09:21,473
We should hold a party.

151
00:09:30,093 --> 00:09:32,942
Congratulations on hitting 100,000 subscribers.

152
00:09:33,697 --> 00:09:35,134
Good job.

153
00:09:55,735 --> 00:09:56,564
Deal.

154
00:09:59,334 --> 00:10:01,870
100,000 SUBSCRIBERS.

155
00:10:24,184 --> 00:10:25,677
Is there a crow in my house?

156
00:10:27,859 --> 00:10:29,402
It must be our guests.

157
00:10:29,402 --> 00:10:30,716
I’ll open the door.

158
00:10:30,716 --> 00:10:31,277
Good.

159
00:10:32,452 --> 00:10:33,251
Who is it?

160
00:10:36,398 --> 00:10:37,607
Here is the food you ordered.

161
00:10:37,607 --> 00:10:38,666
Did you order it?

162
00:10:40,156 --> 00:10:42,440
Why did no one come to our party?

163
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,165
Ing, did you post on the wrong date?

164
00:10:45,354 --> 00:10:46,273
What?

165
00:10:46,273 --> 00:10:48,140
Why are you blaming me?

166
00:10:48,728 --> 00:10:50,573
You are the one who made the poster.

167
00:10:50,825 --> 00:10:52,706
Did you put the wrong date in it?

168
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:54,550
Girls, is it because…

169
00:11:00,928 --> 00:11:02,141
Damn, I forgot what to say.

170
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:04,209
Crap!

171
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,117
Hello, P’Tob.

172
00:11:07,117 --> 00:11:09,480
You are coming to my party, right?

173
00:11:09,942 --> 00:11:11,037
Huh? No?

174
00:11:11,247 --> 00:11:13,135
Oh, you’re stuck in traffic.

175
00:11:13,135 --> 00:11:14,404
Okay.

176
00:11:15,936 --> 00:11:17,314
Hello, James.

177
00:11:17,482 --> 00:11:19,072
You will arrive soon, right?

178
00:11:19,072 --> 00:11:20,852
The party will start in a few minutes.

179
00:11:20,999 --> 00:11:23,144
(Who the hell is James?
This is not his phone.)

180
00:11:23,312 --> 00:11:25,067
(Did you tell others that my name is James?)

181
00:11:25,067 --> 00:11:26,478
(Nonsense. I never said that.)

182
00:11:27,548 --> 00:11:28,898
Sorry. I called the wrong number.

183
00:11:28,898 --> 00:11:30,338
(Wait. Don’t hang up. We need to talk.)

184
00:11:34,563 --> 00:11:35,616
(Hello, P’Ingky.)

185
00:11:35,616 --> 00:11:38,296
Anyeong. Ni Hao. Hello, P’Pat.

186
00:11:38,527 --> 00:11:41,069
You are coming to my party, right?

187
00:11:41,069 --> 00:11:42,276
I didn’t forget it.

188
00:11:42,276 --> 00:11:44,363
But my schedule in the province
took longer than I expected.

189
00:11:44,363 --> 00:11:45,548
I don’t think I can make it.

190
00:11:45,548 --> 00:11:46,654
I’m sorry.

191
00:11:46,654 --> 00:11:47,231
Huh?

192
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,795
Huh? You really can’t make it?

193
00:11:50,963 --> 00:11:51,924
(I’m sorry.)

194
00:11:52,931 --> 00:11:53,992
It’s okay.

195
00:11:54,412 --> 00:11:55,263
Girls.

196
00:11:55,934 --> 00:11:56,957
Who the hell is this brat?

197
00:11:56,957 --> 00:11:58,404
Hi.

198
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:01,410
Don’t forget about the party at my house
this Saturday.

199
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:04,327
You are all invited.

200
00:12:06,131 --> 00:12:07,802
She holds a party on the same day as ours.

201
00:12:08,599 --> 00:12:11,191
Why is P’Tob at her party?

202
00:12:11,527 --> 00:12:12,967
He told me that he was stuck in traffic.

203
00:12:12,967 --> 00:12:13,807
Asshole.

204
00:12:14,185 --> 00:12:15,052
Damn.

205
00:12:15,849 --> 00:12:17,072
Her content is so lame.

206
00:12:17,072 --> 00:12:17,840
She is so no one.

207
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,099
Shit, she’s famous.

208
00:12:21,568 --> 00:12:22,611
I found it.

209
00:12:22,611 --> 00:12:24,700
Her viral video.

210
00:12:27,091 --> 00:12:28,343
I’m sick of applying skincare.

211
00:12:28,343 --> 00:12:30,679
I spent a fortune on skincare.

212
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,460
I invested a lot in my skin.

213
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,447
I went to see a dermatologist
and all kinds of experts.

214
00:12:35,447 --> 00:12:37,519
I wear makeup and put on lipstick.

215
00:12:38,253 --> 00:12:39,497
But I still can’t find a boyfriend.

216
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,454
What?

217
00:12:40,706 --> 00:12:42,000
It got a million likes?

218
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,140
Yeah.

219
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,114
This lame video?

220
00:12:44,114 --> 00:12:44,690
Right.

221
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:49,185
This is what I wanted to tell you, but I forgot.

222
00:12:49,793 --> 00:12:50,380
What?

223
00:12:50,716 --> 00:12:54,381
This brat is holding a party
on the same day as ours.

224
00:12:56,867 --> 00:12:58,862
Thank you for telling me.

225
00:12:58,862 --> 00:12:59,485
It’s not a big deal.

226
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:01,647
Why didn’t you wait to tell me
in the next lifetime, idiot?

227
00:13:02,675 --> 00:13:03,970
Look.

228
00:13:04,809 --> 00:13:06,165
I go to her Facebook feed.

229
00:13:06,165 --> 00:13:07,443
Look at the dates.

230
00:13:08,114 --> 00:13:09,459
They are the same day.

231
00:13:09,753 --> 00:13:11,149
She definitely prayed to the goddess for help.

232
00:13:11,149 --> 00:13:12,265
You’re right.

233
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:13,376
Nonsense.

234
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:17,600
Don’t you see that all her videos went viral
after she prayed to the goddess for help?

235
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,034
The goddess must be powerful.

236
00:13:20,034 --> 00:13:21,307
That’s probably true.

237
00:13:22,104 --> 00:13:23,480
What kind of goddess is named Dalp?

238
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,008
Her name is Dalop, bitch.

239
00:13:25,532 --> 00:13:27,180
GODDESS DALOP.

240
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:29,587
What are we doing here?

241
00:13:31,328 --> 00:13:32,061
Girls.

242
00:13:32,628 --> 00:13:34,774
I can feel mysterious energy.

243
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,949
I got goosebumps.

244
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:38,606
Kat, you are having nature calls, aren’t you?

245
00:13:38,606 --> 00:13:39,609
Yes, I am.

246
00:13:40,847 --> 00:13:41,538
Come on, girls.

247
00:13:42,482 --> 00:13:43,543
Since we are here,

248
00:13:44,802 --> 00:13:45,510
let’s go in.

249
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,785
How do we know that she’s powerful?

250
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,472
You are the one
who needs to prove yourself to the goddess.

251
00:13:52,472 --> 00:13:54,236
We need to fight.

252
00:13:55,663 --> 00:13:57,978
Amen.

253
00:14:32,167 --> 00:14:34,197
How do we know that she’s powerful?

254
00:14:34,821 --> 00:14:36,904
If you don’t believe in her power,
why are you paying respect to her?

255
00:14:38,775 --> 00:14:39,862
Because I’m a Thai.

256
00:14:41,385 --> 00:14:44,493
Goddess, if you are as sacred as they say.

257
00:14:44,493 --> 00:14:50,370
Please pick a stick with the number
that is on my mind.

258
00:15:01,935 --> 00:15:04,087
She’s really sacred.

259
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:05,027
Brat!

260
00:15:05,229 --> 00:15:07,628
How would I know
what number was on your mind, Ingky?

261
00:15:07,995 --> 00:15:09,606
Pick a number and write it on a paper.

262
00:15:09,716 --> 00:15:10,478
Then do it again.

263
00:15:10,973 --> 00:15:11,984
So picky.

264
00:15:12,901 --> 00:15:13,585
Stop it.

265
00:15:14,172 --> 00:15:14,840
Alright.

266
00:15:15,427 --> 00:15:16,153
I’ll do it.

267
00:15:16,281 --> 00:15:17,903
Goddess, if you are real,

268
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:24,732
please help me lift this elephant
with my pinky finger.

269
00:15:33,647 --> 00:15:34,364
See?

270
00:15:35,409 --> 00:15:38,447
I can lift it.

271
00:15:40,428 --> 00:15:41,170
Bitch.

272
00:15:41,537 --> 00:15:43,429
Look at your muscles.

273
00:15:43,667 --> 00:15:45,449
You can even lift a real elephant with it.

274
00:15:45,633 --> 00:15:46,316
Goddess.

275
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:50,880
If you are real,

276
00:15:52,788 --> 00:15:54,391
please make my left foot stinky.

277
00:15:57,638 --> 00:15:59,090
How is it? Is it stinky?

278
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:00,307
Yes.

279
00:16:00,472 --> 00:16:01,833
Yes, it is, bitch.

280
00:16:03,832 --> 00:16:05,457
Isn’t your foot normally stinky?

281
00:16:05,861 --> 00:16:06,691
Let’s try again.

282
00:16:07,461 --> 00:16:08,461
If you are real,

283
00:16:09,213 --> 00:16:10,934
please get rid of the smell from my left foot.

284
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:15,567
Stop it, bitch.

285
00:16:16,154 --> 00:16:17,238
Put your face away from me.

286
00:16:17,733 --> 00:16:18,436
It’s my foot.

287
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:32,609
If you are here to challenge her,

288
00:16:33,636 --> 00:16:35,660
you will get nothing from her.

289
00:16:40,742 --> 00:16:42,239
I’m Medtubtim.

290
00:16:42,569 --> 00:16:44,176
You can call me…

291
00:16:45,423 --> 00:16:46,140
Med.

292
00:16:46,287 --> 00:16:47,811
How can I help you?

293
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:52,709
I want to know

294
00:16:52,966 --> 00:16:54,647
if the goddess is really powerful.

295
00:16:57,142 --> 00:17:03,056
The goddess doesn’t need
to prove herself to you.

296
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:06,096
You are the one

297
00:17:06,927 --> 00:17:08,921
who needs to prove yourself to the goddess.

298
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:10,673
Prove?

299
00:17:11,242 --> 00:17:12,384
Prove what?

300
00:17:13,136 --> 00:17:14,643
Your faith.

301
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:20,061
Nowadays, people try to rationalize everything.

302
00:17:21,253 --> 00:17:24,258
They only believe in things
that are scientifically proven.

303
00:17:25,689 --> 00:17:28,482
If you have doubts from the beginning,

304
00:17:29,546 --> 00:17:33,112
how would you know…

305
00:17:35,406 --> 00:17:37,012
if the goddess is powerful?

306
00:17:39,543 --> 00:17:40,946
Amen.

307
00:17:41,808 --> 00:17:42,510
Med.

308
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:44,847
What do we need to do?

309
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,247
That’s a good question.

310
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:50,841
A 5x7-inch photo costs 1,000 baht.

311
00:17:50,841 --> 00:17:54,405
If you want a larger one,
we have a 12x16-inch photo for 2,500 baht.

312
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,172
Why don’t you get a larger one?

313
00:18:12,301 --> 00:18:14,161
She must be very sacred.

314
00:18:15,152 --> 00:18:16,562
Otherwise, we wouldn’t have bought it.

315
00:18:16,819 --> 00:18:18,322
Maybe we are scammed.

316
00:18:18,946 --> 00:18:20,021
It’s still inconclusive.

317
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:23,768
Girls.

318
00:18:25,621 --> 00:18:26,778
I can really feel it.

319
00:18:27,548 --> 00:18:29,311
I can feel that the goddess is holding me.

320
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:38,008
I don’t think she’s holding you.

321
00:18:40,723 --> 00:18:42,520
Let’s do it all.

322
00:18:45,639 --> 00:18:47,577
HOW TO PAY RESPECT
TO GODDESS DALOP.

323
00:18:47,834 --> 00:18:51,072
These are guidelines
on how to pay respect to the goddess.

324
00:18:51,292 --> 00:18:52,120
First,

325
00:18:52,207 --> 00:18:54,980
You need to light incense sticks and candles,
and pay respect to her every day.

326
00:18:55,475 --> 00:18:57,692
The incense sticks must be rose-scented.

327
00:18:57,692 --> 00:18:58,974
You cannot use other scents.

328
00:18:59,249 --> 00:19:00,803
It’s available here.
ROSE INCENSE STICKS: 1,000 BAHT

329
00:19:01,885 --> 00:19:07,014
Secondly, you need to take pride
in being a trans woman.

330
00:19:07,087 --> 00:19:08,378
Do not turn into a gay.

331
00:19:08,598 --> 00:19:09,902
Otherwise, you will be cursed.

332
00:19:11,058 --> 00:19:16,571
Thirdly, you need to work your charm
every day.

333
00:19:16,938 --> 00:19:18,078
How?

334
00:19:18,683 --> 00:19:22,210
Girls, do we really need to get ten matches?

335
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:24,124
I’m stuck at nine matches for a while.

336
00:19:24,271 --> 00:19:25,301
What should I do?

337
00:19:25,301 --> 00:19:27,313
Am I going to be cursed?

338
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:28,260
Oh.

339
00:19:30,242 --> 00:19:31,202
I got ten matches.

340
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:36,684
Fourthly, this is very important.

341
00:19:36,978 --> 00:19:40,485
All of you must be a fighter.

342
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:45,139
What do you mean?

343
00:19:45,139 --> 00:19:48,556
Every day, you need to win
at least one battle.

344
00:19:48,905 --> 00:19:50,947
We need to fight.

345
00:19:52,965 --> 00:19:58,330
We need to fight to win.

346
00:19:59,138 --> 00:20:00,847
FIGHT CLUB.
If you want to join our club,

347
00:20:00,847 --> 00:20:02,066
the second rule is…

348
00:20:02,928 --> 00:20:05,827
that our club holds a competition every week.

349
00:20:06,212 --> 00:20:08,801
If you lose in the fight,
you will be a servant for the winner

350
00:20:08,911 --> 00:20:09,630
for seven days.

351
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:11,564
Excuse me. What is the first rule?

352
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:13,249
You need to wait.

353
00:20:13,616 --> 00:20:14,835
The first rule is very important.

354
00:20:14,835 --> 00:20:15,606
I’ll talk about it later.

355
00:20:18,102 --> 00:20:18,786
Alright.

356
00:20:19,611 --> 00:20:20,572
The first rule is that

357
00:20:21,398 --> 00:20:23,529
you can’t tell anyone about the fight club.

358
00:20:23,914 --> 00:20:24,539
Hey.

359
00:20:26,062 --> 00:20:26,935
Asshole Bank.

360
00:20:28,484 --> 00:20:29,636
What are you doing here?

361
00:20:30,019 --> 00:20:30,899
Who told you about this place?

362
00:20:31,303 --> 00:20:32,479
This is a secret club.

363
00:20:32,479 --> 00:20:33,526
Secret club, your ass!

364
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:35,459
You posted about it on Facebook.

365
00:20:41,954 --> 00:20:43,076
Will you fight with me?

366
00:20:45,623 --> 00:20:47,289
Come on, Bank.

367
00:20:51,105 --> 00:20:52,430
Let’s kick her ass.

368
00:20:53,422 --> 00:20:54,272
Show her what you got.

369
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,083
Go for it.

370
00:20:57,351 --> 00:20:58,910
Come on, Bank.

371
00:21:02,245 --> 00:21:03,955
Have you learned boxing?

372
00:21:14,652 --> 00:21:16,844
1 WEEK LATER.

373
00:21:19,687 --> 00:21:20,608
Get me some drinks.

374
00:21:21,727 --> 00:21:22,385
What?

375
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:30,576
Thank you, Bankie.

376
00:21:42,315 --> 00:21:43,878
Did you beat Bank in the boxing match?

377
00:21:44,538 --> 00:21:45,452
You defeated Bank?

378
00:21:45,452 --> 00:21:47,037
He’s such a noob.

379
00:21:51,574 --> 00:21:52,787
What are you doing?

380
00:21:53,337 --> 00:21:55,466
I was fighting with it at the back of the school.

381
00:21:59,826 --> 00:22:01,031
You’re almost bitten.

382
00:22:01,527 --> 00:22:02,372
This is not what she meant.

383
00:22:02,567 --> 00:22:04,813
No, keep it away from me.

384
00:22:07,546 --> 00:22:08,547
You, bastard.

385
00:22:13,831 --> 00:22:14,864
It’s probably dead.

386
00:22:16,478 --> 00:22:17,191
Girls.

387
00:22:17,485 --> 00:22:18,801
Let’s talk about this.

388
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:21,091
We have been following the guidelines
for over a week.

389
00:22:21,586 --> 00:22:23,528
We still don’t see any result.

390
00:22:23,528 --> 00:22:24,950
The number of our subscribers
hasn’t increased.

391
00:22:29,276 --> 00:22:29,966
Girls.

392
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,207
What?

393
00:22:31,464 --> 00:22:32,108
It’s increasing.

394
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:37,645
It’s increasing.

395
00:22:37,736 --> 00:22:38,282
Let me see.

396
00:22:39,603 --> 00:22:40,397
Girls.

397
00:22:40,397 --> 00:22:41,490
It’s really increasing.

398
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,255
It almost hit 100,000 subscribers.

399
00:22:44,255 --> 00:22:45,319
Girls.

400
00:22:45,319 --> 00:22:49,474
A YouTuber who has 200,000 subscribers
wants us to appear on her channel.

401
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:54,292
My inbox is flooded with DMs.

402
00:22:56,596 --> 00:22:58,560
Girls, P’Pat mentioned me.

403
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:03,152
Brace yourself for me, P’Pat.

404
00:23:04,407 --> 00:23:09,434
Why don’t we hold a party again?

405
00:23:09,434 --> 00:23:14,318
Okay. Let’s go.

406
00:23:18,427 --> 00:23:20,570
Thank you, Goddess,

407
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:22,303
for helping us get where we are today.

408
00:23:22,376 --> 00:23:25,458
Please help our party today go smoothly.

409
00:23:25,568 --> 00:23:27,066
If you can help us on this,

410
00:23:27,213 --> 00:23:31,310
I promise we will upgrade the offering to you.

411
00:23:32,557 --> 00:23:35,805
Amen.

412
00:23:46,353 --> 00:23:49,735
There’s another important thing
you need to bear in mind.

413
00:23:49,927 --> 00:23:54,978
When your wishes are granted,

414
00:23:55,822 --> 00:24:01,728
you need to remember
that the goddess is only an extra help.

415
00:24:02,187 --> 00:24:06,335
You will do well or not,
that’s up to your actions.

416
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:08,264
Don’t forget it.

417
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:10,397
Anyway.

418
00:24:11,589 --> 00:24:13,647
Did you follow the goddess’s guidelines today?

419
00:24:15,848 --> 00:24:16,622
Yes.

420
00:24:16,897 --> 00:24:17,976
That’s good.

421
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:25,598
How did the candles go out?

422
00:24:25,598 --> 00:24:26,725
It must be the goddess.

423
00:24:26,725 --> 00:24:27,771
It went out right after we lit them.

424
00:24:27,771 --> 00:24:28,727
The goddess did it.

425
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:31,416
Brat.

426
00:24:31,966 --> 00:24:32,758
Turn it off, bitch.

427
00:24:32,758 --> 00:24:33,494
Put it away.

428
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:38,420
P’Pat.

429
00:24:38,548 --> 00:24:40,381
I’ll show you around the party.

430
00:25:01,087 --> 00:25:05,251
Everyone, welcome to our party.

431
00:25:10,463 --> 00:25:12,570
Oh, the man over there.

432
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:14,215
Did you bring your own drink?

433
00:25:14,215 --> 00:25:16,051
Can you put it away?

434
00:25:16,051 --> 00:25:21,905
Because our party is fun without alcohol.

435
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:25,921
Don’t leave yet.

436
00:25:26,015 --> 00:25:32,583
We have prepared a special performance
to express our gratitude to you.

437
00:25:36,328 --> 00:25:40,907
And now, let’s enjoy the party.

438
00:25:46,954 --> 00:25:48,330
Do as we’ve planned.

439
00:25:48,678 --> 00:25:49,903
Don’t make any mistakes.

440
00:25:50,356 --> 00:25:52,302
Fews, you are in charge of the guest list.

441
00:25:52,528 --> 00:25:53,213
Sure.

442
00:25:53,213 --> 00:25:55,837
Ing, keep our guests entertained.

443
00:25:56,324 --> 00:25:58,691
Kat, you are in charge of the food.

444
00:25:58,969 --> 00:25:59,469
Sure.

445
00:25:59,469 --> 00:26:00,292
Okay. Let’s go.

446
00:26:00,727 --> 00:26:02,034
Shit.

447
00:26:02,417 --> 00:26:04,296
So I won’t be at the party like you.

448
00:26:05,655 --> 00:26:07,615
You can come out at 8 p.m.

449
00:26:07,615 --> 00:26:09,408
Your job is the most important.

450
00:26:09,637 --> 00:26:11,694
Enjoy the party.

451
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:32,760
What?

452
00:26:33,653 --> 00:26:35,231
What are you doing here?

453
00:26:35,406 --> 00:26:36,940
Why aren’t you greeting our guests?

454
00:26:37,218 --> 00:26:38,544
I just take a break.

455
00:26:39,175 --> 00:26:40,447
You look tired.

456
00:26:40,691 --> 00:26:43,407
Fews, why don’t you take a rest?

457
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,735
I’ll cover it for you.

458
00:26:45,735 --> 00:26:46,683
Go.

459
00:26:48,562 --> 00:26:49,838
P’Pat.

460
00:26:49,838 --> 00:26:50,338
Ingky.

461
00:26:51,869 --> 00:26:52,708
I miss you.

462
00:26:55,212 --> 00:26:55,910
Paul?

463
00:26:57,372 --> 00:26:58,896
Paul from the dating app?

464
00:26:59,296 --> 00:27:00,160
Yes.

465
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,092
Your friend helped me with my plan.

466
00:27:02,405 --> 00:27:04,598
I want to come here to surprise you.

467
00:27:07,539 --> 00:27:11,355
Paul, come with me. We need to talk.

468
00:27:12,034 --> 00:27:12,837
Wrong way.

469
00:27:26,668 --> 00:27:27,557
Hi, the party’s host.

470
00:27:28,135 --> 00:27:29,240
Congratulations.

471
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,318
You are now a big celebrity.

472
00:27:31,554 --> 00:27:32,848
Thank you, P’Pat.

473
00:27:34,084 --> 00:27:37,570
Where are the other members?

474
00:27:37,883 --> 00:27:39,981
I want to congratulate them, too.

475
00:27:41,147 --> 00:27:43,713
They are busy with their duties.

476
00:27:44,183 --> 00:27:49,126
Tonight, I’ll show you around the party.

477
00:27:49,317 --> 00:27:50,055
Sure.

478
00:27:50,212 --> 00:27:51,983
Hey, Fews.

479
00:27:52,979 --> 00:27:54,865
Hello, P’Pat.

480
00:27:55,178 --> 00:27:58,459
Fews, we have a small problem in the kitchen.

481
00:27:58,459 --> 00:28:00,161
Can you please go and check it?

482
00:28:00,561 --> 00:28:04,013
Work in the kitchen is not my expertise.

483
00:28:04,187 --> 00:28:06,519
Why don’t you check it yourself?

484
00:28:07,772 --> 00:28:10,935
Will you go? Or should I tell him
you took his photo with you to a bathroom?

485
00:28:15,177 --> 00:28:19,563
P’Pat, excuse me. This is quite important.

486
00:28:19,807 --> 00:28:22,225
This idiot won’t be able to handle it.

487
00:28:23,135 --> 00:28:25,113
Please take care of it, Fews.

488
00:28:32,175 --> 00:28:34,206
Your party looks great.

489
00:28:34,502 --> 00:28:36,271
You never let me down, Nevia.

490
00:28:36,967 --> 00:28:39,018
I didn’t do much.

491
00:28:39,245 --> 00:28:41,852
I just arranged everything for the party.

492
00:28:42,165 --> 00:28:43,277
Everything?

493
00:28:43,277 --> 00:28:45,123
Yeah. It’s not that hard.

494
00:28:47,254 --> 00:28:50,987
Bank, thank you for helping me
with the party.

495
00:28:50,987 --> 00:28:53,772
Can you take the ice
and give it to Kat in the kitchen?

496
00:28:54,068 --> 00:28:55,638
Thank you, Bankie.

497
00:28:55,829 --> 00:28:56,990
What the hell are you doing?

498
00:28:56,990 --> 00:28:57,789
You scare me.

499
00:28:58,851 --> 00:29:01,201
P’Pat, did you get any drink?

500
00:29:01,827 --> 00:29:02,573
Enjoy.

501
00:29:02,573 --> 00:29:03,483
Enjoy.

502
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:07,463
Darling.

503
00:29:07,463 --> 00:29:09,747
I’m carrying two bags of ice.

504
00:29:09,747 --> 00:29:10,801
I’m exhausted.

505
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:12,157
Don’t you have any reward for me?

506
00:29:12,644 --> 00:29:13,329
Darling?

507
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:14,535
Darling, your ass!

508
00:29:14,918 --> 00:29:15,741
Who is this?

509
00:29:15,741 --> 00:29:17,091
I’m her man.

510
00:29:17,091 --> 00:29:19,335
I’m her man, bro.

511
00:29:21,144 --> 00:29:22,145
No.

512
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:23,617
No.

513
00:29:24,015 --> 00:29:26,674
I never knew you have a boyfriend, Nevia.

514
00:29:26,674 --> 00:29:29,141
You never heard of me?

515
00:29:29,211 --> 00:29:31,402
We’ve been dating for seven years.

516
00:29:34,776 --> 00:29:37,455
Excuse me.

517
00:29:37,455 --> 00:29:38,236
Yes, sir.

518
00:29:38,915 --> 00:29:41,495
P’Pat, it’s not what you think.

519
00:29:41,495 --> 00:29:43,272
P’Pat.

520
00:29:44,575 --> 00:29:46,484
P’Pat.

521
00:29:48,694 --> 00:29:49,382
What?

522
00:29:49,869 --> 00:29:50,743
P’Pat.

523
00:29:53,701 --> 00:29:55,919
Why do you barely answer my chat lately?

524
00:29:58,721 --> 00:29:59,580
Paul.

525
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,921
My life is a bit hectic right now.

526
00:30:03,285 --> 00:30:06,265
My phone is not functioning well.

527
00:30:07,501 --> 00:30:10,208
Ingky, I bought a tangerine for you.

528
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:12,153
Tangerine?

529
00:30:12,953 --> 00:30:16,588
You are so sweet, Paul.

530
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:18,466
You remember that I like tangerines.

531
00:30:20,241 --> 00:30:22,299
I can feed you all night.

532
00:30:26,911 --> 00:30:28,865
I’m really sorry.

533
00:30:29,283 --> 00:30:30,930
But I need to go back
to help my friends with the party.

534
00:30:31,087 --> 00:30:31,792
Thank you.

535
00:30:36,664 --> 00:30:37,359
Ingky.

536
00:30:38,535 --> 00:30:39,498
Where have you been?

537
00:30:39,498 --> 00:30:41,115
I’ve been looking for you everywhere.

538
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,036
I couldn’t sleep for three days.

539
00:30:43,036 --> 00:30:44,886
Can you please tell me what I am to you?

540
00:30:44,886 --> 00:30:46,683
This is driving me crazy.

541
00:30:49,102 --> 00:30:50,729
When did you get here?

542
00:30:59,619 --> 00:31:00,653
I’m sorry.

543
00:31:01,001 --> 00:31:02,615
But I don’t have time to talk to you.

544
00:31:02,615 --> 00:31:04,193
My life is very hectic right now.

545
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:06,680
You want to know what you are to me?

546
00:31:07,098 --> 00:31:08,721
You will never understand it.

547
00:31:09,209 --> 00:31:11,089
You are like a tangerine.

548
00:31:11,176 --> 00:31:12,669
But I am a banana.

549
00:31:12,669 --> 00:31:13,376
Huh?

550
00:31:13,828 --> 00:31:15,122
I don’t like tangerines.

551
00:31:15,122 --> 00:31:15,880
Remember it.

552
00:31:16,332 --> 00:31:17,268
- I’m sorry.
- Ingky.

553
00:31:19,756 --> 00:31:20,753
You forgot your tangerines.

554
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:21,507
Paul.

555
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:23,649
Why are you still here?

556
00:31:25,824 --> 00:31:27,019
Didn’t you say you don’t like tangerines?

557
00:31:27,872 --> 00:31:28,526
What is this?

558
00:31:29,083 --> 00:31:30,904
Didn’t you say I’m the only one for you?

559
00:31:33,271 --> 00:31:35,018
You also told me I’m your only one.

560
00:31:35,349 --> 00:31:36,093
Then what is this?

561
00:31:36,755 --> 00:31:37,562
Who is this average Joe?

562
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:38,287
You are the average Joe.

563
00:31:38,287 --> 00:31:39,905
She and I are seeing each other.

564
00:31:39,905 --> 00:31:41,620
You are seeing her?

565
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:42,323
There’s no way she's going out with you.

566
00:31:47,857 --> 00:31:50,000
I didn’t mean to eavesdrop.

567
00:31:50,278 --> 00:31:52,052
I just came out to answer a call.

568
00:31:52,957 --> 00:31:55,955
P’Pat, it’s not what you think.

569
00:31:56,112 --> 00:31:57,895
I just ran into them.

570
00:31:57,895 --> 00:31:59,205
It’s okay, Ingky.

571
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:00,335
I get it.

572
00:32:01,693 --> 00:32:02,979
Thank you, P’Pat.

573
00:32:02,979 --> 00:32:04,332
Have fun with juggling between two men.

574
00:32:12,798 --> 00:32:14,721
What the hell is wrong with you?

575
00:32:15,521 --> 00:32:16,314
Why?

576
00:32:16,453 --> 00:32:17,506
Do you want to try me?

577
00:32:18,393 --> 00:32:18,936
Bring it on.

578
00:32:20,676 --> 00:32:21,801
Can you stop arguing?

579
00:32:22,427 --> 00:32:23,589
Get out of my house.

580
00:32:23,867 --> 00:32:24,828
Get out.

581
00:32:24,985 --> 00:32:25,961
Will you get out?

582
00:32:26,518 --> 00:32:27,225
This is my house.

583
00:32:27,225 --> 00:32:28,596
If you don’t leave, I will.

584
00:32:30,336 --> 00:32:31,517
What the heck?!

585
00:32:53,342 --> 00:32:54,081
Kat!

586
00:32:55,125 --> 00:32:56,495
Why are you drinking?

587
00:32:56,495 --> 00:32:58,069
You are a minor.

588
00:33:02,663 --> 00:33:04,454
Mr. KATRINA WANGRARENG.
BORN IN 2004.
Open your eyes and look.

589
00:33:05,481 --> 00:33:07,742
I was born in 2004.

590
00:33:07,933 --> 00:33:10,238
I held back a year in kindergarten.

591
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:12,187
I received a school suspension
when I was in 6th grade.

592
00:33:12,187 --> 00:33:13,736
I wanted to be a top student.

593
00:33:14,084 --> 00:33:15,974
So I repeated Grade 9.

594
00:33:16,914 --> 00:33:18,639
What the hell are you doing?

595
00:33:19,015 --> 00:33:20,314
Go back and do the dishes.

596
00:33:20,314 --> 00:33:21,321
Go do the dishes, Kat.

597
00:33:21,321 --> 00:33:23,455
Stop drinking.

598
00:33:31,867 --> 00:33:32,908
Kat!

599
00:34:01,647 --> 00:34:04,289
(My prince.)

600
00:34:20,217 --> 00:34:21,147
P’Pat.

601
00:34:21,147 --> 00:34:21,838
Let’s dance.

602
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:26,712
P’Pat just grabbed anyone near him
without looking.

603
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:50,496
Kat, why are you dancing alone?

604
00:34:51,149 --> 00:34:52,031
Don’t you feel lonely?

605
00:34:54,697 --> 00:34:55,951
Are you asking me that…

606
00:34:56,350 --> 00:34:57,644
because you have special feelings for me?

607
00:35:08,912 --> 00:35:09,747
P’Pat.

608
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:11,751
Let’s dance.

609
00:35:49,543 --> 00:35:52,610
Nevia, I told you
not to dim the light in the room.

610
00:35:53,245 --> 00:35:55,454
P’Pat just grabbed anyone near him
without looking.

611
00:36:37,761 --> 00:36:39,515
What happened to your face?

612
00:36:39,515 --> 00:36:41,529
Kat threw up on my face.

613
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:44,480
Your face is so stinky.

614
00:36:50,066 --> 00:36:50,857
Shit.

615
00:36:50,948 --> 00:36:51,697
What?

616
00:36:52,169 --> 00:36:52,966
Our performance.

617
00:36:54,181 --> 00:36:54,909
Come on.

618
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:56,866
Kat.

619
00:37:03,107 --> 00:37:03,746
Kat.

620
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:05,478
This is embarrassing.

621
00:37:06,222 --> 00:37:06,722
Come here

622
00:37:32,863 --> 00:37:33,921

Go.

637
00:38:14,517 --> 00:38:15,179

we successfully wrapped up our performance.)

646
00:39:26,022 --> 00:39:27,895
(Even if you don’t believe in the goddess,
don’t disrespect her.)

647
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:31,311
(I used to think that
my success was determined by my actions.)

648
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,844
(But actually,)

649
00:39:33,678 --> 00:39:35,505
(it’s up to the divine power.)

650
00:39:36,341 --> 00:39:38,761
(She is the one
who helps us get where we are today.)

651
00:39:43,585 --> 00:39:48,318
(Today, the one I am most thankful for is…)

652
00:39:48,318 --> 00:39:49,466
Goddess Dalop.

653
00:39:53,854 --> 00:39:54,593
Kat!

654
00:39:55,065 --> 00:39:56,796
When did you get the goddess’s photo?

655
00:39:57,068 --> 00:39:58,135
Get down, Kat.

656
00:39:58,371 --> 00:40:00,128
Kat, put the photo down.

657
00:40:00,128 --> 00:40:01,004
No.

658
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,290
I want to express my gratitude to her

659
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,234
with my own words.

660
00:40:08,558 --> 00:40:11,847
Goddess, thank you so much

661
00:40:13,008 --> 00:40:14,427
for helping me get where I am today.

662
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:17,121
I’m so happy.

663
00:40:20,549 --> 00:40:21,874
All of you.

664
00:40:22,908 --> 00:40:24,827
Keep this in mind.

665
00:40:25,335 --> 00:40:26,375
This is…

666
00:40:30,328 --> 00:40:30,975
Goddess…

667
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,593
Kat, no.

668
00:40:34,028 --> 00:40:35,084
Swallow it.

669
00:40:39,037 --> 00:40:40,177
This is…

670
00:40:42,135 --> 00:40:42,873
Goddess…

671
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:44,560
Da…

672
00:41:07,609 --> 00:41:08,730
Goddess.

673
00:41:09,474 --> 00:41:11,728
We are so sorry.

674
00:41:13,487 --> 00:41:15,171
I know that my friend is an idiot.

675
00:41:15,969 --> 00:41:18,550
But I never thought she was this stupid.

676
00:41:25,659 --> 00:41:28,636
Do you think the goddess will be mad at us?

677
00:41:30,105 --> 00:41:31,868
I’m not sure.

678
00:41:31,868 --> 00:41:34,822
But we didn’t do anything wrong.

679
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:35,794
Yeah.

680
00:41:36,374 --> 00:41:37,067
That’s right.

681
00:41:37,593 --> 00:41:38,666
She won’t be mad at us.

682
00:41:39,065 --> 00:41:41,543
If she is mad, she can take it out on Kat.

683
00:41:46,748 --> 00:41:47,514
Is she having a nightmare?

684
00:41:48,022 --> 00:41:48,771
What’s wrong with her?

685
00:41:49,206 --> 00:41:50,820
She looks like she’s having an epileptic seizure.

686
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:51,458
Kat.

687
00:41:57,991 --> 00:41:59,262
You finally woke up, bitch.

688
00:42:06,262 --> 00:42:07,429
What are you doing?

689
00:42:13,049 --> 00:42:14,196
I’m not your friend.

690
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:21,633
I’m…

691
00:42:21,959 --> 00:42:22,685
the…

692
00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:24,304
…goddess!

693
00:42:33,963 --> 00:42:34,656
Wait.

694
00:42:35,454 --> 00:42:36,773
What are you screaming for?

695
00:43:01,536 --> 00:43:02,578
She’s gone.

696
00:43:03,792 --> 00:43:04,292
Kat.

697
00:43:05,525 --> 00:43:06,703
Stop acting nonsense.

698
00:43:08,299 --> 00:43:10,632
The goddess has possessed your friend.

699
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:14,660
Your life will be full of misfortune.

700
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:18,324
If someone tells us we have bad luck,
we will only focus on it.

701
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:20,064
Shit.

702
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:23,532
Nevia, wait.

703
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,640
You need to find three magic items.

704
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,934
Then you can permanently take Kat’s body.
