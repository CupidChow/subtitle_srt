NARARAT JONGMUNKIT.

5
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:40,020
It all began with my belief,

6
00:00:40,328 --> 00:00:43,686
How high or low you stand 
comes from your own actions.

7
00:00:44,205 --> 00:00:47,772
Your actions determine your life.

8
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:49,077
Am I right?

9
00:00:49,231 --> 00:00:50,050
(Hello.)

10
00:00:50,838 --> 00:00:51,841
Where are you, Aim?

11
00:00:51,995 --> 00:00:53,661
I came to see Dylan.

12
00:00:53,661 --> 00:00:55,084
He makes an appearance at an event today.

13
00:00:55,238 --> 00:00:56,326
(So I came to support him.)

14
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:58,614
You have time for your fangirl activity?

15
00:00:59,268 --> 00:01:00,317
Did you forget something?

16
00:01:00,625 --> 00:01:02,211
(Huh? What did I forget?)

17
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,548
Right, today is Nine’s birthday.

18
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:12,036
Today is Nine’s birthday?

19
00:01:12,401 --> 00:01:13,287
(Yes.)

20
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:16,026
(He invited me to his party, but I forgot.)

21
00:01:16,026 --> 00:01:17,925
(When I finish from here, I’ll go to the party.)

22
00:01:17,925 --> 00:01:19,581
(You are at the party, right?)

23
00:01:22,945 --> 00:01:23,733
I’m at home.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,750
(You didn’t go to his party?)

25
00:01:25,923 --> 00:01:28,357
(He didn’t invite you, did he?)

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,170
Even if he invited me, I wouldn’t go anyway.

27
00:01:32,689 --> 00:01:34,502
Because I’m a responsible person.

28
00:01:35,117 --> 00:01:38,089
Tomorrow, we have to give a presentation 
in the morning class.

29
00:01:38,397 --> 00:01:40,165
That’s right.

30
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,126
You just remember it?

31
00:01:41,126 --> 00:01:44,331
Do I need to remind you 
that you haven’t sent your part to me?

32
00:01:44,331 --> 00:01:48,470
(Sorry, sorry. I’ll send it to you by 6 a.m.)

33
00:01:53,477 --> 00:01:54,402
Are you crazy?

34
00:01:55,671 --> 00:01:57,382
The presentation starts at 8 a.m.

35
00:01:58,228 --> 00:02:02,918
Aren’t you going to give me time 
to compile, proofread, and fix errors?

36
00:02:02,918 --> 00:02:04,262
I can’t believe 
you got accepted into the med school.

37
00:02:04,435 --> 00:02:05,458
Your words are too harsh.

38
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:06,984
Then you should be more considerate of me.

39
00:02:06,984 --> 00:02:09,445
(Fine. I’ll send it to you by midnight.)

40
00:02:09,733 --> 00:02:10,625
Don’t be late.

41
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:13,498
Do you know I already did your part?

42
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:16,310
If you don’t send it by midnight, I will…

43
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,027
(Bye.)

44
00:02:19,238 --> 00:02:20,390
I will remove your name from the credit.

45
00:03:13,115 --> 00:03:15,796
YOU HAVE NO NEW EMAILS.

46
00:03:28,355 --> 00:03:31,752
How high or low you stand 
comes from your own actions.

47
00:03:31,925 --> 00:03:33,175
That’s what I always tell myself.

48
00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:35,727
Now, it’s time 
I need to teach this lesson to others.

49
00:03:37,043 --> 00:03:39,249
MISS WATHINEE SINTHUPANYA.

50
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,896
Shit.

51
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:34,106
What the heck?!

52
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,316
Hello, Aim.

53
00:05:35,643 --> 00:05:36,632
Are you at school?

54
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,270
Okay.

55
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,980
My charger cable is broken.

56
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:43,858
So my phone was dead, 
and the alarm didn’t ring.

57
00:05:44,069 --> 00:05:44,926
Hold on.

58
00:05:44,926 --> 00:05:46,796
Don’t scold me now.

59
00:05:46,796 --> 00:05:49,920
It was an accident.

60
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,510
I didn’t know that my charger cable was broken.

61
00:05:51,664 --> 00:05:54,237
I’ll send the file to you.

62
00:05:54,237 --> 00:05:55,731
You print it out and submit it to the professor.

63
00:05:55,731 --> 00:05:57,863
We won’t be unlucky and selected to be 
the first group to give the presentation, right?

64
00:05:57,863 --> 00:05:58,723
I’ll hurry up to go to school.

65
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:01,139
What’s with the face?

66
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:02,919
I told you it was my bad luck.

67
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,470
I’ll be right there. I’ve got to go.

68
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:12,897
What the hell did she say?

69
00:06:13,243 --> 00:06:15,115
Why didn’t she turn on the microphone?

70
00:06:21,516 --> 00:06:24,075
[Where are you? 
It’s our turn to give a presentation.]

71
00:06:24,306 --> 00:06:25,196
[I’ll be there in a minute.]

72
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:28,278
[You forgot to put my name in the credit.]

73
00:06:28,278 --> 00:06:29,470
[I added it in.]

74
00:06:37,589 --> 00:06:38,617
(Wait up.)

75
00:06:52,733 --> 00:06:53,865
Hello, Nine.

76
00:06:55,326 --> 00:06:56,047
Hello.

77
00:06:56,335 --> 00:06:57,169
Do you want to have a bite?

78
00:06:58,092 --> 00:07:00,572
It’s okay. I’m not hungry yet.

79
00:07:10,588 --> 00:07:12,815
Happy Birthday, Nine.

80
00:07:13,546 --> 00:07:14,316
Thank you.

81
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,502
Why didn’t you come to my birthday party 
last night?

82
00:07:17,502 --> 00:07:18,307
You were busy?

83
00:07:18,999 --> 00:07:20,966
How could I go when you didn’t invite me?

84
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:26,095
I mean…

85
00:07:26,095 --> 00:07:27,502
I did invite you.

86
00:07:28,559 --> 00:07:29,582
Why did you say I didn’t invite you?

87
00:07:30,274 --> 00:07:31,397
When did you invite me?

88
00:07:31,781 --> 00:07:34,777
I told Aim to invite Noon to the party.

89
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:35,972
Aim didn’t tell you, Noon?

90
00:07:40,278 --> 00:07:41,474
I’m not Noon.

91
00:07:42,531 --> 00:07:43,420
My name is Na.

92
00:07:43,535 --> 00:07:44,048
Oh.

93
00:07:50,161 --> 00:07:51,395
This is my floor.

94
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,440
Hey, Thee.

95
00:07:58,651 --> 00:07:59,407
Come here.

96
00:08:00,118 --> 00:08:01,045
Where were you?

97
00:08:01,276 --> 00:08:03,206
I went to buy grilled pork. I’m so hungry.

98
00:08:34,703 --> 00:08:36,393
In the end, I was late for the class.

99
00:08:36,393 --> 00:08:38,548
The professor called me irresponsible.

100
00:08:38,548 --> 00:08:40,154
He also deducted my points.

101
00:08:40,154 --> 00:08:41,849
It’s not a big deal.

102
00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:43,909
It won’t affect your grades.

103
00:08:44,082 --> 00:08:45,389
Why are you stressed about it?

104
00:08:45,389 --> 00:08:46,548
I’m not stressed.

105
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:49,291
I just…

106
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:50,519
I just don’t get it.

107
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:52,096
Don’t get what?

108
00:08:52,634 --> 00:08:55,610
I don’t get 
why these misfortunes always happen to me.

109
00:08:57,494 --> 00:08:59,519
Aren’t you getting used to it?

110
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,956
You encounter misfortunes all the time.

111
00:09:03,148 --> 00:09:04,559
Yesterday, you were trapped in an elevator.

112
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:07,616
Last week, you were pickpocketed.

113
00:09:07,616 --> 00:09:08,176
See?

114
00:09:08,176 --> 00:09:11,126
Last month, you got caught in the door.

115
00:09:11,126 --> 00:09:12,375
That’s enough.

116
00:09:13,413 --> 00:09:15,610
I know I was born with bad luck.

117
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:18,411
Try this.

118
00:09:18,757 --> 00:09:19,604
Do you want to try it?

119
00:09:23,328 --> 00:09:24,032
Hey!

120
00:09:24,743 --> 00:09:27,819
Aren’t you going to comfort me 
or take my problem seriously?

121
00:09:30,472 --> 00:09:31,563
To tell you the truth.

122
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:33,934
When you tell us that 
something misfortune happens to you,

123
00:09:34,722 --> 00:09:36,480
that’s your normal.

124
00:09:36,864 --> 00:09:41,194
If one day you wake up 
and find that your life is wonderful,

125
00:09:41,578 --> 00:09:44,018
I’ll think that is strange.

126
00:09:46,281 --> 00:09:47,910
What is this yellowish meat?

127
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:52,234
Ouch.

128
00:09:54,945 --> 00:09:55,865
Damn it.

129
00:09:57,307 --> 00:09:58,715
You and I have been grilling meat 
for some time.

130
00:09:58,926 --> 00:10:00,092
We didn’t get any oil splash.

131
00:10:00,611 --> 00:10:01,161
You’re right.

132
00:10:08,413 --> 00:10:09,896
MY PHONE NUMBER’S LUCKY SCALE.

133
00:10:14,267 --> 00:10:15,330
GRADE F.

134
00:10:17,887 --> 00:10:19,472

YOUR NUMBER HAS A NEGATIVE IMPACT 
ON YOUR LIFE IN EVERY WAY.

135
00:10:20,394 --> 00:10:22,075
(I told you to change your phone number.)

136
00:10:23,132 --> 00:10:23,841
Then what?

137
00:10:24,187 --> 00:10:26,746
How can a new phone number help?

138
00:10:27,054 --> 00:10:27,554
Right.

139
00:10:27,554 --> 00:10:30,410
If you don’t believe it, don’t disrespect it.

140
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:34,626
Do you know how I got this boyfriend?

141
00:10:35,184 --> 00:10:36,439
Because you have an itch.

142
00:10:37,093 --> 00:10:38,166
It’s because I changed my phone number.

143
00:10:40,417 --> 00:10:41,992
WE RECOMMEND YOU 
CHANGE YOUR NUMBER IMMEDIATELY.

YES OR NO.

I changed my number,

151
00:11:41,052 --> 00:11:42,251
but my life doesn’t get any better.

152
00:11:42,251 --> 00:11:43,461
Did you change your number, Na?

153
00:11:43,461 --> 00:11:44,208
Shit.
