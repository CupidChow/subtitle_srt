1
00:00:07,539 --> 00:00:09,184
[I’ll see you.]

2
00:00:09,184 --> 00:00:11,484
My life is really better 
after I changed my number.

3
00:00:16,639 --> 00:00:17,798
Hello, Na.

4
00:00:20,972 --> 00:00:23,898
You remember my name?

5
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:25,785
Okay.

6
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:29,088
To tell you the truth, I know your name.

7
00:00:29,398 --> 00:00:30,402
I was just kidding you.

8
00:00:30,712 --> 00:00:31,322
Kidding me?

9
00:00:31,988 --> 00:00:32,732
Yes.

10
00:00:33,042 --> 00:00:35,266
You always look stressed.

11
00:00:35,514 --> 00:00:37,023
I don’t know how to approach you.

12
00:00:37,116 --> 00:00:38,781
So I was kidding you 
by saying your name wrong.

13
00:00:41,103 --> 00:00:42,744
I thought you would find it funny.

14
00:00:42,744 --> 00:00:45,368
So we could break the ice between us.

15
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:47,428
But…

16
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:50,184
when I saw the look on your face earlier,

17
00:00:51,035 --> 00:00:54,187
you didn’t understand my joke, did you?

18
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:54,739
Yes, I did.

19
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:58,161
Of course, I know it was a joke.

20
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:01,228
It’s not that hard.

21
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:02,618
Why wouldn’t I get it?

22
00:01:03,067 --> 00:01:04,266
I’m not stupid.

23
00:01:05,071 --> 00:01:05,591
Right?

24
00:01:06,504 --> 00:01:07,250
Right.

25
00:01:07,854 --> 00:01:11,112
But you kept playing the same joke.

26
00:01:11,468 --> 00:01:13,318
So I felt a bit annoyed.

27
00:01:17,375 --> 00:01:18,055
I’m kidding.

28
00:01:18,334 --> 00:01:19,359
It’s just a joke.

29
00:01:20,522 --> 00:01:22,407
I didn’t see it coming.

30
00:01:23,243 --> 00:01:25,307
Na, you are not mad at me, aren’t you?

31
00:01:26,484 --> 00:01:28,034
Not at all.

32
00:01:29,637 --> 00:01:30,485
We are cool, right?

33
00:01:30,485 --> 00:01:31,048
Yes.

34
00:02:13,052 --> 00:02:13,609
It’s okay.

35
00:02:14,368 --> 00:02:15,748
Anyone can be late.

36
00:02:21,733 --> 00:02:23,096
Half an hour!

37
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:25,195
What kind of man is he?

38
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:38,078
(The number cannot be reached…)

39
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:07,084
Excuse me.

40
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:09,014
Can I move to another table?

41
00:03:16,547 --> 00:03:17,829
Isn’t she Nine’s girlfriend?

42
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:19,741
Why is she here with another man?

43
00:03:25,701 --> 00:03:26,498
Why am I hiding?

44
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:27,366
She doesn’t even know me.

45
00:03:38,841 --> 00:03:41,347
[I’m sorry, I will be a bit late.]

46
00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:16,030
My friend booked a table at another bar.

47
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:17,095
Why don’t you come with me?

48
00:04:17,095 --> 00:04:20,689
Your tasteless flirting move is pathetic.

49
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,947
How dare you say that?

50
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:26,040
Let me go.

51
00:04:26,396 --> 00:04:27,207
Let me go.

52
00:04:27,687 --> 00:04:28,656
I said Let me go.

53
00:04:28,842 --> 00:04:29,658
This is not good.

54
00:04:30,866 --> 00:04:31,489
Hey.

55
00:04:32,046 --> 00:04:32,644
Let me go.

56
00:04:32,644 --> 00:04:33,144
Hey.

57
00:04:33,733 --> 00:04:34,341
Stop it.

58
00:04:34,697 --> 00:04:35,414
What are you doing?

59
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:36,835
It’s none of your business.

60
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:38,271
Who are you?

61
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,357
Who said it’s not my business?

62
00:04:39,357 --> 00:04:40,113
Who are you?

63
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:40,613
I…

64
00:04:41,294 --> 00:04:41,794
I…

65
00:04:42,893 --> 00:04:43,801
I am…

66
00:04:45,674 --> 00:04:46,174
I am…

67
00:04:48,001 --> 00:04:48,531
I’m

68
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,083
She’s my girlfriend.

69
00:04:51,238 --> 00:04:51,875
Do you have a problem with that?

70
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,140
Is it clear now?

71
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,220
Okay. Now, I believe it.

72
00:05:47,901 --> 00:05:49,707
The new number has totally changed my life.

73
00:06:10,949 --> 00:06:12,099
My name is Leemhai.

74
00:06:12,099 --> 00:06:12,925
What’s your name?

75
00:06:13,064 --> 00:06:13,902
I’m Na.

76
00:06:13,995 --> 00:06:15,361
Do you believe in fate?

77
00:06:15,361 --> 00:06:20,673
When you use this number, 
people will fall in love with you.

78
00:06:20,905 --> 00:06:23,089
A guy is hitting on me.

79
00:06:23,089 --> 00:06:23,927
Do you know him?

80
00:06:25,257 --> 00:06:27,714
The person who bought the number 
is this woman.

81
00:06:27,714 --> 00:06:30,345
She is the woman Nine is trying to ask out.

82
00:06:30,345 --> 00:06:31,075
Do you want me to give you a ride?

83
00:06:31,075 --> 00:06:33,408
Are you going to take the number back from her?

84
00:06:33,408 --> 00:06:34,390
Do you have a crush on Nine?
