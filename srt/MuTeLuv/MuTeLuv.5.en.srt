1
00:00:31,248 --> 00:00:33,000
Shall I start?

2
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,392
My name is Ploy.

3
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,840
People call me Ployjued.

4
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,208
The reason why I’m here is…

5
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:49,888
I accidentally got involved in a crime.

6
00:00:51,472 --> 00:00:55,432
It all began…

7
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:00,000
because I fell in love.

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,320
because I fell in love.

9
00:01:02,752 --> 00:01:03,872
Everyone.

10
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:06,456
Everyone.

11
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:09,472
Do you see it?

12
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,080
The current flood problem.

13
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:16,376
No government agencies step in to solve it.

14
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:20,632
But they dare to say
the problem is under control.

15
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:21,904
It’s under control.

16
00:01:21,936 --> 00:01:23,392
It’s under control.

17
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:24,472
How could they say it’s under control?

18
00:01:24,496 --> 00:01:26,470
If the flood level rises by an inch,
we will be living under water.

19
00:01:34,488 --> 00:01:35,872
He looks so hot.

20
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,664
Everyone.

21
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,568
Phu, please look at my camera.

22
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,472
You are so hot.

23
00:01:48,584 --> 00:01:50,580
(This is Phupar.)

24
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,296
(He was the leader of a famous boy band.)

25
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,000
(For an unknown reason,
he suddenly left the group.)

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,928
(For an unknown reason,
he suddenly left the group.)

27
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,184
(He now became an activist.)

28
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:06,480
(He’s the president of the newspaper club.)

29
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:11,440
(I’m one of those who have a crush on him.)

30
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:15,896
(So I decided to apply to this university
and join the club.)

31
00:02:15,928 --> 00:02:20,416
(If I applied to the club alone,
I was afraid that my cover would be blown.)

32
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,784
(So I coax my best friend, Fay,
into joining the club.)

33
00:02:26,008 --> 00:02:27,664
Hello, guys.

34
00:02:27,704 --> 00:02:31,184
Today, my best friend and I
will celebrate Songkran Festival.

35
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:34,072
Say thank you.

36
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:41,864
(Though I got myself into his circle.)

37
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:47,672
(In the last three years,
I can only watch him from afar.)

38
00:02:47,696 --> 00:02:49,670
(There’s no progress.)

39
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,312
If you ask me why.

40
00:02:57,864 --> 00:03:00,000
It’s probably because of our social status.

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,392
It’s probably because of our social status.

42
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:09,464
(Our society still judges people
based on their social standing.)

43
00:03:09,504 --> 00:03:12,992
(Phu is one of those high-profiles.)

44
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:17,880
(Even Fay seems to have
her own target audience)

45
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:20,816
(That’s why)

46
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,400
(I think…)

47
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:33,080
(admiring him from afar is enough for me.)

48
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:41,512
Ake, did you find it?

49
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:46,840
No. I’ll go ask Wanna.

50
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:53,856
Phu.

51
00:03:54,976 --> 00:03:56,980
Can we take a photo with you?

52
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,432
Sure.

53
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,184
You can come closer

54
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,600
Selfie.

55
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:08,928
One, two, three.

56
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,512
HOW TO GET ATTENTION FROM MY CRUSH?

57
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,960
You finally make a move.

58
00:04:20,992 --> 00:04:22,048
I’ve been waiting for this day for so long.

59
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:23,312
What are you doing?

60
00:04:23,336 --> 00:04:24,416
What are you afraid of?

61
00:04:24,456 --> 00:04:25,320
Open it.

62
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,928
No.

63
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,496
This is Phu’s last year in college.

64
00:04:29,544 --> 00:04:31,136
Do you want to miss your shot with him?

65
00:04:31,168 --> 00:04:35,136
I joined this nerdy club because of you.

66
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,000
Why don’t you use a blatant move like them?

67
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,656
No.

68
00:04:51,152 --> 00:04:52,712
That’s not my style.

69
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:58,448
Thank you for cheering me on
during the past three years.

70
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,560
Fine.

71
00:04:59,584 --> 00:05:00,000
I deserve the Best Friend of the Year award.

72
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,328
I deserve the Best Friend of the Year award.

73
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,920
Then what are you going to do?

74
00:05:03,952 --> 00:05:07,888
Why don’t you turn to a higher power for help?

75
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:10,304
Are you interested in this kind of stuff?

76
00:05:10,472 --> 00:05:12,496
To be honest, not really.

77
00:05:12,528 --> 00:05:14,728
But I’ve read about it.

78
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,880
I’ll show you.

79
00:05:21,176 --> 00:05:22,224
What is it?

80
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,512
Chantharusati necklace.

81
00:05:24,544 --> 00:05:25,848
It’s a hot item.

82
00:05:25,888 --> 00:05:27,312
Everyone in school is wearing it.

83
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:34,488
(I never believed in this stuff until…)

84
00:05:34,512 --> 00:05:36,816
Come in and take a look.

85
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,592
The 1st edition of the Chantharusati necklace
is available for pre-order.

86
00:05:40,624 --> 00:05:42,960
Hurry up.

87
00:05:42,984 --> 00:05:49,000
(This is how I got to know
the Chantharusati Family.)

88
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:53,416
(Have you ever wondered

89
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,312
about your fate in love?)
WHERE IS MY LOVE?

90
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:00,000
(Chantharusati family proudly presents
the 1st edition of the Chantharusati necklace.)

91
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,688
(Chantharusati family proudly presents
the 1st edition of the Chantharusati necklace.)

92
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:09,104
All you need to do is chant
“Amora lumen, cor ad cor, veni, anima mea.”

93
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,512
“Amora lumen, cor ad cor, veni, anima mea.”

94
00:06:11,544 --> 00:06:13,832
“Amora lumen, cor ad cor, veni, anima mea.”

95
00:06:13,856 --> 00:06:15,424
Then scan the QR code,

96
00:06:15,432 --> 00:06:20,744
and you will get your answer.

97
00:06:23,912 --> 00:06:29,112
The biggest talk of the town right now
is the Chantharusati necklace.

98
00:06:29,136 --> 00:06:33,888
Celebrities and influencers all talk about it.

99
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:43,640
Father of Chantharusati is the most trending
figure on social media this week.

100
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:47,888
When I found out it’s tied to superstition,
that’s it.

101
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:51,648
I would never believe in this kind of stuff.

102
00:06:51,672 --> 00:06:53,872
Amora lumen, cor ad cor, veni, anima mea.

103
00:06:53,904 --> 00:06:56,144
Amora lumen, cor ad cor, veni, anima mea.

104
00:06:56,168 --> 00:06:58,192
Amora lumen, cor ad cor, veni, anima mea.

105
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,000
You really bought it.

106
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,016
You really bought it.

107
00:07:01,048 --> 00:07:02,496
Let me see.

108
00:07:09,816 --> 00:07:11,960
Love will head straight to you.

109
00:07:12,008 --> 00:07:14,744
You will have skin-to-skin contact
with your soulmate.

110
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:18,920
There will be an event
that will make your heart race.

111
00:07:18,968 --> 00:07:21,968
The answer is very specific.

112
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,424
It’s not a generic answer.

113
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:27,912
Why? Don’t you believe it?

114
00:07:28,232 --> 00:07:29,504
How can I believe it?

115
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,664
The answers I got are all random.

116
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,064
Look.

117
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:36,520
I scanned it dozens of times for fun.

118
00:07:36,552 --> 00:07:38,632
There are around 40 answers.

119
00:07:38,656 --> 00:07:40,480
Some of them have similar meanings.

120
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:44,152
You’re surely not doing it for fun.

121
00:07:44,168 --> 00:07:46,368
I read reviews on the internet.

122
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:49,352
It’s obvious that
the influencers are paid to write their reviews.

123
00:07:49,384 --> 00:07:50,832
Most of the comments are positive.

124
00:07:50,856 --> 00:07:52,232
They are surely written by bots.

125
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:54,240
Do you know this?

126
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,560
The necklace is only for a 7-day trial.

127
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,000
If you want a real one,
you need to go to the cult center to buy it.

128
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,270
If you want a real one,
you need to go to the cult center to buy it.

129
00:08:01,312 --> 00:08:04,640
You also need to pay an annual subscription.

130
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:10,928
So they use this necklace
to lure people to join the cult?

131
00:08:10,952 --> 00:08:12,930
It’s so shady.

132
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,208
Yes.

133
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,640
The answers from the necklace are all lies.

134
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:23,904
What a bummer!

135
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:28,616
I thought it would help you find good love.

136
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:32,688
But you put a lot of effort into researching it.

137
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:34,544
You must be desperately in love with Phu.

138
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,540
Stop teasing me.

139
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:47,024
Ploy.

140
00:08:47,824 --> 00:08:49,400
Even though the necklace
doesn’t have superstitious power,

141
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,880
it doesn’t mean it’s useless for your love plan.

142
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,072
Huh?

143
00:08:56,096 --> 00:08:56,888
What do you mean?

144
00:08:56,928 --> 00:08:58,664
Listen to me.

145
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:00,000
Your research is amazing.

146
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,768
Your research is amazing.

147
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:06,864
Why don’t you give it to him to write an article?

148
00:09:06,888 --> 00:09:08,888
You can use this opportunity

149
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:12,744
to develop your relationship with him.

150
00:09:16,552 --> 00:09:20,312
(What Fay said sounds interesting, right?)

151
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:22,072
I never thought it would lead me
to the most dangerous situation in my life.
CHANTHARUSATI FAMILY

152
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:38,616
Phu.

153
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,800
I don’t think we should write an article about it.

154
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:45,000
Superstition is very subjective.

155
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,568
Even if you don’t believe it,

156
00:10:46,584 --> 00:10:48,104
you shouldn’t disrespect it.

157
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,568
I can’t believe that…

158
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,552
you have this crazy and reckless idea.

159
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:06,864
You dare to risk your life

160
00:11:08,192 --> 00:11:10,232
to reveal the truth

161
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:13,152
to the public.

162
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,200
Phu.

163
00:11:19,344 --> 00:11:21,312
When did you start to investigate it?

164
00:11:21,336 --> 00:11:23,310
Since it became the talk of the town.

165
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:25,888
I didn’t tell you guys about it.

166
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,704
Because I was worried about your safety.

167
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:33,480
I’ve been following the news about this cult.

168
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:36,336
The cult is surely a scam.

169
00:11:36,376 --> 00:11:38,340
I can tell it too.

170
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:42,080
But are you sure
you want to risk your life to write this article?

171
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:49,432
Although none of you agrees with me,
including you, Ake.

172
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,128
At least I have…

173
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,912
Excuse me. What’s your name?

174
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:00,000
Ploy.

175
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,440
Ploy.

176
00:12:01,944 --> 00:12:03,752
I have Ploy.

177
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,776
She will move forward with me.

178
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:14,072
I’ll expose the Chantharisatu’s scam.

179
00:12:14,112 --> 00:12:15,736
Chantharusati.

180
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:17,136
Along with Ploy.

181
00:12:27,192 --> 00:12:28,224
Ploy.

182
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:30,568
Let’s work together.

183
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:43,912
You are so lucky to have me as your friend.

184
00:12:43,936 --> 00:12:49,360
Otherwise, you wouldn’t have gotten
physically close to Phu.

185
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,608
Stop it.

186
00:12:50,664 --> 00:12:52,016
I’m stressed about it.

187
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:54,088
Why are you feeling stressed?

188
00:12:54,104 --> 00:12:56,824
This is your chance to get close to him.

189
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,552
I’m not stressed about that.

190
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,000
I agree with everyone in our club
that this cult is dangerous.

191
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,208
I agree with everyone in our club
that this cult is dangerous.

192
00:13:04,248 --> 00:13:07,872
The witness who agreed
to give an interview with Phu went missing.

193
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,560
Missing?

194
00:13:12,608 --> 00:13:13,496
Who is it?

195
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,496
This girl.

196
00:13:14,528 --> 00:13:15,512
Look.

197
00:13:25,592 --> 00:13:29,616
Her account is deleted right in front of us.

198
00:13:29,656 --> 00:13:31,328
Don’t you think this is strange?

199
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:38,856
Who is that?

200
00:13:38,904 --> 00:13:40,032
I don’t know.

201
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:57,904
It must be a cult follower who came to kill me.

202
00:13:57,928 --> 00:14:00,000
How can they know so fast?

203
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,624
How can they know so fast?

204
00:14:00,664 --> 00:14:01,512
Look.

205
00:14:08,408 --> 00:14:10,776
He must be sent here by the cult.

206
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:12,888
We need to attack him first.

207
00:14:12,928 --> 00:14:14,264
When I open the door,

208
00:14:14,288 --> 00:14:15,904
You’ll lunge at him with me.

209
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:16,720
Three.

210
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,200
Two.

211
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:19,864
One.

212
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:21,400
Ouch!

213
00:14:25,336 --> 00:14:26,080
Hey.

214
00:14:26,112 --> 00:14:26,936
Hey.

215
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,352
Hey.

216
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:29,904
Stop it.

217
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,760
Stop!

218
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:34,840
It’s me.

219
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:38,512
Phu!

220
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:41,016
Phu.

221
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:42,608
Phu.

222
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:43,820
I’m sorry.

223
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:56,736
It hurts.

224
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:03,352
I’m sorry for showing up unannounced.

225
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:06,720
I have something important
to talk to you and Fay.

226
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:11,472
So I got your address
from the application forms for the club.

227
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:17,672
What do you want to talk to Ploy about?

228
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:20,752
(Fay!)

229
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:26,664
I heard that the cult is recruiting new followers.

230
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:29,880
Tomorrow is the only day for their recruitment.

231
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:34,680
I need a volunteer to join the cult with me.

232
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:42,056
Phu.

233
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:45,040
Don’t you think it’s too dangerous?

234
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:47,064
Fay.

235
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,288
I’ll let you two talk.

236
00:15:52,312 --> 00:15:53,544
I feel hungry.

237
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,816
I’ll go find something to eat.

238
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:09,536
Ploy, will you go with me?

239
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,584
If we work together,

240
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,376
we might find evidence to expose them?

241
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:21,856
Please, Ploy.

242
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:30,784
Thank you, Ploy.

243
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:54,984
Let’s do it.

244
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,336
I want to eat a crispy pork belly bun.

245
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:58,792
You secretly take his picture
while he’s sleeping without his consent.

246
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,000
Good job, girl.

247
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,696
Good job, girl.

248
00:18:02,216 --> 00:18:04,220
To be honest,

249
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,536
when he is sleeping,

250
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,200
he looks quite handsome.

251
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:12,392
But when he opens his mouth and talks,
he turns into a weirdo.

252
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:16,240
Only crazy people would fall for him.

253
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,520
Not all. You are unlike them.

254
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,664
You are right.

255
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:27,888
I don’t get it either.

256
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:38,712
I don’t get why I like him so much.

257
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:50,112
Then you should go to bed early.

258
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:55,576
So you will feel fresh when you go out
on a date with him tomorrow.

259
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,496
Before I go to bed,

260
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:00,000
I want to scold you first.

261
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,048
I want to scold you first.

262
00:19:01,088 --> 00:19:03,030
How could you leave me?

263
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:04,896
I didn’t leave you.

264
00:19:04,936 --> 00:19:07,080
I stepped aside.

265
00:19:07,128 --> 00:19:09,080
I’m rooting for you.

266
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:19,800
Ploy.

267
00:20:20,456 --> 00:20:23,672
Did you prepare a backup phone
and other stuff for me?

268
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:24,816
Here.

269
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,856
Don’t worry, Ploy.

270
00:20:33,592 --> 00:20:35,590
I’ll always be by your side.

271
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:51,416
ALL THINGS IN THE WORLD ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE.
COME AND JOIN US.

272
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,464
CHANTHARUSATI FAMILY

273
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:12,336
You did well.

274
00:21:12,368 --> 00:21:14,096
You did well.

275
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,864
You did well.

276
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,328
Phu.

277
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,552
Don’t you think they’re acting strange?

278
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:33,864
I think they try to be nice to us
to win our trust.

279
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:37,488
But…

280
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:40,992
they don’t seem to be dangerous.

281
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,216
Don’t lower your guard yet.

282
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:45,000
Look there.

283
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:46,176
Hey.

284
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:46,968
Hey.

285
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,096
Hey.

286
00:21:50,616 --> 00:21:52,620
What are you doing to me?

287
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:56,696
Hey.

288
00:21:56,728 --> 00:21:58,016
Hey, let me go.

289
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,000
Hey.

290
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,000
Let me go.

291
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,096
Let me go.

292
00:22:00,128 --> 00:22:01,464
Let me go.

293
00:22:01,496 --> 00:22:03,080
Hey, let me go.

294
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,072
Let me go.

295
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:18,704
Please take your bag here for checking.

296
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,240
Yes.

297
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:20,872
Ploy, come on.

298
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,192
Thank you.

299
00:22:49,136 --> 00:22:51,000
Stop, you two.

300
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:57,056
Yes.

301
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,488
What are you hiding in your belly?

302
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,080
Nothing.

303
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:12,264
I’ve been eating a lot lately.

304
00:23:12,304 --> 00:23:13,728
So I got the beer belly.

305
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,968
Right?

306
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,504
Let me see your belly.

307
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:21,672
Let me see your belly.

308
00:23:21,688 --> 00:23:23,592
Let me see your belly.

309
00:23:23,616 --> 00:23:25,590
Let me see your belly.

310
00:23:25,616 --> 00:23:27,184
Let me see your belly.

311
00:23:27,208 --> 00:23:28,992
Let me see your belly.

312
00:23:29,008 --> 00:23:30,360
Let me see your belly.

313
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,576
Let me see your belly.

322
00:24:03,928 --> 00:24:04,872
Phu.

323
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:08,680
Is this cult dangerous or bizarre?

324
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:11,032
Probably both.

325
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:12,896
Let’s go, Ploy.

326
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:25,888
Shit.

327
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:34,520
Phu.

328
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:51,704
The room is bugged with a hidden camera
and a microphone to monitor the guest.

329
00:24:51,728 --> 00:24:53,700
It’s exactly what you have suspected.

330
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:57,592
Here, Ploy.

331
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:00,000
Their security system is very tight,
like we thought.

332
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,672
Their security system is very tight,
like we thought.

333
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,224
Exposing them is harder than we thought.

334
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,968
Do you remember our plan?

335
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,072
Then let’s get it started.

336
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:19,624
Phu and I went to do our missions separately.

337
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,904
We tried to blend in with other followers.

338
00:25:22,952 --> 00:25:27,048
This is one of the ways
our family practices meditation.

339
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:36,480
(Our plan was to gather information
about this cult as much as possible.)

340
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,536
(We also wanted to help those
who were kidnapped by them.)

341
00:25:41,568 --> 00:25:43,490
You did well.

342
00:25:43,536 --> 00:25:45,032
You did well.

343
00:25:45,064 --> 00:25:46,184
You did well.

344
00:25:46,208 --> 00:25:47,512
You did well.

345
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:52,840
(At first, I thought
we would go home empty-handed.)

346
00:26:03,872 --> 00:26:04,640
WELCOME HOME, FATHER.

347
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:09,128
(I remember that night was a full moon night.)

348
00:26:09,152 --> 00:26:13,160
(The cult was holding a big event that night.)

349
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:27,880
Today is a good day for us.

350
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:33,696
My comrades,
please get ready physically and mentally

351
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:37,760
to receive good things into your life.

352
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:45,024
Comrade, where are you going?

353
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,464
I have a bad stomach.

354
00:26:48,496 --> 00:26:50,256
I probably ate too much.

355
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,624
Can I go to the bathroom?

356
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,280
Of course.

357
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:55,832
Okay.

358
00:26:55,856 --> 00:26:59,336
I will be accompanying you.

359
00:27:26,424 --> 00:27:27,640
Umm.

360
00:27:28,408 --> 00:27:30,410
You don’t need to stay with me.

361
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,640
I feel like I don’t have privacy.

362
00:27:32,664 --> 00:27:34,848
Comrade, don’t worry.

363
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:37,352
We are family.

364
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:40,576
What you are doing is natural for humans.

365
00:27:40,608 --> 00:27:42,616
You don’t need to hold it in.

366
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:54,712
Are you done?

367
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,000
This is the ladies’ room.

368
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,288
This is the ladies’ room.

369
00:28:00,312 --> 00:28:01,648
You got in the wrong bathroom.

370
00:28:01,688 --> 00:28:03,040
No, I didn’t.

371
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,664
I came here

372
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,712
Because I’m worried about you.

373
00:28:08,184 --> 00:28:10,704
I saw you’ve been in the bathroom for a while.

374
00:28:10,744 --> 00:28:12,288
Don’t worry about me.

375
00:28:12,328 --> 00:28:13,488
I…

376
00:28:14,504 --> 00:28:16,168
I’m not done yet.

377
00:28:16,216 --> 00:28:17,136
Is that so?

378
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:21,424
You aren’t doing something else,

379
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:24,928
Are you?

380
00:28:28,704 --> 00:28:30,168
Why don’t you answer me?

381
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,552
Please answer me.

382
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,680
You don’t answer me

383
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:38,920
because

384
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:52,424
Can you leave now?

385
00:28:52,456 --> 00:28:53,744
This is embarrassing.

386
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:07,248
Now it’s time.

387
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:15,176
My comrades, you will meet
the creator of the Chantharusati Family.

388
00:29:15,224 --> 00:29:20,040
Say his name together.

389
00:29:20,088 --> 00:29:33,096
Father.

390
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:31,568
I’m so happy to meet you tonight.

391
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:38,064
Thank you for everything you did for me.

392
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:43,568
I will bless you with happiness and success.

393
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:47,544
With the power of the moon,

394
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:55,360
please protect my followers from all harm.

395
00:30:56,460 --> 00:31:00,000
You did well.

396
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,352
You did well.

397
00:31:01,384 --> 00:31:04,688
You did well.

398
00:31:04,728 --> 00:31:07,896
You did well.

399
00:31:30,728 --> 00:31:32,440
I can’t believe it.

400
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,264
On a good day like this,

401
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,880
something bad is happening.

402
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:43,600
Hey.

403
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:46,128
Why are you so quiet?

404
00:31:46,152 --> 00:31:49,088
I can feel an energy.

405
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:51,376
A bad energy.

406
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:55,472
It is hostile towards our family.

407
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:57,536
Hey.

408
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:00,000
Are you still alive?

409
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,536
Are you still alive?

410
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,200
Do you think I don’t know…

411
00:32:28,048 --> 00:32:30,050
what you are thinking?

412
00:32:48,744 --> 00:32:50,740
Do you think I don’t know

413
00:32:53,272 --> 00:32:55,270
what you are thinking?

414
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:05,816
Yes, I don’t believe in your damn cult.

415
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:10,096
If you really have magical power,
then show it to me.

416
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,480
Why don’t you say anything?

417
00:33:17,528 --> 00:33:18,480
See?

418
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:23,584
You are just a con artist
who is scamming people.

419
00:33:24,552 --> 00:33:26,112
It’s too late.

420
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:28,160
What?

421
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:29,896
What are you talking about?

422
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:33,400
I want to help wash away your sin.

423
00:33:33,752 --> 00:33:38,040
But you are too sinful beyond repair.

424
00:33:44,944 --> 00:33:46,940
I’m hearing a baby crying.

425
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,080
Everywhere around me.

426
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,440
Blood is all over the bathroom.

427
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,696
Blood, there is blood everywhere.

428
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,000
You know…

429
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:00,432
You know…

430
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:03,240
what I am seeing, right?

431
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,032
You!

432
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:07,664
How did you know about my wife’s abortion?

433
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:09,904
Did you spy on me?

434
00:34:09,936 --> 00:34:11,288
Help!

435
00:34:11,608 --> 00:34:13,610
Help!

436
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:14,952
Help!

437
00:34:14,984 --> 00:34:16,016
Help what?

438
00:34:16,056 --> 00:34:17,216
Who needs your help?!

439
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:24,408
Please take revenge for me.

440
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:26,800
Sure.

441
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:30,776
I’ll take revenge for you.

442
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:16,160
Father.

443
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:19,880
(After hearing what I told you,)

444
00:35:19,912 --> 00:35:27,336
(I know you can tell the incident was staged.)

445
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:34,384
(What I didn’t expect was that
they work together systematically.)

446
00:35:34,424 --> 00:35:37,464
(They were professional.)

447
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:41,600
(They targeted those who are vulnerable

448
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:45,008
and those who need a support system.)

449
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:51,456
I was sure that we would win this battle.

450
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,584
But I was wrong.

451
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:59,512
Father.

452
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:20,680
Wait.

453
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,264
Don’t go yet.

454
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,520
If you have intuition power.

455
00:36:34,552 --> 00:36:35,880
If you really have magical power.

456
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,720
Then you would have known

457
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,840
that I don’t believe you either.

458
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:51,168
His name is Phupar.

459
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,368
Is your name Phupar?

460
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:09,064
Yes, it’s written in my application form.

461
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:35,472
Stage.

462
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:38,256
Fame.

463
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:40,776
Fans.

464
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:49,280
Surprisingly, they didn’t make you happy.

465
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:54,440
Are you tired?

466
00:37:56,140 --> 00:38:00,000
You’ve been trying to prove
that you have more than just good looks.

467
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:00,592
You’ve been trying to prove
that you have more than just good looks.

468
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:08,608
Everyone was trying to milk you dry.

469
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:11,520
They treated you as if you were a product.

470
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:14,448
They controlled what you would wear,

471
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,760
where you should be to make money.

472
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:26,608
But what you really wanted was
to earn recognition without using your looks.

473
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:29,712
Am I right?

474
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,176
Answer me! Am I right?

475
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:46,740
If you don’t want to answer me, it’s okay.

476
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,536
Let me help you.

477
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:16,736
The power of the moon,
manifest your power now.

478
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,248
What are you doing?

479
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:37,488
I’m destroying your good looks.

480
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:43,256
The shell that holds you back is gone.

481
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:55,112
You will be remembered as a new man.

482
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:59,600
No one will remember your past.

483
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:03,128
I will give this to you.

484
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:18,784
Welcome to our family, Comrade Phupar.

485
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:23,496
Now, you have been reborn.

486
00:40:27,810 --> 00:40:38,544
You did well.

487
00:40:38,568 --> 00:40:40,540
Can you feel the power in you?

488
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,272
The power of rebirth.

489
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:46,952
Use your power

490
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,504
with the followers in front of you.

491
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,000
Raise your hand.

492
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,240
Raise your hand.

493
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,200
See?

494
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:13,536
I didn’t lie to you.

495
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:20,512
Then swing your arm in circles.

496
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:36,224
Raise your arms and wave.

497
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:40,592
Father.

498
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:43,160
Did you read my mind?

499
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,568
Spread your arms.

500
00:41:45,184 --> 00:41:46,256
Move them up and down.

501
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:49,104
Fold your arms.

502
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:51,040
Until your hands touch your shoulders.

503
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:52,576
Spread your arms.

504
00:41:52,608 --> 00:41:53,896
Move them up and down.

505
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,632
Raise your arms and swing them in circles.

506
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:03,408
Father.

507
00:42:25,936 --> 00:42:27,432
Father is manifesting his power.

508
00:42:27,472 --> 00:42:29,352
The power of the moon is miraculous.

509
00:42:29,384 --> 00:42:43,120
It’s miraculous.

510
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:46,728
It’s a steel pole.

511
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:49,328
It’s created based on a physics theory.

512
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:52,408
It’s not a miracle as they claim.

513
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:57,568
You are so busted.

514
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:00,000
It’s miraculous.

515
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,080
It’s miraculous.

516
00:43:02,112 --> 00:43:03,448
Got you.

517
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:06,016
Ouch.

518
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:12,808
Let me go.

519
00:43:12,832 --> 00:43:13,616
Let me go.

520
00:43:13,648 --> 00:43:14,696
Let me go.

521
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:23,768
Shit.

522
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:38,416
(Everything happened so fast.)

523
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:46,568
(In that split second,
a thought popped up in my head.)

524
00:43:47,352 --> 00:43:49,350
Love will head straight to you.

525
00:43:49,376 --> 00:43:52,080
You will have skin-to-skin contact
with your soulmate.

526
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:55,896
There will be an event
that will make your heart race.

527
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,640
(I can’t believe it.)

528
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:00,000
(The prediction is coming true.)

529
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,216
(The prediction is coming true.)

530
00:44:22,830 --> 00:44:23,440
Stop.

531
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:44,776
Why is my heart suddenly beating fast?

532
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:47,640
when I am near you

533
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:57,000
Heart racing, your ass!

534
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,408
The Mother of Chantharusati has descended.

535
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:10,144
Mother.

536
00:45:10,176 --> 00:45:11,896
Do you think I’ll let you do it

537
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:13,800
What are you talking about, Sangchan?

538
00:45:13,848 --> 00:45:14,920
Who is Sangchan?

539
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,920
Why do you keep calling me Sangchan?

540
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:20,144
Ploy, can you tell me what’s going on?

541
00:45:20,176 --> 00:45:22,856
I got important evidence to expose this cult.

542
00:45:22,896 --> 00:45:25,008
What they do is not just scamming people.

543
00:45:30,592 --> 00:45:33,010
This cannot harm me.
