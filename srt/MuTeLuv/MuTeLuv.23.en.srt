4
00:00:13,011 --> 00:00:14,039
I was almost hit by a motorcycle.

5
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:14,921
My leg is injured.

6
00:00:14,921 --> 00:00:17,617
Did the rider take responsibility for it?

7
00:00:17,617 --> 00:00:18,828
She takes responsibility for it.

8
00:00:18,828 --> 00:00:20,120
She’ll help me find the plaque.

9
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,528
How can you not know which shrine 
she went to write the wishing plaque?

10
00:00:23,528 --> 00:00:24,489
You were still together at the time.

11
00:00:24,489 --> 00:00:25,607
I was busy.

12
00:00:25,607 --> 00:00:27,630
If I were her, 
I would have broken up with you.

13
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,878
My boyfriend will never do that to me.

14
00:00:29,878 --> 00:00:31,079
You two are living apart.

15
00:00:31,187 --> 00:00:31,969
Be careful.

16
00:00:31,969 --> 00:00:33,094
He might see someone behind your back.

17
00:00:33,267 --> 00:00:35,135
What the hell is wrong with you?

18
00:00:36,128 --> 00:00:37,407
You are an asshole.

19
00:00:44,557 --> 00:00:46,453
5 MONTHS AGO.
May.

20
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:50,709
May.

21
00:00:52,673 --> 00:00:54,215
These two just arrived, too.

22
00:00:54,215 --> 00:00:55,400
It’s not too late to go in.

23
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,837
Forget it. It’s too late.

24
00:00:57,506 --> 00:00:58,049
Hey.

25
00:01:00,337 --> 00:01:01,800
It’s not too late to go inside.

26
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,860
Didn’t we agree to go in together?

27
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,944
Okay, now we are both here.

28
00:01:06,944 --> 00:01:08,015
Come on. Let’s go in.

29
00:01:08,015 --> 00:01:08,551
No.

30
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,812
I don’t want to watch the concert anymore.

31
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:15,811
May, why are you making a big deal out of it?

32
00:01:16,286 --> 00:01:17,385
It’s not that big a deal.

33
00:01:18,421 --> 00:01:20,729
I wanted to know 
if you would keep your promise.

34
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:21,852
You could just go in first.

35
00:01:21,852 --> 00:01:23,156
I could follow you when I arrived.

36
00:01:23,156 --> 00:01:24,320
Why do you have to start a fight about this?

37
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,231
I started the fight?

38
00:01:25,231 --> 00:01:26,652
You arrived first. You went in first.

39
00:01:26,652 --> 00:01:27,628
That’s all.

40
00:01:33,175 --> 00:01:33,893
Payu.

41
00:01:38,208 --> 00:01:40,002
If I have to do everything alone,

42
00:01:40,477 --> 00:01:42,116
what’s the point of having a boyfriend?!

43
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:43,829
May, wait.

44
00:01:46,999 --> 00:01:47,644
What the heck!?

45
00:02:09,376 --> 00:02:10,231
I…

46
00:02:13,339 --> 00:02:15,160
I didn’t want to come here.

47
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,453
I took you to those shrines.

48
00:02:20,374 --> 00:02:23,044
I was hoping that 
you would find your Ema plaque.

49
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:26,293
So we wouldn’t need to come here.

50
00:02:34,636 --> 00:02:36,507
Before he moved to Tokyo,

51
00:02:37,694 --> 00:02:39,700
we wrote the wishing plaque together.

52
00:02:41,103 --> 00:02:42,888
You want to write a wishing plaque?

53
00:02:43,384 --> 00:02:44,756
You’re acting like an old man.

54
00:02:45,339 --> 00:02:47,835
I’m not superstitious.

55
00:02:50,404 --> 00:02:52,191
But it makes me feel more at ease.

56
00:02:53,272 --> 00:02:54,737
We will be living apart.

57
00:02:54,845 --> 00:02:56,900
What if a guy hits on you?

58
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:59,240
That’s crazy.

59
00:02:59,326 --> 00:03:01,358
Don’t you trust me?

60
00:03:05,589 --> 00:03:08,985
May we stay together forever.

61
00:03:09,287 --> 00:03:10,886
That’s cute.

62
00:03:10,886 --> 00:03:12,949
I’m not going anywhere.

63
00:03:13,079 --> 00:03:16,069
Two months after he moved to work in Tokyo,

64
00:03:16,997 --> 00:03:19,068
I can’t contact him.

65
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,683
When I sent him messages,

66
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,296
he never read them.

67
00:03:28,534 --> 00:03:29,617
Even so…

68
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,316
I’m still waiting for him.

69
00:03:32,244 --> 00:03:33,310
It’s been a year.

70
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,266
Are his friends able to contact him?

71
00:03:43,863 --> 00:03:44,565
Yes.

72
00:03:46,702 --> 00:03:49,793
I’m the only one with whom he cut contact.

73
00:03:51,822 --> 00:03:54,670
If you want to break up, you can just say so.

74
00:03:54,994 --> 00:03:58,768
Asshole, you don’t even have the guts 
to break up with me.

75
00:04:04,725 --> 00:04:06,704
Why did he dump me?

76
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,431
Does our time together mean nothing to him?

77
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,067
When you broke up with your girlfriend,
 did it end that easily?

78
00:04:24,981 --> 00:04:26,334
I want to break up with you.

79
00:04:34,406 --> 00:04:35,189
I don’t know.

80
00:04:38,146 --> 00:04:39,716
If I were going to break up with my girlfriend,

81
00:04:41,529 --> 00:04:43,130
it wouldn’t be hard for me.

82
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:44,463
Men are all sucks.

83
00:04:44,463 --> 00:04:45,573
Men are assholes.

84
00:04:45,573 --> 00:04:49,028
Men are the worst. They are all assholes.

85
00:04:49,028 --> 00:04:50,942
All men are assholes.

86
00:04:50,942 --> 00:04:52,680
Asshole, they are assholes.

87
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,838
Assholes.

88
00:05:18,218 --> 00:05:20,671
When you are drunk, you are very chaotic.

89
00:05:20,671 --> 00:05:21,402
Do you know that?

90
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,931
COMFORTING WORDS

91
00:06:33,939 --> 00:06:35,464
Can’t we leave your motorbike here?

92
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,762
No.

93
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:39,956
It might be stolen.

94
00:06:41,035 --> 00:06:43,550
Look at you. You can’t ride it.

95
00:06:43,852 --> 00:06:47,129
Just wait, if I run into my boyfriend,

96
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:48,933
I will punch him to the ground.

97
00:06:48,933 --> 00:06:49,573
Easy, easy.

98
00:06:50,069 --> 00:06:51,818
Right now, you should worry 
about not falling over yourself.

99
00:06:53,178 --> 00:06:53,851
I…

100
00:06:54,844 --> 00:06:57,157
I no longer love him.

101
00:06:57,718 --> 00:06:59,628
I have no feelings for him.

102
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:01,609
All I feel is rage.

103
00:07:02,538 --> 00:07:05,492
I won’t cry for him anymore.

104
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,643
Why did he leave me?

105
00:07:16,413 --> 00:07:18,254
Has he ever missed me?

106
00:07:20,995 --> 00:07:21,819
Hey.

107
00:07:23,438 --> 00:07:26,729
When do people fall out of love?

108
00:07:30,873 --> 00:07:31,812
What do you mean?

109
00:07:32,352 --> 00:07:33,485
You can’t go with me?

110
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:35,836
I promise I’ll go with you next time.

111
00:07:35,836 --> 00:07:37,635
If I have to do everything alone,

112
00:07:38,131 --> 00:07:39,972
what’s the point of having a boyfriend?!

113
00:07:42,238 --> 00:07:43,523
PLEASE MAKE PAYU LOVE ME FOREVER.

114
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,570
Are you going to keep crying until dawn?

115
00:07:53,678 --> 00:07:55,107
Then I’ll buy something to eat.

116
00:07:56,381 --> 00:07:59,176
Hey, I’m hurting.

117
00:07:59,867 --> 00:08:01,501
Can’t you be gentle with me?

118
00:08:01,501 --> 00:08:03,024
What do you want me to do?

119
00:08:03,715 --> 00:08:04,722
Do you want me to comfort you?

120
00:08:05,111 --> 00:08:06,588
Do you want me to say it’ll be okay?

121
00:08:07,495 --> 00:08:08,509
You’re a terrible person.

122
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:40,302
Don’t cry.

123
00:09:52,506 --> 00:09:53,486
Why are you laughing?

124
00:09:54,846 --> 00:09:55,776
Look.

125
00:09:58,517 --> 00:10:01,739
A man with an injured leg is pushing the bike.

126
00:10:03,142 --> 00:10:06,329
Meanwhile, I cried.

127
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:07,677
My hair is a mess.

128
00:10:11,563 --> 00:10:13,360
This isn't good.

129
00:10:22,243 --> 00:10:22,830
Hey.

130
00:10:24,492 --> 00:10:25,505
Can I ask you something?

131
00:10:27,815 --> 00:10:30,161
Why are you waiting for your boyfriend 
for so long?

132
00:10:31,629 --> 00:10:34,887
Don’t you want to start a new relationship?

133
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,732
You don’t need to be that serious.

134
00:10:50,207 --> 00:10:51,429
I’m just curious.

135
00:10:53,394 --> 00:10:54,489
I’m not being serious.

136
00:10:55,973 --> 00:10:56,674
I just…

137
00:11:05,136 --> 00:11:06,769
Are you alright?

138
00:11:08,663 --> 00:11:09,564
Drink some water.

139
00:11:36,728 --> 00:11:37,628
I…

140
00:11:39,571 --> 00:11:42,310
I always believed that one day

141
00:11:43,972 --> 00:11:45,760
I would move to Tokyo to live with him.

142
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,419
I thought we would get married.

143
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:52,827
I really believed it.

144
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:09,788
But I still trust him.

145
00:12:11,061 --> 00:12:12,006
To be honest,

146
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:14,113
I kind of knew that this might happen.

147
00:12:14,739 --> 00:12:16,167
That’s why it doesn’t hurt so bad.

148
00:12:25,514 --> 00:12:27,400
This is what you call it doesn’t hurt so bad.

149
00:12:41,272 --> 00:12:43,468
You can lean on me 
if you aren’t feeling okay.

150
00:12:45,778 --> 00:12:47,007
Doesn’t your leg hurt?

151
00:12:49,964 --> 00:12:51,268
Just worry about yourself.

152
00:12:51,441 --> 00:12:52,400
You don’t need to worry about me.

153
00:13:02,113 --> 00:13:06,068
When I finally admit that it’s over, 
I feel much lighter.

154
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,968
Maybe I was waiting for this day to come.

155
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,851
It may be time for a new beginning.

156
00:13:15,449 --> 00:13:16,202
What about you?

157
00:13:18,317 --> 00:13:19,936
If I didn’t want to have a new start,

158
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:21,639
I wouldn’t have come all the way here.

159
00:13:23,884 --> 00:13:24,913
Don’t worry.

160
00:13:25,301 --> 00:13:27,978
I’ll help you find the Ema plaque.

161
00:13:32,684 --> 00:13:35,085
Let’s forget about our exes.

162
00:13:37,718 --> 00:13:38,380
Yes.

163
00:13:44,337 --> 00:13:46,188
Are you sure you won’t cry to sleep tonight?

164
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,000
You are unbelievable!

165
00:14:07,443 --> 00:14:10,387
My leg is injured, 
but I need to push your bike.

166
00:14:11,099 --> 00:14:12,117
When will it get better?

167
00:14:14,556 --> 00:14:16,355
You are such a whiner.

168
00:14:17,499 --> 00:14:18,408
I’m drunk.

169
00:14:19,401 --> 00:14:20,515
You’re not drunk.

170
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,186
But you’re whining so much.

171
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,959
Because you’re acting like this.

172
00:14:28,693 --> 00:14:31,194
Whiner, whiner, whiner.

173
00:14:31,302 --> 00:14:33,568
Yes, whiner, whiner, whiner.

174
00:14:33,568 --> 00:14:34,969
Whiner, whiner, whiner.

175
00:14:35,893 --> 00:14:37,420
Stop it, or I’ll leave the bike here.

176
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,901
I think you and May are perfect for each other.

177
00:14:39,901 --> 00:14:40,671
Why?

178
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:42,471
You barely pay attention to her.

179
00:14:42,471 --> 00:14:44,200
She’s willing to look past everything.

180
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,571
Would this count as coming together?
