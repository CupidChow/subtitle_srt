4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,888
To increase our subscribers,

5
00:00:14,888 --> 00:00:16,436
why don’t we pray to gods for help?

6
00:00:19,341 --> 00:00:20,295
It’s really increasing.

7
00:00:20,295 --> 00:00:21,570
It almost hit 100,000 subscribers.

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,775
Thank you, Goddess,

9
00:00:23,775 --> 00:00:25,427
for helping us get where we are today.

10
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,960
Congratulations on hitting 100,000 subscribers.

11
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,389
I’m not your friend.

12
00:00:38,644 --> 00:00:41,934
I’m the goddess!

13
00:00:43,574 --> 00:00:45,297
GODDESS DALOP

14
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:01,950
Kat!

15
00:01:06,206 --> 00:01:08,316
Are you here to apologize to me?

16
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:10,399
Stop talking nonsense.

17
00:01:12,251 --> 00:01:13,282
No.

18
00:01:20,669 --> 00:01:22,735
The goddess is possessing your friend.

19
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,324
How is that possible?

20
00:01:27,324 --> 00:01:31,419
The person who is the most disrespectful
to the goddess is Kat.

21
00:01:31,419 --> 00:01:32,234
How insolent!

22
00:01:33,267 --> 00:01:34,669
I’m not being insolent.

23
00:01:35,367 --> 00:01:36,736
I mean it.

24
00:01:36,736 --> 00:01:39,202
Unless the goddess likes the smell of vomit.

25
00:01:39,491 --> 00:01:42,656
Are you sure you didn’t do anything wrong?

26
00:01:49,797 --> 00:01:51,480
What’s wrong, Ingky?

27
00:01:52,105 --> 00:01:53,129
Nothing.

28
00:01:53,129 --> 00:01:54,175
I’m fine.

29
00:01:54,175 --> 00:01:56,196
Why don’t you tell them?

30
00:01:56,821 --> 00:01:58,759
You haven’t had any matches on Tinder
for the past 3 – 4 days.

31
00:01:59,528 --> 00:02:01,304
No, it’s not true.

32
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,020
Check it.

33
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,417
Give me your phone.

34
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,305
Look.

35
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:07,477
Her last match was three days ago.

36
00:02:10,266 --> 00:02:11,053
Ingky!

37
00:02:11,053 --> 00:02:12,213
Give it back, Fews.

38
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,333
You need to understand me.

39
00:02:16,102 --> 00:02:18,226
I have more than 20 matches.

40
00:02:18,683 --> 00:02:22,125
They all text me and want to talk to me.

41
00:02:22,462 --> 00:02:23,773
They want to meet me.

42
00:02:23,773 --> 00:02:28,083
They want…give me their love.

43
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:31,840
I don’t match with them just to fulfill
the goddess’s requirement, like you.

44
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,532
What?

45
00:02:33,157 --> 00:02:34,180
How dare you say that?

46
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,041
Fews.

47
00:02:36,546 --> 00:02:38,698
You said that
as if you didn’t do anything wrong.

48
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,020
What?

49
00:02:40,501 --> 00:02:42,577
- I have new matches every day.
- OMG!

50
00:02:43,683 --> 00:02:44,991
On Disco?

51
00:02:45,135 --> 00:02:47,111
The gay app for dating?

52
00:02:52,623 --> 00:02:53,704
Hi.

53
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,991
Are you a fem gay?

54
00:02:55,664 --> 00:02:57,079
I’m a masc.

55
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,772
If I acted like a fem gay,
I wouldn’t get any matches.

56
00:03:01,927 --> 00:03:03,249
You can’t do that.

57
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,169
What?

58
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:11,855
Why the hell are you staring at me?

59
00:03:12,961 --> 00:03:15,232
I got new matches every day as a fem.

60
00:03:15,352 --> 00:03:16,695
I won every battle.

61
00:03:18,138 --> 00:03:19,617
What about that day?

62
00:03:21,273 --> 00:03:23,065
The day that you were defeated.

63
00:03:32,418 --> 00:03:33,490
P’Pat.

64
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:34,696
Oh, I’ll go.

65
00:03:34,936 --> 00:03:35,841
Definitely go.

66
00:03:39,255 --> 00:03:40,654
Oh, my heart.

67
00:03:44,717 --> 00:03:45,429
P’Pat.

68
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:52,005
You were crying in the bathroom.

69
00:03:52,197 --> 00:03:54,086
You were bawling your eyes out for an hour.

70
00:03:54,086 --> 00:03:55,845
I was just crying. I wasn’t defeated.

71
00:03:58,373 --> 00:03:59,299
Whatever.

72
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,559
Now, it’s a good chance.

73
00:04:01,559 --> 00:04:04,093
The goddess is possessing Katrina.

74
00:04:04,574 --> 00:04:07,603
You can apologize to her now.

75
00:04:07,795 --> 00:04:11,320
Med, how can you be sure
that she is the goddess?

76
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,338
That’s right.

77
00:04:12,338 --> 00:04:13,879
This doesn’t make sense.

78
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:15,689
She broke the conditions more often than us.

79
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:16,418
Hey!

80
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,704
I’m warning you.

81
00:04:20,185 --> 00:04:22,782
You need to apologize to me right now.

82
00:04:23,407 --> 00:04:24,646
I’m not mad at Kat.

83
00:04:25,488 --> 00:04:26,527
About the vomit,

84
00:04:28,859 --> 00:04:29,804
I can bear with it.

85
00:04:31,631 --> 00:04:33,442
You broke my rules.

86
00:04:33,995 --> 00:04:35,910
You need to apologize to me.

87
00:04:36,174 --> 00:04:36,846
Sure.

88
00:04:37,135 --> 00:04:39,273
But not to this face.

89
00:04:40,716 --> 00:04:41,526
Asshole.

90
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,705
Fine.

91
00:04:43,138 --> 00:04:44,934
I’ll curse you.

92
00:04:44,934 --> 00:04:49,968
Your every day, every hour, every minute,

93
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:53,552
your lives will be full of misfortunes.

94
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,272
Wait and see the result of defying me.

95
00:04:58,416 --> 00:04:59,801
What will be your punishment?

96
00:05:01,292 --> 00:05:01,908
Idiots!

97
00:05:01,908 --> 00:05:03,205
No, you are an idiot, bitch!

98
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,508
Kat!

99
00:05:07,326 --> 00:05:08,880
Do you think I’m afraid of you?

100
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,452
Huh?

101
00:05:09,452 --> 00:05:10,253
Kat!

102
00:05:11,095 --> 00:05:11,889
Bitch!

103
00:05:11,889 --> 00:05:12,644
Kat!

104
00:05:12,644 --> 00:05:13,800
Bitch!

105
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,572
They are idiots!

106
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,125
Amen.

107
00:06:19,044 --> 00:06:22,379
Kat was talking nonsense.

108
00:06:22,836 --> 00:06:24,360
A curse? What the heck?!

109
00:06:24,841 --> 00:06:27,143
I think what she said might be true.

110
00:06:27,936 --> 00:06:29,288
Come to think about it.

111
00:06:29,697 --> 00:06:32,807
Kat is the only one
who didn’t break any rules.

112
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:33,817
Except…

113
00:06:35,549 --> 00:06:36,412
the vomiting.

114
00:06:37,424 --> 00:06:38,721
Nonsense.

115
00:06:39,394 --> 00:06:40,405
I don’t believe it.

116
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:41,803
She just used a psychological tactic.

117
00:06:41,803 --> 00:06:45,543
If we are told that we have bad luck,
we will focus on it.

118
00:06:45,735 --> 00:06:46,549
Focus?

119
00:06:46,813 --> 00:06:50,695
If you feel worried,
we can go to Chonburi.

120
00:06:51,777 --> 00:06:52,690
Why?

121
00:06:52,859 --> 00:06:54,069
I found a temple that can reverse curses.

122
00:06:54,838 --> 00:06:55,932
It’s not time yet.

123
00:06:56,389 --> 00:06:59,184
If we were cursed,
we wouldn’t have so many sponsors.

124
00:07:00,939 --> 00:07:01,614
Girls.

125
00:07:01,782 --> 00:07:02,750
Stop.

126
00:07:04,193 --> 00:07:07,070
We are from AXTC.

127
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:09,590
We want to invite Air Dolls
to join a promotional activity with Crepes.

128
00:07:11,327 --> 00:07:12,257
Crepes?

129
00:07:12,257 --> 00:07:13,079
Crepes!

130
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:13,616
Gosh!

131
00:07:13,616 --> 00:07:14,208
P’Pat’s boy group.

132
00:07:25,148 --> 00:07:26,943
We’re so lucky.

133
00:07:26,943 --> 00:07:29,934
We get to shoot this content
because the other YouTuber is hospitalized.

134
00:07:31,377 --> 00:07:32,689
This is what you call misfortune?

135
00:07:32,689 --> 00:07:35,353
We totally lucked out.

136
00:07:35,353 --> 00:07:36,011
Hey.

137
00:07:37,141 --> 00:07:39,654
My stomach is not feeling well.

138
00:07:42,563 --> 00:07:43,335
Stop.

139
00:07:49,381 --> 00:07:50,088
See?

140
00:07:50,088 --> 00:07:51,264
If we had bad luck,

141
00:07:51,264 --> 00:07:52,894
we would have fallen into this damn sewer.

142
00:07:53,303 --> 00:07:55,939
Bad luck is a result of being reckless.

143
00:07:56,444 --> 00:07:57,839
If we are cautious about everything,

144
00:07:58,272 --> 00:07:59,609
there’s no way we will have bad luck.

145
00:08:01,653 --> 00:08:02,338
Let’s go.

146
00:08:07,676 --> 00:08:08,897
- Hello.
- So big.

147
00:08:08,897 --> 00:08:09,850
Hello.

148
00:08:10,547 --> 00:08:11,800
P’Pat.

149
00:08:14,156 --> 00:08:16,266
Hello, P’Pat.

150
00:08:16,266 --> 00:08:16,934
Hello.

151
00:08:16,934 --> 00:08:19,261
I’ll introduce my members to you.

152
00:08:19,261 --> 00:08:20,905
This is Hot.

153
00:08:20,905 --> 00:08:22,202
He’s the main dancer of my group.

154
00:08:34,115 --> 00:08:34,833
Good.

155
00:08:36,155 --> 00:08:38,235
I want to talk to you.

156
00:08:38,235 --> 00:08:39,919
Do you want to talk to me?

157
00:08:40,136 --> 00:08:41,280
I’m introverted and not good at talking.

158
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,450
Will you be interested in me?

159
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:43,754
What should I do?

160
00:08:43,754 --> 00:08:45,026
I don’t want to give my heart away for free.

161
00:08:45,026 --> 00:08:47,084
I hope you will be kind to me.

162
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:47,988
Good job.

163
00:08:50,224 --> 00:08:52,259
This is Tone, the main rapper.

164
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,443
Good.

165
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:59,942
Oh!

166
00:09:01,288 --> 00:09:05,290
You are here, Air Dolls.

167
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:06,312
Kat!

168
00:09:07,394 --> 00:09:08,364
Goddess.

169
00:09:08,677 --> 00:09:10,326
What are you doing here?

170
00:09:10,326 --> 00:09:13,439
I thought you were holding
a ceremony to curse us.

171
00:09:13,439 --> 00:09:15,335
Why can’t I be here?

172
00:09:15,335 --> 00:09:17,561
I’m also a member of Air Dolls.

173
00:09:17,561 --> 00:09:19,956
The reason why I’m here,

174
00:09:20,245 --> 00:09:22,967
it’s because I want to witness
your misfortune with my own eyes.

175
00:09:23,231 --> 00:09:26,533
A goddess like me always keeps my word.

176
00:09:28,232 --> 00:09:29,249
Kat.

177
00:09:29,418 --> 00:09:32,146
Can you stop pretending
to be possessed by a spirit?

178
00:09:32,146 --> 00:09:34,295
What kind of goddess
wants to go out with guys?

179
00:09:34,295 --> 00:09:35,971
It would be more strange
if I went out with girls, idiot!

180
00:09:36,981 --> 00:09:38,657
Is there a problem between you?

181
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,252
- No.
- No problem.

182
00:09:41,252 --> 00:09:42,271
Not at all.

183
00:09:43,617 --> 00:09:45,491
Excuse us. We need to get ready.

184
00:09:45,491 --> 00:09:46,229
Sure.

185
00:09:46,229 --> 00:09:47,448
See you, P’Pat.

186
00:10:03,376 --> 00:10:03,975
Ing.

187
00:10:05,153 --> 00:10:06,280
Can you come with me to ask for medicine?

188
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,014
What? Why can’t you…

189
00:10:14,377 --> 00:10:15,742
Can’t you ask for me?

190
00:10:16,175 --> 00:10:17,940
Do you have medication for an upset stomach?

191
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:21,420
Search in the bag.

192
00:10:21,733 --> 00:10:23,007
You want us to look for it by ourselves?

193
00:10:23,007 --> 00:10:23,507
Yes.

194
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,557
Right.

195
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:26,863
What about this?

196
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:29,838
No.

197
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,758
Antacids will make my condition worse.

198
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:33,910
What about this one?

199
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:37,699
Ing, use your brain.

200
00:10:37,867 --> 00:10:40,340
Domperidone will make my lips feel dry.

201
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,285
I won’t look good.

202
00:10:41,285 --> 00:10:42,790
You are so choosy.

203
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,687
Let’s go with this one.

204
00:10:47,673 --> 00:10:48,766
What is this?

205
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:50,928
What the hell are you doing?

206
00:10:52,851 --> 00:10:54,440
It’s an organic medicine.

207
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,432
Let’s get back to work.

208
00:10:57,884 --> 00:11:00,535
Do you see my laxative?

209
00:11:00,896 --> 00:11:01,554
I don’t know.

210
00:11:01,554 --> 00:11:02,565
Look in the bag.

211
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:08,368
Today, Crepes and everyone
will eat spicy food.

212
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:12,252
The concept of the show is
promoting your song while enjoying a meal.

213
00:11:12,637 --> 00:11:16,091
I want you guys to look like
you're having a good time while eating.

214
00:11:16,091 --> 00:11:17,875
You can play jokes all you want.

215
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:21,582
If you have any questions, feel free to ask.

216
00:11:21,582 --> 00:11:22,836
I have a question.

217
00:11:22,836 --> 00:11:23,755
Yes.

218
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,840
I’m allergic to vinegar.

219
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,909
Have you informed your staff about my allergy?

220
00:11:29,909 --> 00:11:32,092
I checked the recipes thoroughly.

221
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:35,922
They use only lime juice in every dish.

222
00:11:35,922 --> 00:11:37,102
Wow!

223
00:11:37,102 --> 00:11:41,260
Ingky, if you don’t want to eat, it’s okay.

224
00:11:42,342 --> 00:11:44,113
It’s not that big of a deal.

225
00:11:44,113 --> 00:11:45,794
I’m ready for today.

226
00:11:50,961 --> 00:11:51,597
Fews.

227
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:53,498
What’s wrong?

228
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:56,391
Ingky.

229
00:11:57,882 --> 00:11:59,513
My stomach is upset.

230
00:12:01,485 --> 00:12:02,933
Excuse me, I need to go to the bathroom.

231
00:12:02,933 --> 00:12:03,648
Okay.

232
00:12:04,033 --> 00:12:06,901
If everyone is ready, let’s begin the shooting.

233
00:12:07,141 --> 00:12:08,437
Hold it in.

234
00:12:08,557 --> 00:12:09,429
It has to wait.

235
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:11,018
The shooting won’t take longer than an hour.

236
00:12:11,162 --> 00:12:12,428
Hold it in.

237
00:12:19,181 --> 00:12:21,582
P’Pat, enjoy the food.

238
00:12:22,183 --> 00:12:23,129
Thank you.

239
00:12:23,129 --> 00:12:24,840
I’ll get it for you.

240
00:12:26,186 --> 00:12:27,306
P’Pat.

241
00:12:27,979 --> 00:12:30,460
You should stay away from Air Dolls.

242
00:12:31,037 --> 00:12:32,563
They have a long face

243
00:12:32,563 --> 00:12:34,130
because they are down on their luck.

244
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:34,870
Yeah.

245
00:12:38,376 --> 00:12:40,364
P’Pat, don’t listen to her.

246
00:12:40,364 --> 00:12:42,559
I don’t know what got into her lately.

247
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:43,625
She keeps talking nonsense.

248
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:45,767
I guess her brain has stopped developing.

249
00:12:45,767 --> 00:12:48,314
I’m talking about her math skills.

250
00:12:48,314 --> 00:12:50,669
Don’t ask her. She can’t answer it.

251
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:51,839
Because she’s stupid.

252
00:12:53,402 --> 00:12:55,723
Do you normally use harsh words
to tease each other?

253
00:12:55,723 --> 00:12:56,465
That’s…

254
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,019
That’s right, P’Pat.

255
00:13:01,211 --> 00:13:03,769
This is how we tease each other.

256
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,345
You’re just joking.

257
00:13:07,778 --> 00:13:09,656
P’Pat, please dig in.

258
00:13:13,057 --> 00:13:14,611
Are you okay, P’Fews?

259
00:13:15,404 --> 00:13:16,839
Why didn’t you eat anything?

260
00:13:24,884 --> 00:13:25,995
Thank you.

261
00:13:28,801 --> 00:13:31,828
FEWS, ACT LIKE YOU ENJOY THE FOOD.

262
00:13:35,651 --> 00:13:37,725
Do you want to try spicy pork bone soup?

263
00:13:38,591 --> 00:13:40,556
I’ll try it a bit, P’Pat.

264
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:48,462
Do you know my mom always sends me
a limousine so I can go out to eat the soup?

265
00:13:48,775 --> 00:13:51,474
Spicy pork bone soup
is one of my favorite foods.

266
00:13:51,859 --> 00:13:55,425
I love spicy food.

267
00:13:55,593 --> 00:13:57,287
Then you should eat it a lot.

268
00:14:00,556 --> 00:14:01,385
That’s enough.

269
00:14:01,385 --> 00:14:02,681
I’ll have a small bite.

270
00:14:02,681 --> 00:14:04,016
My mouth is small.

271
00:14:12,778 --> 00:14:14,691
Fews, are you okay?

272
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,264
For you.

273
00:14:21,822 --> 00:14:22,595
For me?

274
00:14:23,749 --> 00:14:25,371
Thank you.

275
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:42,918
P’Pat, do you know
that Kat used to have no friends?

276
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:45,709
Because she was too stinky.

277
00:14:45,709 --> 00:14:46,873
Idiot.

278
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:50,400
Why don’t you tell him about your past, too?

279
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:54,712
P’Pat, do you know
she used to coach a cheerleading team?

280
00:14:54,712 --> 00:14:56,048
She didn’t let them go home.

281
00:14:56,048 --> 00:14:56,785
She acted like a dictator.

282
00:14:56,785 --> 00:14:59,000
Those cheerleaders really hated her.

283
00:14:59,155 --> 00:15:00,320
Bitch, you are a dictator.

284
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,024
Shameless.

285
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,531
Kat, you are a dumbass.

286
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,217
Nevia, you are an asshole.

287
00:15:12,724 --> 00:15:14,400
Do you want to try me?

288
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,505
Bring it on, bitch.

289
00:15:28,297 --> 00:15:30,071
Is there something rotten in here?

290
00:15:37,429 --> 00:15:38,807
Did you…

291
00:15:39,721 --> 00:15:40,809
…fart?

292
00:15:40,809 --> 00:15:41,485
Poop.

293
00:15:42,135 --> 00:15:43,475
I’m pooping.

294
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:45,212
I’m holding it in for too long.

295
00:15:45,693 --> 00:15:46,725
I can’t hold it in any longer.

296
00:15:59,345 --> 00:16:00,285
Fews.

297
00:16:00,862 --> 00:16:01,966
What’s wrong?

298
00:16:01,966 --> 00:16:03,415
Why are all the doors locked?

299
00:16:03,415 --> 00:16:04,720
I’m going to poop my pants any minute.

300
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,664
Miss.

301
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,022
The water is not running.

302
00:16:08,022 --> 00:16:09,180
So the cleaner locked the doors.

303
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,747
I’ll call the cleaner.

304
00:16:15,931 --> 00:16:16,814
Hey.

305
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,563
The nearest bathroom is 20 minutes away.

306
00:16:19,563 --> 00:16:21,181
I would have pooped when we got there.

307
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,828
I’ll do it here.

308
00:16:22,828 --> 00:16:23,680
No.

309
00:16:24,305 --> 00:16:25,370
Stop it, bitch.

310
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,018
Come with me. I’ll take you to the bathroom.

311
00:16:27,018 --> 00:16:28,612
I’ll count to three. Then walk with me.

312
00:16:28,804 --> 00:16:29,323
One.

313
00:16:29,876 --> 00:16:30,579
Two.

314
00:16:31,108 --> 00:16:32,182
Three. Let’s go.

315
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,682
Who is this?

316
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:43,961
Ingky?

317
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,266
I feel strange.

318
00:16:48,819 --> 00:16:51,803
Have you informed your staff about my allergy?

319
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,360
Miss, did they put vinegar in the food?

320
00:16:58,442 --> 00:17:00,637
They usually don’t use vinegar in their recipes.

321
00:17:00,998 --> 00:17:04,470
But I forgot that they have a new chef today.

322
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,949
Where is your med?

323
00:17:08,969 --> 00:17:09,795
Give it to me.

324
00:17:11,438 --> 00:17:12,689
Idiot.

325
00:17:12,689 --> 00:17:14,535
Why didn’t you bring your meds?

326
00:17:14,535 --> 00:17:17,750
Miss, get me a car.

327
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,487
I need to take my friend to the hospital.

328
00:17:19,487 --> 00:17:20,722
Hurry up.

329
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:22,275
Ingky, turn around.

330
00:17:22,275 --> 00:17:23,261
I don’t want to see it.

331
00:17:23,261 --> 00:17:24,707
You look pretty now.

332
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,952
Fews, go.

333
00:17:27,361 --> 00:17:28,536
Go.

334
00:17:29,642 --> 00:17:31,499
Fews, how are you?

335
00:17:31,716 --> 00:17:32,677
Open the door.

336
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:33,918
Where is the driver?

337
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,985
He just left with the cleaner.

338
00:17:35,985 --> 00:17:37,854
I’ll go get a taxi. I’ll be right back.

339
00:17:39,249 --> 00:17:41,129
Nevia, wait.

340
00:17:41,129 --> 00:17:42,021
What, bitch?

341
00:17:53,231 --> 00:17:55,817
Fews, I called the cleaner.

342
00:17:55,817 --> 00:17:57,103
She is hurrying back.

343
00:17:57,103 --> 00:17:58,126
No need for it.

344
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,940
We are here to apologize to you.

345
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:14,416
You need to learn your lesson.

346
00:18:15,859 --> 00:18:18,738
No, I don’t want to smell it again.

347
00:18:45,316 --> 00:18:48,329
We are here to apologize to you.

348
00:18:52,153 --> 00:18:53,261
Do it.

349
00:19:08,038 --> 00:19:10,080
Ouch, it hurts.

350
00:19:12,792 --> 00:19:14,685
The flower is beautiful.

351
00:19:17,071 --> 00:19:18,813
It smells good.

352
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,229
You will lift the curse on us, won’t you?

353
00:19:29,712 --> 00:19:30,638
No, not yet.

354
00:19:33,579 --> 00:19:34,783
Because…

355
00:19:38,704 --> 00:19:41,161
People like you,

356
00:19:42,141 --> 00:19:42,763
you,

357
00:19:43,547 --> 00:19:44,632
and you,

358
00:19:46,201 --> 00:19:48,324
You need to learn your lesson.

359
00:19:54,715 --> 00:19:59,846
The three of you will be serving me

360
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:02,897
until I feel satisfied.

361
00:20:07,015 --> 00:20:08,484
How do you want us to serve you?

362
00:20:12,101 --> 00:20:14,694
No, I don’t want to smell it again.

363
00:20:14,808 --> 00:20:15,569
Idiot.

364
00:20:16,468 --> 00:20:17,911
I point that way.

365
00:20:18,238 --> 00:20:19,065
There.

366
00:20:23,183 --> 00:20:23,939
Go.

367
00:20:24,184 --> 00:20:24,802
Yes.

368
00:20:28,464 --> 00:20:31,028
Stop crying. Hurry and clean it up.

369
00:20:43,544 --> 00:20:44,228
Go.

370
00:20:45,664 --> 00:20:46,517
Hurry up.

371
00:20:48,886 --> 00:20:50,074
That’s not my style.

372
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:51,591
Idiot.

373
00:20:54,075 --> 00:20:55,520
Can you press harder?

374
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:10,705
Oh, P’Pat.

375
00:21:14,405 --> 00:21:16,924
P’Kat, why are you here alone?

376
00:21:18,231 --> 00:21:19,841
I came to see you.

377
00:21:23,305 --> 00:21:25,480
P’Pat, don’t look at them.

378
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:25,980
What?

379
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:26,602
Come with me.

380
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:27,727
What about them?

381
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,680
Don’t pay attention to them.

382
00:21:45,664 --> 00:21:47,358
I can’t take this shit anymore.

383
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,699
Girls.

384
00:21:50,222 --> 00:21:53,001
The penalty for a homicide
is 20 years of imprisonment.

385
00:21:53,148 --> 00:21:54,752
That’s quite a long time.

386
00:21:55,664 --> 00:21:56,773
I can’t take it anymore.

387
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:58,694
I want to stab her with this toothbrush.

388
00:21:59,429 --> 00:22:00,653
Calm down, Fews.

389
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,340
You can’t let Kat hear that.

390
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:04,566
She is right outside.

391
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,011
She will curse us again.

392
00:22:06,011 --> 00:22:07,467
I don’t want to get swollen lips again.

393
00:22:08,447 --> 00:22:10,062
There’s no way she will hear it.

394
00:22:10,274 --> 00:22:11,884
She turns on the music that loud.

395
00:22:12,113 --> 00:22:15,510
I wouldn’t be surprised
if she lost her hearing.

396
00:22:17,487 --> 00:22:17,987
See?

397
00:22:18,232 --> 00:22:19,073
She didn’t hear it.

398
00:22:21,949 --> 00:22:22,810
Whatever.

399
00:22:23,872 --> 00:22:24,850
Let’s endure it for the meantime.

400
00:22:26,238 --> 00:22:27,621
I think there will be a day

401
00:22:28,405 --> 00:22:29,446
that we can avenge her.

402
00:22:29,624 --> 00:22:31,021
When will that day come?

403
00:22:31,021 --> 00:22:32,224
Why are you yelling, brat?

404
00:22:32,861 --> 00:22:34,094
She can’t hear it anyway.

405
00:22:34,094 --> 00:22:35,550
Stop yelling, both of you.

406
00:22:36,726 --> 00:22:37,630
One day.

407
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:39,704
One day.

408
00:22:41,504 --> 00:22:42,736
Girls.

409
00:22:43,618 --> 00:22:44,413
I’m hungry.

410
00:22:45,099 --> 00:22:46,363
Go buy me my usual.

411
00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:48,579
Ingky.

412
00:22:49,837 --> 00:22:50,737
Go buy Daifuku.

413
00:22:51,276 --> 00:22:53,264
Fews, go buy a matcha drink.

414
00:22:53,771 --> 00:22:55,591
I’ll buy ice cream.

415
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,473
Nevia, what are you doing?

416
00:23:35,565 --> 00:23:36,173
Lower your voice.

417
00:23:36,892 --> 00:23:39,682
I saw P’Med sneaking into Kat’s room.

418
00:23:41,578 --> 00:23:42,272
She’s here.

419
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,028
Get up.

420
00:23:50,374 --> 00:23:51,101
What?

421
00:23:56,216 --> 00:23:57,657
You don’t need to whisper.

422
00:23:57,657 --> 00:23:58,670
No one will hear us.

423
00:24:00,484 --> 00:24:05,163
I’m telling you about the three magical items
that will help you take over her body.

424
00:24:05,304 --> 00:24:06,062
Huh?

425
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:09,695
Who is there?

426
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:12,944
Meow.

427
00:24:13,875 --> 00:24:15,653
Meow.

428
00:24:15,653 --> 00:24:18,001
Meow.

429
00:24:20,893 --> 00:24:22,195
Are there many stray cats around here?

430
00:24:24,516 --> 00:24:25,208
No.

431
00:24:25,894 --> 00:24:26,948
I only saw a mouse.

432
00:24:30,281 --> 00:24:33,569
Squeak…eek…eek.

433
00:24:34,353 --> 00:24:35,655
It’s a hamster.

434
00:24:39,527 --> 00:24:41,470
Doo…do…doo

435
00:24:42,116 --> 00:24:44,308
What kind of hamsters make that sound?

436
00:24:46,988 --> 00:24:48,033
It’s probably nothing.

437
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,085
The thing that you were saying earlier.

438
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:52,078
What is it?

439
00:24:52,503 --> 00:24:54,968
According to the Yajurveda,

440
00:24:55,540 --> 00:25:00,362
we need to find three lost magical items.

441
00:25:00,664 --> 00:25:05,054
They will help you
take over Kat’s body permanently.

442
00:25:12,517 --> 00:25:13,136
Girls.

443
00:25:13,822 --> 00:25:15,086
What should we do?

444
00:25:16,262 --> 00:25:18,173
If she takes over Kat’s body permanently,

445
00:25:18,353 --> 00:25:20,640
then we will be her servants forever.

446
00:25:22,846 --> 00:25:26,069
We need to find a shaman to get rid of her.

447
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:28,193
How will you get rid of her?

448
00:25:28,503 --> 00:25:30,522
I’m not even sure
if the goddess is a ghost or not.

449
00:25:31,192 --> 00:25:32,636
She’s some kind of spirit anyway.

450
00:25:33,257 --> 00:25:35,219
We can try.

451
00:25:35,824 --> 00:25:37,169
But the main problem is

452
00:25:37,496 --> 00:25:39,207
how we are going to take Kat with us.

453
00:25:41,315 --> 00:25:42,266
I think…

454
00:25:43,132 --> 00:25:44,506
I have an idea.

455
00:25:51,952 --> 00:25:52,790
Who is it?

456
00:25:53,607 --> 00:25:54,904
How dare you interrupt my pleasure?

457
00:25:56,464 --> 00:25:57,751
So annoying.

458
00:26:02,963 --> 00:26:04,464
What the hell are you wearing?

459
00:26:05,918 --> 00:26:06,658
Wait.

460
00:26:06,658 --> 00:26:07,713
What are you doing?

461
00:26:09,037 --> 00:26:09,639
Ouch.

462
00:26:10,407 --> 00:26:11,766
Don’t forget your promise.

463
00:26:13,286 --> 00:26:14,801
Alright, I won’t forget it.

464
00:26:15,013 --> 00:26:17,060
I’ll be your servant for three days.

465
00:26:19,429 --> 00:26:20,237
What the heck is that?

466
00:26:20,368 --> 00:26:21,119
Seven days.

467
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:23,955
Seven days.

468
00:26:24,364 --> 00:26:25,073
Yeah.

469
00:26:28,831 --> 00:26:29,955
Did you tie her tightly?

470
00:26:30,282 --> 00:26:31,994
Yes, take a look for yourself.

471
00:26:32,223 --> 00:26:33,085
Then…

472
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:36,681
Let me teach you a lesson.

473
00:26:36,681 --> 00:26:37,655
Nevia.

474
00:26:38,652 --> 00:26:40,743
I won’t let you get away with it.

475
00:26:40,743 --> 00:26:41,553
Eat this.

476
00:26:41,652 --> 00:26:42,290
Asshole.

477
00:26:43,106 --> 00:26:43,957
Scumbag.

478
00:26:43,957 --> 00:26:45,091
Stop it, bitch.

479
00:26:46,184 --> 00:26:48,236
I will no longer be your servant.

480
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:52,058
Kat could die.

481
00:26:52,058 --> 00:26:53,808
I’ll leave her body.

482
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,213
Asshole.

483
00:27:12,144 --> 00:27:12,826
Let me go.

484
00:27:14,265 --> 00:27:16,011
Let me go.

485
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:22,659
Let me go.

486
00:27:22,894 --> 00:27:23,893
Stop it.

487
00:27:34,001 --> 00:27:35,380
Hello, P’Pat.

488
00:27:36,455 --> 00:27:38,490
Your content is always grand.

489
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:39,500
Yeah.

490
00:27:40,666 --> 00:27:41,699
How did he get here?

491
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:43,644
I posted an IG story
saying I was going to see a shaman.

492
00:27:43,644 --> 00:27:45,009
So he asked if he could come with me.

493
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:45,912
Hey!

494
00:27:47,223 --> 00:27:49,054
Haven’t you learned your lesson?

495
00:27:50,274 --> 00:27:52,844
Do you think I don’t know who kicked me?

496
00:27:52,844 --> 00:27:54,382
Especially the one with short legs.

497
00:27:55,019 --> 00:27:56,438
You kicked me non-stop.

498
00:27:57,185 --> 00:27:59,572
Read the room, you damn goddess.

499
00:28:00,118 --> 00:28:02,462
Today, what happens, happens.

500
00:28:03,045 --> 00:28:05,118
I will no longer be your servant.

501
00:28:07,631 --> 00:28:09,945
Make some noise.

502
00:28:20,707 --> 00:28:22,553
MASTER GOK, THE ROCK SHAMAN.

503
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,645
Ingky, what the hell is this?

504
00:28:25,645 --> 00:28:26,727
I don’t know.

505
00:28:27,182 --> 00:28:30,281
But he’s the most famous shaman
on social media.

506
00:28:30,281 --> 00:28:30,958
Idiot.

507
00:28:31,796 --> 00:28:33,433
He looks like a joke.

508
00:28:36,056 --> 00:28:38,822
Hey, is this the evil spirit

509
00:28:39,011 --> 00:28:41,355
that you want me, Master Gok,

510
00:28:41,611 --> 00:28:45,026
the rock shaman, to get rid of?

511
00:28:46,265 --> 00:28:47,589
She’s not a spirit.

512
00:28:48,008 --> 00:28:49,312
She’s a goddess.

513
00:28:49,312 --> 00:28:50,021
What goddess?

514
00:28:50,021 --> 00:28:50,887
Dalop.

515
00:28:51,069 --> 00:28:52,262
Goddess Dalop?

516
00:28:53,411 --> 00:28:55,889
Do you want me
to dump her in a river or what?

517
00:28:56,144 --> 00:28:56,982
I’m fine with that.

518
00:28:56,982 --> 00:28:59,103
Do you want me to trap her
in a clay pot or a stainless steel pot?

519
00:28:59,103 --> 00:28:59,850
A clay pot.

520
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:02,255
What guitar effect do you want?

521
00:29:02,419 --> 00:29:04,667
Anything is fine. You just pick one.

522
00:29:04,977 --> 00:29:07,852
Overdrive.

523
00:29:17,567 --> 00:29:18,852
When will you start?

524
00:29:28,062 --> 00:29:30,565
This bitchy spirit, you’ll regret it.

525
00:29:30,565 --> 00:29:32,779
What kind of shaman
plays the guitar to perform exorcism?

526
00:29:32,779 --> 00:29:34,636
You are cultureless.

527
00:29:34,873 --> 00:29:37,948
Music will control and subdue your spirit.

528
00:29:38,221 --> 00:29:40,349
A fake goddess like you
knows nothing about it.

529
00:29:40,731 --> 00:29:41,829
Fake goddess?

530
00:29:42,175 --> 00:29:45,178
I have granted wishes
to thousands of thousands of my followers.

531
00:29:45,178 --> 00:29:46,612
You can fight against me.

532
00:29:46,867 --> 00:29:49,002
I’ve been growing my spiritual power
for 500 years.

533
00:29:49,603 --> 00:29:50,353
I’ve been doing that for 1,000 years.

534
00:29:50,353 --> 00:29:51,923
I’ve been doing it for 2,000 years.

535
00:29:51,923 --> 00:29:52,639
I’ve been doing it for 3,000 years.

536
00:29:52,639 --> 00:29:53,466
I’ve been doing it for 4,000 years.

537
00:29:54,158 --> 00:29:56,091
The guitar wasn’t invented 2,000 years ago.

538
00:29:56,091 --> 00:29:56,712
Why are you so dumb?

539
00:29:56,712 --> 00:29:57,545
I played the hammered dulcimer back then.

540
00:29:57,651 --> 00:29:58,327
Idiot.

541
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,131
Goddess.

542
00:30:00,623 --> 00:30:01,835
Do you have the vanishing power?

543
00:30:01,835 --> 00:30:02,749
I want to be your follower.

544
00:30:02,749 --> 00:30:05,116
My power is only for girls, idiot.

545
00:30:05,116 --> 00:30:05,824
Dang it.

546
00:30:08,174 --> 00:30:08,826
Hey.

547
00:30:09,008 --> 00:30:09,892
Shut up.

548
00:30:10,293 --> 00:30:10,984
No.

549
00:30:11,257 --> 00:30:13,945
I’m just going to ask when you will start.

550
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:14,924
Let’s get it started.

551
00:30:57,079 --> 00:30:58,037
How was it?

552
00:30:58,037 --> 00:30:58,912
Did it come out?

553
00:30:58,912 --> 00:30:59,446
Yes.

554
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:02,065
My pee came out.

555
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:03,598
Shit.

556
00:31:03,731 --> 00:31:06,148
Fine, brace yourself
for my ancient sorcery ritual.

557
00:31:06,348 --> 00:31:08,225
Guys, let’s begin the ritual.

558
00:31:11,933 --> 00:31:13,395
He puts the thread around her.

559
00:31:17,092 --> 00:31:20,474
This rattan cane has been passed down
for several centuries.

560
00:31:20,571 --> 00:31:21,538
It is used for punishment.

561
00:31:21,538 --> 00:31:22,860
I think he’s going to hit her for real.

562
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:24,018
I’ll hit you with it.

563
00:31:24,018 --> 00:31:26,350
I’ll give you ten seconds.

564
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:29,658
One.

565
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:31,492
Two.

566
00:31:31,492 --> 00:31:32,075
Ten.

567
00:31:32,075 --> 00:31:32,616
What?

568
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:33,582
Ouch.

569
00:31:34,037 --> 00:31:34,948
Ouch.

570
00:31:35,895 --> 00:31:36,597
Ouch.

571
00:31:38,327 --> 00:31:39,175
Ouch.

572
00:31:39,394 --> 00:31:41,904
Ouch.

573
00:31:42,615 --> 00:31:43,457
Ouch.

574
00:31:43,457 --> 00:31:43,986
Good.

575
00:31:43,986 --> 00:31:44,487
Great.

576
00:31:44,487 --> 00:31:45,144
I like it.

577
00:31:45,144 --> 00:31:47,679
Ouch.

578
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:48,674
Eww.

579
00:31:54,891 --> 00:31:56,896
Asshole, your mouth stinks.

580
00:31:58,411 --> 00:31:59,156
Don’t do it.

581
00:31:59,302 --> 00:32:01,219
Crux sacra…

582
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:02,870
…sit mihi lux. Vade retro Satana.

583
00:32:03,854 --> 00:32:04,511
Bitch.

584
00:32:20,624 --> 00:32:21,726
A sword?

585
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:32,689
Does he need to go this far?

586
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:35,038
Kat could die.

587
00:32:35,038 --> 00:32:36,335
He won’t stab her for real.

588
00:32:36,335 --> 00:32:37,251
I will.

589
00:32:40,876 --> 00:32:41,971
Oh my goodness!

590
00:32:43,138 --> 00:32:44,826
This time, it’s you.

591
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:47,584
No.

592
00:32:47,584 --> 00:32:48,480
Stop it.

593
00:32:49,451 --> 00:32:51,444
Just to get rid of the spirit,
do you really need to kill her?

594
00:32:51,444 --> 00:32:52,626
It’s no longer about exorcism.

595
00:32:52,626 --> 00:32:54,665
It’s about me and this brat.

596
00:32:55,211 --> 00:32:56,386
You need to learn your lesson.

597
00:32:57,325 --> 00:32:58,961
Guys, take them away.

598
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:01,637
Hey.

599
00:33:01,637 --> 00:33:02,641
Let me go.

600
00:33:05,373 --> 00:33:06,352
Wait, wait.

601
00:33:06,861 --> 00:33:07,536
Hold on.

602
00:33:08,046 --> 00:33:10,370
I’ll leave her body.

603
00:33:10,643 --> 00:33:11,609
I’ll leave her body.

604
00:33:12,082 --> 00:33:13,263
I don’t care.

605
00:33:16,502 --> 00:33:17,174
Kat!

606
00:34:02,531 --> 00:34:03,182
Hey.

607
00:34:03,662 --> 00:34:04,842
Give the sword to me.

608
00:34:04,969 --> 00:34:05,517
No.

609
00:34:10,825 --> 00:34:12,112
Give it to me.

610
00:34:16,392 --> 00:34:17,311
Give it to me.

611
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:21,133
Give it to me.

612
00:34:21,424 --> 00:34:22,443
Don’t do it.

613
00:34:27,814 --> 00:34:29,569
The goddess is really powerful.

614
00:34:31,299 --> 00:34:31,868
What?

615
00:34:40,410 --> 00:34:41,298
You are a dumbass.

616
00:34:41,735 --> 00:34:43,983
You helped me get the first magical item.

617
00:34:45,203 --> 00:34:47,896
What a crazy coincidence!

618
00:34:49,517 --> 00:34:52,413
I’m leaving, idiots!

619
00:34:55,726 --> 00:34:56,580
I’m leaving.

620
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:58,267
What are you waiting for?

621
00:34:58,358 --> 00:34:59,465
Catch them.

622
00:34:59,866 --> 00:35:02,543
Catch them. Don’t let them get away.

623
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:04,591
Hey.

624
00:35:04,591 --> 00:35:05,382
Where are they going?

625
00:35:06,111 --> 00:35:07,059
Catch them.

626
00:35:12,728 --> 00:35:13,751
Stop.

627
00:35:16,926 --> 00:35:17,494
Shit.

628
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:19,776
I don’t think they are following us.

629
00:35:20,978 --> 00:35:22,097
What happened to P’Kat?

630
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:28,560
Let’s go in.

631
00:35:28,706 --> 00:35:32,033
At first, we prayed to a higher power for help.

632
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:34,476
Because we wanted to have better lives.

633
00:35:35,623 --> 00:35:36,347
I’m…

634
00:35:36,611 --> 00:35:37,312
the…

635
00:35:37,603 --> 00:35:38,376
…goddess

636
00:35:38,376 --> 00:35:41,370
Your lives will be full of misfortunes.

637
00:35:41,651 --> 00:35:42,280
But right now,

638
00:35:43,191 --> 00:35:47,708
the goddess is ruining our lives.

639
00:35:49,402 --> 00:35:51,773
We shouldn’t have asked
the higher power for help.

640
00:35:52,848 --> 00:35:55,962
If the goddess has all three magical items,

641
00:35:57,784 --> 00:35:59,291
Kat’s soul will be gone?

642
00:36:03,517 --> 00:36:05,051
You are going to help her, aren’t you?

643
00:36:08,584 --> 00:36:09,876
We should, I guess.

644
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:10,847
We will.

645
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:12,726
What is the next magical item?

646
00:36:15,549 --> 00:36:18,089
I think it will be a crown.

647
00:36:18,526 --> 00:36:19,285
Huh?

648
00:36:40,417 --> 00:36:42,020
THE SWORD OF GODDESS DALOP.

649
00:36:43,805 --> 00:36:45,451
BODICE OF GODDESS DALOP.

650
00:36:50,423 --> 00:36:55,879
We’re back with the 7th Miss Golden Flower.

651
00:36:56,917 --> 00:36:57,678
EDITH PROOF.

652
00:36:57,678 --> 00:36:58,940
As in the previous years,

653
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:02,354
this is our gorgeous crown.

654
00:37:03,027 --> 00:37:09,154
It has been passed down for centuries
from our goddess.

655
00:37:09,883 --> 00:37:12,410
This is Goddess Dalop’s crown.

656
00:37:13,451 --> 00:37:16,435
In short, we need to get this crown, right?

657
00:37:17,856 --> 00:37:18,914
Yes.

658
00:37:25,051 --> 00:37:25,927
You are such a loser.

659
00:37:27,657 --> 00:37:29,657
I don’t want to do it anymore.

660
00:37:29,784 --> 00:37:32,255
Why are you so afraid of the pageant?

661
00:37:32,474 --> 00:37:33,873
Kat is really joining the pageant.

662
00:37:33,873 --> 00:37:35,306
We have to stop her.

663
00:37:46,692 --> 00:37:49,710
1 YEAR AGO.

664
00:38:01,934 --> 00:38:03,158
What kind of beauty pageant is this?

665
00:38:03,513 --> 00:38:04,743
It’s ridiculous.

666
00:38:04,969 --> 00:38:06,782
The crown looks stunning.

667
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:10,911
Quiet.

668
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:12,624
They are about to announce the winner.

669
00:38:12,689 --> 00:38:15,962
The winner is…

670
00:38:19,657 --> 00:38:21,227
The winner is…

671
00:38:24,521 --> 00:38:25,585
No one.

672
00:38:26,328 --> 00:38:27,106
What?

673
00:38:27,558 --> 00:38:29,070
None of the contestants is good enough.

674
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:30,321
The finalists are not good.

675
00:38:30,563 --> 00:38:32,812
Our crown is very picky about its owner.

676
00:38:32,812 --> 00:38:36,829
See you next year.

677
00:38:54,548 --> 00:38:59,420
So this crown is the goddess’s second item?

678
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:04,494
That’s why no one won the crown
in the past two years.

679
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:06,615
They need to give it to someone this year.

680
00:39:07,083 --> 00:39:08,326
Otherwise, this pageant will be so bullshit.

681
00:39:08,827 --> 00:39:10,094
They hold the contest for three years.

682
00:39:10,094 --> 00:39:11,544
But there is no winner.

683
00:39:12,254 --> 00:39:12,924
What if…

684
00:39:13,812 --> 00:39:15,056
Kat gets the crown?

685
00:39:16,041 --> 00:39:17,011
It’s unlikely.

686
00:39:18,011 --> 00:39:20,134
Their security is super tight.

687
00:39:20,521 --> 00:39:22,298
They won’t let anyone steal it easily.

688
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:24,285
I’m not saying that she will steal it.

689
00:39:25,108 --> 00:39:27,461
What if she wins the contest?

690
00:39:30,074 --> 00:39:30,755
Win?

691
00:39:35,083 --> 00:39:35,718
Are you crazy?

692
00:39:35,718 --> 00:39:37,427
Why are you laughing? I’m serious.

693
00:39:37,427 --> 00:39:38,140
Win?

694
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,205
That’s enough.

695
00:39:41,142 --> 00:39:42,389
You think she can win the contest?

696
00:39:42,841 --> 00:39:45,308
If you told me she would steal it,
it would be more believable, bitch.

697
00:39:45,308 --> 00:39:46,368
That’s right.

698
00:39:46,497 --> 00:39:48,064
You are worried over nothing.

699
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,519
What are we doing here?

700
00:40:01,165 --> 00:40:02,471
We are here to spy on Kat.

701
00:40:03,553 --> 00:40:05,196
If she’s going to steal the crown,

702
00:40:05,357 --> 00:40:06,534
she must have some kind of plan.

703
00:40:07,826 --> 00:40:08,849
(Are you resisting me?)

704
00:40:08,849 --> 00:40:10,417
(I don’t want to do it anymore.)

705
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:11,198
(I’m tired.)

706
00:40:11,311 --> 00:40:12,043
Listen.

707
00:40:12,721 --> 00:40:14,428
She’s talking to someone.

708
00:40:18,836 --> 00:40:19,895
I don’t want to do it anymore.

709
00:40:20,428 --> 00:40:21,250
I’m tired.

710
00:40:23,801 --> 00:40:24,555
Ouch.

711
00:40:25,508 --> 00:40:27,100
Goddess, why did you hit me?

712
00:40:27,278 --> 00:40:29,951
Thank you for hitting me.

713
00:40:33,843 --> 00:40:34,863
You are such a loser.

714
00:40:35,412 --> 00:40:37,017
You are so pathetic.

715
00:40:38,325 --> 00:40:39,015
Ouch.

716
00:40:41,421 --> 00:40:43,451
But I don’t want to do it anymore.

717
00:40:45,243 --> 00:40:45,933
Get up.

718
00:40:48,726 --> 00:40:49,412
Goddess.

719
00:40:49,735 --> 00:40:50,571
Don’t pull my hair.

720
00:40:53,604 --> 00:40:55,021
Should we step in and help her?

721
00:40:55,718 --> 00:40:56,219
Goddess.

722
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,539
I will never join it.

723
00:40:59,781 --> 00:41:01,284
Are you challenging me?

724
00:41:05,718 --> 00:41:07,006
I won’t do it.

725
00:41:07,135 --> 00:41:07,635
Fine.

726
00:41:08,071 --> 00:41:09,338
Then I’ll push you again.

727
00:41:09,742 --> 00:41:10,816
I’ll do it.

728
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:13,063
Goddess, please don’t push my head down.

729
00:41:13,063 --> 00:41:15,262
This is not enough for you.

730
00:41:16,477 --> 00:41:18,807
Goddess, I can’t breathe.

731
00:41:21,197 --> 00:41:21,823
Okay.

732
00:41:22,081 --> 00:41:23,836
I’ll join it.

733
00:41:24,143 --> 00:41:24,878
I don’t believe you.

734
00:41:27,494 --> 00:41:28,618
Let me go.

735
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:41,106
Girls.

736
00:41:41,493 --> 00:41:42,882
Kat is really joining the pageant.

737
00:41:44,497 --> 00:41:45,250
So?

738
00:41:45,573 --> 00:41:47,235
Then we need to join the pageant too.

739
00:41:47,542 --> 00:41:48,254
Why?

740
00:41:48,674 --> 00:41:50,555
I don’t think we need to worry about it.

741
00:41:51,136 --> 00:41:52,319
Look at her.

742
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:54,767
Even if she joins the pageant,
there’s no way she will win the crown.

743
00:41:55,171 --> 00:41:57,261
I’m not saying that she will win.

744
00:41:57,665 --> 00:42:01,364
What if she joins the pageant
to steal the crown?

745
00:42:01,622 --> 00:42:03,089
We have to stop her.

746
00:42:03,089 --> 00:42:06,384
Then we need to think about our chance
to win the contest.

747
00:42:06,788 --> 00:42:10,573
In the end, pageants always choose
the winner based on their beauty.

748
00:42:11,849 --> 00:42:15,169
I’m the one who should join the pageant.

749
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:19,031
Ing, are you sure
you can answer their question?

750
00:42:19,031 --> 00:42:21,406
The questions round of the contest are tough.

751
00:42:21,551 --> 00:42:25,487
Then I’ll volunteer to do it.

752
00:42:27,327 --> 00:42:29,433
It’s not the time
to compete against each other.

753
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,381
We need to think carefully.

754
00:42:32,043 --> 00:42:33,691
What is our goal?

755
00:42:33,691 --> 00:42:34,744
Think rationally.

756
00:42:34,889 --> 00:42:36,231
Our goal is to stop Kat.

757
00:42:36,651 --> 00:42:41,270
Then who is the best choice for this mission?

758
00:42:42,013 --> 00:42:42,912
Okay.

759
00:42:45,124 --> 00:42:45,924
Do you have the answer?

760
00:42:46,183 --> 00:42:46,683
Yes.

761
00:42:46,683 --> 00:42:47,404
Take your time to think.

762
00:42:47,517 --> 00:42:48,944
I’ll count to three,

763
00:42:49,025 --> 00:42:50,113
and we will say it at the same time.

764
00:42:50,718 --> 00:42:51,777
Sure.

765
00:42:52,116 --> 00:42:52,740
Okay?

766
00:42:54,791 --> 00:42:55,636
One.

767
00:42:56,233 --> 00:42:57,039
Two.

768
00:42:57,588 --> 00:42:58,318
Three.

769
00:42:58,835 --> 00:42:59,524
Me.

770
00:43:01,470 --> 00:43:02,920
I’m joking.

771
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:05,051
That’s a test round.

772
00:43:05,051 --> 00:43:07,787
A test round?

773
00:43:07,787 --> 00:43:09,137
This time, let’s do it seriously.

774
00:43:09,137 --> 00:43:09,642
Okay.

775
00:43:09,642 --> 00:43:10,142
Alright

776
00:43:10,142 --> 00:43:10,642
Come on.

777
00:43:10,642 --> 00:43:11,975
Okay, do you have the answer?

778
00:43:11,975 --> 00:43:12,650
Yes.

779
00:43:12,908 --> 00:43:14,430
I’ve carefully thought about it.

780
00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:15,039
Okay.

781
00:43:15,604 --> 00:43:16,276
One.

782
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:18,027
Two.

783
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:19,535
Three.

784
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:20,892
Me.

785
00:43:30,718 --> 00:43:33,234
Why are you so afraid of the pageant?

786
00:43:36,641 --> 00:43:41,420
Because the person
who most deserves to win the crown is…

787
00:43:43,099 --> 00:43:44,501
It’s me.

788
00:43:57,414 --> 00:43:58,206
Kat.

789
00:43:58,480 --> 00:43:59,360
What are you doing here?

790
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:01,377
Why can’t a goddess like me join the pageant?

791
00:44:03,201 --> 00:44:05,491
We need to do everything
to help me pass into the next round.

792
00:44:05,491 --> 00:44:07,334
Gosh, I’m done.

793
00:44:07,641 --> 00:44:09,454
You only think about yourself.

794
00:44:09,454 --> 00:44:12,004
We will no longer follow your orders.

795
00:44:12,101 --> 00:44:13,518
Ingky, you will pair up with me, right?

796
00:44:13,518 --> 00:44:16,563
Don’t you want to have new partners?

797
00:44:17,387 --> 00:44:18,505
My friends need me.

798
00:44:18,505 --> 00:44:20,446
Between the power I can give you

799
00:44:20,446 --> 00:44:22,443
and your stupid friendship,

800
00:44:22,443 --> 00:44:23,327
what will you choose?

801
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:24,524
The goddess was right.

802
00:44:24,524 --> 00:44:26,960
They are no longer my friends.
