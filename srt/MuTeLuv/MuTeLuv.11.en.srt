Viewer discretion is advised.

4
00:00:13,036 --> 00:00:15,992
We need to find three lost magical items.

5
00:00:15,992 --> 00:00:20,329
They will help you
take over Kat’s body permanently.

6
00:00:20,463 --> 00:00:22,393
We need to find a shaman to get rid of her.

7
00:00:29,915 --> 00:00:30,961
You are a dumbass.

8
00:00:30,961 --> 00:00:33,206
You helped me get the first magical item.

9
00:00:33,206 --> 00:00:34,978
What is the next magical item?

10
00:00:34,978 --> 00:00:38,440
This is Goddess Dalop’s crown.

11
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,209
We need to get this crown, right?

12
00:00:40,209 --> 00:00:41,340
Yes.

13
00:01:03,558 --> 00:01:04,466
Hello.

14
00:01:04,755 --> 00:01:05,906
Excuse me.

15
00:01:05,906 --> 00:01:07,851
Where can I get an application form?

16
00:01:10,318 --> 00:01:13,093
You need to prepare an application form yourself.

17
00:01:16,707 --> 00:01:17,207
What?

18
00:01:17,839 --> 00:01:19,439
Hi.

19
00:01:19,707 --> 00:01:21,477
This is my form.

20
00:01:21,993 --> 00:01:24,231
I can speak many languages.

21
00:01:24,231 --> 00:01:26,546
So I filled in the form in five languages.

22
00:01:28,135 --> 00:01:31,083
Oh, Ingky.

23
00:01:31,772 --> 00:01:33,726
Are you also joining the contest?

24
00:01:34,262 --> 00:01:35,329
You are also here.

25
00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:38,277
Don’t you know
you need to bring your own application form?

26
00:01:38,277 --> 00:01:39,502
Where is your application form?

27
00:01:39,846 --> 00:01:41,004
You don’t have one?

28
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:45,028
You don’t know
you need to bring your own application form.

29
00:01:45,946 --> 00:01:47,398
What are you going to do?

30
00:01:48,335 --> 00:01:50,244
I guess you would have to go home.

31
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:58,497
You are right.

32
00:01:59,885 --> 00:02:01,668
Do I really need to go home?

33
00:02:02,758 --> 00:02:06,248
Because I forgot to print out my application form.

34
00:02:06,764 --> 00:02:08,976
I made a small mistake.

35
00:02:08,976 --> 00:02:11,213
It never happened before.

36
00:02:13,144 --> 00:02:14,251
It’s okay.

37
00:02:14,251 --> 00:02:15,458
You can use this one.

38
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:16,590
Just fill in the form in Thai.

39
00:02:17,814 --> 00:02:18,546
What?

40
00:02:36,863 --> 00:02:38,823
One, two, three.

41
00:02:56,785 --> 00:02:57,659
Hello.

42
00:02:59,132 --> 00:03:01,854
Hey, Fews and Ingky.

43
00:03:01,854 --> 00:03:03,313
I didn’t know you would be here.

44
00:03:03,313 --> 00:03:04,514
Yes, I’m here.

45
00:03:04,648 --> 00:03:06,942
But you can go home now.

46
00:03:06,942 --> 00:03:08,341
Because I’m here.

47
00:03:09,393 --> 00:03:10,534
Don’t be overconfident.

48
00:03:10,668 --> 00:03:11,848
What’s wrong with you?

49
00:03:11,848 --> 00:03:13,336
Why do you need to bring those guys with you?

50
00:03:13,642 --> 00:03:15,488
This is a beauty pageant.

51
00:03:15,718 --> 00:03:17,882
It’s not a boxing tournament.

52
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:22,032
They probably came to
cheer on the head of their fight club.

53
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:29,326
Your laugh is so ugly.

54
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,142
I guess you don’t know that

55
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:34,497
the contest has a popular vote award.

56
00:03:34,688 --> 00:03:36,120
The winner is chosen
based on how loud the cheering is.

57
00:03:44,821 --> 00:03:45,848
Don’t be ridiculous.

58
00:03:45,848 --> 00:03:47,530
There’s no such award.

59
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:48,457
You are making it up.

60
00:03:48,457 --> 00:03:48,987
That’s right.

61
00:03:48,987 --> 00:03:50,668
Who would fall for your guy shills?

62
00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:54,197
I got this info from a secret insider.

63
00:03:55,593 --> 00:03:59,362
You can never beat me on strategic planning.

64
00:04:05,441 --> 00:04:06,421
Where is Kat?

65
00:04:07,263 --> 00:04:08,712
I want to mock her, too.

66
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,255
That’s right.

67
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:29,075
Who is calling?

68
00:04:34,097 --> 00:04:34,837
Hello.

69
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,139
Hello, Kat.

70
00:04:36,426 --> 00:04:37,431
Where are you?

71
00:04:37,565 --> 00:04:38,461
I’m in my room.

72
00:04:38,882 --> 00:04:41,206
What are you doing?

73
00:04:42,545 --> 00:04:43,903
I’m sleeping.

74
00:04:46,275 --> 00:04:47,019
Oh!

75
00:04:48,033 --> 00:04:50,665
Aren’t you joining the pageant?

76
00:04:50,971 --> 00:04:51,767
Pageant?

77
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:53,405
What pageant?

78
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:55,788
The MGF contest, bitch!

79
00:04:56,649 --> 00:04:57,241
Huh?

80
00:04:59,154 --> 00:05:00,321
Is it held today?

81
00:05:02,178 --> 00:05:02,783
Shit.

82
00:05:10,191 --> 00:05:10,958
Shit.

83
00:05:12,449 --> 00:05:13,199
My bag.

84
00:05:17,371 --> 00:05:18,340
Have I forgotten something?

85
00:06:21,175 --> 00:06:26,404
Miss Ingky, why do you join the MGF contest?

86
00:06:38,195 --> 00:06:41,211
Thank you for the question.

87
00:06:41,441 --> 00:06:46,545
Of course, I want to join the MGF contest.

88
00:06:46,717 --> 00:06:53,869
It’s the first pageant for LGBT people like me.

89
00:06:53,869 --> 00:06:55,690
The clock is ticking.

90
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:56,999
Please keep it concise.

91
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:59,831
I’m here to fulfill my dream,

92
00:06:59,831 --> 00:07:01,730
fulfill my heart,

93
00:07:01,902 --> 00:07:06,759
fulfill my love of doing something.

94
00:07:06,912 --> 00:07:11,785
I want to give inspiration to…

95
00:07:15,877 --> 00:07:17,604
Thank you.

96
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,384
What the heck is she saying?

97
00:07:23,614 --> 00:07:25,160
It’s so damn long.

98
00:07:25,739 --> 00:07:26,483
Gosh.

99
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:28,202
Bonjour.

100
00:07:28,202 --> 00:07:30,077
My name is Fews.

101
00:07:30,077 --> 00:07:33,334
I love French culture.

102
00:07:34,176 --> 00:07:36,692
You can speak French?

103
00:07:38,242 --> 00:07:41,654
How did you learn the language?

104
00:07:45,556 --> 00:07:47,387
I…

105
00:07:48,841 --> 00:07:50,513
I…

106
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:53,267
I…

107
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:54,912
Thank you.

108
00:08:07,054 --> 00:08:08,109
It’s not time yet, dumbass.

109
00:08:08,683 --> 00:08:10,060
Wait until I finish my speech.

110
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:13,360
I’m sorry.

111
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:22,574
Hello, I’m Nevia Pichapob Narawin.

112
00:08:34,344 --> 00:08:36,299
Are they here to start a brawl?

113
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,985
The next contestant is Miss Katrina.

114
00:08:45,955 --> 00:08:47,825
Miss Katrina.

115
00:08:49,145 --> 00:08:50,176
Are you here?

116
00:08:50,539 --> 00:08:51,765
Miss Katrina.

117
00:08:52,989 --> 00:08:54,221
She’s not here?

118
00:08:54,221 --> 00:08:56,745
Then we will eliminate her.

119
00:08:58,581 --> 00:08:59,314
Wait.

120
00:09:01,934 --> 00:09:03,031
I’m here.

121
00:09:15,457 --> 00:09:16,167
Kat.

122
00:09:24,024 --> 00:09:25,856
Did she fight with a dog or something?

123
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:28,174
Hello.

124
00:09:41,947 --> 00:09:43,024
Hello.

125
00:09:43,808 --> 00:09:45,036
I’m Katrina.

126
00:09:45,495 --> 00:09:47,237
Why do you join the contest?

127
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:52,720
Why do I join this contest?

128
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:54,691
I…

129
00:09:59,301 --> 00:10:01,521
I’m sorry. I was rushing to get here.

130
00:10:01,521 --> 00:10:02,809
I had an accident and got injured.

131
00:10:02,809 --> 00:10:03,996
My brain is still foggy.

132
00:10:18,009 --> 00:10:19,573
Time’s up.

133
00:10:20,204 --> 00:10:21,412
Please step down.

134
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:24,120
I won’t step down.

135
00:10:40,179 --> 00:10:42,397
Please step down.

136
00:10:42,397 --> 00:10:44,153
Your time is up. You need to step down.

137
00:10:44,153 --> 00:10:44,861
Shut up.

138
00:10:45,282 --> 00:10:46,156
I won’t step down.

139
00:10:51,357 --> 00:10:52,268
Security.

140
00:10:52,574 --> 00:10:54,216
Security, where are you?

141
00:10:54,216 --> 00:10:55,535
Get her down.

142
00:11:05,116 --> 00:11:06,265
Why are you doing nothing?

143
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:08,779
Go help him get her down.

144
00:11:27,068 --> 00:11:27,605
Kat.

145
00:11:28,102 --> 00:11:28,896
Why are you here?

146
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:31,139
Why can’t a goddess like me be here?

147
00:11:31,139 --> 00:11:32,791
Instead, we are holding a sports event?

148
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:34,296
If you are ready,

149
00:11:34,812 --> 00:11:35,811
start!

150
00:11:56,081 --> 00:11:58,469
ONE WEEK LATER.

151
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,428
Oh, oh, oh.

152
00:12:10,774 --> 00:12:12,600
Who is this?

153
00:12:12,784 --> 00:12:15,624
I can’t believe you got into this round.

154
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:19,606
Bitch, you don’t need to be surprised
that we got into this round.

155
00:12:19,975 --> 00:12:23,809
You should be surprised
that the brat got into this round.

156
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:31,817
Kat.

157
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:33,442
Why are you here?

158
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:37,159
Don’t you know
only contestants are allowed in here?

159
00:12:38,864 --> 00:12:40,685
Idiots.

160
00:12:41,008 --> 00:12:43,423
Why can’t a goddess like me be here?

161
00:12:43,866 --> 00:12:45,504
You are the ones who shouldn’t be here.

162
00:12:45,504 --> 00:12:47,353
Have you looked in the mirror lately?

163
00:12:48,805 --> 00:12:49,618
- Idiot!
- Dumbass!

164
00:12:50,915 --> 00:12:52,306
What a moron!

165
00:12:52,306 --> 00:12:53,729
You are so useless.

166
00:12:53,753 --> 00:12:58,353
I assigned you a simple task,
but you still failed to do it.

167
00:12:58,353 --> 00:12:59,345
You are freaking stupid.

168
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:00,297
You are freaking dumb.

169
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,844
Hello.

170
00:13:08,844 --> 00:13:11,154
Hello.

171
00:13:16,599 --> 00:13:18,826
Hello, everyone.

172
00:13:18,826 --> 00:13:27,372
I want to congratulate you all
for qualifying for the MGF contest.

173
00:13:32,306 --> 00:13:34,764
Do you know why you are qualified?

174
00:13:35,225 --> 00:13:36,573
Because I’m pretty.

175
00:13:36,573 --> 00:13:37,459
No.

176
00:13:38,934 --> 00:13:40,928
We need fifteen contestants.

177
00:13:40,928 --> 00:13:42,276
But there are only fourteen applicants.

178
00:13:42,276 --> 00:13:44,680
So you all are qualified for the contest.

179
00:13:47,483 --> 00:13:48,248
What?

180
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:51,156
We need fifteen contestants,
no matter what?

181
00:13:55,026 --> 00:13:56,001
Go.

182
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:59,349
Now, we have fifteen contestants.

183
00:14:00,951 --> 00:14:04,445
I’ll give you time to rest.

184
00:14:04,626 --> 00:14:06,661
I told you the good news.

185
00:14:06,661 --> 00:14:10,310
Now, I have bad news to inform you.

186
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:19,460
As you know, our pre-pageant event
will take place on a cruise.

187
00:14:23,426 --> 00:14:27,089
But because of the incompetence
of these dumbasses.

188
00:14:27,089 --> 00:14:28,796
They are useless idiots.

189
00:14:28,796 --> 00:14:30,483
They are dipshits.

190
00:14:30,622 --> 00:14:31,763
They screwed it up.

191
00:14:31,763 --> 00:14:33,419
I told them to book a yacht,

192
00:14:33,603 --> 00:14:34,957
but instead they booked a long-tailed boat.

193
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:35,923
Are you crazy?

194
00:14:36,914 --> 00:14:39,984
So we can’t hold the event on a cruise.

195
00:14:40,026 --> 00:14:41,277
It’s okay.

196
00:14:41,277 --> 00:14:45,846
Instead, we are holding a sports event
on the lawn.

197
00:14:45,846 --> 00:14:49,617
Please change your outfit into workout wear.

198
00:14:50,378 --> 00:14:52,219
You brought it with you, right?

199
00:14:52,472 --> 00:14:54,565
I’ll see you.

200
00:14:54,983 --> 00:14:56,006
Let’s go.

201
00:14:58,905 --> 00:15:01,714
I didn’t have workout wear. What do I do?

202
00:15:01,866 --> 00:15:04,606
Why didn’t you prepare it?

203
00:15:04,998 --> 00:15:06,395
Why? Do you have it?

204
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:09,072
Of course, I have outfits for all occasions.

205
00:15:09,072 --> 00:15:10,104
You guys.

206
00:15:11,325 --> 00:15:12,476
I need to talk to you.

207
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:13,957
Follow me.

208
00:15:15,506 --> 00:15:16,515
Now!

209
00:15:28,209 --> 00:15:31,121
If Kat passes into the next round,

210
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:33,403
she will get closer to the crown.

211
00:15:33,518 --> 00:15:37,806
I think we need to do everything
to help me pass into the next round.

212
00:15:38,474 --> 00:15:38,988
What?

213
00:15:39,656 --> 00:15:40,998
Why does it have to be you?

214
00:15:42,319 --> 00:15:43,469
Because I can win the crown.

215
00:15:43,866 --> 00:15:45,196
I’m doing this for us.

216
00:15:46,002 --> 00:15:47,074
For us?

217
00:15:47,904 --> 00:15:49,422
It’s for yourself.

218
00:15:49,422 --> 00:15:50,096
She’s right.

219
00:15:50,466 --> 00:15:52,288
Fews, you need to think rationally.

220
00:15:52,772 --> 00:15:56,241
I have the highest chance to win the crown.

221
00:15:56,241 --> 00:15:57,080
What?

222
00:15:57,541 --> 00:16:00,515
You want me to help you two
win the crown instead?

223
00:16:00,515 --> 00:16:01,586
Can you win it?

224
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:03,462
I can’t take it anymore.

225
00:16:03,739 --> 00:16:05,513
You only think of yourself.

226
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:07,898
Yeah. Fews is right.

227
00:16:08,266 --> 00:16:11,418
Nevia, have you ever cared about our feelings?

228
00:16:12,178 --> 00:16:13,192
From now on,

229
00:16:13,376 --> 00:16:15,977
we won’t follow your orders anymore.

230
00:16:16,576 --> 00:16:17,618
Let’s go, Ing.

231
00:16:37,589 --> 00:16:39,244
Nevia has done this so many times.

232
00:16:39,428 --> 00:16:40,502
She only thinks of herself.

233
00:16:40,663 --> 00:16:41,367
That’s true.

234
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:44,723
She’s never cared
about the people around her.

235
00:16:44,884 --> 00:16:46,691
We are her friends,

236
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:48,084
but she’s never cared about us.

237
00:16:48,084 --> 00:16:48,640
She’s selfish.

238
00:16:48,826 --> 00:16:49,444
She’s awful.

239
00:16:49,444 --> 00:16:50,118
She’s terrible.

240
00:16:50,118 --> 00:16:50,783
She’s evil.

241
00:16:50,783 --> 00:16:51,666
She thinks she’s so pretty.

242
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:52,608
She’s not pretty at all.

243
00:16:52,608 --> 00:16:53,257
Yeah.

244
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:54,887
This time,

245
00:16:55,095 --> 00:16:58,393
you and I will only help each other.

246
00:16:59,591 --> 00:17:00,308
Right?

247
00:17:10,151 --> 00:17:11,361
Right?

248
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:13,896
Where is my room?

249
00:17:37,661 --> 00:17:38,561
Brat.

250
00:17:38,861 --> 00:17:40,684
Didn’t you say
you brought no workout wear, Ingky?

251
00:17:44,255 --> 00:17:46,853
I searched my bag.

252
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:49,306
My house helper probably prepared it for me.

253
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,809
Excuse me, girls.

254
00:17:55,376 --> 00:17:56,855
What the hell are you waiting for?

255
00:17:57,685 --> 00:17:59,184
Why aren’t you pairing up?

256
00:17:59,184 --> 00:18:01,076
You will compete in a three-legged race.

257
00:18:01,076 --> 00:18:02,282
Can’t you tell from the track?

258
00:18:02,282 --> 00:18:03,219
Pair up.

259
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,228
Damn, Nevia.

260
00:18:08,758 --> 00:18:10,472
That brat walks around so full of herself.

261
00:18:11,094 --> 00:18:12,564
So freaking cocky.

262
00:18:12,794 --> 00:18:14,292
No one wants to be her friend.

263
00:18:14,476 --> 00:18:15,704
I’m not surprised.

264
00:18:16,372 --> 00:18:19,173
Trash always attracts trash.

265
00:18:20,417 --> 00:18:22,213
Ingky, you will pair up with me, right?

266
00:18:22,213 --> 00:18:22,866
Huh?

267
00:18:24,466 --> 00:18:25,342
Oh.

268
00:18:26,218 --> 00:18:27,115
Sure.

269
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:30,428
Don’t you want to…

270
00:18:30,612 --> 00:18:32,066
…pair up with a new friend?

271
00:18:34,578 --> 00:18:36,459
You want to pair up with a new friend?

272
00:18:36,805 --> 00:18:37,620
Fine.

273
00:18:38,012 --> 00:18:39,248
I don’t mind.

274
00:18:39,663 --> 00:18:40,444
Good.

275
00:18:40,628 --> 00:18:42,235
I don’t mind either.

276
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:44,974
If you want to do it, I’ll do it.

277
00:18:45,366 --> 00:18:46,509
It’s up to you.

278
00:19:02,893 --> 00:19:03,891
What are you looking at?

279
00:19:04,836 --> 00:19:06,582
Why? Do you want to pair up with me?

280
00:19:06,582 --> 00:19:07,750
Don’t be so full of yourself.

281
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,062
Today, I’m here to mock you.

282
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:13,720
Miss.

283
00:19:14,665 --> 00:19:15,815
Do you want to pair up with me?

284
00:19:17,889 --> 00:19:18,898
Then…

285
00:19:20,419 --> 00:19:21,474
P’Pailin.

286
00:19:21,474 --> 00:19:21,974
Yes.

287
00:19:22,343 --> 00:19:23,827
Do you want to pair up with me?

288
00:19:23,827 --> 00:19:24,327
Sure.

289
00:19:24,649 --> 00:19:29,327
Let’s show them
what good teamwork looks like.

290
00:19:30,197 --> 00:19:32,652
We don’t randomly pick our partner.

291
00:19:32,652 --> 00:19:35,156
Don’t rush to judge, Nevia.

292
00:19:35,548 --> 00:19:38,986
Reality will hit you when I beat you.

293
00:19:45,438 --> 00:19:46,422
So…

294
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:49,681
do you want to pair up with a new friend, Ingky?

295
00:19:49,866 --> 00:19:50,802
No.

296
00:19:51,954 --> 00:19:53,359
I’ll let you choose.

297
00:19:54,903 --> 00:19:57,710
But you seem to have a problem with it.

298
00:19:57,987 --> 00:19:59,563
Not more than you do.

299
00:20:01,946 --> 00:20:04,864
Do all of you have a partner?

300
00:20:09,838 --> 00:20:11,115
There’s one person left?

301
00:20:12,728 --> 00:20:13,796
Can I ask for real?

302
00:20:14,579 --> 00:20:15,529
You guys,

303
00:20:16,105 --> 00:20:21,794
can’t you complete a single job I assign you?

304
00:20:21,794 --> 00:20:25,120
Not even once?

305
00:20:26,364 --> 00:20:29,419
The three of you will be on the same team.

306
00:20:31,451 --> 00:20:32,870
So we can start.

307
00:20:34,783 --> 00:20:35,472
Oh.

308
00:20:36,555 --> 00:20:37,950
I guess we will be paired up.

309
00:20:47,488 --> 00:20:55,704
Girls, you probably wonder
what the chairs in the middle of the track are.

310
00:20:55,866 --> 00:20:59,619
It’s a challenge in this race.

311
00:20:59,746 --> 00:21:02,157
You need to overcome it.

312
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:10,016
You need to run three-legged
to the finish line beautifully.

313
00:21:10,984 --> 00:21:12,210
Are you ready?

314
00:21:14,652 --> 00:21:15,346
Ready?

315
00:21:17,066 --> 00:21:18,003
Ready?

316
00:21:19,201 --> 00:21:20,416
Yes.

317
00:21:20,831 --> 00:21:22,474
If you are ready,

318
00:21:25,866 --> 00:21:26,849
start!

319
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,618
One, two, one, two.

320
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,056
Watch your step.

321
00:21:41,167 --> 00:21:42,655
Can’t you follow my steps?

322
00:21:44,877 --> 00:21:45,377
What is this?

323
00:21:49,124 --> 00:21:50,513
Don’t be confused.

324
00:21:50,813 --> 00:21:52,932
Blow the powder and find marbles.

325
00:21:53,116 --> 00:21:54,163
Blow it.

326
00:22:00,256 --> 00:22:01,871
Do I really need to blow it?

327
00:22:11,871 --> 00:22:13,056
Blow it, brat.

328
00:22:14,037 --> 00:22:15,129
Now!

329
00:22:16,554 --> 00:22:17,250
Sit down.

330
00:22:33,906 --> 00:22:35,534
I’m out of breath.

331
00:22:35,534 --> 00:22:36,986
Can you help me find it?

332
00:22:36,986 --> 00:22:37,929
Do it yourself.

333
00:22:37,929 --> 00:22:39,089
Look at my face.

334
00:22:43,444 --> 00:22:44,639
I can’t…

335
00:22:47,819 --> 00:22:50,288
Go.

336
00:22:51,619 --> 00:22:52,707
Let’s go.

337
00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:58,663
What the heck?!

338
00:22:58,663 --> 00:22:59,841
Step over it.

339
00:23:03,504 --> 00:23:04,041
Bitch.

340
00:23:07,866 --> 00:23:08,519
Spit it on her.

341
00:23:13,626 --> 00:23:14,736
You lift her?

342
00:23:15,146 --> 00:23:15,674
Come here.

343
00:23:23,033 --> 00:23:24,278
You want to try me?

344
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:30,717
It hurts.

345
00:23:38,015 --> 00:23:39,134
It hurts.

346
00:23:39,531 --> 00:23:40,900
Good job.

347
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:43,127
We have the winner.

348
00:23:43,127 --> 00:23:45,577
It’s Katrina.

349
00:23:52,812 --> 00:23:55,797
Let’s go inside. It’s hot out here.

350
00:24:02,078 --> 00:24:04,902
Oh, oh, Nevia.

351
00:24:05,202 --> 00:24:07,148
Didn’t you say you would beat me?

352
00:24:07,632 --> 00:24:08,849
How does it turn out this way?

353
00:24:08,964 --> 00:24:11,047
With the way you cheat,
even a dog could win the race.

354
00:24:11,047 --> 00:24:13,874
If my partner were as petite as yours,
I would have won.

355
00:24:13,874 --> 00:24:15,983
What? How could you say that?

356
00:24:17,642 --> 00:24:19,225
I’m just telling the truth.

357
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:22,781
If you were a useful partner,
we would have won.

358
00:24:22,873 --> 00:24:24,835
Hey, don’t you think that is too much?

359
00:24:25,365 --> 00:24:26,792
I’m just telling the truth.

360
00:24:26,792 --> 00:24:28,467
I didn’t say bad things about her.

361
00:24:28,744 --> 00:24:34,738
Didn’t you see I found the marbles,
picked them up, and carried her by myself?

362
00:24:35,084 --> 00:24:37,117
I helped her get where we are.

363
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:42,928
Thank you so much for making me fall down.

364
00:24:42,928 --> 00:24:44,647
Otherwise, it would be too comfortable for me.

365
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,243
Do you think you were the sun?

366
00:24:47,381 --> 00:24:49,225
That’s why you think
everything revolves around you.

367
00:25:18,836 --> 00:25:20,136
It serves her right.

368
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:23,588
A dictator like her needs a lesson.

369
00:25:24,348 --> 00:25:27,803
I hope she finally stops being so full of herself.

370
00:25:28,494 --> 00:25:31,589
But it would be hard for a narcissist like her.

371
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,102
Fews.

372
00:25:35,609 --> 00:25:37,957
Can you stop badmouthing others for a minute?

373
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:44,999
I’m sick and tired of
listening to your negative attitudes.

374
00:25:45,967 --> 00:25:47,589
Especially when you talk about our friends.

375
00:25:47,935 --> 00:25:49,780
You know this is toxic.

376
00:25:50,033 --> 00:25:51,426
You should stop doing it.

377
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:52,543
I mean it.

378
00:25:53,096 --> 00:25:54,328
Are you criticizing me, Ing?

379
00:25:58,237 --> 00:25:59,007
Yes.

380
00:25:59,514 --> 00:26:06,780
I’m criticizing you for badmouthing others.

381
00:26:07,106 --> 00:26:10,626
Since I arrived here,
I haven’t seen you being nice to anyone.

382
00:26:10,787 --> 00:26:13,736
You are badmouthing others all the time.

383
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:17,050
Even though Nevia is self-centered,

384
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:19,188
short-tempered, and moody,

385
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,240
she never badmouths others.

386
00:26:22,461 --> 00:26:23,462
Do you see now?

387
00:26:24,153 --> 00:26:25,498
Who is the toxic one?

388
00:26:25,498 --> 00:26:28,556
Ing, you think you are better than me.

389
00:26:28,556 --> 00:26:30,841
If you want this world to be a better place,

390
00:26:30,841 --> 00:26:32,674
then you should stop being pretentious.

391
00:26:32,812 --> 00:26:35,179
This world would be a better place.

392
00:26:35,432 --> 00:26:36,069
Huh?

393
00:26:36,461 --> 00:26:37,193
What?

394
00:26:38,046 --> 00:26:39,414
When am I being pretentious?

395
00:26:39,506 --> 00:26:41,044
All the time, bitch.

396
00:26:41,044 --> 00:26:42,760
When I badmouth other people,

397
00:26:42,852 --> 00:26:45,484
you always egg me on to do it.

398
00:26:46,152 --> 00:26:47,595
Stop pretending to be a nice person.

399
00:26:47,808 --> 00:26:49,434
This workout wears too.

400
00:26:49,687 --> 00:26:51,617
You said you didn’t have one.

401
00:26:51,617 --> 00:26:53,339
But you actually brought a nice one.

402
00:26:53,339 --> 00:26:54,966
Why did you lie to me?

403
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:57,636
This is what I call being pretentious, brat.

404
00:26:58,212 --> 00:26:59,660
Oh.

405
00:27:00,259 --> 00:27:04,851
Fews, the word pretentious is best
to describe you.

406
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:06,565
You want to show everyone
that you are smart?

407
00:27:06,626 --> 00:27:09,124
But actually,
you are not smarter than the rest of us.

408
00:27:09,354 --> 00:27:11,185
You want to show off
that you can speak five languages.

409
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:14,090
But no one here understands anything
that you say.

410
00:27:14,551 --> 00:27:15,911
You bimbo.

411
00:27:16,234 --> 00:27:18,659
How dare you call me stupid?

412
00:27:18,844 --> 00:27:21,225
You're not half as smart as I am.

413
00:27:21,847 --> 00:27:22,570
Fine.

414
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,957
I don’t know how high my IQ is.

415
00:27:25,349 --> 00:27:28,533
But I know that it’s higher than
the beauty level on your face right now.

416
00:27:28,786 --> 00:27:30,244
Do you know how happy I am?

417
00:27:30,244 --> 00:27:34,426
At least, I don’t need to use my intelligence to cover up appearance insecurity like you.

418
00:27:34,426 --> 00:27:35,852
I’ll kill you, Ing.

419
00:27:38,242 --> 00:27:39,355
Do you see this?

420
00:27:39,447 --> 00:27:40,377
Are you going to hit me?

421
00:27:40,377 --> 00:27:41,605
Why not?

422
00:27:45,305 --> 00:27:47,254
Did you hit me, Fews?

423
00:27:49,985 --> 00:27:51,197
How dare you hit me, Ing?

424
00:27:51,197 --> 00:27:51,800
Yeah.

425
00:27:58,665 --> 00:27:59,416
It hurts.

426
00:28:07,228 --> 00:28:08,350
Ouch.

427
00:28:09,626 --> 00:28:10,825
Stop it.

428
00:28:11,017 --> 00:28:13,959
Separate them.

429
00:28:15,066 --> 00:28:15,917
Bring it on.

430
00:28:16,493 --> 00:28:17,778
Bitch.

431
00:28:19,186 --> 00:28:20,930
Okay, okay.

432
00:28:24,066 --> 00:28:25,385
I don’t want to lose my friends.

433
00:28:25,385 --> 00:28:27,765
then you should do everything to get them back.

434
00:28:27,765 --> 00:28:30,119
Between the power I can give you
and your stupid friends,

435
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:31,390
it’s up to you to choose.

436
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:32,766
The goddess is right.

437
00:28:32,766 --> 00:28:35,289
They are not my friends anymore.

438
00:28:58,023 --> 00:28:58,645
Hey.

439
00:28:59,209 --> 00:28:59,977
Where are you going?

440
00:29:01,074 --> 00:29:01,867
What are you doing here?

441
00:29:02,641 --> 00:29:04,114
I bought snacks for you guys.

442
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:08,170
It’s not necessary.

443
00:29:09,057 --> 00:29:09,819
I’m leaving.

444
00:29:22,495 --> 00:29:23,700
Do you think I’m a jerk?

445
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:26,986
Yeah.

446
00:29:27,728 --> 00:29:28,228
What?

447
00:29:28,873 --> 00:29:29,459
What?

448
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:32,037
You ask my opinion.

449
00:29:32,553 --> 00:29:33,271
You are a jerk.

450
00:29:33,529 --> 00:29:34,885
You listen to no one.

451
00:29:35,256 --> 00:29:36,365
You are very stubborn.

452
00:29:37,381 --> 00:29:38,613
Don’t eat it, brat.

453
00:29:39,581 --> 00:29:40,081
What?

454
00:29:42,161 --> 00:29:42,773
Hey.

455
00:29:43,934 --> 00:29:45,435
You also don’t give up easily.

456
00:29:47,483 --> 00:29:48,798
You have determination.

457
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,063
When you do something,

458
00:29:51,063 --> 00:29:52,627
you always find the most effective way
to reach the goal.

459
00:29:53,934 --> 00:29:55,277
For me, that’s a good thing.

460
00:29:55,772 --> 00:29:56,777
Why are you whining about it?

461
00:30:04,551 --> 00:30:06,428
I had a fight with Fews and Ingky.

462
00:30:07,476 --> 00:30:10,283
Other contestants also hate me.

463
00:30:10,686 --> 00:30:11,988
They said I’m self-centered.

464
00:30:12,746 --> 00:30:15,123
Do you care what others think about you?

465
00:30:16,688 --> 00:30:17,330
No.

466
00:30:19,781 --> 00:30:21,546
I don’t care how people see me.

467
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:24,100
But I just feel bad…

468
00:30:24,535 --> 00:30:26,904
to know that my friends
also think of me that way.

469
00:30:28,081 --> 00:30:29,487
I mean…

470
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:31,709
I don’t want to lose my friends.

471
00:30:34,035 --> 00:30:36,763
If you don’t want to lose them,

472
00:30:37,408 --> 00:30:40,218
then you should do everything to get them back.

473
00:30:42,734 --> 00:30:43,554
How?

474
00:30:45,215 --> 00:30:47,544
A smart girl like you will figure it out.

475
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:50,663
The question is whether you will do it or not.

476
00:31:01,645 --> 00:31:02,254
Hey.

477
00:31:02,899 --> 00:31:04,233
That’s my snack.

478
00:31:12,989 --> 00:31:14,202
Air Dolls without me,

479
00:31:14,686 --> 00:31:16,509
how can they get this messed up?

480
00:31:18,041 --> 00:31:19,346
What are you going to do, Kat?

481
00:31:22,188 --> 00:31:23,668
I’m going back to my friends.

482
00:31:24,894 --> 00:31:25,980
They need me.

483
00:31:26,109 --> 00:31:27,022
Fine.

484
00:31:27,538 --> 00:31:31,280
If you go back to them, I’ll leave you.

485
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:34,088
Between the power I can give you

486
00:31:34,088 --> 00:31:35,936
and your stupid friends,

487
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:37,124
it’s up to you to choose.

488
00:32:02,046 --> 00:32:05,906
We are Air Dolls.

489
00:32:11,725 --> 00:32:12,677
I chose them.

490
00:32:37,653 --> 00:32:39,624
That was quite a scene that you two caused.

491
00:32:43,881 --> 00:32:47,880
Your cat fight,
it was live-streamed.

492
00:32:48,525 --> 00:32:49,596
The video went viral.

493
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:51,080
Why?

494
00:32:52,483 --> 00:32:53,982
Are you here to rub it in?

495
00:32:56,756 --> 00:32:57,591
No.

496
00:33:01,655 --> 00:33:02,732
I’m here to apologize to you.

497
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:04,780
Huh?

498
00:33:25,338 --> 00:33:26,434
I know…

499
00:33:28,305 --> 00:33:30,182
I wasn’t fair to you about many things.

500
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:32,023
So…

501
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:37,469
it’s not strange
if you would be upset or mad at me.

502
00:33:40,823 --> 00:33:41,837
I’m not complaining about it.

503
00:33:42,756 --> 00:33:44,101
You’re not complaining about it?

504
00:33:44,714 --> 00:33:46,188
It should be us who say that.

505
00:33:47,236 --> 00:33:48,189
Right.

506
00:33:48,866 --> 00:33:50,271
I’m apologizing to you.

507
00:33:51,335 --> 00:33:52,744
You two should apologize to each other, too.

508
00:33:54,357 --> 00:33:55,991
This time, you two went too far.

509
00:34:04,168 --> 00:34:05,804
I apologize to you two.

510
00:34:09,578 --> 00:34:10,743
I’m sorry

511
00:34:11,856 --> 00:34:14,856
for being too critical of you sometimes.

512
00:34:15,791 --> 00:34:18,352
It’s because you deserve to be criticized.

513
00:34:19,287 --> 00:34:19,983
Bitch.

514
00:34:21,386 --> 00:34:22,048
I…

515
00:34:23,241 --> 00:34:24,420
I’m sorry too.

516
00:34:25,435 --> 00:34:31,904
Sometimes, I forgot to think about your feelings.

517
00:34:34,742 --> 00:34:36,030
It’s so cringe to say this.

518
00:34:41,215 --> 00:34:43,582
Do you see that when there are only us left,

519
00:34:43,759 --> 00:34:45,141
we have no one else to criticize?

520
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:47,032
So we start to criticize each other.

521
00:34:47,484 --> 00:34:52,995
It’s because
we used to have Kat as our doormat.

522
00:34:52,995 --> 00:34:54,767
She put up with everything from us.

523
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,173
She is our most important friend.

524
00:34:59,721 --> 00:35:02,236
We can go on without her.

525
00:35:05,715 --> 00:35:13,266
So we need to work together to bring her back.

526
00:35:18,813 --> 00:35:20,134
Hey, girls.

527
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:26,005
Why don’t we drug and beat her up?

528
00:35:27,835 --> 00:35:32,192
Just to stop her from performing the ritual
or finding the magical items.

529
00:35:33,224 --> 00:35:38,358
I think we should lock her up
in a sealed room.

530
00:35:44,179 --> 00:35:45,396
Who made that damn noise?

531
00:35:46,622 --> 00:35:47,739
Forget it.

532
00:35:48,094 --> 00:35:49,984
Don’t use rough measures on her.

533
00:35:51,032 --> 00:35:53,335
We just need to focus on the contest.

534
00:35:53,496 --> 00:35:54,682
Fine.

535
00:35:54,811 --> 00:35:55,452
Okay.

536
00:35:57,210 --> 00:35:58,086
Come on.

537
00:36:03,069 --> 00:36:05,224
Let’s rescue bitchy Kat!

538
00:36:11,635 --> 00:36:12,309
Why?

539
00:36:13,776 --> 00:36:15,504
Why are they doing this to me?

540
00:36:27,859 --> 00:36:28,571
Right.

541
00:36:28,975 --> 00:36:30,343
The goddess is right.

542
00:36:31,311 --> 00:36:33,889
They are not my friends anymore.

543
00:36:42,452 --> 00:36:43,629
Hello, P’Med.

544
00:36:46,645 --> 00:36:48,326
You all look very pretty today.

545
00:36:48,326 --> 00:36:51,523
I think he must have a crush on one of us.

546
00:37:10,802 --> 00:37:14,328
Hello, girls.

547
00:37:14,704 --> 00:37:16,862
Nice to meet you.

548
00:37:17,786 --> 00:37:21,922
Your styles are all over the place.

549
00:37:21,922 --> 00:37:24,884
It looks like you are attending different events.

550
00:37:26,407 --> 00:37:31,992
I have something to tell you.

551
00:37:32,112 --> 00:37:34,647
As you know,

552
00:37:34,647 --> 00:37:38,551
we are holding a gala party this evening.

553
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:44,336
Before the final round tomorrow.

554
00:37:44,901 --> 00:37:49,683
But because these dumbasses are incompetent.

555
00:37:49,683 --> 00:37:51,410
They are freaking useless.

556
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:54,370
They only have a brain to keep their ears apart.

557
00:37:54,370 --> 00:37:57,377
They’ve got the IQ of a brick.

558
00:37:57,514 --> 00:37:58,838
They are a waste of skin.

559
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:04,780
My staff only booked the hotel for one night.

560
00:38:05,242 --> 00:38:07,496
We can’t book the hotel for tomorrow.

561
00:38:07,496 --> 00:38:12,563
So the final round will be held this evening.

562
00:38:12,563 --> 00:38:15,186
The pre-liminary round is canceled.

563
00:38:15,186 --> 00:38:18,631
We need to give the room back
by 2 a.m. tonight.

564
00:38:18,631 --> 00:38:20,393
The final round will begin at 8 p.m.

565
00:38:22,275 --> 00:38:23,359
Can we get ready in time?

566
00:38:23,667 --> 00:38:26,069
Go get ready and get dressed.

567
00:38:29,577 --> 00:38:31,062
What should we do?

568
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:33,226
Hurry up.

569
00:38:33,421 --> 00:38:34,236
Let’s go.

570
00:38:36,161 --> 00:38:36,911
Kat.

571
00:38:41,908 --> 00:38:43,543
Hello.

572
00:38:43,885 --> 00:38:48,276
We want to change our makeup appointment
from tomorrow to today.

573
00:38:48,276 --> 00:38:49,433
Is it possible to do that?

574
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:50,838
What?

575
00:38:51,249 --> 00:38:53,621
Your husband is arrested for DUI.

576
00:38:53,621 --> 00:38:54,730
You are waiting to bail him out.

577
00:38:55,192 --> 00:38:57,660
Can’t you come to do our makeup?

578
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:58,636
It won’t take long.

579
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:00,830
No?

580
00:39:01,617 --> 00:39:02,430
It’s okay.

581
00:39:05,082 --> 00:39:07,026
How the hell did he get drunk already?

582
00:39:07,026 --> 00:39:07,684
It’s only 6 p.m.

583
00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:08,410
Oh.

584
00:39:10,207 --> 00:39:12,050
What are you going to do?

585
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:18,346
I brought a big makeup bag.

586
00:39:18,346 --> 00:39:20,733
I have all kinds of makeup tools.

587
00:39:23,095 --> 00:39:24,620
What is f*cking funny about it?

588
00:39:25,253 --> 00:39:26,887
I’ll call other makeup artists.

589
00:39:26,887 --> 00:39:28,018
You guys should do it too.

590
00:39:33,515 --> 00:39:34,346
Thank you.

591
00:39:35,818 --> 00:39:36,400
Girls.

592
00:39:37,085 --> 00:39:37,832
Petch can’t come.

593
00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:49,410
P’Pat?

594
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:50,101
Yes, it’s me.

595
00:39:51,334 --> 00:39:53,024
P’Pat, what are you doing here?

596
00:39:54,598 --> 00:39:55,579
Hello, girls.

597
00:39:57,273 --> 00:39:59,674
My band is called to perform
at the opening of the contest.

598
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:01,360
I see.

599
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:03,322
You all look very pretty today.

600
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:06,618
P’Nevia.

601
00:40:07,525 --> 00:40:08,304
P’Fews.

602
00:40:12,069 --> 00:40:13,241
P’Ingky.

603
00:40:21,456 --> 00:40:25,049
But we are in trouble right now.

604
00:40:25,579 --> 00:40:29,281
We can’t find a makeup artist at the last minute.

605
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,440
Really?

606
00:40:30,765 --> 00:40:33,228
Do you want my makeup artist to do it?

607
00:40:33,742 --> 00:40:34,370
Huh?

608
00:40:34,918 --> 00:40:35,768
Really?

609
00:40:36,589 --> 00:40:38,019
Does she know how to do pageant makeup?

610
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:38,970
Can she do our makeup now?

611
00:40:39,244 --> 00:40:40,394
Of course.

612
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:45,945
She has a lot of experience
in doing ghost and zombie makeup.

613
00:40:46,938 --> 00:40:48,490
It will be hard to do the makeup.

614
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:50,042
Ghost makeup? My makeup?

615
00:40:50,145 --> 00:40:51,500
She usually does ghost makeup.

616
00:40:53,947 --> 00:40:56,031
But she can do your makeup.

617
00:40:56,801 --> 00:40:58,173
Good.

618
00:40:58,450 --> 00:41:00,470
Excuse me, I’ll call her for you.

619
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:01,541
Sure.

620
00:41:01,695 --> 00:41:02,507
Thank you.

621
00:41:02,507 --> 00:41:04,841
Please tell her she doesn’t need
to bring tools for ghost makeup.

622
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:05,737
Girls.

623
00:41:06,113 --> 00:41:09,149
I think he must have a crush on one of us.

624
00:41:09,286 --> 00:41:11,494
Otherwise, he wouldn’t help us.

625
00:41:11,494 --> 00:41:13,712
Stop talking. Your man is right there.

626
00:41:16,996 --> 00:41:17,818
Damn, Bank.

627
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:19,246
What the hell are you doing here?

628
00:41:20,136 --> 00:41:21,355
Why are you chasing me away?

629
00:41:21,766 --> 00:41:23,571
I brought a phallic charm for you.

630
00:41:23,571 --> 00:41:26,190
It will help bring you good luck.

631
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:29,676
My phallic charm is huge.

632
00:41:29,916 --> 00:41:30,416
Bank.

633
00:41:30,844 --> 00:41:31,884
That’s gross.

634
00:41:32,226 --> 00:41:33,078
Get out.

635
00:41:33,988 --> 00:41:34,699
Come here.

636
00:41:34,956 --> 00:41:36,516
Ouch.

637
00:41:44,583 --> 00:41:45,690
My dress has arrived.

638
00:41:45,895 --> 00:41:46,960
I’ll go get it.

639
00:41:47,063 --> 00:41:47,769
Okay.

640
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,184
Wait.

641
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,171
Let’s do it outside.

642
00:42:26,292 --> 00:42:26,888
Stop.

643
00:42:36,107 --> 00:42:37,251
I can smell queers.

644
00:42:37,251 --> 00:42:38,904
But we all are queers.

645
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:41,178
I’m not talking about you.

646
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:29,113
Girls.

647
00:43:29,113 --> 00:43:30,000
We have a problem.

648
00:43:30,513 --> 00:43:31,414
You heard it, right?

649
00:43:31,414 --> 00:43:32,103
Heard what?

650
00:43:32,445 --> 00:43:34,594
Heard that I’ll defeat you.

651
00:43:53,769 --> 00:43:56,509
Now, I have two magical items in my hands.

652
00:43:56,885 --> 00:43:58,782
If I win the crown,

653
00:43:58,782 --> 00:44:02,633
you will lose Katrina forever.

654
00:44:08,170 --> 00:44:10,283
THE BODICE OF GODDESS DALOP

655
00:44:21,094 --> 00:44:22,673
What do we do?

656
00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:24,462
If Kat wins the crown,

657
00:44:24,736 --> 00:44:25,657
what are we going to do?

658
00:44:25,890 --> 00:44:27,365
We have to steal the crown.

659
00:44:29,025 --> 00:44:30,412
Tell us the combination of your safe.

660
00:44:32,690 --> 00:44:34,574
They are the thieves.

661
00:44:34,574 --> 00:44:35,322
Thieves?

662
00:44:35,613 --> 00:44:36,764
We didn’t steal anything.

663
00:44:36,986 --> 00:44:37,796
You are fake.

664
00:44:37,984 --> 00:44:42,562
I know that you and P’Med are lying to everyone here.

665
00:44:42,562 --> 00:44:43,800
Fake goddess?

666
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:47,470
I found the real goddess.
