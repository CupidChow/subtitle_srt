4
00:00:13,053 --> 00:00:14,191
I want to break up with you.

5
00:00:14,191 --> 00:00:16,227
It’d be better 
if we never had to see each other again.

6
00:00:16,227 --> 00:00:17,614
The only way to fix this.

7
00:00:17,614 --> 00:00:18,515
You need a new girlfriend.

8
00:00:18,515 --> 00:00:19,240
A photobooth.

9
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,186
Do you want to take a picture together?

10
00:00:21,284 --> 00:00:22,026
What are you doing?

11
00:00:22,443 --> 00:00:23,305
Jab, do you know this?

12
00:00:23,305 --> 00:00:24,341
May popped up.

13
00:00:24,429 --> 00:00:25,184
Then she disappeared.

14
00:00:25,184 --> 00:00:26,416
I think she did black magic on you.

15
00:00:26,416 --> 00:00:27,128
I’m telling you.

16
00:00:27,128 --> 00:00:28,124
You need to end it.

17
00:00:28,124 --> 00:00:29,814
Don’t let May do this to you.

18
00:00:29,814 --> 00:00:31,755
Hello, Jab. I arrived in Kawagoe.

19
00:00:31,755 --> 00:00:33,516
There’s a famous shrine.

20
00:00:33,911 --> 00:00:34,956
I sent its location to you.

21
00:00:34,956 --> 00:00:36,000
There’s not a single plaque here.

22
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,045
Are you looking for this?

23
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:39,157
The plaque.

24
00:00:39,355 --> 00:00:40,546
I’ll throw it away.

25
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,098
Watch out!

26
00:00:43,669 --> 00:00:44,743
Oh!

27
00:00:58,411 --> 00:00:59,100
Payu.

28
00:01:00,395 --> 00:01:01,432
Pass the ball to me.

29
00:01:02,113 --> 00:01:03,245
Payu, I’m free.

30
00:01:03,245 --> 00:01:04,062
Payu, pass the ball to me.

31
00:01:04,216 --> 00:01:06,000
I’m so free.

32
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,630
Hurry and pass the ball to me.

33
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:11,198
Ouch.

34
00:01:14,916 --> 00:01:15,539
Yu.

35
00:01:16,461 --> 00:01:17,160
Yu, are you okay?

36
00:01:17,819 --> 00:01:19,031
- Don’t touch me.
- First-aid team, come here.

37
00:01:19,031 --> 00:01:20,765
Where is the first-aid team?

38
00:01:20,765 --> 00:01:21,722
I’m coming.

39
00:01:21,898 --> 00:01:22,986
Calm down.

40
00:01:23,601 --> 00:01:24,594
Are you okay?

41
00:01:26,789 --> 00:01:28,124
Where does it hurt? This leg?

42
00:01:31,944 --> 00:01:32,697
This leg.

43
00:01:33,597 --> 00:01:35,380
Give me an ice pack.

44
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:40,800
What about this leg?

45
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:43,078
This leg is fine.

46
00:01:43,078 --> 00:01:45,332
I dodged the kick.

47
00:01:46,833 --> 00:01:49,103
Please sit comfortably.

48
00:01:52,681 --> 00:01:55,674
Yes, right there.

49
00:01:56,091 --> 00:01:57,692
It will be alright.

50
00:01:58,416 --> 00:01:59,782
Thank you.

51
00:02:00,331 --> 00:02:01,562
Yeah, I can move it.

52
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,753
Easy, easy.

53
00:02:55,003 --> 00:02:57,100
PROMISE

54
00:02:59,076 --> 00:02:59,754
It hurts.

55
00:03:00,105 --> 00:03:01,749
Am I going to die?

56
00:03:02,847 --> 00:03:04,638
No, it’s not that serious.

57
00:03:04,638 --> 00:03:05,384
Really?

58
00:03:05,911 --> 00:03:08,022
I got kicked here.

59
00:03:08,637 --> 00:03:10,810
But the pain is going up to here.

60
00:03:12,127 --> 00:03:13,300
My heart is fluttering.

61
00:03:16,022 --> 00:03:17,807
It’s more fluttering when you look at me.

62
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:21,332
What are you doing?

63
00:03:23,461 --> 00:03:24,000
Sorry.

64
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,343
My leg is injured.

65
00:03:25,673 --> 00:03:26,715
Please be gentle.

66
00:03:26,715 --> 00:03:28,163
Then stay still. I’ll treat it.

67
00:03:28,163 --> 00:03:30,552
Okay, I’ll stay still.

68
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:33,979
What’s your name?

69
00:03:34,945 --> 00:03:36,033
I’m May.

70
00:03:36,033 --> 00:03:39,337
May. Okay, now I know your name.

71
00:03:39,337 --> 00:03:41,068
Thank you, May.

72
00:03:43,483 --> 00:03:44,474
I’m Payu.

73
00:03:45,176 --> 00:03:46,016
Payu?

74
00:03:46,543 --> 00:03:47,366
Payu.

75
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,400
He kicked to stop me when I had the ball.

76
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,296
Do you feel better?

77
00:03:52,867 --> 00:03:53,571
What?

78
00:03:53,659 --> 00:03:54,679
Do you feel better?

79
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,003
Yes.

80
00:03:57,935 --> 00:03:59,681
What’s your name? I’m Payu.

81
00:04:00,252 --> 00:04:01,127
Satsuki.

82
00:04:03,081 --> 00:04:04,234
How come you can speak Thai?

83
00:04:05,134 --> 00:04:06,045
When I was young,

84
00:04:06,484 --> 00:04:09,096
I moved to Thailand to live with my dad…

85
00:04:09,096 --> 00:04:11,198
Good. Let’s go.

86
00:04:11,198 --> 00:04:11,786
Huh?

87
00:04:11,874 --> 00:04:12,892
I can’t go now.

88
00:04:12,892 --> 00:04:14,596
What? Are you going to back on your word?

89
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:18,278
I have to go to work.

90
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,075
When I get off work, I’ll take you to find it.

91
00:04:22,997 --> 00:04:25,119
Give me your contact info.

92
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:28,306
I’m not a fool to believe it.

93
00:04:29,052 --> 00:04:31,358
Where do you work? I’ll go and wait there.

94
00:04:31,358 --> 00:04:32,015
What?

95
00:04:33,903 --> 00:04:35,584
Then you need to talk to the police.

96
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:38,657
Fine.

97
00:04:39,425 --> 00:04:41,314
You can wait at my workplace.

98
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:44,541
Good.

99
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:48,409
Damn it.

100
00:04:48,409 --> 00:04:50,443
Why does this have to happen to me?

101
00:04:50,443 --> 00:04:50,943
Hey.

102
00:04:51,294 --> 00:04:52,493
Are you criticizing me?

103
00:04:53,854 --> 00:04:55,242
Don’t overthink.

104
00:04:56,472 --> 00:04:57,401
Damn.

105
00:04:59,043 --> 00:04:59,949
She is surely criticizing me.

106
00:05:11,404 --> 00:05:12,768
You work at a Thai restaurant?

107
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:15,662
I can speak Thai.

108
00:05:16,035 --> 00:05:17,486
I know Thai food.

109
00:05:17,793 --> 00:05:18,714
It’s not strange for me to work here.

110
00:05:35,327 --> 00:05:36,575
Welcome.

111
00:05:36,926 --> 00:05:38,266
How many people?

112
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:40,562
He’s my friend.

113
00:05:41,242 --> 00:05:43,957
We have an errand to do after I get off work.

114
00:05:44,067 --> 00:05:45,902
Can he wait here?

115
00:05:46,714 --> 00:05:48,776
Sure. No problem.

116
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,100
Wait here.

117
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,675
Order something to eat.

118
00:06:08,048 --> 00:06:09,317
It’s bad to just take up a table.

119
00:06:15,903 --> 00:06:18,530
I’ll have a Pad Thai and a green tea.

120
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:25,122
Got it. Please wait a moment.

121
00:06:33,881 --> 00:06:36,364
One Pad Thai and one green tea.

122
00:06:36,364 --> 00:06:37,003
Yes.

123
00:06:39,269 --> 00:06:40,366
Who is he?

124
00:06:41,244 --> 00:06:42,464
Is he your friend?

125
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:45,145
He’s so handsome.

126
00:06:45,145 --> 00:06:45,968
Handsome?

127
00:06:45,968 --> 00:06:47,235
He’s also very tall.

128
00:06:47,455 --> 00:06:48,955
Does he have a girlfriend?

129
00:06:54,577 --> 00:06:56,067
You think he’s handsome?

130
00:06:58,635 --> 00:07:01,857
Of course, he’s very handsome.

131
00:07:06,148 --> 00:07:07,456
Are they gossiping about me?

132
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:16,126
I’m full.

133
00:07:21,737 --> 00:07:23,220
IT’S UP TO ME RESTAURANT

134
00:07:49,195 --> 00:07:50,119
I’m bored.

135
00:07:50,119 --> 00:07:51,317
I’m going to walk around the neighborhood.

136
00:07:51,646 --> 00:07:52,631
Can I have the bill?

137
00:07:54,549 --> 00:07:58,337
One Pad Thai and one green tea. 

138
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,145
1800 yen.

139
00:08:22,042 --> 00:08:24,695
His leg seems to be just fine.

140
00:08:36,813 --> 00:08:38,049
It’s raining again.

141
00:08:49,124 --> 00:08:50,024
(Hello.)

142
00:08:50,024 --> 00:08:51,354
(Hello, Jab.)

143
00:08:51,354 --> 00:08:52,219
How are you doing?

144
00:08:52,658 --> 00:08:53,548
Did you cut it?

145
00:08:53,548 --> 00:08:54,692
Or do you want to burn it?

146
00:08:54,999 --> 00:08:56,773
You should post the picture and tag May.

147
00:08:56,773 --> 00:08:57,772
I was almost hit by a motorcycle.

148
00:08:57,772 --> 00:08:58,729
My leg is injured.

149
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,976
Damn.

150
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,460
Did the rider take responsibility for it?

151
00:09:04,701 --> 00:09:08,199
If not, I’ll fly to Japan and deal with them.

152
00:09:08,199 --> 00:09:08,962
But…

153
00:09:09,269 --> 00:09:11,053
You need to buy me a plane ticket.

154
00:09:11,053 --> 00:09:12,207
I’ll gradually pay you back.

155
00:09:12,207 --> 00:09:13,999
She takes responsibility for it.

156
00:09:14,372 --> 00:09:16,289
She’ll help me find the plaque.

157
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:18,446
(That’s great. You get help from a local.)

158
00:09:18,446 --> 00:09:21,239
(It will get easier to find the plaque.)

159
00:09:21,832 --> 00:09:25,813
(I’m going to ask you to buy something for me.)

160
00:09:25,813 --> 00:09:27,192
(Is there a mall in the town?)

161
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:29,411
(Can you buy me…)

162
00:09:32,948 --> 00:09:33,784
3 YEARS AGO.

163
00:09:33,784 --> 00:09:37,703
I’ll buy a big bouquet for you 
on Valentine’s Day.

164
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:39,390
Really?

165
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:40,070
Yes.

166
00:09:41,739 --> 00:09:42,923
Promise?

167
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,425
Sure, I promise.

168
00:09:46,325 --> 00:09:48,583
You need to sign it too.

169
00:09:50,251 --> 00:09:51,173
There.

170
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:52,462
Then deliver it.

171
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,093
Okay.

172
00:09:55,093 --> 00:09:56,034
Then remember it.

173
00:09:56,034 --> 00:09:58,555
Okay, I’ll remember it.

174
00:09:58,555 --> 00:09:59,933
I’ll buy it for you on Valentine’s Day.

175
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,960
I like pink flowers.

176
00:10:03,584 --> 00:10:05,309
VALENTINE’S DAY

177
00:10:05,309 --> 00:10:06,762
Happy Valentine’s Day!

178
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,980
It’s so cute.

179
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:13,719
Do you like it?

180
00:10:13,719 --> 00:10:14,749
Yes, I like it.

181
00:10:14,749 --> 00:10:15,515
Thank you.

182
00:10:15,669 --> 00:10:16,883
It has your name on it.

183
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:18,236
Thank you.

184
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:20,069
Okay.

185
00:10:20,354 --> 00:10:21,029
It’s my turn.

186
00:10:30,657 --> 00:10:31,347
Tada!

187
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,372
Didn’t you say you would buy me a flower?

188
00:10:40,257 --> 00:10:40,945
I…

189
00:10:43,778 --> 00:10:46,025
Flowers will wither in a few days.

190
00:10:46,464 --> 00:10:48,626
My gift is better. You can eat it.

191
00:10:54,136 --> 00:10:54,933
One more thing.

192
00:10:56,667 --> 00:10:59,319
If I always give you what you want,

193
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,286
you may forget what you really want is me.

194
00:11:07,883 --> 00:11:08,572
Hey.

195
00:11:09,406 --> 00:11:11,769
If you don’t like it, you can give it to me.

196
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,443
It’s now mine. You can’t take it back.

197
00:11:14,321 --> 00:11:17,621
I carefully chose it for you.

198
00:11:18,214 --> 00:11:19,633
Until now, 
I have never gotten a flower from you.

199
00:11:19,633 --> 00:11:20,320
Shit.

200
00:11:23,481 --> 00:11:24,396
It’s scratched.

201
00:11:46,765 --> 00:11:48,396
You keep me waiting.

202
00:11:48,989 --> 00:11:50,823
The water is not cold.

203
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:53,549
What are you going to do about it?

204
00:11:57,654 --> 00:11:59,954
This is a Thai restaurant.

205
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,754
But you can’t make a simple dish?

206
00:12:03,754 --> 00:12:04,670
Are you kidding me?

207
00:12:04,802 --> 00:12:07,438
This is not the Pad Kaprao 
that I had in Thailand.

208
00:12:08,184 --> 00:12:10,354
I’m very sorry.

209
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:15,181
But this is really Pad Kaprao.

210
00:12:15,686 --> 00:12:16,810
No, it’s not.

211
00:12:20,278 --> 00:12:22,309
It should have more vegetables.

212
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:30,173
It has to be more colorful.

213
00:12:32,434 --> 00:12:37,549
I heard that some Thai restaurants 
add other vegetables to Pad Kaprao.

214
00:12:38,361 --> 00:12:39,962
What kind of vegetables?

215
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,253
I’m sorry.

216
00:12:46,253 --> 00:12:49,578
Can you tell me what ingredient 
you want us to add to the dish?

217
00:12:49,578 --> 00:12:50,559
How would I know that?

218
00:12:51,634 --> 00:12:52,378
Hey!

219
00:12:53,585 --> 00:12:54,940
You are a chef.

220
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,293
You should know the dish!

221
00:12:56,513 --> 00:12:57,549
The dish is spicy.

222
00:12:58,471 --> 00:13:02,347
It has yellow, green, and orange vegetables.

223
00:13:03,378 --> 00:13:06,397
I’m sorry. We’ll make it for you.

224
00:13:20,554 --> 00:13:21,947
What the hell is this?!

225
00:13:27,254 --> 00:13:28,956
Are you freaking kidding me?

226
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:35,277
This is not Pad Kaprao.

227
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:47,951
Hey.

228
00:13:51,814 --> 00:13:52,772
What does he want?

229
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:54,708
I heard him order Pad Kaprao.

230
00:13:55,432 --> 00:13:56,758
This is not it.

231
00:14:00,841 --> 00:14:01,806
Kaprao.

232
00:14:07,539 --> 00:14:09,188
He ordered Pad Kaprao, 
which he ate in Thailand.

233
00:14:09,517 --> 00:14:15,576
It was spicy and 
had yellow, green, and orange vegetables.

234
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:26,426
I know what it is.

235
00:14:26,821 --> 00:14:28,254
Tell the chef to follow my instructions.

236
00:14:28,254 --> 00:14:28,997
Okay?

237
00:15:06,974 --> 00:15:10,485
Where are we going to find the Ema plaque?

238
00:15:10,485 --> 00:15:11,561
This photo is the only clue I have.

239
00:15:13,493 --> 00:15:14,658
What are you going to do 
with our wishing plaque?

240
00:15:14,658 --> 00:15:16,315
Stop, stop, stop.

241
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:17,614
Okay, I stopped.
