1
00:00:56,909 --> 00:00:59,153
(An exam room is like a horse race track.)

2
00:00:59,928 --> 00:01:02,507
(Everyone here is a well-trained racing horse.)

3
00:01:03,005 --> 00:01:05,128
(Our goal is to be the first
to reach the finish line.)

4
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:29,459
(The frontrunner is often viewed as a top contender.)

5
00:01:29,754 --> 00:01:31,909
(That's how much the math teachers
at my school believe in me.)

6
00:01:31,909 --> 00:01:34,096
If you finish the exam, you can submit it now.

7
00:01:37,696 --> 00:01:40,091
(I know that even with a small mistake,)

8
00:01:40,774 --> 00:01:42,608
(other horses can outrun me.)

9
00:01:42,996 --> 00:01:49,233
Next is the certificate ceremony for students
who enhanced our school's reputation.

10
00:01:49,233 --> 00:01:55,467
The winner of the middle school math contest
is Pokpong Panprasert.

11
00:01:55,873 --> 00:02:00,796
The next certificate receiver
is Nuchwara Prakorb.

12
00:02:04,876 --> 00:02:09,479
The next receiver is my friend.

13
00:02:09,793 --> 00:02:12,058
He won every contest he participated in.

14
00:02:12,594 --> 00:02:14,992
He has received dozens of certificates.

15
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:24,689
The winner of the high school level
is Anantachai Kraikaew.

16
00:02:26,923 --> 00:02:28,357
Come on.

17
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:33,301
(Just like Benz said,)

18
00:02:33,652 --> 00:02:36,083
(I have won all the prizes for my school.)

19
00:02:36,674 --> 00:02:39,368
(You always see my photos on the board
in the math teacher's lounge.)

20
00:02:41,048 --> 00:02:42,449
(I'm beloved by my friends.)

21
00:02:44,277 --> 00:02:45,780
The next question…

22
00:02:46,186 --> 00:02:47,350
(The teachers adore me.)

23
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:50,520
Keep your virtue as salt keeps its savor.

24
00:02:50,594 --> 00:02:56,613
This friend will get into a global top university.

25
00:02:57,887 --> 00:03:00,707
(In simple words,
this school loves me so much.)

26
00:03:03,513 --> 00:03:07,380
I'm curious why I need to keep my virtue
as salt keeps its savor.

27
00:03:08,045 --> 00:03:09,169
Eating salt will help me become smarter?

28
00:03:09,593 --> 00:03:10,833
If that's the case,

29
00:03:10,999 --> 00:03:13,869
I'll drink fish sauce instead of water.

30
00:03:14,035 --> 00:03:15,193
I'll drink eight glasses of fish sauce every day.

31
00:03:15,193 --> 00:03:16,052
That way, I'll be smarter, right?

32
00:03:16,052 --> 00:03:17,885
Mr. Jate was overstated.

33
00:03:18,347 --> 00:03:20,565
There are many smart students
in other schools.

34
00:03:21,433 --> 00:03:23,040
They are in other schools.

35
00:03:23,778 --> 00:03:24,974
But in our school,

36
00:03:25,292 --> 00:03:27,000
you are the top student.

37
00:03:27,924 --> 00:03:29,703
What Mr. Jate said is right.

38
00:03:29,851 --> 00:03:32,606
You are the star in math class.

39
00:03:32,994 --> 00:03:34,153
You are the ace.

40
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:37,398
Hey.

41
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:38,545
Judy.

42
00:03:38,933 --> 00:03:40,345
Where should I put them?

43
00:03:44,388 --> 00:03:45,905
(I'm everyone's hope.)

44
00:03:46,237 --> 00:03:47,273
(I'm the no.1 student.)

45
00:03:48,011 --> 00:03:48,921
(I'm the ace.)

46
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,161
ANANTACHAI KRAIKAEW

47
00:03:55,517 --> 00:03:57,000
2ND SEMESTER OF 2024

48
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,068
(It all started in the second semester
of my last year in high school.)

49
00:03:59,917 --> 00:04:03,803
(I realized that no horse can win every race.)

50
00:04:09,526 --> 00:04:13,046
Please be nice to your new classmate.

51
00:04:13,563 --> 00:04:16,397
Mawin is joining our class starting today.

52
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:30,767
(He chose a seat at the back of the class.)

53
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,053
(He barely talks.)

54
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:33,593
(He likes being alone.)

55
00:04:34,147 --> 00:04:35,931
(I've seen these kinds of characteristics before.)

56
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,792
(It's like he's hiding his personality.)

57
00:04:37,792 --> 00:04:40,383
I already taught you this question.

58
00:04:40,512 --> 00:04:41,601
Do I need to show it again?

59
00:04:45,884 --> 00:04:46,683
No one?

60
00:04:48,418 --> 00:04:49,492
The new student.

61
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,076
What is the answer?

62
00:04:59,293 --> 00:05:00,334
68.

63
00:05:02,771 --> 00:05:04,242
(He's not just a regular racing horse.)

64
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:06,119
What are you waiting for?

65
00:05:06,119 --> 00:05:07,351
Give him a round of applause.

66
00:05:10,988 --> 00:05:12,001
Well done.

67
00:05:12,315 --> 00:05:13,875
What's your name? Pakin?

68
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:14,509
Mawin.

69
00:05:14,841 --> 00:05:16,212
Yes, Mawin.

70
00:05:16,212 --> 00:05:17,710
Good job.

71
00:05:19,448 --> 00:05:21,824
Let's move on to the next question.

72
00:05:23,024 --> 00:05:25,593
(I can tell that he's a dark horse.)

73
00:05:28,325 --> 00:05:29,732
20 square meters.

74
00:05:29,732 --> 00:05:30,968
5 newtons.

75
00:05:31,116 --> 00:05:32,388
Karp Yanee 11 poem.

76
00:05:32,388 --> 00:05:33,804
Present perfect tense.

77
00:05:35,872 --> 00:05:36,567
(Mawin.)

78
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,807
(His name already tells that he's here to win.)

79
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:42,341
(It took him only a few weeks
to become the top student in our year class.)

80
00:05:45,349 --> 00:05:46,161
There he is.

81
00:05:49,484 --> 00:05:50,847
(Mawin.)

82
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:52,237
(No way.)

83
00:05:52,366 --> 00:05:58,812
I will also send Mawin
to the qualifying exam for the math camp.

84
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:05,536
The exam is used to select 15 students
to join the math camp.

85
00:06:05,536 --> 00:06:08,518
The camp is two weeks long.

86
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:10,034
After the camp ends, there will be an exam.

87
00:06:10,163 --> 00:06:16,584
The student who receives the highest scores
will receive a scholarship to study abroad.

88
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:21,186
I believe that students from our school
will be qualified to join the camp.

89
00:06:22,109 --> 00:06:23,696
At least…

90
00:06:25,081 --> 00:06:26,851
two students,

91
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,192
or maybe only one.

92
00:06:32,241 --> 00:06:32,916
Mawin.

93
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,471
You will go to take the exam
with Anantachai.

94
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:39,048
(Where did you get the confidence?)

95
00:06:39,048 --> 00:06:40,311
(Your look is nothing special.)

96
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:41,719
(You have no friends.)

97
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:42,706
(You should say no to his offer.)

98
00:06:42,983 --> 00:06:44,534
(Tell him that you won't take the exam.)

99
00:06:44,534 --> 00:06:45,249
I'll do it.

100
00:06:45,987 --> 00:06:46,753
Great.

101
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,410
You are the new hope of our school.

102
00:06:49,853 --> 00:06:50,641
How about this?

103
00:06:51,269 --> 00:06:54,990
I'll help you plan your study schedule.

104
00:06:55,138 --> 00:06:55,688
What do you think?

105
00:06:57,497 --> 00:06:58,223
Mr. Jate,

106
00:06:58,481 --> 00:07:00,149
I slightly adjusted my old study schedule.

107
00:07:00,149 --> 00:07:02,476
I moved the algebra to 10 pm.

108
00:07:04,618 --> 00:07:06,078
Good job, Anantachai.

109
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:08,257
Where is your study schedule, Mawin?

110
00:07:08,257 --> 00:07:09,177
I don't have one.

111
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,109
Do I need it?

112
00:07:12,771 --> 00:07:13,892
Of course.

113
00:07:14,612 --> 00:07:20,562
When you compete with other schools,
you need a plan for your preparation.

114
00:07:20,654 --> 00:07:22,512
But I've never had any special preparation.

115
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,124
I only focus in class.

116
00:07:26,749 --> 00:07:36,359
Are you saying you always get straight A's and gold medals from academic contests,

117
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,496
without any special preparation?

118
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:40,032
Yes.

119
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:41,644
See?

120
00:07:42,345 --> 00:07:46,098
This is the best preparation plan
I've ever seen.

121
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:50,825
The best preparation plan is no plan.

122
00:07:51,158 --> 00:07:52,866
You are so smart.

123
00:07:54,103 --> 00:07:55,878
Since I became a teacher…

124
00:07:57,558 --> 00:08:01,481
(I learn the quick way to gain my confidence
from my family.)

125
00:08:02,127 --> 00:08:03,800
(My mom is a multi-faith person.)

126
00:08:04,243 --> 00:08:06,525
(She adopted those beliefs after she joined
beauty pageants when she was young.)

127
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:10,925
(I can't eat poultry meat during the exam)

128
00:08:11,534 --> 00:08:12,529
(because I might fall flat.)

129
00:08:18,645 --> 00:08:20,679
(I can't drop anything
because it will be a bad sign.)

130
00:08:21,177 --> 00:08:23,740
(Anything that can boost my confidence,
I'll do it.)

131
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,296
(But the confidence I have is not enough.)

132
00:08:47,967 --> 00:08:49,290
Why do you look so stressed?

133
00:08:49,493 --> 00:08:51,268
It's not like this is your first academic contest.

134
00:08:51,471 --> 00:08:52,063
I don't know.

135
00:08:52,728 --> 00:08:54,030
Just seeing Mawin's face,

136
00:08:55,211 --> 00:08:56,615
I already lost my confidence.

137
00:09:00,215 --> 00:09:01,784
Do you still pray to gods?

138
00:09:02,227 --> 00:09:03,000
Yes, always.

139
00:09:04,883 --> 00:09:07,404
Maybe the gods that you pray to,

140
00:09:08,475 --> 00:09:09,950
they have many people asking them for help.

141
00:09:10,153 --> 00:09:13,579
So they need to pay attention to many prayers.

142
00:09:14,059 --> 00:09:15,859
You might be way down the list.

143
00:09:17,594 --> 00:09:18,558
What do you suggest I do?

144
00:09:20,478 --> 00:09:22,343
Why don't you seek advice
from a fortune teller?

145
00:09:23,155 --> 00:09:25,621
I think it's better than waiting in line.

146
00:09:26,747 --> 00:09:27,863
A fortune teller?

147
00:09:29,081 --> 00:09:30,247
I study science.

148
00:09:30,838 --> 00:09:33,655
If I seek advice from a fortune teller,
won't it contradict my principles?

149
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:36,807
Err.

150
00:09:37,675 --> 00:09:40,579
You already broke your principles
when you pray to gods for help.

151
00:09:40,856 --> 00:09:42,540
That's not different from seeking advice
from a fortune teller.

152
00:09:43,315 --> 00:09:46,062
Now, there are online fortune-teller services.

153
00:09:46,284 --> 00:09:48,079
No one will see that you break your principles.

154
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:53,176
Hey.

155
00:09:53,786 --> 00:09:55,356
I have a fortune teller to recommend to you.

156
00:09:55,356 --> 00:09:56,781
His predictions are very accurate.

157
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,049
He's popular among our schoolmates.

158
00:10:00,803 --> 00:10:01,831
I sent his contact to you.

159
00:10:02,182 --> 00:10:03,106
You should text him.

160
00:10:03,844 --> 00:10:04,387
Come on.

161
00:10:09,353 --> 00:10:10,296
There.

162
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,635
Text him.

163
00:10:12,635 --> 00:10:22,080
SEER TK

164
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:29,599
[Hello, Err. Please leave your questions.]

165
00:10:29,869 --> 00:10:32,221
[I, Seer TK, will reply to you as soon as I can.]

166
00:10:32,356 --> 00:10:35,043
(Seer TK is the hottest fortune teller right now.)

167
00:10:35,274 --> 00:10:37,760
(Many schoolmates are chatting with him.)

168
00:10:38,011 --> 00:10:39,986
(His reading is accurate and free.)

169
00:10:40,275 --> 00:10:42,507
(But the language he uses is a bit odd.)

170
00:10:42,507 --> 00:10:43,240
(It sounds like a bot.)

171
00:10:43,471 --> 00:10:46,320
(He will give you missions to do
as his psychic reading fee.)

172
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,363
Tum, what is wrong with you?

173
00:10:48,363 --> 00:10:49,795
Why aren't you playing football with us?

174
00:10:49,911 --> 00:10:50,957
Did you hit your head?

175
00:10:51,092 --> 00:10:52,606
You can play without me.

176
00:10:53,165 --> 00:10:54,304
I need to study.

177
00:10:54,979 --> 00:10:56,994
(His missions are a bit strange.)

178
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,931
(For example, studying near the football field.)

179
00:11:01,204 --> 00:11:03,371
Everyone gets what they wish for.

180
00:11:04,046 --> 00:11:05,273
He is so good at it.

181
00:11:06,353 --> 00:11:10,469
Judy told me that he passed an audition.

182
00:11:10,912 --> 00:11:13,280
He followed the fortune teller's advice
not to wear makeup to the audition.

183
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,714
He is selected to shoot a commercial.

184
00:11:14,714 --> 00:11:16,209
His language is odd.

185
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:17,222
It sounds like a chatbot.

186
00:11:17,357 --> 00:11:19,065
If his language sounds odd,

187
00:11:19,277 --> 00:11:20,373
it means this is the real him.

188
00:11:21,476 --> 00:11:22,149
Hey.

189
00:11:23,344 --> 00:11:24,985
Someone told me…

190
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:28,294
he's an alien.

191
00:11:30,588 --> 00:11:31,662
That's exaggerating.

192
00:11:32,626 --> 00:11:33,608
I agree.

193
00:11:36,576 --> 00:11:37,240
Err.

194
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,629
Maybe he can travel through time.

195
00:11:41,477 --> 00:11:42,505
That must be it.

196
00:11:43,642 --> 00:11:44,664
You failed. Go.

197
00:11:44,895 --> 00:11:45,608
You can retake the test next week.

198
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:48,922
You need to attend gym class next week.

199
00:11:48,922 --> 00:11:49,847
Don't come late.

200
00:11:49,847 --> 00:11:52,030
We just need to focus on the birdie
when it flies to us.

201
00:11:53,418 --> 00:11:55,449
We just reach the racket to where it heads.

202
00:11:55,661 --> 00:11:56,182
That's all.

203
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:58,538
Didn't you see
how we were doing during the practice?

204
00:11:59,309 --> 00:12:01,396
Did either of us catch any of it?

205
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,049
Hey.

206
00:12:04,994 --> 00:12:06,888
I don't want to retake the test next week.

207
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:11,645
How can we pass the test today?

208
00:12:14,344 --> 00:12:14,844
Hey.

209
00:12:18,931 --> 00:12:23,540
Hold on, you haven't texted him
to ask about the qualifying exam?

210
00:12:23,926 --> 00:12:24,460
No.

211
00:12:26,137 --> 00:12:27,445
I don't know how to begin.

212
00:12:27,637 --> 00:12:30,227
The fortune teller must be an AI bot
like ChatGPT.

213
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:35,446
Even if he's a bot but he can help you,
then you should listen to his advice.

214
00:12:38,319 --> 00:12:40,458
Come on. Text him.

215
00:12:40,689 --> 00:12:42,875
Text him now.

216
00:12:43,126 --> 00:12:46,230
[What do I need to do
to pass the badminton test on the first try?]

217
00:12:46,963 --> 00:12:48,511
[I keep missing the birdie.]

218
00:12:51,133 --> 00:12:52,071
Why does he read the messages so quickly?

219
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:54,283
I told you he's a bot.

220
00:12:56,384 --> 00:12:59,666
[When the birdie reaches the net,
you need to swing the racket.]

221
00:13:00,032 --> 00:13:02,956
A quality of a good partner
for the badminton test is focus.

222
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,667
What kind of answer is this?

223
00:13:07,344 --> 00:13:11,370
He told you how to pick a good partner.

224
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:12,584
How does that have anything to do with focus?

225
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,086
Hey.

226
00:13:18,684 --> 00:13:21,120
Why don't you pair up with Tle?

227
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:22,187
Look at him.

228
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,438
He's super focused.

229
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:26,427
Exactly what you need.

230
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,502
But he already has a partner.

231
00:13:31,356 --> 00:13:33,094
Hey, look there.

232
00:13:33,094 --> 00:13:34,414
Another person who can stay focused.

233
00:13:38,019 --> 00:13:38,707
No way.

234
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:40,384
Why?

235
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,876
Why don't you give it a try?

236
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,751
It won't hurt.

237
00:13:45,676 --> 00:13:47,601
This way, you can see
if his advice is useful or not.

238
00:13:49,645 --> 00:13:51,153
Come on. Give it a try.

239
00:13:52,059 --> 00:13:53,563
What if he fails the test because of me?

240
00:13:55,645 --> 00:13:57,759
He will never let himself fail the test.

241
00:14:02,097 --> 00:14:02,832
Come on.

242
00:14:13,376 --> 00:14:14,011
Hey.

243
00:14:16,633 --> 00:14:17,961
Do you want to be my partner
for the badminton test?

244
00:14:25,227 --> 00:14:27,216
Oh, then who will be my partner?

245
00:14:28,122 --> 00:14:30,535
Student no. 12 and no. 31.

246
00:14:31,191 --> 00:14:32,791
If you are ready, you can start serving.

247
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,663
You only have three chances.

248
00:14:35,145 --> 00:14:36,026
If you fail the test this time,

249
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,083
you need to get in line to retake the test.

250
00:14:38,758 --> 00:14:39,563
Do you get it?

251
00:14:58,758 --> 00:14:59,652
You are too slow.

252
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,491
You only have one chance left.

253
00:15:01,819 --> 00:15:02,851
If you fail this time,

254
00:15:03,449 --> 00:15:04,448
you need to retake the test.

255
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,166
Get it?

256
00:15:05,436 --> 00:15:07,100
No. 12 picks up the birdie
and gives it to your partner.

257
00:15:07,235 --> 00:15:07,891
Serve again.

258
00:15:17,646 --> 00:15:18,603
Do you want to change your partner?

259
00:15:19,239 --> 00:15:20,597
I think the teacher will allow it.

260
00:15:21,137 --> 00:15:22,606
Can you stay focused?

261
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,247
I can, but the problem is

262
00:15:24,555 --> 00:15:25,946
I don't know how to play badminton.

263
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,246
If you want to change your partner,
I can tell the teacher for you.

264
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,013
You will fail the test if I am your partner.

265
00:15:34,076 --> 00:15:35,478
I can retake the test next week.

266
00:15:35,478 --> 00:15:36,795
Take the test with me and pass it.

267
00:15:41,268 --> 00:15:42,299
I don't think I can do it.

268
00:15:42,299 --> 00:15:43,253
You can do it.

269
00:15:44,179 --> 00:15:44,866
I can't.

270
00:15:44,866 --> 00:15:45,400
You can.

271
00:15:45,786 --> 00:15:46,563
I can't.

272
00:15:46,949 --> 00:15:47,660
You can.

273
00:15:48,084 --> 00:15:49,473
I can't do it.

274
00:15:51,112 --> 00:15:52,015
You can do it.

275
00:15:53,114 --> 00:15:54,246
Try again.

276
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:20,962
(When the birdie reaches the net,)

277
00:16:24,259 --> 00:16:25,737
(you need to swing the racket.)

278
00:16:31,868 --> 00:16:32,711
(Damn.)

279
00:16:32,711 --> 00:16:34,803
(The fortune teller must be an alien, Benz.)

280
00:16:40,808 --> 00:16:42,145
How can he do that?

281
00:16:50,814 --> 00:16:52,208
[I have an exam in two days,

282
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:53,963
but I don't feel ready at all.]

283
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:55,236
[What should I do?]

284
00:16:56,335 --> 00:16:57,364
[Study.]

285
00:16:57,538 --> 00:16:59,093
If studying helped, why would I ask you?

286
00:17:01,985 --> 00:17:05,234
[I've been studying for over a month,
but I still don't feel confident.]

287
00:17:05,639 --> 00:17:06,655
[Do you have any advice?]

288
00:17:08,062 --> 00:17:09,360
[The things that will help you pass the exam.]

289
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:12,662
[1. Wash your hair with the shampoo
with a cat printed on the label.]

290
00:17:13,318 --> 00:17:14,381
What the heck?

291
00:17:17,986 --> 00:17:18,766
Excuse me.

292
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:22,160
Do you have a shampoo
with a cat printed on the label?

293
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,117
I've never seen it.

294
00:17:24,698 --> 00:17:27,815
Mew, he wants a shampoo
with a cat on the label.

295
00:17:28,066 --> 00:17:29,779
Shampoo with a cat on the label?

296
00:17:33,172 --> 00:17:36,288
This is the only shampoo
with a cat on the label.

297
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:40,163
Is it for you?

298
00:17:44,983 --> 00:17:48,014
[2. Cook your favorite food and eat it.]

299
00:17:49,441 --> 00:17:50,213
Err.

300
00:17:50,753 --> 00:17:52,509
Are you going to eat chicken?

301
00:17:52,721 --> 00:17:54,335
I asked a fortune teller.

302
00:17:54,701 --> 00:17:57,406
He told me to cook my favorite food and eat it.

303
00:17:58,448 --> 00:17:59,994
Don't stir it.

304
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:02,051
Wait until that side is cooked.

305
00:18:02,282 --> 00:18:04,737
How did you know the fortune teller?

306
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:05,970
Can you trust him?

307
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:07,640
At first, I wasn't sure if I should trust him.

308
00:18:08,527 --> 00:18:10,630
But his advice helped me
pass the badminton test on the first try.

309
00:18:10,861 --> 00:18:12,869
Benz took the test four times
before he passed it.

310
00:18:13,814 --> 00:18:14,505
Really?

311
00:18:14,505 --> 00:18:15,218
Yes.

312
00:18:15,218 --> 00:18:16,650
Where is his office?

313
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:18,025
He's an online fortune teller.

314
00:18:18,526 --> 00:18:19,749
I talk to him via a chat app.

315
00:18:20,539 --> 00:18:21,544
I see.

316
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:25,119
Kids these days meet fortune tellers online.

317
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:29,542
The fortune teller whom I went to see
in Huai Kwang also offers an online service.

318
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,521
Do you remember Aunt Pen?

319
00:18:33,639 --> 00:18:38,198
She always has a video call
with a fortune teller until late at night.

320
00:18:38,641 --> 00:18:40,691
Why does she have to talk to him
until late at night?

321
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:43,190
Because they are dating.

322
00:18:46,217 --> 00:18:48,167
There are many guys out there.
Why did she choose to date a fortune teller?

323
00:18:48,475 --> 00:18:53,587
She can flirt with anyone,
even the doctor at the hospital.

324
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:56,932
This is sweet.

325
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,044
Taste it.

(Honey, drink the tea without blowing it.)

333

only one student gets this scholarship.)

If you are ready,
you can go into the exam room.

00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:48,153
(I don't know if it's because of the cat shampoo,
the fried chicken, or Fourth's song.)

I'm so happy.

351
00:21:07,074 --> 00:21:08,627
At first, I was worried
that I wouldn't get into the camp.

352
00:21:09,996 --> 00:21:11,551
To be honest, the exam was not that hard.

353

It took me only 40 minutes to finish it.

(My true goal is to be no. 1
among the 15 participants.)

359
00:21:47,782 --> 00:21:48,361
Err.

360
00:21:50,527 --> 00:21:53,157
You still look good
even when you are stressed.

361
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,580
Good job, my friend.

362
00:21:56,745 --> 00:21:58,160
Benz, can I ask you something?

363
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:02,585
Besides complimenting me,
what else do you do?

364
00:22:02,879 --> 00:22:04,657
I don't want you to feel stressed.

365
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:07,319
I don't know why you are stressed about it.

366
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:10,990
For me, among the 15 participants,

367
00:22:11,318 --> 00:22:12,626
you are the smartest one.

368
00:22:13,463 --> 00:22:15,494
You should have some limit
when complimenting me.

369
00:22:16,623 --> 00:22:17,892
Don't talk about those 15 participants.

370
00:22:18,092 --> 00:22:21,063
I can't even defeat Mawin.

371
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:23,893
Did you ask Seer TK about it?

372
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:26,508
No.

373
00:22:27,691 --> 00:22:29,077
Then ask him.

374
00:22:29,933 --> 00:22:33,705
Didn't his advice help you get into the camp?

375
00:22:35,635 --> 00:22:37,262
Text him.

376
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:39,985
Ask him how you can defeat Mawin.

377
00:22:39,985 --> 00:22:41,071
Just get to the point.

378
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:42,219
Give your phone to me.

379
00:22:42,565 --> 00:22:43,431
I'll ask him for you.

380
00:22:51,832 --> 00:22:53,998
[What do I do to defeat Mawin?]

381
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:55,317
Don't include his name.

382
00:22:55,681 --> 00:22:57,540
What if he's not a bot and
uses the message to expose me?

383
00:22:57,879 --> 00:22:58,688
I'll do it.

384
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:04,017
[I'm competing with a dozen students.
What do I need to do to defeat them?]

385
00:23:09,078 --> 00:23:09,900
Why did he read the message so quickly?

386
00:23:12,376 --> 00:23:13,577
[Focus on important things.]

387
00:23:13,686 --> 00:23:16,271
[Prepare yourself for the competition]

388
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,371
His answers are so generic.

389
00:23:20,736 --> 00:23:22,050
It's because your question is generic.

390
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:22,879
Give me your phone.

391
00:23:22,879 --> 00:23:23,538
I'll do it.

392
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:27,996
[I am at the same level as them.

393
00:23:27,996 --> 00:23:29,328
But I don't feel confident.]

394
00:23:29,565 --> 00:23:31,138
[All my competitors are talented.]

395
00:23:35,671 --> 00:23:38,646
[Doing good things will bring you peace.]

396
00:23:39,902 --> 00:23:42,222
[Doing good things to earn love
from people around you.]

397
00:23:42,222 --> 00:23:44,747
[Surrounding yourself with good things.
Success will follow.]

398
00:23:49,789 --> 00:23:53,510
Doing good things to earn love
from people around you.

399
00:23:54,711 --> 00:23:55,731
What do I need to do?

400
00:24:11,894 --> 00:24:12,590
Err.

401
00:24:17,596 --> 00:24:18,692
Why are you bringing the pillow with you?

402
00:24:18,892 --> 00:24:20,051
The hotel has pillows.

403
00:24:20,142 --> 00:24:21,214
It's my security pillow.

404
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,298
I can't sleep without it.

405
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:23,760
I miss you so much.

406
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,278
Benz should have been here with us.

407
00:24:25,278 --> 00:24:26,179
So our group would be complete.

408
00:24:26,397 --> 00:24:27,113
The Menz gang.

409
00:24:27,441 --> 00:24:28,692
Menz-Err-Bee

410
00:24:28,765 --> 00:24:29,874
Mhee-Err-Benz

411
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:31,858
Right.

412
00:24:33,059 --> 00:24:33,821
How are you doing?

413
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:35,355
I'm studying hard.

414
00:24:35,355 --> 00:24:36,630
Is that so?

415
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:37,449
Excuse me.

416
00:24:49,164 --> 00:24:51,121
We found the secret figure.

417
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:52,615
Yes.

418
00:24:53,452 --> 00:24:54,390
Extremely rare.

419
00:24:54,849 --> 00:24:55,399
Yes.

420
00:24:56,433 --> 00:24:57,027
Damn.

421
00:24:57,027 --> 00:24:58,070
There are only 15 of us.

422
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:58,793
Why is the room so big?

423
00:24:59,212 --> 00:24:59,797
True.

424
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:01,509
Here.

425
00:25:02,656 --> 00:25:04,251
What region do you come from?

426
00:25:04,543 --> 00:25:05,316
Central region.

427
00:25:05,316 --> 00:25:06,034
I'm Anantachai.

428
00:25:06,034 --> 00:25:07,524
Me, too. I'm Kritsana.

429
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:09,848
You can go inside now.

430
00:25:09,848 --> 00:25:10,469
Yes.

431
00:25:12,879 --> 00:25:14,289
As always,
the central region has the most participants.

432
00:25:14,708 --> 00:25:15,687
There are seven of us.

433
00:25:16,634 --> 00:25:18,960
Three come from the northern region.

434
00:25:21,053 --> 00:25:22,353
I'll sit here. You sit there.

435
00:25:22,681 --> 00:25:23,181
Okay.

436
00:25:28,988 --> 00:25:30,107
Those sitting in front of us

437
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:31,784
are from the southern region.

438
00:25:32,879 --> 00:25:33,715
There are three of them.

439
00:25:34,298 --> 00:25:35,574
Those two that we met earlier,

440
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:38,260
they are from Khon Kaen.

441
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:39,984
They are Mangpor and Ton.

442
00:25:41,586 --> 00:25:43,067
My teacher told me

443
00:25:43,249 --> 00:25:47,396
the person who has a chance to beat
the former champ from Hat Yai is Mangpor.

444
00:25:48,215 --> 00:25:49,365
She is a top contender this year.

445
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:53,410
No.

446
00:25:54,284 --> 00:25:56,355
This year is different from other years.

447
00:26:01,561 --> 00:26:02,287
Because this year,

448
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:04,274
that bighead also joins the camp.

449
00:26:05,384 --> 00:26:07,300
He can defeat any former champs.

450
00:26:18,898 --> 00:26:19,617
Is he your friend?

451
00:26:24,805 --> 00:26:25,957
Why is he wearing earphones?

452
00:26:33,584 --> 00:26:35,019
There's a saying,

453
00:26:35,711 --> 00:26:38,147
an exam room is like a horse race track.

454
00:26:38,475 --> 00:26:39,493
He's talking nonsense.

455
00:26:39,493 --> 00:26:40,251
What race track?

456
00:26:40,251 --> 00:26:44,774
I'm happy to meet
the best 15 racing horses in the country.

457
00:26:45,265 --> 00:26:47,902
Congratulations on getting into this camp.

458
00:26:49,522 --> 00:26:50,606
A round of applause, please.

459
00:26:53,088 --> 00:26:54,598
You must be confused.

460
00:26:54,762 --> 00:26:56,018
I'm just kidding.

461
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:58,394
My name is Mr. Chuchuen.

462
00:26:58,394 --> 00:27:00,500
I'm the head teacher of this camp.

463
00:27:00,646 --> 00:27:02,802
I'm also one of the teachers

464
00:27:02,802 --> 00:27:06,637
who will teach you during the next 12 days.

465
00:27:07,802 --> 00:27:09,804
If you have any problems and need advice,

466
00:27:09,804 --> 00:27:12,118
feel free to come talk to me.

467
00:27:12,279 --> 00:27:13,339
About the rooms,

468
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:17,109
each room will be shared by two students.

469
00:27:17,437 --> 00:27:19,970
One room will be shared by three students.

470
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:22,067
Girls and guys cannot share a room.

471
00:27:22,067 --> 00:27:23,721
Since you are a girl and a guy,

472
00:27:23,721 --> 00:27:25,915
you will share a room with those two girls.

473
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:27,110
Right there.

474
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:32,283
Is my room bigger than the room for two?

475
00:27:33,025 --> 00:27:34,957
Is the table big enough for the three of us?

476
00:27:35,376 --> 00:27:36,754
Don't worry about that.

477
00:27:36,754 --> 00:27:37,879
I'll take care of it.

478
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:42,306
We have three boys from the northern region.

479
00:27:42,433 --> 00:27:44,839
You already have a roommate, right?

480
00:27:44,839 --> 00:27:46,259
The boy from the northern region
who doesn't have a roommate.

481
00:27:47,133 --> 00:27:48,469
You don't have a roommate.

482
00:27:48,469 --> 00:27:51,875
You can share a room with him.

483
00:27:53,003 --> 00:27:53,771
These two.

484
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:55,464
Do you know each other?

485
00:27:55,464 --> 00:27:56,506
No?

486
00:27:57,125 --> 00:27:57,949
That's good.

487
00:27:58,331 --> 00:27:59,626
It's your chance to make a new friend.

488
00:27:59,626 --> 00:28:00,854
You two will share a room.

489
00:28:00,854 --> 00:28:02,316
You will get a new friend.

490
00:28:02,316 --> 00:28:02,974
Okay.

491
00:28:03,192 --> 00:28:04,180
That school.

492
00:28:05,127 --> 00:28:07,370
Borom…Boromavidya.

493
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:08,630
Please raise your hand, Boromavidya.
Where are you?

494
00:28:12,253 --> 00:28:13,028
Mr. Chuchuen.

495
00:28:13,028 --> 00:28:14,841
Perfect, you two will share a room.

496
00:28:14,841 --> 00:28:17,606
You are from the same school.
You should share a room.

497
00:28:17,606 --> 00:28:21,612
You will share a room
with the boy from Kaenpanya School.

498
00:28:22,594 --> 00:28:23,430
Okay.

499
00:28:23,885 --> 00:28:26,000
Let's relax for today.

500
00:28:27,474 --> 00:28:28,692
(I'm Ton.)

501
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:30,923
(I'm Mhee.)

502
00:28:32,744 --> 00:28:33,443
Mhee.

503
00:28:33,589 --> 00:28:34,375
Mhee.

504
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:36,071
(Suea.)

505
00:28:36,071 --> 00:28:37,451
(Mhee.)

506
00:29:02,114 --> 00:29:04,031
Let's split the room in half.

507
00:29:06,525 --> 00:29:07,201
How?

508
00:29:09,731 --> 00:29:11,020
Split the room between the beds.

509
00:29:11,238 --> 00:29:12,672
Your bed is closer to the bathroom.

510
00:29:12,963 --> 00:29:15,309
I'll mark a line to split the room.

511
00:29:15,655 --> 00:29:17,554
So when I go to the bathroom,
I won't get into your space.

512
00:29:18,228 --> 00:29:19,768
It's split exactly in half.

513
00:29:20,439 --> 00:29:21,337
How is this the exact half?

514
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:25,685
The three-foot bed is 200 cm long
and 90 cm wide.

515
00:29:25,685 --> 00:29:28,958
Based on the size of the table, the distance from the wall to your bed is around 120 cm.

516
00:29:28,958 --> 00:29:33,022
The distance from this bed to the bathroom door
is double the size of the nightstand.

517
00:29:33,513 --> 00:29:35,061
It's approximately 150 cm long.

518
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:36,895
Half of the space between the beds
is around 50 cm.

519
00:29:39,043 --> 00:29:40,343
What size are your shoes?

520
00:29:43,328 --> 00:29:44,006
42?

521
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:48,431
The narrowest space you need
for walking around is 26 cm.

522
00:29:48,431 --> 00:29:49,879
The general size of this kind of cabinet
is 50 cm wide.

523
00:29:49,879 --> 00:29:51,376
Two of them can loosely fit the space.

524
00:29:51,376 --> 00:29:54,538
So the distance from the wall to the bed
is around 115 cm.

525
00:29:54,938 --> 00:29:56,399
Deducting the 26 cm wide path for you.

526
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:57,902
We will get the total space, including the bed.

527
00:29:58,011 --> 00:30:01,210
289 x 295 is the total space on my side.

528
00:30:01,483 --> 00:30:05,686
The total space on your side,
including the path, is 315 x 260 cm.

529
00:30:05,777 --> 00:30:07,528
It's less than 8.2 square meters.

530
00:30:09,894 --> 00:30:13,245
The space on my side is 8.5 square meters.
Am I right?

531
00:30:16,594 --> 00:30:17,481
You are right.

532
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:19,882
Your side is slightly bigger than mine.

533
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:21,582
Don't you want a bigger side?

534
00:30:22,256 --> 00:30:22,783
No.

535
00:30:24,075 --> 00:30:25,204
I can take either side.

536
00:30:27,771 --> 00:30:30,143
I just want to ask you
when you said it's split exactly in half.

537
00:30:31,035 --> 00:30:31,874
What do you mean?

538
00:30:35,005 --> 00:30:36,889
Actually, it's not the exact half.

539
00:30:37,053 --> 00:30:38,650
You want the table, right?

540
00:30:38,868 --> 00:30:39,982
That's why you want that side of the room.

541
00:30:43,714 --> 00:30:44,802
That's all you need to say.

542
00:31:02,787 --> 00:31:04,743
[I figured it out]

543
00:31:04,889 --> 00:31:06,585
[The mission that the fortune teller gave you.]

544
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:10,877
[Hurry and tell me what I need to do.
I'm so stressed right now.]

545
00:31:13,443 --> 00:31:17,635
[It means you need to
make someone close to you fall for you.]

546
00:31:17,879 --> 00:31:20,242
[Huh? How did you come up
with the interpretation?]

547
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:26,975
[It said doing good things to earn love from
people close to you to achieve success.]

548
00:31:27,266 --> 00:31:28,598
[This is a literal interpretation.]

549
00:31:29,235 --> 00:31:31,636
[Damn, it's so romantic.

550
00:31:31,636 --> 00:31:32,837
It's like what we see in a drama.]

551
00:31:33,037 --> 00:31:36,364
[Go for it, man. You can make
someone close to you fall for you.

552
00:31:36,764 --> 00:31:38,765
[Choose the person who is closest to you.]

553
00:32:02,212 --> 00:32:06,639
As you know,
four subjects will be taught in this camp.

554
00:32:06,639 --> 00:32:09,067
To keep your energy up

555
00:32:09,067 --> 00:32:10,542
and help you stay alert,

556
00:32:10,898 --> 00:32:13,972
Every day, you will be collecting points.

557
00:32:14,382 --> 00:32:17,107
The top 13 ranking will be shown in real time.

558
00:32:19,814 --> 00:32:25,106
The only rule of this camp is
that you cannot miss any class.

559
00:32:26,246 --> 00:32:28,734
If you miss a class,
your point will be deducted.

560
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:35,037
It means your chance to win the scholarship
will go down as well.

561
00:32:37,139 --> 00:32:39,519
Let's take a break from this.

562
00:32:39,661 --> 00:32:42,770
You came from different regions:
northern, southern, eastern, and western.

563
00:32:43,197 --> 00:32:46,268
Let's introduce yourself
to the teachers and classmates.

564
00:32:46,482 --> 00:32:48,611
Tell us your name, what you like,

565
00:32:48,611 --> 00:32:49,988
and why you want the scholarship.

566
00:32:49,988 --> 00:32:51,711
Let's start with this one.

567
00:32:53,082 --> 00:32:53,784
Hello.

568
00:32:54,336 --> 00:32:55,327
I'm Yo.

569
00:32:55,559 --> 00:32:56,599
Besides math,

570
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:58,693
I'm also interested in management.

571
00:32:58,996 --> 00:33:03,330
After graduating, I want to study in England
for four or five years.

572
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:06,197
So I will earn experience
that will be used to develop our country.

573
00:33:09,082 --> 00:33:09,997
Good.

574
00:33:10,994 --> 00:33:11,686
Next.

575
00:33:12,551 --> 00:33:15,629
Hello, I'm Prik-Klua.

576
00:33:15,914 --> 00:33:19,014
My name sounds spicy,
but I'm actually sweet.

577
00:33:19,014 --> 00:33:21,618
Hello, everyone. I'm Golf.

578
00:33:21,778 --> 00:33:23,496
If I get the scholarship, my dad will be happy.

579
00:33:24,066 --> 00:33:27,143
I just want to make him proud, you know.

580
00:33:27,639 --> 00:33:31,118
Hello, I'm Petch.
I'm from Satreetrang School.

581
00:33:31,118 --> 00:33:34,389
My mom is working as a nurse in the US.

582
00:33:34,496 --> 00:33:37,464
I want to move to live closer to her.

583
00:33:39,476 --> 00:33:41,634
Hello, I'm Mara.

584
00:33:41,719 --> 00:33:43,062
I'm from Hat Yai.

585
00:33:43,365 --> 00:33:45,485
My ultimate dream is to study

586
00:33:46,019 --> 00:33:47,673
and become like Iron Man.

587
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:50,528
Are you sure
you will be able to fly like Iron Man?

588
00:33:55,853 --> 00:33:56,844
I'm Mangpor.

589
00:33:57,574 --> 00:34:00,100
I come from Kaenpanya School
in Khon Kaen.

590
00:34:00,795 --> 00:34:02,318
I like studying.

591
00:34:02,532 --> 00:34:05,247
I want to keep studying. I don't want to work.

592
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:13,169
She is an ace this year.

593
00:34:13,169 --> 00:34:15,992
I heard we have a few top contenders this year.

594
00:34:16,224 --> 00:34:18,829
Another top contender is from Boromavidya.

595
00:34:19,381 --> 00:34:21,865
Where are you?

596
00:34:22,007 --> 00:34:22,949
Who comes from Boromavidya School?

597
00:34:23,163 --> 00:34:24,672
Right there.

598
00:34:27,344 --> 00:34:28,275
I'm Mawin.

599
00:34:28,613 --> 00:34:29,685
I come from Boromavidya School.

600
00:34:30,273 --> 00:34:32,375
I don't have anything
I'm interested in or good at.

601
00:34:36,082 --> 00:34:40,485
Do you have any subject
that you are good at or like?

602
00:34:41,676 --> 00:34:43,523
I'm not good at any subject in particular.

603
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,919
I've gotten straight A's,

604
00:34:46,892 --> 00:34:47,739
in every semester,

605
00:34:48,398 --> 00:34:49,055
every year.

606
00:34:56,321 --> 00:34:57,019
Great.

607
00:34:58,248 --> 00:34:59,594
He's smart.

608
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:02,543
What about you, the one in the front?

609
00:35:02,649 --> 00:35:03,781
It's your turn.

610
00:35:05,776 --> 00:35:06,328
Damn.

611
00:35:06,755 --> 00:35:08,032
Your friend is so cool.

612
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:10,409
He already made a lot of enemies
on the first day.

613
00:35:13,587 --> 00:35:15,365
You can count me as one of his enemies.

614
00:35:16,932 --> 00:35:17,999
I'm not his friend.

615
00:35:27,173 --> 00:35:30,621
Alright, you all have introduced yourself.

616
00:35:31,102 --> 00:35:36,056
Next, I'll be testing your basic knowledge.

617
00:35:36,555 --> 00:35:37,844
It's a speed quiz.

618
00:35:38,076 --> 00:35:40,635
I'll give you questions.
You will quickly answer them.

619
00:35:40,938 --> 00:35:43,606
If you know the answer,
please raise your hand.

620
00:35:44,122 --> 00:35:44,747
Okay?

621
00:35:45,159 --> 00:35:46,158
Are you ready?

622
00:35:46,746 --> 00:35:48,187
Ready?

623
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:49,365
Go.

624
00:35:52,874 --> 00:35:54,754
2 to the power of 1284

625
00:35:55,609 --> 00:35:56,330
Correct.

626
00:35:56,330 --> 00:35:57,545
Well done.

627
00:35:57,777 --> 00:35:58,498
Go.

628
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:00,195
Pi.

629
00:36:00,409 --> 00:36:01,869
You are something.

630
00:36:01,869 --> 00:36:02,462
Good job.

631
00:36:02,462 --> 00:36:02,977
Correct.

632
00:36:03,386 --> 00:36:04,088
Go.

633
00:36:04,088 --> 00:36:05,020
1/3, right?

634
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:05,668
5.

635
00:36:05,668 --> 00:36:07,132
Y = -¾ X

636
00:36:07,542 --> 00:36:08,316
cos θ

637
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:09,130
Correct.

638
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:09,756
Next.

639
00:36:11,466 --> 00:36:12,536
Equilateral triangle.

640
00:36:14,335 --> 00:36:15,162
Correct.

641
00:36:16,284 --> 00:36:17,142
Well done.

642
00:36:17,338 --> 00:36:18,823
Boromavidya.

643
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:20,843
Come on.

644
00:36:20,843 --> 00:36:22,143
You haven't answered a single question.

645
00:36:22,143 --> 00:36:23,878
Kaenpanya got several answers right.

646
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:25,666
You need to step up your game.

647
00:36:26,005 --> 00:36:29,661
The next question is a bit complex.

648
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:32,184
If you get it right, I'll give you five points.

649
00:36:32,469 --> 00:36:34,314
Raise your hand if you know the answer.

650
00:36:34,314 --> 00:36:34,974
Ready?

651
00:36:35,597 --> 00:36:36,799
Ready.

652
00:36:37,066 --> 00:36:37,604
Go.

653
00:36:40,899 --> 00:36:42,745
Take your time to solve it.

654
00:36:42,745 --> 00:36:44,187
It requires a little technique.

655
00:36:45,291 --> 00:36:46,488
I believe that you can do it.

656
00:36:46,488 --> 00:36:47,533
Give it a try.

657
00:37:07,792 --> 00:37:08,403
What is the answer?

658
00:37:10,344 --> 00:37:11,688
0 and 5/2

659
00:37:15,553 --> 00:37:16,212
Good job.

660
00:37:16,212 --> 00:37:17,246
Give him a round of applause.

661
00:37:17,246 --> 00:37:17,941
Correct.

662
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:20,244
He's pretty good.

663
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:23,844
Boromavidya chose to answer a difficult question.

664
00:37:24,004 --> 00:37:25,594
Well done.

665
00:37:26,556 --> 00:37:27,279
Good job.

666
00:37:28,044 --> 00:37:29,268
You receive five points for it.

667
00:37:34,338 --> 00:37:36,179
NO.1 MAWIN SUTTIRAKSA

668
00:37:36,179 --> 00:37:38,517
(Make someone close to you fall for you.)

669
00:37:38,517 --> 00:37:41,506
ANANTACHAI KRAIKAEW

670
00:37:49,523 --> 00:37:51,876
(Alright, Benz could be right.)

671
00:37:52,232 --> 00:37:52,866
(Let's give it a try.)

672
00:38:00,979 --> 00:38:01,710
Hey.

673
00:38:02,387 --> 00:38:03,355
Do you want to use the table with me?

674
00:38:04,459 --> 00:38:05,539
It's okay. I don't need it.

675
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,206
Hey.

676
00:38:14,883 --> 00:38:15,992
The AC airflow is blowing
straight down on your bed.

677
00:38:16,384 --> 00:38:17,583
Do you want my blanket?

678
00:38:17,583 --> 00:38:19,527
I brought an extra blanket.

679
00:38:19,669 --> 00:38:20,445
I don't feel cold.

680
00:38:23,559 --> 00:38:24,249
Hey.

681
00:38:24,249 --> 00:38:26,669
I brought several bottles of shampoo.

682
00:38:26,669 --> 00:38:27,456
I don't need them.

683
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:40,544
How can I make him like me?

684
00:38:41,292 --> 00:38:43,041
Just sharing the room with him
is already too hard.

685
00:39:24,981 --> 00:39:26,486
(What is your problem?)

686
00:39:26,664 --> 00:39:28,524
(Don't you see I'm trying to study?)

687
00:39:46,777 --> 00:39:47,541
[Benz.]

688
00:39:47,701 --> 00:39:50,098
[I don't think it's going to work,
the fortune teller's mission.]

689
00:39:50,098 --> 00:39:51,702
[This jerk is unpleasant to be around,]

690
00:39:51,702 --> 00:39:54,162
[You want me to befriend him.
I'd rather befriend a dog.]

691
00:39:54,162 --> 00:39:56,167
[He's not friendly and has no manners.]

692
00:39:56,167 --> 00:39:57,931
[Is he going to blow-dry his hair until dawn?]

693
00:39:57,931 --> 00:39:59,517
[Is your hair mid-back long, asshole?]

694
00:40:01,155 --> 00:40:03,397
I'm asking if I can turn off the light.

695
00:40:04,003 --> 00:40:04,898
I'm going to bed.

696
00:40:06,145 --> 00:40:07,708
Yes, you can turn it off.

697
00:40:34,759 --> 00:40:37,463
The person you need to make fall for you is Mawin?

698
00:40:38,407 --> 00:40:39,963
Right? I'm not sure either.

699
00:40:39,963 --> 00:40:41,563
They want to know about Mawin.

700
00:40:41,563 --> 00:40:42,480
Do you want to have dinner with me?

701
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,007
You need to find all the info about him.

702
00:40:44,007 --> 00:40:45,342
how does your friend study?

703
00:40:45,342 --> 00:40:46,586
What workbook does he use?

704
00:40:48,919 --> 00:40:51,366
How is the mission going?

705
00:40:51,366 --> 00:40:53,014
If you don't talk to him, how will he fall for you?

706
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:54,999
Didn't you try to start a convo with me
earlier today?

707
00:40:54,999 --> 00:40:55,643
So talk to me.

708
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:58,814
I'll tell you why I always wear earphones
and what I listen to.
