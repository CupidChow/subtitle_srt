Li Zixuan, congratulations

17
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,000
on becoming president
of Haiqing Tea Merchants Association.

18
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,040
Congratulations.

19
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,160
The association sent this

20
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,320
to you this morning.

21
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,280
Look.

22
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,960
Li Zixuan is appointed...

23
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,400
What's wrong? Too thrilled to speak?

24
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,040
Exactly.

25
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,360
Young Master?

26
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,040
What's wrong?

27
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,360
What's wrong?

28
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,600
Young Master!

29
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:41,960
Xiaotang!

30
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:42,880
I'm here.

31
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,520
Xiaotang!

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,560
I'm here.

33
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,000
- Zixuan.
- Xiaotang.

34
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,040
I'm here!

35
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,040
Ning An.

36
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,640
Send someone

37
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,600
to get a physician!

38
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:03,720
Yes!

39
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,200
Come.

40
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,440
Be careful.

41
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:09,600
Be careful.

42
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,520
Zixuan.

43
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,800
What's wrong with Zixuan's eyes?

44
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,200
I've consulted physicians,

45
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,120
but none

46
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,240
could diagnose.

47
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,680
You know something, right?

48
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,600
Tell me.

49
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,400
Is this related to the game?

50
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,360
Don't panic.

51
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,600
How can I not panic?

52
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,160
What is this?

53
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,480
Speak up! What is this?

54
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,080
I once believed

55
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,600
that everyone's fate in this world

56
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,400
was predetermined.

57
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,120
But I never expected

58
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,440
that fate could change.

59
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,840
A person without feelings

60
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,840
could open up

61
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,440
to another one.

62
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,640
A person without affection

63
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,040
could plant seeds
of love for another one.

64
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,400
What has happened shows

65
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,040
that both your destinies
have transformed.

66
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:30,920
So,

67
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,120
from the very beginning,

68
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,520
your fates weren't tied to the Top Tea.

69
00:03:53,918 --> 00:03:58,080
(Missions)

70
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,360
We've accomplished the missions

71
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,520
required of us.

72
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,200
Candlelight illuminates
what eyes can see,

73
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,400
revealing only surface truths.

74
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,280
To see deeper

75
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,400
requires following your heart.

76
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,840
Close your eyes.

77
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,440
Let your inner light guide your vision.

78
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,720
(In this world,)

79
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,440
(things change,)

80
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,480
(and lives change.)

81
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:44,120
(Love exists. In the sixth year
of Yuanfeng era,)

82
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,560
(Xiaotang, Li Zixuan's wife,)

83
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,920
(for some reason,)

84
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,840
(repeatedly saved Zixuan's life.)

85
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,600
(Karma changed.)

86
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,000
(Fate changed.)

87
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,840
(The couple sowed their own seeds,)

88
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,640
(thus reaping their own harvest.)

89
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,120
(Wei Xiaotang saved Li Zixuan.)

90
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,960
(She fell in love.)

91
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,880
(It happens naturally.)

92
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,520
(She risked her own life)

93
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,920
(to protect Li Zixuan)

94
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,680
(until karma is balanced.)

95
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,240
(From whence it came)

96
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,440
(to whence it returns,)

97
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,480
(Li Zixuan's forbidden longing
for Wei Xiaotang)

98
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,560
(produced love.)

99
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:34,800
(He loves her)

100
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,680
(wholeheartedly)

101
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,920
(until debts were repaid.)

102
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,520
(Throughout it all,)

103
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,880
(he follows his heart.)

104
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:45,800
(Thus,)

105
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,680
(the couple fell in love.)

106
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,880
(Apply their strengths,)

107
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,560
(and gain mutual recognition.)

108
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,000
(They got rid of Uncle.)

109
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,080
(This is a joint effort.)

110
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,800
(They won the tea competition.)

111
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,800
(This is a shared triumph.)

112
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,400
(They took down Mr. Wang.)

113
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,560
(This is a life-and-death trial.)

114
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,840
(They resolved family disputes)

115
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,760
(and revealed Mother's malice,)

116
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,960
(making the couple relieved.)

117
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,200
You made a contract.

118
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,520
I believed

119
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,800
that you were meant to make the Top Tea.

120
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,960
But I never expected

121
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,280
that your true trial

122
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,760
wouldn't be the perilous path
to victory,

123
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,960
but a contract
of letting go of each other.

124
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,920
Love is selfish,

125
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,960
yet true devotion is selfless.

126
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,680
You are

127
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,080
selfishly possessive of each other.

128
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,040
Meanwhile,
you two selflessly let go of each other.

129
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,200
This paradoxical entanglement

130
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,000
is your true destiny.

131
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,400
Zixuan's blindness
is merely the beginning.

132
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,480
He defied his fate

133
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,560
and selfishly kept you by his side.

134
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,160
He will be gone ultimately.

135
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,920
To save him,

136
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,040
you must leave,

137
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,160
selflessly letting go of him.

138
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,800
Then,

139
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,880
all memories
between you and Zixuan will vanish.

140
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,680
Time will rewind to your wedding night.

141
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,160
He will forget everything about you

142
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,840
and marry the original Wei Xiaotang,

143
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,640
living happily ever after.

144
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,200
This is the seed of fate you've sown.

145
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,680
Having tasted the fruit of love,

146
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,680
you must now
accept the bitter harvest of separation.

147
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:36,800
Xiaotang.

148
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,120
You're back.

149
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,600
I'm home.

150
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,600
Could you

151
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,440
look at the color of this tea?

152
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,080
It's good.

153
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:16,920
Actually,

154
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,720
I don't have to master tea making

155
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,240
as long as I have you.

156
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,360
Rest assured,

157
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,240
I'll help you restore your sight.

158
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,800
I was just out

159
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,200
to find you an excellent physician.

160
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,160
He'll come tomorrow,

161
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,520
and you'll regain your vision soon.

162
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,760
What's wrong with you?

163
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:07,760
Xiaotang.

164
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,400
What inspired you

165
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,720
to invite us for drinks

166
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,920
without Zixuan?

167
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,320
Acting all mysterious.

168
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,600
Well, I'll be frank with you all.

169
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,840
This is yours.

170
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,120
Here you are.

171
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,520
This...

172
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,280
This is my development plan

173
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,160
for the tea estate.

174
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,880
I wrote it for Miss Niaoniao

175
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,640
and Mr. Qi.

176
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,280
Plans for Gu's Tea Estate?

177
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,200
Oh, Zimo,

178
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,080
read this carefully.

179
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:41,720
Niaoniao,

180
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:42,640
watch him.

181
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,120
Got it?

182
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:48,000
Xiaotang, you can nag me
at home, not outside.

183
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,840
I'll read this at home.

184
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,040
Moreover,

185
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,440
you know Zixuan's recent mood

186
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,600
and condition.

187
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,120
So, when you're free,

188
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,680
you keep Zixuan company.

189
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,840
It would do him good.

190
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,880
He doesn't need our company.

191
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,240
He only needs you.

192
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,480
Exactly, Xiaotang.

193
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,600
As long as you're with Zixuan,

194
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,320
whatever challenges arise,

195
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,640
he'll overcome them all.

196
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,880
Right?

197
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:21,880
Come on.

198
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,080
Xiaotang.

199
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:23,920
Let us toast you.

200
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,200
Here.

201
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,680
Whether in ten years or twenty years,

202
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
as long as you're here,

203
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,960
we'll fear nothing.

204
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,080
Then tonight, let's get drunk!

205
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,000
- Let's get drunk!
- Let's get drunk!

206
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,120
Bottoms up!

207
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,000
The food is getting cold. Let's eat.

208
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,000
Alright.

209
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:48,800
Xiaotang, you eat.

210
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,400
It looks good.

211
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,080
Here, Zimo.

212
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,720
You're a grown man.

213
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,800
You don't have to be sober tonight.

214
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,320
- Drink up, Zimo!
- Let's drink.

215
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,440
Here.

216
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,760
Zimo, I can outdrink even you.

217
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,280
Where is Xiaotang?

218
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,200
Where is she?

219
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,080
Where is Xiaotang?

220
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,640
Where did she go?

221
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,720
When exactly did she leave?

222
00:12:39,616 --> 00:12:41,216
(Li's Milk Tea)

223
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,240
Tomorrow our shop opens.

224
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,720
I want you to invite all scholars here

225
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,600
to come.

226
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,320
I'll treat them to free milk tea.

227
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,960
Now that the major issues
are mostly resolved,

228
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,440
our getting closer...

229
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,600
(It was just a minor issue.)

230
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,560
(Is it?)

231
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,800
(This is between the two of us.)

232
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,240
(Why is an outsider involved?)

233
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,360
(Fine, I'll listen to you from now on.)

234
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,640
Miss, have some fried cakes?

235
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,560
Give it a try!

236
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,280
(How is it?)

237
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,280
(Delicious, right?)

238
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,992
♪Boundless as stars in shared gazes♪

239
00:13:57,472 --> 00:14:00,768
♪Through destiny's turns,

240
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,040
(They say when releasing sky lanterns,)

241
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,040
(wishes come true.)

242
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,680
Then I must make a wish.

243
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,080
I wish

244
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,120
to win the Top Tea title this year!

245
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,720
But if we earn the Top Tea title,

246
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,480
you'll leave.

247
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,440
Never mind.

248
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,560
Let's just live at the moment.
Happiness is the most important.

♪Across starry rivers,
I chase dreams afar♪

250
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,784
♪Arms spread wide,
falling through heaven and earth♪

00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,440
♪The rhythm of breath and heartbeat♪

00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,624
♪A meeting of the souls♪

♪Through shifting seas and lands,

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,960
♪Eyes bright as moonlit skies,

255
00:14:52,192 --> 00:14:58,368
♪Smiling gazes write eternity♪

256
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,800
(It's pouring rain.)

257
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,240
(I couldn't go back today.)

258
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,200
(You probably can't go back either.)

259
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,208
♪Through shifting seas and lands,

00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,160
(Love is selfish,)

263
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,280
(yet true devotion is selfless.)

264
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,960
(You're selfishly possessive
of each other.)

265
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:36,000
(Meanwhile, you two
selflessly let go of each other.)

266
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,360
(This paradoxical entanglement)

267
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,400
(is your true destiny.)

268
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,480
(Zixuan's blindness)

269
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,280
(is merely the beginning.)

270
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,680
(He defied his fate)

271
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,560
(and selfishly kept you by his side.)

272
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,200
(He will be gone ultimately.)

273
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,720
(To save him,)

274
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,640
(you must leave,)

275
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,840
(selflessly letting go of him.)

276
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,400
(Then,)

277
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,400
(all memories
between you and Zixuan will vanish.)

278
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,320
(Time will rewind
to your wedding night.)

279
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,920
(He will forget everything about you)

280
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,440
(and marry the original Wei Xiaotang,)

281
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,200
(living happily ever after.)

282
00:17:16,224 --> 00:17:21,024
(Li's Tea Estate)

283
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,320
Zixuan.

284
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,000
The weather is getting cold.

285
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,680
So I ordered the servants

286
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,200
to make you more clothes.

287
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,440
When they're ready,

288
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,800
you can try them.

289
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,160
Alright.

290
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,120
Freshly fried cakes!

291
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,080
What's wrong?

292
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,520
Sir, want some fried cakes?

293
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:34,880
Zixuan.

294
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,440
This is street food.

295
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,560
We've never tried it.

296
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,880
Who knows if it's clean?

297
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,480
Somehow,

298
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,840
this fried cake

299
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,240
smells familiar.

300
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,920
As if I shared this

301
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,360
with someone before.

302
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:57,920
But I can't find

303
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,600
that person again.

304
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,320
(Li Zixuan.)

305
00:19:49,984 --> 00:19:56,448
