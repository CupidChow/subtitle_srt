Se Ra!

Kim Jae Ha.

00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,890

12

Stop immediately, Kim Jae Ha!

13
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,900
Se Ra just so happens to be a witness.

14
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,180
Then all the more reason I can't stop.

15
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:06,510
You made the wrong move.

16
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:08,550
You shouldn't have crossed the line.

17
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:12,830
If you hurt Se Ra in any way, you're dead.

18
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:16,100
How scary, Eun Seon Woo.

19
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:20,100
You say that, but you could never protect anyone.

20
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,060
Don Se Ra, here...

21
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:24,010
nor your mother.

22
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,340
You bastard, where are you?

23
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:31,010
Where are you, you bastard?

24
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,800
The place where your tragedy began.

25
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,900
You have to come alone.

26
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,120
If I see so much as a single ant,

27
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,730
Don Se Ra will die.

28
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:44,700
Like your mom.

29
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:47,990
Wait...

30
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,720
right there.

31
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,770
Where are you taking me?

32
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:11,580
Untie me this instant!

33
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,870
You brought this upon yourself.

34
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:18,390
Why did you have to use your supervision and put us in this situation?

35
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,830
Turn yourself in.

36
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,860
Turn yourself in!

37
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:28,370
The ones who pushed me to the brink...

38
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:30,510
are you and Eun Seon Woo.

39
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:34,180
I'll allow you both to meet your end in a memorable place,

40
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,210
so you can look forward to that.

41
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:45,440
What did you say? Se Ra has...

42
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,970
Calm down.

43
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:49,690
We're going to save her.

44
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:52,000
What do we do about Se Ra?

45
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:58,140
The places Kim Jae Ha could go are the house I lived in with my mom

46
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,350
and Vice Chairman's villa.

47
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:04,450
Jin Mo, let's split up into two teams

48
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,190
and contact each other.

49
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,340
You move with Detective Han.

50
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:15,000
You need to be careful.

51
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,420
Where do you think you're going?

52
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,690
Stay here.

53
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:27,400
Brother, this is about Se Ra.

54
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,210
You expect me to just sit here and watch?

55
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,990
If you become in danger, too...

56
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:33,760
Na Hee.

57
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,560
Come with me.

58
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:42,310
Don't worry, Brother.

59
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,480
Where the hell is this place?

60
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,040
Se Ra is probably okay. Right?

61
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:01,260
Where is this?

62
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,510
Where have brought me to—

63
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:06,210
Keep your mouth shut if you want to live.

64
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,490
- Yeah.
- Seon Woo,

65
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:36,950
from now on, whenever I call, you must pick up before the third ring.

66
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,080
You must!

67
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,820
Yang Jin Mo, why all of a sudden?

68
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,060
Why do you think?

69
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:45,070
I'm Eun Ddo's friend, Yang Ddo.

70
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,410
Yang Ddo?

71
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:48,270
In this situation... are you crazy?

72
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:49,690
Yeah, I must be crazy.

73
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:52,760
I must be crazy about you 24/7.

74
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,900
Seon Woo, I'll go with Detective Han for today.

75
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:00,800
I'll hold on to my phone, so call me right away if anything happens.

76
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,800
I'll make a u-turn into Plan B and head straight towards you.

77
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,480
All right?

78
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:09,780
Yang Ddo, you're not just a friend.

79
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,510
You're more than that.

80
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:13,260
Don't forget that.

81
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:15,730
Thanks.

82
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,900
Eun Ddo, me, too!

83
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,100
This is...

84
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:46,030
This is...

85
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:49,050
Why did you bring me here?

86
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:53,020
While Eun Seon Woo was laying low, you two must've stayed here.

87
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:56,360
Eun Seon Woo was probably always happy here.

88
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,420
Since he was with a well-off family,

89
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:02,540
and the woman he loves as well.

90
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,600
No.

91
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,830
Chairman was never happy.

92
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:10,350
Since you made his memories of this place into hell.

93
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:12,510
Hell?

94
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:16,990
You think Eun Seon Woo even knows what real hell is like?

95
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:19,330
It was a constant hell for me,

96
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:24,810
when I saw Eun Seon Woo here, always, every time, constantly.

97
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:29,290
Like a scene from a drawing, they're the only ones who looked happy.

98
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:32,140
Is that why you killed her, too?

99
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:34,760
Me?

100
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,700
I just helped my father.

101
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:41,320
If a child doesn't care for his father, who will?

102
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,740
You're insane.

103
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:48,320
How could you kill someone out of fear of being abandoned by your father?

104
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:52,320
Chairman's mother... you're the one who killed her.

105
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:56,320
You probably killed your father in fear of being caught.

106
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:01,120
Father brought that upon himself.

107
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,410
And, Don Se Ra,

108
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:11,530
do you know why you were abandoned?

109
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:17,810
It's because you were born with those unlucky eyes.

110
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:23,590
Is that...

111
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:26,530
Is that why my father also abandoned me?

112
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:29,830
Just because of that...

113
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,520
You really think your blue eye...

114
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,940
that your blue eye is the reason you were abandoned?

115
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:39,110
I warned you ever since then.

116
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:42,270
The Blue Goblin...

117
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:45,650
If you tell anyone, you'll die.

118
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:53,960
Se Ra, just stay safe.

119
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,800
Please.

120
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,020
The door's locked?

121
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:15,280
Let's try the side.

122
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:30,860
Wait!

123
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:33,180
Get away from there!

124
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,210
Come take a look from here.

125
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:40,450
It's a trap.

126
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:42,600
The fact that he set a trap and was waiting for us...

127
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,510
This means that he knew we would come here.

128
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,890
But where's Chairman Eun Seon Woo?

129
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:53,370
Kim Jae Ha told him to come alone,

130
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:56,910
so he went alone, to keep Se Ra safe.

131
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,340
What?

132
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:02,000
There's definitely a trap there, too.

133
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,890
Let's hurry.

134
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,050
Kim Jae Ha, that bastard!

135
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:36,900
He's using a classic method... Gosh.

136
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,730
He's not to be messed with.

137
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:42,320
This won't do. Call for backup,

138
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,080
and let's walk as far out as we can.

139
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,560
We'll be able to catch a car to the orphanage if we go a bit further out.

140
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,340
Hold on.

141
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,180
After the whole ordeal with President Byeon,

142
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:56,380
I installed a tracking device on Seon Woo's wristwatch.

143
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,440
He's near Seon Woo's villa.

144
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,360
But isn't this illegal?

145
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:22,480
Eun Seon Woo is actually fearlessly coming alone.

146
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,520
For you.

147
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:27,630
What an incredible love.

148
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:37,790
Take a good look.

149
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:40,970
Since today will be the last time you get to see him.

150
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:43,760
Let go of me, you crazy bastard!

151
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:51,680
Untie me.

152
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,530
Untie me!

153
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:57,120
Stay put.

154
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,900
Untie me this instant, you crazy bastard!

155
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,620
Save me...

156
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,290
What is this? What is this?

157
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:22,270
- What is this?
- It's nothing, nothing.

158
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:26,140
With even the slightest shock, that will go "boom!"

159
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,150
If you do anything reckless and that explodes,

160
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:35,370
everything, including your neck, will fly off, so...

161
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,870
it's a good idea to keep your mouth shut.

162
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:41,200
Wait here.

163
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,860
[Unknown Number]

164
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,500
You see me, right?

165
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,660
As you can tell, I came alone.

166
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:02,370
Keep your promise that you won't hurt Don Se Ra.

167
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:06,380
Don Se Ra is waiting patiently for you to come.

168
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,200
Hurry up.

169
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,240
You need to check if Don Se Ra is unhurt.

170
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,370
The place where your tragedy began.

171
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:44,220
Wait.

172
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:47,430
There aren't any cars passing by!

173
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:49,770
I'm sorry!

174
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:53,430
When will the backup arrive?

175
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:57,110
But shouldn't we send them to Chairmain Eun Seon Woo first?

176
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:58,400
She's right.

177
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,350
Seon Woo is alone right now.

178
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:05,760
Let's... keep walking for now!

179
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,250
There isn't a car in sight!

180
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,680
What cars were you talking about?

181
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:28,710
You look tired. Why don't you catch your breath, Chairman?

182
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,840
There's no rush here.

183
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:39,650
And you share this place of memory with me,

184
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:42,650
you should take a moment to...

185
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:45,870
miss your mom like the good son you are.

186
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,140
I warned you not to cross the line.

187
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,350
Where's Don Se Ra?

188
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:56,640
I'm not sure.

189
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:02,360
She's probably desperately waiting somewhere for you to save her.

190
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:06,950
Where could Don Se Ra be?

191
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:08,910
You bastard.

192
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:11,760
Kim Jae Ha, you crazy bastard!

193
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,900
What the hell are you doing?

194
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:06,230
You're not in a position to yell at me, are you?

195
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:13,580
With a wrong press of this button, Don Se Ra's life will be over.

196
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,140
If something happens to Don Se Ra,

197
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:19,170
I won't leave you alone.

198
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:22,380
I don't think you comprehend the situation.

199
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:27,190
This is where you plead with me, not threaten me.

200
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:31,600
What is it that you want?

201
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:58,060
You were so high and mighty just now...

202
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:02,620
did you lose your fighting spirit?

203
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:09,130
I'll do what you want,

204
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:11,540
so throw that switch away.

205
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,960
Let Don Se Ra go,

206
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,550
and you and I should resolve this.

207
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:22,600
I'm still confused about whether you're pleading with me or ordering me.

208
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:27,700
If you're pleading, you should at least get on your knees.

209
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:35,720
I won't tell you twice.

210
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,300
Kneel.

211
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,550
Happy now?

212
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:59,450
Are you satisfied?

213
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,840
You should've done so sooner.

214
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:01,420
This place might have been the beginning of your tragedy,

215
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,390
but it wasn't for me.

216
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:09,000
What I couldn't have, no matter how hard I tried,

217
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:14,870
you already held everything in your hands.

218
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:18,520
Not just you, but your parents, too.

219
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,790
Especially your mom.

220
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:26,420
It seemed like she was sharing everything in the name of volunteering,

221
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:31,080
but she was just showing that she's fundamentally different from us.

222
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:35,920
She just viewed us pitifully.

223
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,270
It was disgusting.

224
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,060
Sure.

225
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,150
My father was the same.

226
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,670
He'd keep you by his side if he needed you,

227
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:50,980
and discard you without a second look if he didn't.

228
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:54,040
You should've blamed your father.

229
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:57,140
Is that why you killed her?

230
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:59,110
Because of your victim mentality?

231
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:01,830
My innocent mother?

232
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:04,840
I didn't intend to kill her in the beginning.

233
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,060
I thought she was already dead.

234
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,680
What?

235
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,590
Your mom...

236
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,740
was alive.

237
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:25,740
Keep listening.

238
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:29,790
What I never told anyone else...

239
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:32,420
you need to listen to it.

240
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,440
I know you're curious.

241
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,190
Say it again.

242
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:48,410
My mother...

243
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,650
was alive?

244
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:53,270
That's right.

245
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:58,200
I still clearly remember the way she looked at me as she gasped for air

246
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,810
as if she'd die any second.

247
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:02,610
Then you...

248
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:03,980
Yes.

249
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:08,460
I... I'm the one who finished her off.

250
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:11,790
Because if I hadn't, I was worried my relationship with Father...

251
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:14,420
would become complicated.

252
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:19,260
I'm as much of a good son as you are.

253
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,670
You son of a bitch!

254
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:23,400
I'm going to kill you!

255
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:40,230
Why did you kill my mother?

256
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:42,220
She never did anything wrong to you!

257
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,880
My innocent mother!

258
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:48,800
She didn't do anything wrong?

259
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,690
Why didn't she do anything wrong?

260
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:54,180
She pitied me.

261
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,730
She felt bad for me.

262
00:21:56,730 --> 00:22:00,070
You guys were the only happy ones!

263
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:02,620
During my 20 miserable years...

264
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,760
were you happy?

265
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:09,450
Did Vice Chairman Kang Wan Soo approve of you?

266
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,000
You're a more pitiful bastard than I am.

267
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,840
What?

268
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:20,420
You dare to pity me?

269
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:23,210
Like your mom did?

270
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:28,760
My mom was sincere towards an asshole like you!

271
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,620
Towards a son of a bitch like you!

272
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:40,840
Die!

273
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,560
Die!

274
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:47,350
Die!

275
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,460
Chairman!

276
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,700
Chairman, are you okay?

277
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:57,700
Are you really okay?

278
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:00,460
Yes, I'm fine, so don't worry about me.

279
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:03,470
What's with your face? Gosh.

280
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:06,560
We need to catch him!

281
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:09,140
Stay still. Are you really okay?

282
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,900
Don't worry about me.

283
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,900
We need to catch him first.

284
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,560
I'll be the one to catch him.

285
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,630
You stay here.

286
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:21,640
- Hey!
- Se Ra!

287
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,370
Se Ra!

288
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:26,720
- Seon Woo!
- Are you okay?

289
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,940
Hey, what happened to you?

290
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:32,060
More importantly, we need to catch Kim Jae Ha first.

291
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:34,130
He ran away but couldn't have gotten far.

292
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:35,380
I'll take care of it.

293
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:37,930
What are you saying when I'm the police?

294
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:39,340
Jin Mo.

295
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:42,370
You're still tracking me, right?

296
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:44,690
Yeah.

297
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:46,620
I-I am.

298
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:59,190
But how did you know I was tracking you?

299
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:01,750
You always have a Plan B.

300
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,560
That's right.

301
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,900
I'll chase after Kim Jae Ha.

302
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,320
You take care of Se Ra.

303
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,020
We don't know when Kim Jae Ha will return, so it's not safe.

304
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:10,980
Be careful.

305
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:19,770
Brother!

306
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:23,770
I thought this might come in handy later.

307
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,520
All right.

308
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:35,680
Attorney Yang, please take good care of them.

309
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,560
All right.

310
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:22,520
Hit me.

311
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:26,260
You want to kill me.

312
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:29,760
You win if you kill me.

313
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,170
Kill me!

314
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:33,430
Go on and kill me!

315
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:38,340
Hurry and hit me!

316
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:41,900
So this was your intention.

317
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:46,390
To make me into a murderer like you.

318
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,270
I'll do as you wish.

319
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:24,460
He even killed someone 20 years ago,

320
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:28,790
abducted our Se Ra, and even tried to kill Chairman,

321
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:31,840
so Kim Jae Ha will be severely punished. Right?

322
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,190
Of course.

323
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:37,030
He'll rot in prison for life.

324
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:40,350
I'm here, Honey.

325
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,900
What a long day.

326
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,520
It was rough, wasn't it?

327
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,900
Because of me.

328
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:50,490
Don't blame yourself.

329
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:52,950
I'm fine.

330
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:58,000
Look at your face.

331
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,860
My goodness...

332
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,820
Are you worried about me right now?

333
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:04,300
Did you think I wouldn't be?

334
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:07,250
Your body and your face, it breaks my heart.

335
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:13,550
♫ Your smile which was always out of reach ♫

336
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:17,200
You worried more...

337

There was no perfect crime.

00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:14,900
The culprit of Yoon Seong Hee's murder has been caught after 20 years.

353
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:17,370
Sources say there was unexpected special cooperation

354
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:21,480
between a police officer and a detective.

355
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,280
[The truth revealed after 20 years, justice is served!]
K, the culprit of this case,

356
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:27,400
and Kang Wan Soo, Eunkang Group's former Vice Chairman, who recently attempted suicide

357
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,990
turned out to be accomplices.

358
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:31,640
The fact that the two of them were father and son

359
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:34,550
[Eunkang]
is even more shocking.

360
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:37,580
Is that true?

361
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:40,470
Father and Assistant Kim...

362
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:42,670
Yes.

363
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:46,730
Kim Jae Ha is your half-brother.

364
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:49,000
No way.

365
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,630
Then Father really killed your...

366
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:55,460
It's true.

367
00:30:55,460 --> 00:31:00,350
And your older brother, Kim Jae Ha, tried to murder your father.

368
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:01,750
And one more thing.

369
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:03,510
Were you aware...

370
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:07,240
that Vice Chairman Kang attempted to kill Oh Ah Ra's child?

371
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,700
Oh Ah Ra's child?

372
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:12,520
Oh Ah Ra became pregnant with your child seven years ago.

373
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,920
And she decided to keep that child.

374
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:21,320
But in the end, Vice Chairman ordered for that child to be killed.

375
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,590
What are you saying?

376
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,080
It's my child?

377
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:28,080
Father tried to kill my child?

378
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,780
Thanks to the nurse who helped during the childbirth,

379
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:33,460
they were able to save the child's life.

380
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:37,560
The child's name is Kang Han Byeol.

381
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:53,810
Your future should be decided by you.

382
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:58,460
This child...

383
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:02,740
is really my child?

384
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:05,410
Confess to everything you've done

385
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:08,110
and if you possess the courage to pay for your crimes,

386
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:10,380
I'll ask her for you.

387
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:13,140
If she wants to meet you or...

388
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:15,770
if she'd rather not for the rest of her life.

389
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:22,580
I hope you don't follow your father's path, Kang Tae Joon.

390
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:06,600
Where should I start?

391
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:10,410
You have too many charges.

392
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:13,010
Abduction and confinement of Don Se Ra,

393
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:16,850
assault and attempted murder of Eun Seon Woo,

394
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:19,640
attempted murder of Vice Chairman Kang Wan Soo,

395
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:23,240
and murder of Mrs. Yoon Seong Hee...

396
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,880
20 years ago.

397
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:30,840
I didn't kill her.

398
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,940
I was just a witness.

399
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:36,500
That was the doing of Vice Chairman Kang Wan Soo.

400
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,700
A witness?

401
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,760
The actual witness is someone else.

402
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:45,050
You going to continue with your lie?

403
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:48,160
Witness...

404
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:52,650
It's been over 20 years since it happened.

405
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:56,050
How can you trust the words of an eight-year-old kid?

406
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:58,850
The day you abducted Don Se Ra,

407
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:01,280
this is a recording of you confessing everything.

408
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,170
And...

409
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:07,280
what if Vice Chairman Kang Wan Soo personally testified?

410
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:10,070
He's alive?

411
00:34:32,450 --> 00:34:34,290
Father,

412
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:38,620
did you really try to kill my child?

413
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:45,250
I wanted to become like you.

414
00:34:45,910 --> 00:34:48,000
I looked up to you.

415
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,720
That's why I took any means necessary to...

416
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:59,850
But I no longer want to become like you.

417
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:02,580
I'm scared I might become like you.

418
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:07,100
I'm going to turn myself in.

419
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:10,410
I'm going to confess everything I did and pay for my crimes.

420
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:12,420
After that,

421
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:18,240
I'm going to meet my child.

422
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,070
I have no more business with you.

423
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:24,990
Spend your entire life repenting.

Where? A detective agency?

427
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:07,520
Yes, it's run alongside our office.

Yes, yes. Okay.

429
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:12,420
Okay, okay.

430
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:14,340
The phone.

431
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:16,820
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

432
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,890
Yes, this is a lawyer's office.

433
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:22,490
A detective agency?

434
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:25,040
There's no separate number for that.

435
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,180
Yes, all right.

436
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,160
- Hello?
- Yes, hello? This is Yang Jin Mo—

This is the lawyer's office.

438
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:39,870
Chairman, here...

439
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,540
It's a necklace.

440
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:48,320
In your eyes, which one looks better?

441
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,530
In my opinion, I think a ring would be better than a necklace...

442
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:53,870
and a bracelet would be better than a ring...

443
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:56,230
A thick gold bracelet...

444
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,740
Wait, not something you want.

445
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:03,160
But what would suit Don Se Ra better?

446
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,260
That's what I'm asking you.

447
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:09,240
Oh, something that would suit Don Se Ra...

448
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:13,660
Wait, but when did it go from flirting to dating?

449
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:17,830
I think you're the only one who wasn't aware.

450
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:20,730
It's been quite a while.

451
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:25,600
Oh, I see... I offer belated congratulations.

452
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,780
If it's a gift commemorating the start of a relationship,

453
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,880
I think a ring...

454
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,580
Yes, a ring would be best.

455
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:34,420
Rings are originally a garakji
(Type of ring)

456
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:36,280
that is split in half.

457
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:41,030
I don't know how it's related to the Garak area, but when you think of rings—

458
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:43,560
"Diamonds are forever." It comes out in 007.

459

"Diamonds are forever."

460
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:50,810
Rings... are something I'll save for when we get married.

461
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:55,910
Director Hong, do you know the reason why I always ask you to get out?

462
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:58,550
Well, that's in order for you to focus on work...

463
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:01,690
or because the secret base might be discovered...

464
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:05,280
It would be great if you could just answer the question I asked you,

465
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,260
but you talk too much.

466
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:11,180
If you reduce your words,

467
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:15,550
you can also reduce the distance between us.

468
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:17,870
Now you may...

469
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:19,660
leave.

470
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,560
Yes, Na Hee, there's a favor I'd like to ask you.

471
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:35,080
"From one to ten, they're all words for you..."

"A story told by the heart, not the mind."

473
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:41,130
Should I stop? Should I resign?

474
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:42,800
Gosh!

- Chairman!
- What the? You were here?

476
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:47,210
- Oh, I was just about to—
- Come on.

477
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:49,410
Attorney Yang's phone is about to explode.

478

482

Anyway, look at this.

I don't know where the information leaked,

484

but people believe I work with the investigator who solved your case,

485
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:15,710
and a variety of old and new cases alike are being referred to me.

Wow, today is the first time this many people visited my forum,

- Hi!

00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,380
Spicy.

492
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:30,990
Sweet, I came because I thought you might be busy.

493
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:32,400
Huh? Spicy?

494
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,250
Sweet? What are you, sweet and sour?

495
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:37,380
- Huh? Sweet?
- And Sour?

496

That's pretty good.

It's pretty.

It looks like the one from Sonyeo Restaurant—

I've offended the tteokbokki from a luxurious restaurant.

01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:35,740
How long has it been since we had a vacation?

822
01:00:35,740 --> 01:00:37,310
Wait.

823
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,450
Eun Seon Woo, this punk was feeling sorry, so he...

824
01:00:43,450 --> 01:00:44,630
What is it?

825
01:00:44,630 --> 01:00:46,880
Tickets to Paris.

826
01:00:47,650 --> 01:00:53,410
Since things turned out like this, should we just go to Paris and go on a food tour?

827
01:00:53,410 --> 01:00:55,150
Paris Food Tour?

828
01:00:55,150 --> 01:00:58,820
Why? You don't like it?

829
01:00:58,820 --> 01:01:02,320
It was my dream!

830
01:01:04,290 --> 01:01:06,170
What will you do now?

831
01:01:06,170 --> 01:01:09,880
Every single day will be like a dream.

832
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:14,000
♫ Since when did it start? ♫

833
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,490
♫ My heart that was wavering, like the breezy spring ♫

834
01:01:16,490 --> 01:01:17,990
Okay!

835
01:01:17,990 --> 01:01:21,200
Let's go!

836
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:22,590
Let's go!

837
01:01:22,590 --> 01:01:25,230
Party tonight!

838
01:01:25,230 --> 01:01:30,140
♫ The words that I practiced so much, "I like you" ♫

839
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:32,050
It's pretty, isn't it?

840
01:01:32,050 --> 01:01:34,060
The color is so pretty.

841
01:01:34,060 --> 01:01:38,130
It's like the color of an aurora.

842
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:40,910
Cheers.

843
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:45,610
It's good.

844
01:01:45,610 --> 01:01:48,610
This tea is from that photography studio uncle, right?

845
01:01:48,610 --> 01:01:50,440
It is.

846
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:53,590
You don't know how much tea I bought in compensation for the photo.

847
01:01:53,590 --> 01:01:56,730
I gave it all to my staff.

848
01:01:56,730 --> 01:02:01,150
I can drink it every single day with you.

849
01:02:07,010 --> 01:02:09,060
Wait...

850
01:02:09,060 --> 01:02:14,330
Is that like a proposal or something?

851
01:02:14,330 --> 01:02:18,370
That you want to stay with me forever?

852
01:02:19,850 --> 01:02:23,060
If it is, will you accept it?

853
01:02:23,060 --> 01:02:25,080
Of course not.

854
01:02:27,020 --> 01:02:29,780
Don't. Don't you dare do it!

855
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:33,550
Since I'm going to do it.

856
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:38,720
Seriously.

857
01:02:41,540 --> 01:02:45,900
Well then, what about this?

858
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:03,650
♫ Even if love is predictable ♫

859
01:03:03,650 --> 01:03:06,120
This won't do.

860
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:08,390
- You're cold, right?
- Huh?

861
01:03:08,390 --> 01:03:09,830
I think you're cold. Here.

862
01:03:09,830 --> 01:03:12,610
♫ It's what I absolutely want to tell you ♫

863
01:03:12,610 --> 01:03:14,010
There.

864
01:03:14,010 --> 01:03:17,790
- I'm not that cold.
- Oh, yeah?

865
01:03:17,790 --> 01:03:20,120
Where are you taking me?

866
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:23,370
I'm wrapping you up and stealing you.

Don Se Ra! Where are you going?

879
01:04:40,910 --> 01:04:42,250
This place...

880
01:04:42,250 --> 01:04:44,450
I think this is the place!

881
01:04:44,450 --> 01:04:48,200
You know the Mosoon Village case we received on our forum?

882
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:50,660
How their house burned down from a fire,

883
01:04:50,660 --> 01:04:51,940
but the mother disappeared

884
01:04:51,940 --> 01:04:55,610
and there was a lot of blood at the scene, but no corpse found.

885
01:04:55,610 --> 01:04:57,260
Oh, is it?

886
01:04:57,260 --> 01:04:59,210
Let's stop by here.

887
01:04:59,210 --> 01:05:02,070
What are you talking about? We're on vacation right now.

888
01:05:02,070 --> 01:05:05,040
We're already here, how can we just ignore it?

889
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:07,230
We can just go back the way we came.

890
01:05:07,230 --> 01:05:08,950
Hey, let's stop by!

891
01:05:08,950 --> 01:05:15,350
The only person who can solve this mystery is my babe.

892
01:05:17,060 --> 01:05:19,350
My honey must be happy.

893
01:05:19,350 --> 01:05:22,420
That I'm yours.

894
01:05:22,420 --> 01:05:25,580
Okay then, shall we get to the bottom of this?

895
01:05:25,580 --> 01:05:27,940
Okay, follow me.

896
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:44,900
- What the?
- What the?

897
