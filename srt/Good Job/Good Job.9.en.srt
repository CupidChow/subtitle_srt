[Episode 9]

8
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:25,850
Vice Chairman Kang Wan Soo's appointment as CEO

9
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:29,710
will be carried out by a vote of the Board of Directors.

10
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:39,160
Those in support, please raise your hands.

11
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:50,720
Please rest your hands.

12
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,400
Please raise your hands if you disagree.

13
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:34,790
Why are you all so surprised as if you've seen a ghost?

14
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:38,320
Have I intruded into where I can't come?

15
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:42,550
All of you seem to be doing well...

16
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,680
I was going to take a longer rest,

17
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,870
but I heard that there was an emergency board meeting,

18
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,070
so I came in a hurry.

19
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:59,050
I didn't know that Eunkang Group was this quick with work.

20
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:01,780
How can I die of injustice?

21
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,850
For the appointment of a new chairman to...

22
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,510
take place even before the funeral...

23
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:08,960
Oh, yeah.

24
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:12,590
You haven't even confirmed his death, right?

25
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,410
Wouldn't anyone do the same?

26
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:17,640
We can't have a criminal as the chairman.

27
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,740
We can't have a criminal as a manager, if I recall.

28
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:24,290
I, who is just a good citizen...

29
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:29,600
almost got killed while trying to find the culprit.

30
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:37,540
Since the chairman is back,

31
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:41,680
let's just say that this emergency board meeting didn't happen in the first place.

32
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,040
- That sounds all right.
- What's the meaning of this?

33
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:48,220
Right at this moment,

34
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:52,540
every single one of you, I'll make sure to remember.

35
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,450
It seems that you need to have some words without me here,

36
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:02,410
so it'd be better for me to leave first. Right?

37
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:21,070
W-What exactly happened here?

38
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,880
I trusted you and followed you,

39
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,560
only to get on the chairman's

40
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,600
- bad side, geez.
- That's true.

41
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,160
If Chairman Eun's words are true,

42
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,370
we can't trust you anymore, Vice Chairman.

43
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:33,850
What do you mean that you can't trust us

44
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:38,290
when you're just trying to get on Eun Seon Woo's side now, now that he's here like a bat!

45
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:40,260
Enough.

46
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:44,530
I'll take care of this as not to cause you trouble, so rest assured, please.

47
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,340
See you later.

48
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,750
What's going to happen to us now?

49
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,930
When you opened the door wide and entered,

50
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:59,680
they looked like they saw a ghost, Chairman.

51
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,030
You went through a lot while I was missing, right?

52

[10 days before the shareholders' meeting]

53
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,590
Director Hong!
[10 days before the shareholders' meeting]

54
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:09,980
Director Hong.

55
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,290
You said you were best friends!

56
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:14,400
How could you do this, huh?

57
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:20,220
Seon Woo is alive and well.

58
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,180
- He's alive.
- What?

59
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:25,440
Is that true? He's alive?

60
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,920
Are you with Ms. Don Se Ra, right now?

61
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,620
Then I'm really disappointed.

62
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:34,630
How could you do this to me?

63
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,540
Am I not your Secretary Director, Chairman?

64
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:39,580
You should've told me in advance!

65
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,410
I'm gravely disappointed, seriously.

66
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:44,970
Who is my one and only Secretary Director forever?

67
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:48,200
It's you, Director Hong! Isn't that right?

68
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,130
Does everything need to be said in words between us?

69
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:53,230
I'm quite largely upset and

70
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:56,520
about to be disappointed in you, Director Hong.

71
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,930
Please pull yourself together nice and clear.

72
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:04,860
There's something that you need to do for me, dear Director Hong.

73
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,960
Hello, Director Hong.

74
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,860
I was about to call you anyway.

75
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,110
I see.

76
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:14,760
I, too, have something to tell you, Vice Chairman.

77
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,290
Is that so?

78
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:18,850
Then let's go to my office.

79
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:23,760
I didn't know that having a younger boss was this difficult of a job.

80
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:28,080
I was worried since he is quite the fickle character,

81
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,030
but I didn't know that it'd be this bad.

82
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:33,460
I also sat Seon Woo as the chairman

83
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:36,660
in respect of the previous chairman's will...

84
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:41,110
But perhaps because of his youth, it's not quite like how I wish things are.

85
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:45,190
I think it's about time for you to step up.

86
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:48,160
The shareholders are being shaken at large.

87
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,570
I hope that you, Vice Chairman, will take the center stage.

88
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,160
A lot of the shareholders

89
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:01,330
trust and follow the previous chairman and Seon Woo.

90
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:03,510
It won't be easy.

91
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:09,060
That's not a reason for us to leave the seat of the chairman empty in this dire time.

92
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:12,020
Since I have been seeing them for a long time,

93
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:15,490
I'll try to convince each and every shareholder.

94
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:17,090
- Hello.
- Hello.

95
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:18,810
Whenever the company was in a pinch, you sirs were always...

96
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:20,440
Geez, don't even mention it.

97
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:25,070
I had to meet every shareholder and convince them...

98
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:28,600
That's not all. You even fooled Vice Chairman!

99
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,950
Ms. Se Ra, you know me well. Right?

100
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:34,720
My method acting. The three combos.

101
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:42,370
Let's go inside.

102
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:50,420
I'm glad that you're safe.

103
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,540
Don't misunderstand me, please.

104
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:58,100
It was all because I couldn't just abandon the board members' wishes and worries.

105
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,850
I guess you didn't worry about me?

106
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:03,080
A misunderstanding?

107
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,870
Is there anything to misunderstand?

108
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:13,990
Also, Chief Manager Kang will be sent to the U.S. branch for multiple reasons.

109
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:18,190
You're quite hasty, which is unlike you, Vice Chairman.

110
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:20,440
Making it show.

111
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:25,180
There are a lot of things that Manager Kang has to resolve. Am I right?

112
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:42,980
If you're not capable, at least don't cause trouble!

113
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,600
You made the matter worse on top of that?

114
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,130
I was just trying to do well...

115
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:50,070
It's not like I knew this would happen.

116
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:51,940
I also did some thinking.

117
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,530
Thinking?

118
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:57,200
You made a paper company to embezzle the company funds and

119
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,620
used it as your personal fund. Is that something a thinking person would do?

120
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:04,580
Did you think that everything will sail smoothly if you just bring a platform developer?

121
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:07,600
One from a rival company that's sure to cause trouble!

122
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,630
You did that and what? You did some "thinking"?

123
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,870
Only if Eun Seon Woo, that bastard, didn't interfere,

124
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:14,500
I'd have had everything covered.

125
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,540
Get your hands off of every matter.

126
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:21,030
Get your hands off and be on your own terms.

127
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,910
Do you know why that asshole is doing that?

128
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:31,150
It's all because of the necklace.

129
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:33,990
You just need to say how you got that necklace, Father.

130
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,640
Then everything would be resolved.

131
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:40,310
Is Eun Seon Woo, that asshole, thinking that

132
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:44,420
you're the one who killed his mother?

133
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,800
Shut your mouth!

134
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,310
How is President Byeon doing?

135
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:50,040
I told him to hide away.

136
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,500
- Keep a good watch.
- Yes.

137
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,430
You go on about your way now.

138
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:09,470
Chairman Eun...

139
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:12,390
is very different from the previous chairman.

140
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:15,540
I think he faked his death and hid

141
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,900
to buy more time.

142
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:21,820
Seeing that he brought up the necklace to Manager Kang Tae Joon,

143
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:24,540
I'm certain he's digging into the past case.

144
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,750
I can't tolerate Chairman Eun running wild any longer.

145
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,200
What should I do?

146
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:35,870
What did Vice Chairman say?

147
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,660
If it's you, the brain,

148
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:41,000
I think you already know.

149
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:45,830
Oh, but when did you know, Se Ra?

150
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:47,760
That Chairman was alive.

151
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,310
Um... well... is that really important?

152
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:53,950
It's enough that he has returned.

153
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:55,410
It's important to me.

154
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:59,020
Please tell me. When did you know?

155
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,480
Hey, Director Hong!

156
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,150
Vice Chairman Kang isn't someone to just sit back and take a hit.

157
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:05,770
He might act first,

158
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:09,990
so we must find the man in that photo before he does.

159
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:16,640
- Okay, but—
- Director Hong?

160
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,030
You know that now isn't the time...

161
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:21,260
to be like this. Right?

162
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,410

00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,190
Hey!

329
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:02,400
I heard the news.

330
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,710
Kang Tae Joon got arrested, huh?

331
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:09,480
Since his son get arrested before his eyes...

332
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:13,550
He'll start blindly tearing things apart now.

333
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:16,110
We must find solid evidence to hold him down.

334
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:18,140
Of course, we do.

335
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:20,010
Gosh...

336
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:25,380
Hey, are you trying to become Yang "Jjin" Mo now?
(Fat)

337
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,620
Are you bulking up?

338
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:29,450
You never liked bread before, but why are you eating it so often now?

339
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:33,840
Why haven't I been eating this delicious bread until now?

340
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,180
Na Hee's bread looks carelessly made,

341
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:39,460
but it's soft and delicious.

342
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:43,830
I guess your allergy is gone now, huh?

343
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:45,970
Speaking of...

344
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:47,210
Na Hee...

345
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:50,130
made this organically because of my allergy.

346
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:52,740
Since she added love to the mix,

347
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:55,180
it's goodbye to my allergy. Goodbye.

348
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,160
Looking at you go like this,

349
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:00,900
it'll probably last exactly one week. Your one-sided love.

350
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,100
You little...

351
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,940
One-sided love?

352
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:08,350
Whatever.

353
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:11,120
What would you know about love?

354
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:16,590
What can I say to someone who believes a relationship is just based on hormones?

355
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:18,510
Seon Woo...

356
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:21,040
when it comes to people,

357
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,450
when they're in love...

358
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:26,760
it's like taking a heart you even forgot existed

359
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:31,060
and resuscitating it back to life— Nevermind.

360
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,650
That's weak, too.

361
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:33,990
It's like taking a dead heart,

362
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:37,250
and jolting it back to life with a defibrillator

363
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,130
and coming back to life.

364
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:40,190
God!

365
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:42,110
Disgusting! Hey!

366
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:44,410
So disgusting. Chew before you speak!

367
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:46,550
Looking at you overreact like this,

368
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:49,200
a big slump is coming your way.

369
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,690
Let's quit it, gosh.

370
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,150
Seriously.

371
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:58,100
Oh, hey!

372
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:00,840
Why? Why, why?

373
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,510
Sit down.

374
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,590
Hey.

375
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,920
You know...

376
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:13,320
how you were at the villa with Se Ra for a few days?

377
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,220
You didn't feel anything?

378
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:21,080
Even if your heart didn't go, "bam-bam,"

379
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,940
it must've at least gone, "pitter-patter."

380
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:29,020
What's wrong with a smart guy like you?

381
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:32,870
Hearts will pound even if you stay still.

382
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:38,460
Forget it.

383
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,720
Forget it, you might have a cold mind,

384
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,720
but there's no way Eun Seon Woo possesses a pounding heart.

385

What are you saying?

386
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:47,310
Bullshit.

Second-floor lawyer?

I'll go since you're busy.

No, no! He's our best customer,

so I should personally deliver it to him.

How could Eunkang Group's Chairman look like this?

Okay!

You should pay attention to your outfit since you're going to a meeting, right?

427
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,760
If you clumsily go with a filthy shirt like this,

428
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,880
the employees will point fingers at you.

Geez, you must not know.

00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:13,530
Wait! What did you just say?

494
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:16,080
Oh, Don Se Ra! Where's Don Se Ra?

495
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,800
Oh, Se Ra! Right, right, Se Ra.

496
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,680
Her legs are swollen. She said she sprained them.

497
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:23,170
And I'm not sure if she has a cold, but it seems like she has a fever,

498
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:24,260
so I told her to hurry home and get some rest.

499
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:26,760
Wait, you just sent her home?

500
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,650
Gosh, look at those eyes.

501
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:31,510
You're such a wicked business owner!

502
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:35,210
You should send a sick person home. Were you going to keep her here from 9-6?

503
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:36,450
That's not what I meant—

504
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:39,400
If her legs are so swollen, she can't walk and she has a fever,

505
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,610
I'm asking why you sent her home and not to a hospital,

506
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:43,750
you... you wicked man!

507
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:46,280
Don Se Ra... Don Se Ra!

508
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:54,800
Eun Seon Woo, you will thank me for today.

509
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,560
I'm late! Na Hee...

510
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:06,900
Don Se Ra... Don Se Ra! Se Ra!

511
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:11,880
Se Ra! Are you okay? Are you okay? I mean, look at this sweat!

512
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:16,200
Do you have a fever? Did you vomit blood?

513
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,070
Vomit... blood? Fever—

514
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:20,680
Nevermind. Don't say anything.

515
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:24,470
It'll stress your neck. Should I call 911 for now?

516
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:26,270
Nevermind, get on! Get on, get on!

517
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:29,240
I'll take you to the hospital. Come on.

518
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,550
Wait...

519
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:32,870
Should I call my personal physician? What do you think?

520
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:34,470
I'll do anything you ask.

521
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:37,690
Why do I need to go to a hospital when I just sprained my leg?

522
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:39,790
And my neck is...

523
00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:42,930
this fine.

524
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:45,880
Your voice... sounds fine?

525
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:48,340
But Jin Mo said...

526
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:51,290
that you had a fever and you were sweating, and you can't even walk properly,

527
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:52,320
so he told you to go home...

528
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,980
I did?

529
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,810
Oh, I was sweating because it was too hot, so

530
00:32:57,810 --> 00:33:01,930
I had some refreshing watermelons and... fell asleep.

531
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:05,110
Gosh, if you ran all the way here in this heat, you...

532
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:08,190
must've suffered heatstroke.

533
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:14,960
So... you had watermelon... and fell asleep?

534
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:19,100
Then... this... what is this blood?

535
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:23,510
Wait. What kind of watermelon leaves a stain this red?

536
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:27,250
What should I do? This is Na Hee's shirt. I'm a dead women...

537
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:29,410
Gosh, well...

538
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:33,840
Why don't have a refreshing watermelon since you're here anyway?

539
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:37,410
Yeah... no.

540
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:43,180
I happen... to have a meeting nearby, so I should go now.

541
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:45,550
Hey, wait!

542
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:20,640
It's here, right?

543
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:26,340
You're feet are this swollen, but you said you didn't need to go to the hospital?

544
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:29,080
It'll be okay after a day's rest.

545
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:31,300
Don Se Ra, are you a doctor?

546
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:34,810
If you hurt your ankle once, you can easily hurt it again.

547
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:37,110
We need to treat this somehow.

548
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:39,470
Why? Do you need something?

549
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:43,460
Staying put is helping me. A patient should stay still.

550
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:45,660
Get some rest.

551
00:34:50,810 --> 00:34:53,360
You don't need to do this.

552
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:57,290
Stay put. Anyhow, you got hurt because of me.

553
00:34:57,290 --> 00:34:59,050
An occupational accident.

554
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:00,930
Even if it isn't occupational,

555
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:04,620
I would've helped in a dangerous situation like this.

556
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:08,710
So you're saying that you'd have helped anyone, not just me?

557
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:11,010
That everyone's on the same level?

558
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:16,230
I mean you, Chairman, are a bit different.

559
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:19,000
A bit?

560
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:26,800
Quite a large amount of different, you know?

561
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:31,060
Who would wrap up my ankle with bandages so that it won't hurt?

562
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:32,910
Except for you, Chairman.

563
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:39,590
♫ Your smile which was always out of reach ♫

564
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:46,460
♫ is warmer than it was yesterday ♫

565
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:54,980
♫ Me, who had to act as if I knew nothing and turn away ♫

566
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:59,760
♫ Do you know me? ♫

567
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,380
♫ If I was only ♫

568
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,250
This kind of heartbeat means...

569
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:07,110
♫ given one day ♫

570
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:09,530
that I should...

571
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:15,050
see the doctor, not you, Don Se Ra.

572
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:17,290
- Sorry?
- What? Oh, nothing.

573
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:19,660
Are you really going to write on it?

574
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:20,690
Stay put.

575
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:23,830
You shouldn't be doodling on something like that.

576
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:26,000
♫ and stay in the same place ♫

577
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,210
Pork belly?

578
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:30,810
[Pork bellies are with me only! Good job, Eun Seon Woo]

579
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:35,160
How am I going to walk around like this?

580
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:38,440
Don't move and stay put.

581
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,000
Okay.

582
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,590
Since I wrote this for you, get better quickly.

583
00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:48,170
For now, I'll clean up here.

584
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:49,360
Okay.

585
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,450
Stop moving!

586
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:54,960
I'm so scared!

587
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,460
What's this? Are you going to make me fall?

588
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:58,510
Step forward slowly.

589
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:00,800
Slowly, slowly.

590
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,000
One, two...

591
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,580
three.

592
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:17,630
[Sa Na Hee, I love you]

593
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:33,850
It's so wonderful!

594
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:40,230
What is all this?

595
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:42,950
You said you wanted to have a date at the Han River.

596
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:46,350
The food, it can't be!

597
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:50,580
You also said that you wanted to eat more pork trotters than you'd ever want, right?

598
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:57,760
Attorney, you remembered everything I said?

599
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,390
Isn't that a given?

600
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:03,760
Everything that you said was a great saying to me and

601
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:08,340
every moment that I had with you was, in my life,

602
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:10,380
the best shot of my life.

603
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:15,260
Also, even now, when I close my eyes,

604
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:19,610
your silhouette is here, and is it here?

605
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:22,400
My goodness, Attorney.

606
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,350
However...

607
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,430
there's one thing that I can't remember.

608
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:29,730
What is it?

609
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:31,510
The...

610
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:36,300
first night we were together on the bed...

611
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:39,850
I can't remember that moment because I was too drunk.

612
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:41,540
That makes me...

613
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:43,480
- angry even now.
- Well, what's the worry?

614
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:48,130
We just need to have a "first night" every night from now on.

615
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:51,120
Na Hee, why would you say something like that?

616
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,110
Why?

617
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:54,580
A "first night" every night?

618
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,360
It's too sweet.

619
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,630
When I like it spicy.

620
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:02,810
My gosh, you! You, Sweetie!

621
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:05,040
You, Spicy!

622
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,930
Please come this way.

♫ You and I, who were not very different ♫

624

625

Now, shall we have a toast?

626
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,460
- Do you like it?
- I like it.

627
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,300
I like it even more.

628
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:28,390
♫ My heart that was wavering, like a breezy spring's ♫

629

Since you did a lot of work here,

00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:35,750
have a taste first, Sweetie.

632
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:37,740
How is it?

633
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:39,380
It's so sweet.

634
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:40,570
Now.

635
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:44,070
Spicy, spicy.

636
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,160
This is from that place!

637
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,150
- Yes!
- Yes, I know!

638
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:51,360
It's so good...

639
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:54,750
Let's take a picture to remember this day.

640
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:56,330
Nice!

641
00:39:56,330 --> 00:39:57,800
Here...

642
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,400
Close to each other...

643
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,630

644
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:12,550
♫ It's pounding, I want to share the same memories ♫

645
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:17,230
♫ I want it to be a moment just a little more special ♫

646
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:22,200
♫ My heart that's up in the clouds, my heart that is always the same ♫

647

♫ The words that I practiced so much, "I like you" ♫

648
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:42,400
What brings you to Se Ra's home?

649
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:46,750
Do I have to tell you every little thing?

650
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:50,230
Don't use Se Ra.

651
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:52,190
Use?

652
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:55,500
Don Se Ra is hired by my company and is working for me.

653
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:59,490
You didn't hire her for her supervision?

654
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:01,880
I thought you knew Don Se Ra very well.

655
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:07,280
I guess you don't know she's got other wonderful qualities besides her supervision, Detective Han?

656
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,810
I do know.

657
00:41:08,810 --> 00:41:11,620
That's why I'm more concerned about her.

658
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:14,140
So, why don't you fire Se Ra?

659
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:17,120
If I fire a competent employee,

660
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:21,040
I'd be violating the labor law. So that wouldn't be good.

661
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,200
On top of that, Don Se Ra is...

662
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,500
a very special employee.

663
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,400
A special employee?

664
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:31,890
I know very well why you have hired her.

665
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:34,170
To investigate a case from 20 years ago,

666
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:36,330
you need Se Ra's ability right now. Isn't that right?

667
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:38,420
Is that a problem?

668
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:41,710
More reason you shouldn't use Se Ra if that's the reason.

669
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:44,690
If you really need help, just ask the police!

670
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:46,990
Do you think I haven't done everything in the last 20 years?

671
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:48,250
The police?

672
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:50,030
You couldn't find him.

673
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:51,670
No...

674
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:54,660
You didn't find him.

675
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:56,750
I'll personally...

676
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:58,340
find him now.

677
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:00,930
[Pork bellies are with me only! Good job, Eun Seon Woo]

678
00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:16,840
Good... job...

679
00:42:42,610 --> 00:42:45,090
Gosh, no way.

680
00:42:45,090 --> 00:42:46,700
There's no way.

681
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:51,370
Gosh, Don Se Ra, what are you thinking?

682
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:53,720
Come on!

683
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,200
Ouch...

684
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,940
Whatever.

685
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:10,930
♫ I feel this way and that even by the small things and the way you speak ♫

686
00:43:10,930 --> 00:43:16,530
♫ I'd feel down and then feel excited all of sudden ♫

687
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:19,940
♫ Please tell me ♫

688
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:36,850
Mom had known about Don Se Ra's supervision since she was a child.

689
00:43:36,850 --> 00:43:38,970
And with her supervision,

690
00:43:38,970 --> 00:43:41,320
we're looking for her killer.

691
00:43:43,170 --> 00:43:45,900
Shall I call this a coincidence?

692
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:47,580
Or...

693
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:51,080
is there such a thing as fate?

694
00:43:58,330 --> 00:44:01,750
Wait, then where's Don Se Ra in this picture?

695
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:05,440
This ugly kid... is this Don Se Ra?

696
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,510
You're right.

697
00:44:08,570 --> 00:44:11,470
She's cute now...

698
00:44:11,470 --> 00:44:13,970
She was even cuter as a child.

699
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:32,870
Hey.

700
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:44,720
Chairman! Chairman!

701
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:45,890
We found him!

702
00:44:45,890 --> 00:44:47,790
We found him!

703
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,070
We found him...

704
00:44:51,070 --> 00:44:53,430
The man who was with the Vice Chairman in that photo.

705
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:55,600
Who is it? Where is he?

706
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:58,480
His name is Choi Moon Ki. He's Vice Chairman's high school junior.

707
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:01,360
He was called in to be a private driver a few times about 20 years ago

708
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:03,780
and quit after working for about a year.

709
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:06,140
And here.

710
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:09,550
He's living here right now.

711
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:12,050
I'll take you there today.

712
00:45:12,050 --> 00:45:15,400
Please deliver this to the managing director, Director Hong.

713
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:16,730
Wait, Chairman!

714
00:45:16,730 --> 00:45:19,160
Are you going there alone again?

715
00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:21,770
Shit...

716
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:24,030
I don't know.

717
00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:26,980
Oh, Assistant Kim!

718
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:28,530
Where is Director Hong?

719
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:30,290
Oh, he's at the chairman's office.

720
00:45:30,290 --> 00:45:34,260
- What brings you here?
- I wanted to ask him something.

721
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:36,310
I prepared some tea.

722
00:45:36,310 --> 00:45:39,390
Chairman is in the Room of Contemplation right now.

723
00:45:39,390 --> 00:45:40,920
So put away the tea.

724
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,700
What brings you here, Assistant Kim?

725
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:46,190
I need some materials relating to the last year's anniversary event.

726
00:45:46,190 --> 00:45:48,170
What?

727
00:45:48,170 --> 00:45:49,910
Please find some materials for Assistant Kim.

728
00:45:49,910 --> 00:45:52,560
I'm going to the managing director's office.

729
00:45:53,390 --> 00:45:57,670
I'm the one who found Mr. Choi. So, why are those two going?

730
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:04,040
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

731
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:05,500
What a relief.

732
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:07,200
Would you like more coffee?

733
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,890
But I have to get going.

734
00:46:08,890 --> 00:46:11,020
Oh, since your lunchtime is over...

735
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:12,350
Honey?

736
00:46:12,350 --> 00:46:13,920
What are you doing?

737
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:16,100
Go on up ahead.

738
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:18,080
Is he your boyfriend?

739
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:19,950
Yes.

740
00:46:19,950 --> 00:46:21,820
I guess you haven't told him yet?

741
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:24,040
My office is right above this bakery.

742
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:27,270
- I'm Attorney Yang Jin Mo.
- I see.

743
00:46:27,270 --> 00:46:30,120
The times are so unsettling these days. So I come down here every so often.

744
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,250
We put a few CCTVs in here recently.

745
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:35,050
- W-Where...
- Here.

746
00:46:35,050 --> 00:46:37,350
So, are you a freelancer?

747
00:46:37,350 --> 00:46:41,570
Oh, no. I work for Eunkang Group.

748
00:46:41,570 --> 00:46:43,700
Lunchtime is over. I guess you've got a lot of time?

749
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:44,960
I was just about to leave.

750
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,330
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

751
00:46:46,330 --> 00:46:47,700
- Thank you.
- Thank you!

752
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:51,250
You should take some bread with you. Okay, take care!

753
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:55,210
My sweetie, you get so jealous.

754
00:46:55,210 --> 00:46:58,630
I'll get jealous right to your face going forward.

755
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:05,320
Then, for my boyfriend, I'll have to create a new bread for the menu.

756
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:08,700
What kind of bread? By chance... jukppang?
(Means a punch or a smack)

757
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:10,240
Not that!

758
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:13,110
Jil2zinppang.
(Jil-too means jealousy, Zin means for real)

759
00:47:13,110 --> 00:47:15,500
Wow, it's going to be bad. I guess I'll only eat that bread.

760
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:17,050
Jil2zinppang?

761
00:47:17,050 --> 00:47:19,810
Sounds good, sounds good, huh?

762
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:22,400
- Can I eat this?
- No, you can't.

763
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,760
I want to eat all of your bread, Na Hee.

764
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:27,780
So how do I use this?

765
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:30,860
It can't even locate me.

766
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:33,410
Geez, that Yang Jin Mo. Oh, it's working.

767
00:47:33,410 --> 00:47:40,100
[Do Not Enter]

768
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:44,080
Don Se Ra, this...

769
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:46,540
this direction. Right?

770
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:48,600
Yes. I think it's this way.

771
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:50,370
Let's go.

772
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:53,320
Gosh, go slower.

773
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:54,620
Are you okay?

774
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:56,980
5-4...

775
00:47:58,070 --> 00:48:00,110
Gosh, why is it so high up here?

776
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:02,410
5-12.

777
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:04,950
We don't have much time.

778
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:07,130
Wait...

779
00:48:07,130 --> 00:48:09,790
I can't do this...

780
00:48:16,890 --> 00:48:19,120
Don't use it.

781
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:22,030
There are so many houses. How else can we find it?

782
00:48:22,030 --> 00:48:24,120
All we need is this.

783
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:28,440
And be careful, so you don't hurt your injured ankle again.

784
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:31,830
It feels like you're very worried about me.

785
00:48:31,830 --> 00:48:34,500
Of course, I'm worried about you.

786
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:36,820
If my assistant is sick,

787
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:39,140
I'd be the one to suffer.

788
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:42,150
Follow me.

789
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:47,600
Eun Bi!

790
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:50,360
- Isn't it this way?
- Teacher, please go this way.

791
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:51,450
Excuse me!

792
00:48:51,450 --> 00:48:54,550
I lost a child. By chance...

793
00:48:54,550 --> 00:48:56,850
- You lost a child?
- Yes.

794
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:59,070
Have you seen this girl?

795
00:48:59,070 --> 00:49:00,550
Oh? This balloon.

796
00:49:00,550 --> 00:49:01,610
You recognize it?

797
00:49:01,610 --> 00:49:04,000
- Let's go over there.
- Okay.

798
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:05,730
Hey, Don—

799
00:49:05,730 --> 00:49:07,510
Hurry up and follow us!

800
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:10,210
Why does she follow a stranger so easily?

801
00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:11,910
Hey!

802
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,280
Excuse me.

803
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:20,010
When and how did she disappear?

804
00:49:20,010 --> 00:49:23,740
She was drawing a picture and ran outside all of a sudden.

805
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:25,260
Was there a problem?

806
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:28,290
Eun Bi's mom passed away not too long ago.

807
00:49:28,290 --> 00:49:32,240
What kind of picture was she drawing?

808
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:36,950
She was drawing a picture of her playing with her mom at a playground.

809
00:49:36,950 --> 00:49:38,800
A playground...

810
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:46,730
Follow me.

811
00:49:54,810 --> 00:49:58,000
She's got to be here somewhere.

812
00:49:59,450 --> 00:50:02,270
Over there. That balloon!

813
00:50:04,150 --> 00:50:05,980
Eun Bi.

814
00:50:10,190 --> 00:50:12,000
Eun Bi!

815
00:50:14,070 --> 00:50:15,280
Eun Bi...

816
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,270
Eun Bi, did you get hurt?

817
00:50:17,270 --> 00:50:19,020
Gosh, seriously.

818
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:21,150

990
01:01:05,710 --> 01:01:08,310
Oppa, do you know someone named Kim Nam Gyu, by chance?

991
01:01:08,310 --> 01:01:11,090
You know how special that Angel Lady is to me.

992
01:01:11,090 --> 01:01:14,700
I wonder if Angel Lady is special to you or Chairman Eun is.

993
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:17,360
Don't just look at other people with your supervision.

994
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:19,950
Take a good look at your heart as well.

995
01:01:19,950 --> 01:01:23,100
That girl from the orphanage. You said she's got something going on with Chairman Eun, right?

996
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:25,150
- Don Se Ra?
- Bring her to me.

997
01:01:25,150 --> 01:01:27,750
And as for Chairman Eun, I'll find a way.

998
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:29,870
We cannot afford to leave them be.

999
01:01:29,870 --> 01:01:33,270
For this one, I can't let it go even if you try to stop me.
