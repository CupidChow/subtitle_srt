168
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,360
I've got to give them a sharp warning when it's this noisy.

169
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,960
- That's how they'll learn their lesson.
- Hey!

170
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:13,470
Trust me, okay?

171
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:16,020
Fine, go give them a sharp warning.

172
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,770
Gosh, this is really...

173
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,760
Welcome!

174
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,150
[I wish you prosperity!]
We're Bang Bang!

175
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,660
[This shop's bread is the best!]
- Have a taste.
- Hello!

176
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:29,080
We're Bang Bang, an organic and handmade bakery shop!

177
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,130
Please spread the word!

178
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,090
You spent 20,000 won? Thank you!

179
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,080
Please spread the word!

180
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,900
Enjoy your bread!

181
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,600
Welcome!

182
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,740
Please try a sample before you go.

183
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,770
Hello, welcome.

184
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:45,000
- Please give it a try.
- It looks good.

185
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,700
Please enjoy it.

186
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:49,520
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

187
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:51,820
Welcome!

188
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,440
Hello.

189
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,410
Welcome!

190
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:56,750
Thank you! Please spread the word.

191
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:59,520
Thank you. We're Bang Bang, everyone!

192
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,770
Hello, we're Bang Bang!

193
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:05,070
I'm the second-floor lawyer.

194
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:09,090
Helmet?

195
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:12,580
You must really like free things. You came all the way down here yourself.

196
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,970
How could I not, with all this going on?

197
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:17,980
My ears are sensitive.

198
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,830
They must be very sensitive.

199
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:22,840
I must've caused a great inconvenience for you.

200
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,700
Whatever. When will all this end?

201
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,020
It'll end when it ends.

202
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,030
You must be very impatient.

203
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:32,260
Don't be like that, and while you're down here,

204
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,470
you should try our bread properly.

205
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:37,300
I'm fine. I have allergies, so I don't eat them.

206
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,840
What allergies are you talking about?

207
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,750
I said it's fine.

208
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:42,200
- Just give it a try—
- I said, it's fine—

209
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,600
This bastard...

210
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:58,390
I told you that I'm allergic, but you still...

211
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:01,490
Don't you l-listen to your customers?

212
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:03,950
Why force... me...

213
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:05,240
Turn off the music.

214
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,520
That wasn't my fault—

215
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,350
It's dancing.

216
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:26,090
Dancing...

217
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:43,360
My balloon seems to have been greatly damaged by you.

218
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,700
Get up.

219
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,940
G-Get up!

220
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:55,820
She's up.

221
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:08,410
[Bang Bang]

222
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,800
N-No.

223
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,890
Not there.

224
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:24,530
Go.

225
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:33,580
Yang Jin Mo.

226
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:36,570
What the hell are you doing right now?

227
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:38,710
Are you crazy?

228
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:41,340
Enjoy your food!

229
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:43,920
How long are you going to make Attorney Yang dance like that?

230
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,070
Tell him to stop now.

231
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:46,780
Why? Looking at his dance,

232
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:49,380
I can tell he frequented the club dance floor.

233
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:53,820
There are times I question his occupation, but he's a total know-it-all.

234
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,970
Attorney Yang must be the type to give it his all in everything.

235
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:58,100
I know, right?

236
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:01,000
He's actually doing his best just because we told him to.

237
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:05,140
Soo Ah, eat up.

238
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:07,290
Hold on! Hold on, hold on, hold on.

239
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:09,020
Why?

240
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:15,280
You need to post these things on IG to get popular these days.

241
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:18,900
You beautiful girl! I put our store in your care, customer.

242
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:24,570
Come to the convenience store with some money. I got caught.

243
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:26,980
Why? Is something wrong, Soo Ah?

244
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,610
Huh?

245
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:31,740
I forgot that I had plans with a friend.

246
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,160
I'll get going, Sisters.

247
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,660
Oh, what?

248
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,800
Goodbye!

249
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:42,730
Anyway, her devotion to her friends is the same as me.

250
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,220
What did you do with that dress?

251
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:47,520
Did you return it? Or sell it?

252
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:54,240
I thought it could be a gift from God to a poor soul, so I considered selling it,

253
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,630
but out of conscience, I have to return it.

254
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:00,780
You could just fold your conscience and put it away.

255
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:03,900
I could not put it away even if I wanted to.

256
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,430
Kind. Too kind.

257
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,080
Boss!

258
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,600
I'm sorry. She must've forgotten to bring her card today.

259
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,260
If she weren't your friend, I would've called the police on her right away.

260
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,840
But are you sure you're even friends?

261
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,860
Yes.

262
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,710
Don't hang out with girls like her.

263
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:32,780
She has the hands of a thief.

264
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,450
I'm sorry.

265
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:36,300
Anyway, thank you.

266
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,210
Sure.

267
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:39,420
- Take care!
- See you.

268
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,300
Yeon Joo!

269
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:45,220
Yeon Joo!

270
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:50,290
I thought you went back home since I didn't hear from you.

271
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:52,560
I wouldn't have left in the first place if I had planned to go back.

272
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,830
That shithole of a house.

273
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:56,490
Do you have more money?

274
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:59,350
- Why?
- Do you?

275
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:03,190
Here.

276
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:06,590
You should've contacted me, at least.

277
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,710
I heard you left the shelter two days ago.

278
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:11,320
- Where are you staying now?
- What does it matter to you?

279
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,550
Mind your own business!

280
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:15,370
I won't contact you next time.

281
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:17,690
- Yeon Joo!
- God damn it!

282
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:21,250
If you're not returning home, do you want to spend a few days with me at the orphanage?

283
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,700
Hey, am I an orphan?

284
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,590
You and I are still different.

285
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:27,400
Don't look down on me just because you got into college.

286
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,500
I'm so embarrassed.

287
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,420
All the neighbors saw me.

288
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:37,710
Who would come to me to defend them?

289
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:40,250
To a lawyer who danced like a balloon.

290
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:43,900
Hey, how long are you going to stay like that?

291
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,950
Do you even know how I feel?

292
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:50,370
You bastard with no sense of empathy.

293
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:51,750
Look at this guy.

294
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:54,690
Hey! Hey, I—

295
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:57,220
I empathized more than enough!

296
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:01,740
When I saw you dancing like a balloon,

297
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:04,990
"Is that Yang Jin Mo or a balloon doll?"

298
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:07,270
I was briefly confused quite intently.

299
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:09,740
You're making fun of me again right now.

300
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:10,810
What do you mean?

301
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:12,670
Hey, let's go out.

302
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:15,720
- Huh? Let's go out!
- Let go.

303
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:20,860
Hey, y-you go out.

304
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:22,930
Geez, it's Se Ra! You go out.

305
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:26,040
- I told you to go out.
- You go out!

306
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,320
Hello, I brought the dress...

307
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,930
Yang Jin Mo, come out.

308
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:46,140
- Here.
- I-It's not mine.

309
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,590
Close the door, please.

310
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:54,470
Gosh! Do you still have something left to say?

311
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:56,550
I just wanted to return this dress.

312
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:59,660
You want me to wear it after you return it?

313
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:02,930
You're quite blessed in regards to your looks, Chairman,

314
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:05,730
so I thought this dress would look good on you, too.

315
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:08,800
I don't need it, so you can throw it out.

316
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,790
Throw it out? This expensive dress?

317
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:17,510
Your brain is divided into money, money and, of course, money, huh?

318
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:19,790
You hold such a long grudge.

319
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:23,330
Considering you were talking to yourself, I heard you loud and clear just now.

320
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:27,990
Oh, you must be headed somewhere.

321
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:30,190
You're quite the curious cat.

322
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:34,620
Well, this level of disguise is something like a detective?

323
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:38,410
If there's a detective like me, he'd probably walk the runway, not hold an investigation.

324
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:42,020
A real detective would laugh if he heard that.

325
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:47,600
Wait.

326
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,860
Wouldn't it be better for Se Ra to accompany us for a hospital inquiry?

327
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,050
Think about it.

328
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:56,070
Instead of you who shuts people up even if they want to talk.

329
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,320
Yes, that's right!

330

- Yes, sure.

493
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:51,380
For patient Choi Myeong Soo in room 513, please attach a 20 mL NS500.

494
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,630
I'll write a prescription right now.

495
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:54,110
Okay.

496
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:56,370
Nurse Kang?

497
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:57,310
Yes.

498
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:59,280
Sheet change in room 510 for patient Lee Myeong Gi,

499
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,910
and patient Choi Myeong Soo in room 513, IV change.

500
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:04,510
The infusion is NS500, 20 mL.

501
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:06,010
20 mL...

502
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:10,260
But which department are you from?

503
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,830
There's something I want to ask.

504
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:15,710
To me?

505
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:21,520
Who's the one who reported Han Byeol's dad for child abuse?

506
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,660
I'm not sure.

507
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:26,710
Asking Nurse Shim would be better...

508
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:29,220
Nurse Shim knows well, huh?

509
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:32,340
Since she was the nurse in charge of Han Byeol.

510
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:34,860
But you are...

511
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:38,350
Oh, Charge Nurse!

512
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:43,770
To be honest, I'm...

513
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:49,010
[Police Agency]
investigating a case regarding Jang Min Soo.

514
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:54,030
I already explained everything to the detective who came earlier.

515
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:56,860
You know Oh Ah Ra, right?

516
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:59,190
Yes.

517
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:02,080
She's sponsoring a pediatric patient from our hospital.

518
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,740
I see.

519
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,420
Anything else?

520
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:07,650
Like what?

521
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:11,180
By chance, were you working on June 8th?

522
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,290
I'm just asking some questions for formality.

523
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:22,080
For work...

524
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,520
Oh, my.

525
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,730
Oh, my! L-Look at him smile!

526
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:27,910
A moment, please.

527
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:33,570
Yes, I had an evening shift that day.

528
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:35,790
Oh, I see.

529
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:38,380
Okay, take care.

530
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:44,480
What a killer smile.

531
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,790
Please look into the whereabouts of the pediatric nurses on the day of the incident.

532
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:49,560
Understood.

533
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,210
Bride!

534
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,760
There's something I must tell you.

535
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,180
Right now?

536
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:59,830
I'm a little busy right now.

537
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:02,590
There's nothing more important than what I'm about to tell you.

538
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:07,970
I'm telling you this because it's like I'm looking at my younger self.

539
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:11,780
We look similar.

540
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:14,000
We look very similar.

541
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:18,910
If you let it go because it was just once...

542
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:21,350
- Don Se Ra?
- You'll end up like me.

543
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:24,630
Don Se Ra!

544
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:26,980
Where is she following her?

545
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:35,850
The bakery shop boss...

546
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:42,060
- Boss, Boss!
- What the?

547
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:43,670
Second-floor lawyer?

548
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:45,690
I'm busy right now!

549
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:50,550
Sa Na Hee!

550
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,700
What the? What's wrong with him?

551
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:09,700
I must tell you today—

552
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,660
Geez!

553
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,350
I'm serious right now.

554
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:24,110
Wow, this woman is amusing.

555
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:26,270
I mean, she dragged a patient—

556
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:30,440
I mean, I wonder what she's talking about with my honey...

557
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,420
Your husband...

558
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:35,880
I saw him earlier with the nurses...

559
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:39,660
he was so sweet to the nurses.

560
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:41,400
- Sweet?
- Yes.

561
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,280
You probably don't know too well,

562
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:46,380
but men live up to their looks.

563
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:50,440
Some time ago, in the next pediatrics ward, Han Byeol's dad

564
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:53,500
hit it off with Nurse Shim and

565
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:56,120
Oh, you don't know Han Byeol's dad, do you?

566
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,640
There's this guy who has a decent-looking face.

567
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,900
Han Byeol's dad did?

568
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:03,700
You know Han Byeol's dad?

569
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:06,930
The one who abused his child.

570
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:09,290
Oh! So you do know.

571
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:11,580
I was completely fooled, too.

572
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:14,450
Then he was so-and-so with Nurse Shim...

573
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:16,430
Yes, that's what I said!

574
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:18,250
You can't deceive my eyes.

575
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:20,720
They're very accurate.

576
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:24,640
So that's why you should manage your husband well.

577
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,920
If you just leave him be in hopes that he'll stop...

578
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:30,270
My god, you're going to die of stress like me.

579
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:34,580
- Aigoo, Bride, are you okay?
- Don Se Ra!

580
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:36,730
Don Se Ra, emergency! Emergency!

581
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:39,270
The bakery shop owner has appeared!

582
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:42,250
I have to go right now to catch that husband of mine.

583
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:43,760
Of course, you should. Go catch him.

584
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,880
Catch him! Kill that bastard!

585
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:50,710
The hospital's going to be noisy today as well.

586
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:54,390
So, what is it that you want?

587
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:56,480
I came because I heard Se Ra was admitted here.

588
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,330
So I need to go. What do you need to tell me?

589
00:32:58,330 --> 00:32:59,940
First off...

590
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:03,170
Calm down and look at my eyes.

591
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:04,430
Calm down.

592
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:06,410
Gosh, do I look like I can calm down?

593
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:07,790
Exactly how ill is she?

594
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:10,350
She's the type of person who crawls to work

595
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:12,530
even if she has a 38°C fever, that girl.

596
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:14,400
She's not the type to just faint anywhere,

597
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:18,000
but what in the world did she do until she collapsed?

598
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,200
She didn't faint...

599
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,750
How do you know she didn't faint?

600
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,330
By any chance, did you guys...

601
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:27,230
I mean, how much did you overwork her when she's a mere part-timer?

602
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:30,560
If I check on Se Ra and she says her heart still hurts,

603
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,240
I'm not going to leave you guys alone. Understand?

604
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,870
- Why are you taking it that far—
- What I'm saying

605
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:37,610
is why in the world would that strong girl faint?

606
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:41,800
Hey, let me get a word in! Give and take! Let's have a conversation. Okay?

607
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,970
Why are you going off by yourself? I can speak, too!

608
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:45,250
I'm a lawyer. I'm good at speaking.

609
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:49,740
Why do you continue talking by yourself?

610
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:51,580
Oh, my.

611
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:56,050
I'm sorry for yelling just now,

612
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:59,080
but you're really making us out to be criminals or something.

613
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:03,320
- And we're tactical—
- Tactical?

614
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:06,200
Who are you people, huh?

615
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,450
Are you even a lawyer?

616
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:09,010
What the hell do you bastards do?

617
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:12,370
Did you just call us bastards? Bastards?

618
00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:15,280
Whatever. Where's Se Ra?

619
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:20,970
Oh, my!

620
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:32,360
Oh, Honey! Where did you go when you're sick?

621
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,390
Na Hee's here. She's here!

622
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:36,440
But where did you go in this situation?

623
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,530
Y-Yang Jin Mo?

624
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:39,600
Hey, wait!

625
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,680
[Sa Na Hee is loyalty]

626
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:41,780
Why?

627
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,310
Can you pick it up?

628
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:45,220
- I should pick it up for now.
- Yang Jin Mo.

629
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:47,000
Why isn't he picking up? Hey!

630
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,710
Yes, Na Hee?

631
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:52,200
Huh? Attorney Yang fainted?

632
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:55,220
- Emergency room?
- Emergency room?

633
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:57,690
Why did you tell me to feed you something this dangerous?

634
00:34:57,690 --> 00:35:00,710
Thank God I didn't drink that, or I'd be lying here right now!

635
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:02,500
Unbelievable, gosh!

636
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,560
I told you I was allergic.

637
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,860
- Allergic to milk.
- Allergic to milk, my foot!

638
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:09,920
Can an allergic reaction to milk make your face swell up...

639
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,760
like an overstuffed dumpling... and make you look...

640
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:15,150
- hideous?
- It just did.

641
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:18,270
I told you at the bakery that I'm allergic.

642
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:19,530
Na Hee!

643
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:21,200
Hey, Se Ra! What in the world happened?

644
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,830
Wait, who is he?

645
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:25,820
- Did you hit him?
- No way!

646
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:27,880
He's the second-floor lawyer.

647
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:30,160
Attorney Yang?

648
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:33,600
Wait, but why is his face so...

649
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,370
Did you feed him milk by any chance?

650
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:39,290
He drank it in one shot himself.

651
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:41,940
Hey! Are you okay?

652
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:44,910
What the hell? Why does your heart hurt and what's with the hospitalization?

653
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:46,820
That's not it...

654
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:50,640
There's something we need to look into at the hospital.

655
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,260
- Tactical.
- Tactical!

656
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:54,920
Are you a spy? To get tactical?

657
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:59,590
My heart is shriveling up because of you! Shriveling up!

658
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:03,250
Anyway, nothing's wrong with you. Right?

659
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:06,170
You know how strong I am.

660
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:07,940
Are you in your right mind?

661
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:11,900
Why would you drink milk? Do you have a death wish?

662
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:15,700
- It hurts...
- That's pretty bad.

663
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:18,350
Really bad.

664
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:25,320
I'll come back tomorrow.

665
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,440
Where are you going?

666
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,900
Well, of course...

667
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:32,120
Of course, you should stay with your wife!

668

It's her first day at the hospital.

669
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:37,870
It's okay. I'm really fine.

670
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:39,100
You heard her.

671
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:41,660
She'll divorce you at that rate.

672
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,580
Based on what?

673
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:48,070
No one would dare divorce me.

674
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:51,990
A man should be properly tamed from the start.

675
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:54,640
Look at me. That's why I'm going through this hell.

676
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:58,150
Oh, I'm not in a position to do that.

677
00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:01,700
My, my. Being sick is sad enough. Don't be intimidated!

678
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:03,730
Is being sick a sin?

679
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:08,870
The bastards who neglect their wives because they're sick are the sinners!

680
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:11,320
Neglect...

681
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,350
is not something I do.

682
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:16,090
Yes, good night! Yup.

00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:17,710
Let's sleep.

You're really going to sleep here?

685
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,430
Then, what should I do?

686
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:28,120
If I leave, they're going to rip me apart.

687

We're going to sleep together?

688
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:34,240
Yes, we are.

Hey, you think I can sleep somewhere like this?

693
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:45,710
Get down. Come on!

694
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:47,440

[Eunkang]

What is it that Chairman Eun mentioned...

698
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:55,970
The metaverse platform case.

699
00:37:55,970 --> 00:38:01,000
Yes, I've reported the overall schedule and progress until the platform launch.

You're doing as Chairman Eun says?

- Well, I'm...
- Hey, hey.

Why would you bring up who you're backing?

To be blunt,

705
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:16,270
that position was yours from the start!

706
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:18,710
I'm well aware of my position.

707
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:21,770
You're the one who needs to make this platform successful

if you want to defend that position of yours.

I'll properly show you and Eun Seon Woo

710

what is Chief Kang going around doing these days?

Why are his claws drawn out?

714

There was a minor incident at the club recently,

715

but it was put to an end after Chairman Eun Seon Woo showed up.

716

But Seon Woo doesn't frequent places like that.

717
00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:07,800
Why was he there?

718
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,790
I couldn't figure that out.

You must've had a very good sleep, huh?

No way...

727

I'm pretty picky when it comes to sleeping arrangements.

728
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:41,230
Is that why you made your sick bride sleep on the cot?

Seon Woo? Nurse Shim was a Latin dance instructor.

On the day of the incident, she had a Latin dance class,

00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:08,170
That's enough with gratitude.

You're doing this on purpose, aren't you? It tickles!

986
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:33,210
I'm doing the best I can.

987
00:59:33,210 --> 00:59:36,130
That's the problem. Move!

988
00:59:36,130 --> 00:59:38,680
How are you good at nothing?

989
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:40,350
I'll try it, okay?

990
00:59:40,350 --> 00:59:41,790
Here.

991
00:59:49,750 --> 00:59:50,950
Gosh!

Hey, it tickles...

W-What are you staring at?

Aren't you going to untie us?

1001
01:00:54,990 --> 01:00:58,130
Let me just... stare for now.

1002
01:00:58,130 --> 01:01:01,800
You should've at least laid something down first.

I'll be back later.

Wow...

1009
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:56,360
We're headed to the address you found on Park Eun Jeong's car, right?

1010
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:57,650
What about the license plate?

1011
01:01:57,650 --> 01:01:59,960
15G859.

1012
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:05,980
Oh Ah Ra. Park Eun Jeong. Jang Min Soo.

1013
01:02:05,980 --> 01:02:08,280
How do you think these three are related?

1014
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:12,220
Jang Min Soo and Park Eun Jeong planned it out and killed Oh Ah Ra.

1015
01:02:12,220 --> 01:02:13,380
That sounds right.

1016
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:17,440
Oh Ah Ra cashed out her entire fortune not too long ago.

1017
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:19,040
They must've been targeting the money.

1018
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:22,080
Then the two of them killed Oh Ah Ra...

1019
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:25,980
This case has nothing to do with money.

1020
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:29,330
- What?
- Then why would the two of them kill Oh Ah Ra?

1021
01:02:29,330 --> 01:02:31,660
Who said anyone killed Oh Ah Ra?

1022
01:02:33,740 --> 01:02:35,970
Oh Ah Ra isn't dead.

1023
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:41,370
Hello?

Oh Ah Ra isn't dead?

1026
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:48,930
What are you saying?

1027
01:02:48,930 --> 01:02:51,250
Then the person we have been looking for all this time

1028
01:02:51,250 --> 01:02:54,900
- isn't a murderer—
- I never said we were looking for a murderer.

1029
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:56,700
I'm not interested in that, either.
