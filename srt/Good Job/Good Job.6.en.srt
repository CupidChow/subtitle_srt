You think I don't know?

Stay put as if you're dead, and don't act up!

If I stay put...

00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,290
will Eun Seon Woo, that bastard, hand over the company to you?

147
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:26,290
I need to do whatever it takes. Whatever it takes!

148
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:28,060
Whatever?

149
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,720
Is that why you did that?

150
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:33,580
What did I do? What exactly did I do wrong?

151
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,800
Father, if you just support me this once,

I can make Eun Seon Woo, that bastard...

Don't do anything.

If I'm not to do anything, why am I even here?

Clubs. Women.

Don't cause trouble, keep your mouth shut, and stay put.

Got it?

158

I'm sorry to interrupt your conversation,

Are you the new secretary?

Yes, I'm Don Se Ra, the secretary intern.

164

What do you think is the most important virtue of a secretary?

165
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:39,050
- It's to efficiently assist—
- It's watching their mouths.

In regards to everything about their superior.

167
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,210
Words can either ruin you or make you prosper.

168

Do you understand?

169
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:02,980
What fucking schedule are you talking about?

170
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:09,140
Well, Manager Kim will be here soon and

171
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:14,600
I thought it might put you in an awkward situation if he witnessed what went on.

172
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:18,500
Am I pitiful to you?

173
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:22,630
I asked, do I look pitiful to you?

174
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:24,750
Am I pitiful?

175
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,760
You dare to pity me?

176
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,600
I'm sorry.

177
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,770
I could hear you two all the way from my office,

178
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:34,270
so without thinking, I...

179
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:38,660
Who are you to interfere so arrogantly, huh?

180
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:43,200
I'm sorry.

181
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,970
Get out.

182
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:00,830
He's inside, right?

183
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:02,420
Yes.

184
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:07,590
He must be mad.

185
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,170
Proceed with what I told you previously.

186
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:22,610
But that's a bit too risky, so...

187
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:26,230
So, are you saying you can't?

188
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:29,540
Did you forget who put you in that position?

189
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:34,170
Make that appointment no matter what.

190
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:35,890
Understood.

191
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,380
Manager Kim...

192
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:41,490
I'm not the only one going down if this doesn't work out.

193
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:43,070
If you continue to be like this,

194
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:45,970
don't you think there's a limit to how much I can block for you?

195
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:50,560
Wait! What is he blocking for him?

196
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:55,420
What is Kang Tae Joon scheming with Manager Kim?

197
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,070
Cancel all afternoon schedules.

198
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:00,440
You have a meeting with the director in the afternoon.

199
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,630
Just cancel it.

200
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:04,240
I'm sorry?

201
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,940
Get off.

202
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:36,110
Get off!

203
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,490
God!

204
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:07,340
Gosh, has Don Se Ra gone crazy?

205
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,500
It'll be complicated if Chairman is here.

206
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,960
What?

207
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,580
- Here—
- What the hell?

208
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:20,310
You're lips are bleeding...

209
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,430
Vice Chairman said confidentiality is the most important duty of a secretary.

210
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:41,860
Furthermore, I can't just stand back and let my boss leave in this state.

211
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,880
Is your foot okay?

212
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:10,730
My foot's okay, but my mood is definitely not okay.

213
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:17,100
Manager Kang's secretary couldn't possibly have stepped on my foot intentionally.

214
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,190
Chairman...

215
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:19,040
Secretary Don.

216
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,020
Yes, Manager Kang.

217
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:24,940
- Let's leave together.
- Pardon?

218
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:28,080
Make sure to join me on my external agendas from now on, too.

219
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:34,540
Wait, Don Se—

220
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,370
Who does she think she's following right now?

221
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,340
Kim Jae Ha.

222
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:45,320
Are you coming along, so you can rat me out to Father again?

223
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,660
I don't need you, so get lost.

224
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:52,920
Get in.

225
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,230
You're going with me?

226
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,460
Of course, I am!

227
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:06,660
It looks like Kang Tae Joon is going to cause trouble.

228
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:09,750
It's not because you're worried about Se Ra?

229
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,820
Hey, focus, will you? You plan to lose them?

230
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:15,940
- Hurry and go!
- Yeah, yeah, I'm going.

231
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:42,260
Gosh, let's change the car. You know how many great cars are out there?

232
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:44,540
So annoying, gosh.

233
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:49,730
Why are you glaring vehemently at your shoes?

234
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:52,810
Don Se Ra. There were other methods you could've used.

235
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:54,580
You could've just pushed me, but you stepped on me?

236
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:59,150
On my feet in front of Kang Tae Joon, no less?

237
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:04,790
Se Ra stepped on your foot in front of Kang Tae Joon?

238
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:12,910
It's part of the operation, don't get so giddy.

239
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:16,930
I mean, you hate being stepped on more than anything in the world...

240
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,830
I'm just so bummed

241
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:23,110
I couldn't witness your face the moment your foot got stepped on.

242
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:28,500
Yang Jin Mo, can you shut your mouth and hurry in to set things up?

243
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:39,040
Don Se Ra, just you wait.

244
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:50,580
Thanks to you, I feel like

245
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:54,270
several years' worth of stress has been flushed away.

246
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,740
I'm sorry?

247
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,940
Eat up.

248
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:02,290
I'm not that hungry—

249
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:08,610
You're really good at telling lies when you'll be found out right away.

250
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:10,630
I'm sorry.

251
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:12,990
Then I'll enjoy the food.

252
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:14,720
Eat.

253
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:24,010
Oh, no! What should we do?

254
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:27,120
- Gosh...
- I'm sorry!

255
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,740
Hey, wait.

256
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:35,440
I have a shirt in the car, so bring it to me.

257
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,910
Okay.

258
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:38,880
I'm sorry.

259
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:54,560
- What happened?
- What do you think?

260
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,040
What can't be solved with money?

261
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:02,340
You stay inside.

262
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,760
We're n-not eating?

263
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:29,870
Hey! What if we get caught?

264
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:32,150
We're just eating! Why must you—

265
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,360
You think Kang Tae Joon is here to simply enjoy a meal?

266
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,170
Then?

267
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:44,310
Make sure to duplicate his phone this time.

268
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,560
Right now?

269
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,760
If we get caught...

270
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:50,200
So you should do your best not to get caught, right?

271
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,550
If you don't want to get stepped on.

272
00:20:56,930 --> 00:21:00,970
That little petty and grudgeful—

273
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:02,840
I can hear you!

274
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,780
Grumbly little...

275
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,590
What the hell?

00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,900

Okay. All right, calmly. Calmly.

281
00:21:57,930 --> 00:22:01,120
You need to place the backing directly on top. Okay?

282
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,230
Man, where was it? She's oddly familiar...

283
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:12,370
Where did I see her?

284
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:21,460
Okay, Don Se Ra, Kang Tae Joon is entering the restroom.

Don Se Ra! Kang Tae Joon just came out of the restroom.

289

Hurry up! Hurry up!

Come on, come on! Hurry, hurry, hurry. There's no time! There's no time!

00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,420
Hurry!

I've prepared your shirt.

295
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,550
Leave it to the side.

296
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:16,210
What happened?

297
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:24,140
I see this shirt is a high-end brand that suits your standards.

298
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:27,600
And the fit is perfect, too.

299
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:31,410
What are you saying? Just leave it to the side.

But you know... haven't we...

303
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:57,870
seen each other before?

304

I'm not sure.

Where could I have possibly seen you?

307
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:10,060
I do have a familiar face.

308
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:12,220
I hear that a lot,

309
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:14,260
but because I'm good-natured...

310
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,910
All right. Eat.

311
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:18,390
Okay.

Wow. Wow, Se Ra is so quick-witted.

Blue Dragon Room?

316
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,540
It's the name of one of the rooms in this restaurant.

317

Okay!

It's a burner phone.

It's not Sunday... Sunday...

322
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:53,350
is a person. Look for people who work in this industry,

323
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:55,870
with IDs, account names, project names, nicknames, etc...

324

with the name Sunday.

325
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,960

Huh? I'm not done eating yet, though.

You've eaten a lot. Stop eating now.

What about you?

Head back first. I have other business to attend to.

"Genius Developer Hwang Chi Seon?"

339
00:25:57,270 --> 00:26:01,190
Do you think he's trying to steal the secrets of the competitor's development?

340
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:02,870
There's nothing he knows how to do,

341
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:06,560
and he probably got anxious since Vice Chairman Kang kept pressuring him.

342
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:11,400
What in the world is Kang Tae Joon scheming?

343

- What do we do?
- What do you think?

344

We need to use this chance to shake some sense into him.

Se Ra, nice! You did so well! So well!

Did you find out what Manager Kang is plotting?

347
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:30,090
We figured everything out, thanks to you.

348
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:31,880
Thank god.

349

What a relief. I was about to die from anxiety earlier!

00:28:55,380 --> 00:29:00,520
You know Hwang Chi Seon, our development team leader... very well, right?

360
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,800
Unfortunately, team leader Hwang Chi Seon

361
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,300
was caught in contact with the Chinese side

362
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,390
and we're in the middle of investigating.

363
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:11,690
In the process, I also learned about...

364
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:14,100
Director Kang's situation.

365

Eunkang Group finds out about this...

367
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,590
I think it'll be a headache for both our companies...

368
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:29,090
What do you think?

369
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:36,110
Where's Manager Kang?

370

I'm from... the inspection team of Eunkang Group.

I won't beat around the bush since we're both busy.

The inspection team at Eunkang Group

00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:55,940
It seems like you two are... planning to do something.

Hold on!

382

I hope there won't be any more contact between you and Kang Tae Joon after today.

383
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:37,990
You should not let anyone know about this meeting,

384
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:40,100
including Manager Kang Tae Joon.

385
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:42,050
Yes, of course.

386
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:44,540
If you could just make sure this stays a secret from my company...

387
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:49,210
As long as you keep your promise, that won't be an issue.

388
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:51,280
Because if this gets exposed to external sources,

389
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:54,770
it'll be quite a substantial blow to both companies' reputations.

390

00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:14,980
What is it? My special gift?

499
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:19,040
Aren't you leaving?

500
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,560
Oh, take your time.

501
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:23,270
I have time to accept a gift.

502
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:29,090
Well...

503
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:33,010
I think Kawng Gi saw us at Teen Tonic.

504
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:34,630
Se Ra told me not to come

505
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:37,040
because he's interrogating her.

506
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,130
Then right now, Se Ra...

507
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:42,890
is basically being interrogated by Detective Han?

508
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:47,710
Attorney Yang!

509
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:50,610
Where-Where are you going?

510
00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:54,940
I said I'll buy you something good and your choice is tteokbokki?

511
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:57,130
Yes. Brother, even if I become filthy rich,

512
00:38:57,130 --> 00:39:00,780
my love for tteokbokki will never stop.

513
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:03,960
Sure, eat your fill.

514
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:08,000
I'll take responsibility for all the tteokbokki for the rest of your life, so eat up.

515
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,910
That's a promise.

516
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,270
[Attorney Yang Jin Mo]

517
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:14,070
Give me a sec.

518
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,070
What?

519
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:22,650
I can't. No, I won't.

520
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:23,950
Please help me.

521
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:28,000
I have no one to ask this favor besides you.

522
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,990
I mean, it's not like it's the Joseon Era.

523
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:36,250
Does an arranged marriage for Eun Seon Woo make sense?

524
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:38,420
And while we're on the topic,

525
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:41,420
when Seon Woo rescued Soo Ah last time,

526
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:44,070
he spent... How much was it again?

527
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:45,840
If you add it all together...

528
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,610
Gosh.

529
00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:53,590
And on the night of the get-together, Seon Woo's back was practically broken because of a certain someone.

530
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:55,750
Please help...

531
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:57,590
Please.

532
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:08,090
Hey, dig in.

533
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:09,400
Brother, what should I do?

534
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:13,200
I got an urgent call from work, and I think I need to go right now.

535
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,010
Why?

536
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:19,010
Our job entails that we need to go whenever and wherever the boss tells us to.

537
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,980
I mean, it's not like you're catching criminals.

538
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:25,940
What's so urgent that requires you to go back to work after hours?

539
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:29,310
A secretary's first requirement is to be tight-lipped.

540
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:31,930
Oh, and Dong Hee said she hadn't eaten yet, so I called her here.

541
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:33,610
Since you don't like to eat alone.

542
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:34,940
- What?
- Eat together.

543
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:36,420
Brother, I'm really, really sorry.

544
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:38,570
- Enjoy the meal!
- Hey!

545
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:42,760
Eun Seon Woo, Plan B will definitely not disappoint you this time.

546
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,220
What about disappointment?

547
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:46,830
Oh, about the gift you mentioned earlier?

548
00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:49,710
What is it? When are you giving it to me?

549
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:53,340
You just took a stab, didn't you?

550
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:57,320
- What the? I'm going to leave!
- Hey, wait. Hey...

551
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,670
Are you really just going to eat and leave?

552
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:01,110
I just came to eat.

553
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:03,080
Did you have other plans in mind?

554
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,420
Gosh!

555
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:07,420
Other plans... What other plans?

556
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:10,260
How about...

557
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:14,480
we play a game, and the loser needs to grant the winner a wish?

558
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:17,410
No changing your mind.

559
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:21,760
I'm a lawyer in the Republic of Korea.

560
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,020
Follow me!

561
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:27,320
It's dark, though. Which game do you have in mind?

562
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,460
At least give me a hint.

563
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:40,800
Wow! Perfect!

564
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:10,600
Your form is good, but your—

565
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:20,570
Game over.

566
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:25,870
I guess I'm the one who gave you a gift today.

567
00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:30,480
Go ahead and tell me your wish.

568
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:33,280
Follow me.

569
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,790
Where are you?

570
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:41,050
Why the hell is he texting me? So annoying.

571
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:42,860
Say that one more time.

572
00:42:43,870 --> 00:42:46,500
- Who's doing what?
- You didn't know?

573
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,340
At this restaurant,

574
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:52,130
Eun Seon Woo and Seho Group's daughter are having a blind date today.

575
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:54,910
I thought for sure you'd be aware.

576
00:42:54,910 --> 00:42:56,340
I mean...

577
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:59,880
it's common knowledge that Seho Group and Eunkang are close.

578
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:03,880
Oh, I think your father's the one who arranged it.

579
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:08,220
Hey, behave yourself.

580
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:11,830
If the date goes well and the two families naturally achieve their M&A,

581
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:13,910
do you think there will be a place for you?

582
00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:21,150
[Where are you?]

583
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:31,810
I'm not someone who really enjoys dessert, so...

584
00:43:32,930 --> 00:43:36,060
Then just sit and enjoy the view of me eating.

585
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:39,790
Since I eat quite heartily and beautifully.

586
00:43:40,850 --> 00:43:45,120
You have quite a lot of requests.

587
00:43:45,730 --> 00:43:48,060
You should think carefully, too.

588
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:49,970
You'll have to get married someday anyway.

589
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:53,290
And you'll probably have to sit through a ton of meals like this.

590
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:55,620
Now is the right time.

591
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:59,090
Of course, it's a marriage I have to do someday,

592
00:43:59,090 --> 00:44:00,980
but I'll decide...

593
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:03,590
the timing of my life.

594
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,350
Oppa!

595
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:10,140
I told you not to smile in front of other women!

596
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:23,400
This is... Plan B.

597
00:44:30,310 --> 00:44:31,880
Okay.

598
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:38,010
Well...

599
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:44,050
Isn't your business location... kind of, you know?

600
00:44:44,050 --> 00:44:45,750
What about it?

601
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:49,320
Well, what are you planning to do?

602
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:51,880
I need to prepare the dough in advance,

603
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:53,900
so I can run my business tomorrow.

604
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:55,570
Dough?

605
00:44:58,660 --> 00:44:59,810
Then...

606
00:44:59,810 --> 00:45:03,140
Well, then, should I help out with the dough?

607
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:05,350
It won't be easy.

608
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:13,290
Then, can I leave it in your hands?

609
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,210
Look.

610
00:45:19,730 --> 00:45:22,230
Watch me. Here I go.

611
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:24,080
Knead.

612
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:25,820
Knead.

613
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:28,270
And fold it over. And repeat.

614
00:45:28,270 --> 00:45:30,050
Knead.

615
00:45:30,050 --> 00:45:32,950
Knead. This is the gist of it, okay?

616
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:39,450
This is something a strong man like I should do.

617
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:09,930
Wait, hold on!

618
00:46:09,930 --> 00:46:11,250
You can't do it like that.

619
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:14,100
Look. It's not like that.

620
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:15,250
Hand!

621
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:17,150
Okay, together.

622
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:18,710
Knead.

623
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:22,160
Knead and... fold it.

624
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:30,850
♫ Oh, my sweetheart, my darling ♫

00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:34,520
is my girlfriend.

634
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:44,120
I think this is...

635
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:48,420
where I'm supposed to yell at you and run out the door,

636
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:51,700
but I feel like...

637
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:54,470
that won't be necessary.

638
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:00,420
Of course. There's still a lot of food left.

639
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:03,940
Take your time to enjoy the food.

640
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:06,240
Oppa...

641
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:09,100
Why didn't you eat anything?

642
00:48:10,350 --> 00:48:13,470
Look at how haggard your face looks

643
00:48:13,470 --> 00:48:17,410
because of your long hours at work.

644
00:48:17,410 --> 00:48:19,890
I told you not to skip out on meals

645
00:48:19,890 --> 00:48:23,110
even if you have a busy schedule, didn't I?

646
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:25,860
You worry me so much.

647
00:48:26,590 --> 00:48:31,770
I-I... I-I'll eat.

648
00:48:31,770 --> 00:48:35,280
Do you want to eat something, too?

649
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:38,660
As expected of Oppa...

650
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:42,750
Se Ra didn't have much of a dinner...

651
00:48:42,750 --> 00:48:44,500
so she's starving.

652
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:46,300
Se Ra wants this one.

653
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:47,530
This one, this one.

654
00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:49,150
This one, ah...

655
00:48:49,150 --> 00:48:52,130
Oh, this is what our Se Ra likes.

656
00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:53,700

00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:56,210
- Here, ah...
- Ah...

658
00:48:57,460 --> 00:48:59,070
Good girl.

660
00:49:03,310 --> 00:49:08,470
Eun Seon Woo must be the very sweet type in a relationship.

661
00:49:09,130 --> 00:49:12,280
I'm sorry. I forgot we're not alone.

662
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:16,570
I only have eyes for my Oppa.

663
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:19,310
Of course.

664
00:49:19,310 --> 00:49:22,330
You don't know how attentive my Oppa is.

665
00:49:22,330 --> 00:49:24,150
He's unchanging.

666
00:49:24,150 --> 00:49:27,000
My heart flutters every single day.

667
00:49:29,210 --> 00:49:31,780
You've been in a relationship before, right?

668
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:36,510
Conditions, upbringing, to hell with all that!

669
00:49:37,670 --> 00:49:42,850
A relationship solely full of love.

670
00:49:47,470 --> 00:49:51,950
Oppa, I think I bragged too much about us when there's a third party.

671
00:49:51,950 --> 00:49:55,120
In front of someone I just met. Sorry.

672
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:00,180
I know you have a lot of time on your hands,

673
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:03,630
but I surmise you'd be uncomfortable the longer you stay...

674
00:50:03,630 --> 00:50:06,750
Shall we leave first?

675
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:08,960
No, stay put.

676
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:10,990
I'll be the one to leave.

677
00:50:13,310 --> 00:50:16,070
Eun Seon Woo, you're not as ambitious as I thought you'd be.

678
00:50:16,070 --> 00:50:19,020
I thought you were the same type of person as I was.

679
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:21,640
Thank you for the entertaining show today.

680
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:23,330
I'll make sure to...

681
00:50:23,330 --> 00:50:26,780
repay the favor soon.

682
00:50:34,670 --> 00:50:36,630
Why don't you...

683
00:50:36,630 --> 00:50:39,030
let go of my hand? Huh?

684
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:43,250
Why were you so over the top today?

685
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:45,040
Go sit over there.

686
00:50:45,570 --> 00:50:48,480
I wasn't exactly happy, either.

687
00:50:52,430 --> 00:50:54,500
It's Director Hong!

688
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:56,680
What do we do?

689
00:50:57,210 --> 00:50:59,090
What do you think?

690
00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:01,730
I'm going to let all hell break loose,

691
00:51:01,730 --> 00:51:03,730
so I'm not forced on a blind date ever again.

692
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:06,060
ever again.

693
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:08,280
- Let's go.
- What are you thinking?

694
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:10,360
What do you think?

695
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:13,120
We'll just do as we did.

696
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:15,790
All right. Let's go.

697
00:51:29,210 --> 00:51:30,880
He's still looking at us.

698
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:33,320
I think he's going to keep following us!

699
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:35,240
I do know of a sure method...

700
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:37,050
What is it?

701
00:51:37,050 --> 00:51:38,740
Let's go up to my room.

702
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:39,690
What?

703
00:51:39,690 --> 00:51:41,980
Gosh, just stay put.

704
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:45,530
We can't go to your house right now anyway.

705
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:48,990
You don't have any other plans?

706
00:51:48,990 --> 00:51:51,430
This will leave a bigger impact than any other plan.

707
00:51:51,430 --> 00:51:53,850
Help me one more time while you're at it.

708
00:51:53,850 --> 00:51:57,440
I'm asking... as a favor.

709
00:52:36,470 --> 00:52:37,990
I think Director Hong left.

710
00:52:37,990 --> 00:52:39,670
He's not there.

711
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:47,320
Wait.

712
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:50,090
This is where you stay?

713
00:52:51,150 --> 00:52:53,880
Well, it's more comfortable to stay here when I'm alone.

714
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:56,500
Oh, right.

715
00:52:56,500 --> 00:53:00,910
I guess it's better than returning to an empty house.

716
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:10,930
I think your stomach... is empty, too.

717
00:53:10,930 --> 00:53:14,610
I raced all the way here for you, leaving behind my favorite food!

718
00:53:14,610 --> 00:53:18,340
Since today's Plan B was a success, tell me what you want.

719
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:20,820
What's that favorite food of yours?

720
00:53:22,470 --> 00:53:25,200
Wait! Your favorite food is just this?

721
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:26,650
What do you mean, just?

722
00:53:26,650 --> 00:53:29,200
This tteokbokki is the only drug our country allows.

723
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,680
Don't look down on my tteokbokki!

724
00:53:38,350 --> 00:53:40,280
As expected.

725
00:53:44,770 --> 00:53:46,520
You're not going to eat?

726
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:50,700
You shouldn't eat carbs at night.

727
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:55,630
When it's this delicious?

728
00:53:56,550 --> 00:53:58,920
It's really good.

729
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:02,720
You're going to regret it.

730
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:04,230
I said I'm not going to eat.

731
00:54:04,230 --> 00:54:07,270
Once I say I won't eat something, I don't eat it.

732
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:10,940
- You're not going to regret it?
- Nope.

733
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:12,510
I don't like tteokbokki.

734
00:54:12,510 --> 00:54:14,140
You're salivating.

735
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:16,690
Just have a bite.

736
00:54:16,690 --> 00:54:18,880
Just once.

737
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:27,890
I can't share tteokbokki.

738
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:31,300
Are you playing with me? You having fun?

739
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:34,390
Sure, eat everything. Lick the plate clean.

740
00:54:34,390 --> 00:54:35,810
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

741
00:54:35,810 --> 00:54:39,200
[Bang Bang Bakery]
- It's going to break.
- I'm good at this now.

742
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:45,130
What are you doing? So childish!

743
00:54:45,130 --> 00:54:47,700
- Knead.
- Gosh, seriously. There.

744
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:50,680
Wait, wait, wait!

745
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,900
Brother! What's up?

746
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:56,910
Am I interrupting?

747
00:54:56,910 --> 00:55:00,070
No, of course not.

748
00:55:00,070 --> 00:55:02,440
What brings you here?

749
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:04,590
Nothing much.

750
00:55:04,590 --> 00:55:06,530
A few days ago...

751
00:55:06,530 --> 00:55:09,780
did you two visit Cafe Teen Tonic?

752
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:13,100
Why would we go there? Isn't that place for kids?

753
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:15,650
That's right. Why would we go somewhere like that?

754
00:55:15,650 --> 00:55:19,780
Detective Han, you really don't seem to have a good eye nor any tact.

755
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:22,190
Hey, how could you say that?

756
00:55:22,190 --> 00:55:25,430
Do you know how many bad guys our brother has thrown into jail?

757
00:55:25,430 --> 00:55:27,200
Well, a detective is supposed to catch bad guys.

758
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,700
What good is he if he can't do that?

759
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:32,340
We caught a gang that sells stimulants that night,

760
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:34,620
but they said they saw some people.

761
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:39,670
Se Ra didn't come with you?

762
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:40,760
Yes.

763
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:42,230
She left first because of an urgent work matter.

764
00:55:42,230 --> 00:55:44,350
Then you ate alone?

765
00:55:44,350 --> 00:55:46,520
No, I ate with Dong Hee.

766
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:48,450
Let's definitely eat together next time.

767
00:55:48,450 --> 00:55:50,000
Sure.

768
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:53,210
- Then I'll see you next time.
- Sure, sure.

769
00:55:53,210 --> 00:55:54,920
You're leaving?

770
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:57,030
Bye, Brother!

771
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:02,480
Should I have just gone?

772
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:04,910
I'm leaving.

773
00:56:04,910 --> 00:56:06,840
You're leaving already?

774
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:14,980
You're the one who asked to eat dinner together tonight.

775
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:17,450
Well, that's why I bought dinner.

776
00:56:17,450 --> 00:56:20,130
How could you be so two-faced?

777
00:56:20,130 --> 00:56:21,840
Two-faced?

778
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:24,700
I'm someone who's the same inside and out!

779
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:27,780
You're a mystery inside and out!

780
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:29,390
Gosh.

781
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:32,390
What's wrong with him all of a sudden?

782
00:56:40,510 --> 00:56:41,790
What?

783
00:56:41,790 --> 00:56:44,370
Who showed up on the blind date?

784
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:48,610
It was Don Se Ra.

785
00:56:52,630 --> 00:56:54,590
Wait, the two of them...

786
00:56:54,590 --> 00:56:57,190
went into a hotel room together?

787
00:56:57,190 --> 00:56:58,730
Yes.

788
00:56:59,710 --> 00:57:01,610
He was acting all high and mighty.

789
00:57:01,610 --> 00:57:04,200
What the hell was he doing with my secretary?

790
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:05,800
I think Don Se Ra...

791
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:09,010
is from Chairman Eun's side.

792
00:57:09,490 --> 00:57:11,490
Wait, then...

793
00:57:11,490 --> 00:57:14,720
he's been watching me by planting someone by my side?

794
00:57:19,510 --> 00:57:21,390
Look into Don Se Ra.

795
00:57:21,390 --> 00:57:22,780
Understood.

796
00:57:27,310 --> 00:57:31,840
I was really shocked you came to the welcome party.

797
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:35,870
I was there by coincidence while tailing Kang Tae Joon.

798
00:57:36,590 --> 00:57:38,990
Maybe it's because I showed up.

799
00:57:38,990 --> 00:57:42,380
You seemed to be drinking freely without a care in the world.

800
00:57:42,380 --> 00:57:45,310
Oh, I couldn't help it...

801
00:57:45,310 --> 00:57:48,210
As you know, Kang Ddo...

802
00:57:48,210 --> 00:57:52,200
But I didn't do anything wrong, did I?

803
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:54,460
Oh, wrong?

804
00:57:55,110 --> 00:57:58,130
I can tell you about it all night.

805
00:57:58,130 --> 00:58:00,780
Where should I start?

806
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:04,430
The welcome party or your house? What do you want to know?

807
00:58:05,050 --> 00:58:06,900
I'll...

808
00:58:07,820 --> 00:58:09,630
completely...

809
00:58:09,630 --> 00:58:12,300
forget about what happened that night.

810
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:13,710
Yes, thank you.

811
00:58:13,710 --> 00:58:15,960
But you know...

812
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:20,940
that... time inside the elevator...

813
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:24,920
Oh, Manager Kang had blood on his lips, so I couldn't just ignore it.

814
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:26,470
It wasn't that bad!

815
00:58:26,470 --> 00:58:28,670
It wasn't? Then?

816
00:58:28,670 --> 00:58:30,560
Anyway!

817
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:33,790
Don't do anything to give the wrong impression.

818
00:58:33,790 --> 00:58:37,370
Thank god it was me and not anyone else who saw that or...

819
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:39,790
they could've taken it the wrong way.

820
00:58:39,790 --> 00:58:41,110
Taken what the wrong way?

821
00:58:41,110 --> 00:58:42,940
I don't know. Just be careful.

822
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:46,980
You told me to look into every living person around Kang Tae Joon!

823
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:49,820
Then he needs to believe I'm on his side,

824
00:58:49,820 --> 00:58:53,880
so I can stay by his side for a long time. Am I wrong?

825
00:58:54,710 --> 00:58:56,730

By chance, what?

827
00:58:58,850 --> 00:59:03,460
By chance, you're not acting like this because I stepped on your foot, are you?

828
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:06,070
It's not about the foot, it's—

00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:11,430
Huh?

00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:35,660
but no matter how I think about it,

836
00:59:35,660 --> 00:59:38,880
it's too dangerous for you to be his secretary.

Hey, if you sleep here...

840
01:00:00,370 --> 01:00:04,930
You did have a lot on your plate today,

841
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,440
so I'll be understanding.

saying your arm is cramping or whatnot like that time in the hospital,

846
01:00:37,060 --> 01:00:38,510
as a preventative measure...

847
01:00:38,510 --> 01:00:40,650
I'm doing this as a preventative measure.

848
01:00:40,650 --> 01:00:42,730
