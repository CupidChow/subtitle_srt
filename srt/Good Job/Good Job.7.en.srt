Manager Kim called me to the meeting room yesterday

and informed me about what we need for the demonstration.

That's right.

331
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:46,730
And Chairman has also been informed.

332
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:51,650
If the chairman finds out about your misappropriation of funds...

333
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:57,050
I think it's best for you to inform Vice Chairman and ask for help...

334
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:58,840
Are you insane?

335
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,490
Don't ever tell Father about this.

336
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:01,940
I'll take care of Manager Kim's situation.

337
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,180
It's only a matter of time.

338
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:05,810
I said I'll take care of it!

339
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,310
Geez, that bastard!

340
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:29,510
I need to find Manager Kim

341
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:32,440
before Eun Seon Woo does.

342
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,740
Seon Woo! The secret camera we installed in Kang Tae Joon's room

343
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,850
is about to fall any moment now.

344
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:41,880
Hello? Seon Woo. Eun Seon Woo!

345
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:45,120
There's no other choice.

346
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,640
Enter player.

347
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:38,640
They're good.

348
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:46,450
- Is it good?
- Yeah.

349
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:51,510
Wait... this is... the staff lounge?

350
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:53,770
Sit and have a bite.

351
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:56,770
The company cafeteria is delicious. Why don't you eat there?

352
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:59,360
Gosh, there you go again.

353
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,180
You think we're actually big company employees because we clean here?

354
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:08,020
Service employees like us can't use the cafeteria.

355
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:11,460
Then can't you just go out and eat?

356
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:15,200
With what time? We need to eat and hurry back to work.

357
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:20,640
I think you should suggest a proposal at this point.

358
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,990
You think they'll listen to someone like us?

359
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:26,400
They don't even listen to their own employees.

360
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:30,570
There's no way that's true.

361
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,640
How else do you think

362
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,640
someone good at corporate politics gets promoted,

363
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,460
and someone else gets harassed because they can't kiss their superiors' ass.

364
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:40,640
Sexual harassment even occurs within the company!

365
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,540
I saw multiple employees crying in the restroom.

366
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:48,180
A-And that menace on the twelfth floor who disappeared.

367
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,750
That menace was the worst of the worst!

368
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:53,310
- That's right.
- Geez.

369
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:57,250
Anyway, is Mr. Bang all right?

370
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:58,990
Yes, yes.

371
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:01,870
I warned him multiple times not to do favors for the employees.

372
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:04,230
He got hurt in the end.

373
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:09,270
He hurt his back, helping move the items to be used for the demonstration.

374
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,920
Whoa, gosh.

375
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,830
Hold on, my back hurts.

376
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,690
Judging from earlier,

377
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:21,560
you're pretty quick and efficient.

378
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,760
Do you have a boyfriend?

379
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:25,990
Gosh...

380
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:27,870
My nephew just got a job.

381
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:30,290
Do you want to meet him?

382
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:34,310
You don't know just how diligent and wise he is.

383
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:36,840
You two would be perfect for each other.

384
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,820
Why, thank you.

385
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:41,250
You all seem to be about done eating.

386
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:43,230
Aren't you going back to work?

387
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,090
Hello.

388
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:55,100
I'm here to deliver a cake to the marketing team.

389
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,720
Okay, I'll connect you.

390
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,040
Who from the marketing team?

391
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,560
Well...

392
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:04,940
the client who ordered the cake was adamant that I make it a surprise,

393
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:08,100
I need to deliver it in person.

394
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,560
That's going to be difficult.

395
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,260
You know Bang Bang Bakery, right?

396
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:14,230
You're our regular customer.

397
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:15,810
You remember that?

398
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:19,050
Of course. I know you like our salt bread.

399
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:21,830
I'll leave my ID with you

400
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:25,010
and be right back. Please?

401
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:30,270
Then you need to come right back down after delivering the cake.

402
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:33,560
Of course! What else is there for me to do?

403
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,910
Thank you!

404
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:50,960
I'm from the Support Team. Manager Kang requested a computer repair.

405
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,670
I didn't hear about that.

406
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:57,720
Is that so? He told me he'd like it repaired as soon as possible.

407
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,080
Then I'll try contacting him.

408
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,980
You're going to contact him?

409
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:06,500
You know Manager Kang's temper, right?

410
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:11,390
Of course. Then please hurry and repair it.

411
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:13,380
I understand.

412
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:39,930
Where's Manager Kang?

413
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:43,120
Manager Kang isn't in right now.

414
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,250
And did Manager Kang happen to request a computer—

415
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:48,960
Hello, I'm here to deliver a cake from Bang Bang Bakery.

416
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,190
A cake?

417
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:52,110
I never ordered one.

418
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:54,400
Did Manager Kang Tae Joon by any chance...

419
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,890
Oh, my. Isn't this Manager Choi Tae Han's office?

420
00:28:57,890 --> 00:29:01,530
This is Manager Kang Tae Joon's office.

421
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:04,580
I must've been confused.

422
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:09,250
Oh, no! What should I do?

423
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:11,310
Oh, no! I'm so sorry!

424
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:14,270
- It's all right. It's all right.
- Did it get on you? Are you okay?

425
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,410
What should I do?

426
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:21,690
Oh, you're a regular customer of ours.

427
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:24,850
- You know Bang Bang, right?
- Yes.

428
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:27,600
How come you don't visit these days?

429
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,500
I'm a little busy with work.

430
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:33,510
You buy an iced americano and red bean bread every time you come.

431
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:34,720
That's right.

432
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:40,790
You're amazed by how I remember your order, aren't you?

433
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,190
Actually, my brother really loves red bean bread,

434
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:46,960
so you reminded me of my brother every time you bought one.

435
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,290
I see.

436
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:50,670
Then I'll treat you to an

437
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:53,250
- iced americano next time.
- All right.

438
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,020
I'll get going.

439
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:57,520
Hold on.

440
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:05,290
You forgot your cake.

441
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:07,610
Oh, my. What am I thinking?

442
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:09,810
Thank you.

443
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:18,380
How are you here?

444
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:21,480
Well, I came to deliver a cake and arrived in the lobby,

445
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,950
but I saw Attorney Yang passing by!

446
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:27,410
From experience, I knew I needed to step in.

447
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:29,240
You did recognize the situation right away.

448
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:33,900
I can even recognize customers who've visited the shop only once.

449
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,360
Customers?

450
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:39,760
Oh, so I'm also just a customer who spent a night with you.

451
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,830
Gosh, not just any customer...

452
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:44,970
but a bit special...

453
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:47,220
What's... special?

454
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,860
Do I necessarily have to say it aloud?

455
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,670
When you already know...

456
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:07,640
What do I know?

457
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:12,070
But... if you're to disguise yourself,

458
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:14,790
shouldn't you at least try as hard as Investigator Eun?

459
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:19,150
I don't know about Seon Woo, but no one recognizes me.

460
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:22,260
Huh?

461
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,740
Isn't this Investigator Eun's picture?

462
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:28,350
Who? What? Which aspect?

463
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:30,530
This here?

464
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:32,290
He looks pretty common.

465
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:35,670
I do think I saw him in that Taiwanese magazine.

466
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:37,600
What?

467
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,020
What now?

468
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:41,110
You said you're going somewhere. What about the cake?

469
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:42,880
Oh, my! I need to deliver this!

470
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,090
Th-Then I'll see you later.

471
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:52,160
Geez, moron.
(Also sounds like "life-size cutout" in Korean)

472
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:55,300
How can you place your cutout here?

473
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:09,360
I'll look around here,

474
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,350
so you go look into Lee Yeon.

475
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:12,890
Okay.

476
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:31,890
Right-handed...

477
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,900
Hey, hey. Click this one.

478
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:54,060
Okay.

479
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:55,330
What the?

480
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:57,270
It's the cleaning crew this time?

481
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:59,710
I caught you red-handed.

482
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:01,420
They still can't reach Manager Kim?

483
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:03,510
How ballsy after he caused trouble.

484
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:05,060
Everyone's keeping quiet,

485
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:09,900
but he created a ledger and stabbed Kang Ddo in the back.

486
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,390
You didn't hear anything?

487
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:12,360
You're from the same department.

488
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,880
Nope.

489
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,870
But I'm honestly so happy I don't need to see him anymore.

490
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:19,920
How he makes people feel bad with a single pen?

491
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,310
He wasn't like that in your team?

492
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:22,820
Once a dog, always a dog.

493
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:26,270
He was also infamous for having naughty hands.

494
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:27,530
You had one on your team, too. Right?

495
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:28,960
That one employee he settles on

496
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,670
to harass like his own little rag doll.

497
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:34,280
You're the one making my emotions boil!

498
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:38,420
Don't cry just because you got a little scolding from your boss.

499
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:41,480
You need to get it together.

500
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:44,990
I've seen it plenty of times myself.

501
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:03,720
The person who Manager Kim settled on to harass...

502
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,640
was Lee Yeon.

503
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,980
Come to the demonstration hall.

504
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,670
All right.

505
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,810
Where's the girl who was here just now?

506
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:19,420
Who...

507
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:21,640
The cleaning crew. The cleaning crew!

508
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,620
- I didn't see her.
- The cleaning crew?

509
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:25,380
Shit...

510
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,160
Shit!

511
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:30,400
Shit...

512
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,200
Manager Kim harassed and ostracized her,

513
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,170
which is why she even took medication.

514
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:37,520
That's why she snapped Manager Kim's fountain pen.

515
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,060
Then the two really could have been conspiring.

516
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:43,470
After both of them left work, there was no one who even entered the office.

517
00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:45,540
What if the time that Manager Kim disappeared

518
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:48,930
wasn't after the post was submitted to the forum?

519
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,350
Where the hell did she go?

520
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:05,140
I think Kang Tae Joon is looking for you.

521
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:07,610
Hurry and hide!

522
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:11,430
Hey, stop right there.

523
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:13,460
Stop right there!

524
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:17,210
Shit!

525
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:18,700
Then, what should I do now?

526
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,330
Go to the women's restroom.

527
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:22,810
Hey. Hey!

528
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,070
Geez...

529
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:50,640
You thought I wouldn't know if you disguised yourself, huh?

530
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,110
Huh?

531
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:55,940
You're that bitch from the club, aren't you?

532
00:35:56,600 --> 00:36:00,540
What are you trying to achieve by doing this, huh?

533
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:03,880
Is he okay?

534
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:06,010
You think he won't be, huh?

535
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:07,990
What?

536
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:10,440
I miscalculated my strength.

537
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,750
My soft heart is the problem.

538
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:14,860
I hit him too softly.

I... think it was...

555
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,470
Oh, those two... are the special cleaning crew hired by the secretary's office.

00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:10,920
Who are you?

557
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:16,050
Oh, I'm... Chairman's Secretary Director, Hong Man Soo.

558
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:17,470
Oh, hello.

559
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:21,850
So they're the special cleaning crew hired by the secretary's office?

560
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:24,480
Yes, we had an urgent situation.

561
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,080
For god's sake,

562
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,680
you should've given me a heads up.

563
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,620
It's like you're neglecting my position.

564
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:33,590
There tend to be many unpredictable situations, so...

565
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:34,850
I'm sorry.

566
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:40,470
I hope work management can be nice and neat from now on.

567
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,920
- Take care.
- Yes.

568
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:51,780
I mean, is it Halloween day right now?

569
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:56,450
I took care of you so you wouldn't touch a single drop of water,

570
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:58,860
but what exactly are you doing right now?

571
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:01,560
I know what you're trying to say,

572
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:04,310
but there's a good explanation for my situation—

573
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:06,350
Of course, there is.

574
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:09,200
But isn't this too— What is this?

575
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,870
It smells.

576
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:16,430
Do you know if the audit team or the ethics team

577
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:20,070
have any open investigations on Manager Kim?

578
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:23,210
I think it was about two months ago...

579
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:25,870
There was a request for an investigation for cases of slander.

580
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,420
Relating to Manager Kim?

581
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:31,010
No, the one who requested the investigation was Manager Kim.

582
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:33,880
Manager Kim against who?

583
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:36,120
Manager Cheong Yi Seon.

584
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,180
If it's Manager Cheong Yi Seon...

585
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:40,580
I recall her to be quite a diligent employee.

586
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:43,580
Wasn't he on the same team as Manager Kim?

587
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:46,780
I haven't seen him around recently, so I thought he had resigned.

588
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:48,550
Yes, that's right.

589
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:50,100
By any chance,

590
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,840
- are you investigating that internal complaint—
- Director Hong?

591
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:57,110
You heard what the cleaning team leader just said, right?

592
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:59,840
Heard what... Oh, N&N!

593
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,790
- Nice and neat.
- Yes.

594
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:03,610
So I want you to go and raze

595
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:07,240
the current cleaning crew lounge that's worse than a dungeon,

596
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,650
and prepare them a new one.

597
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:10,320
Right now.

598
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,700
Yes, understood.

599
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,570
Wait, so Chairman, are you investigating the internal—

600
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:16,860
And the... Stairs of Hell from earlier.

601
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:22,210
Oh, and I heard there's a higher-up that won't allow the cleaning crew

602
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:24,240
to use the elevator.

603
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,870
Do you know who that might be?

604
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:27,990
To my knowledge...

605
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:32,190
Chief Manager Kang Tae Joon made that proposal when he was appointed.

606
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:33,670
He must've been busy at work.

607
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:35,210
Up to all kinds of no good.

608
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:36,570
I'm sorry?

609
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:39,530
Oh, nothing.

610
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:40,550
- Director Hong?
- Yes.

611
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:41,920
Please put this away.

612
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,950
- Understood.
- Let's go.

613
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:47,240
But wait!

614
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,150
I didn't hear...

615
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:51,330
What did he say?

616
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:53,670
I'm the Secretary Director, but why does...

617
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:55,940
he bring around Don Se Ra?

618
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:58,730
I replayed it multiple times,

619
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:02,650
but there's no sight of an abductor, let alone Manager Kim's shadow.

620
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,600
It's not like he used magic.

621
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,160
Where could he have gone?

622
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,200
It is like a magical situation...

this situation.

624
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:14,290
He has grabbed the attention of the audience,

625
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:15,960
so is all that's left...

626
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:18,780
is for me to reveal the trick?

627
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:20,910
You figured out where Manager Kim is?

628
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:22,670
So who's the culprit?

629
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:26,930
Magic is only fun when there's an audience.

630
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:30,520
Let's go... and catch Manager Kim.

I'll gladly accept all responsibility for this matter.

665
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:49,370
You probably couldn't move Manager Kim on your own, so...

666
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:53,440
you tricked Mr. Bang into thinking it was a monitor

667
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:56,090
and moved it to the demonstration hall.

668

Please move this to the demonstration hall.

- I'll return the cleaning cart.
- All right.

670
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:06,100
You left the big box to Mr. Bang and

671
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:08,800
you told him you'd return the cleaning cart

Should I just expose that information?

00:44:56,810 --> 00:45:00,310
So you submitted that post pretending to be Manager Kim,

turning Kang Tae Joon and Manager Kim against each other,

So you subdued Manager Kim with sleeping pills,

and the reason you submitted that post at 11:00 p.m.

708
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:21,840
was to exclude the two who were working late from the suspect list. Right?

822
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:29,450
How you almost humiliated yourself trying to steal competitors' manpower and skills?

823
00:53:29,450 --> 00:53:35,310
Or... how you embezzled the company's money to build a slush fund?

824
00:53:37,170 --> 00:53:39,680
Or... your drug use?

825
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:44,660
Or... maybe how you tried to kill Oh Ah Ra.

826
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:47,610
What are you rambling on about?

827
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:58,600
You recognize this necklace, right?

828
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:05,040
I don't think you're the one who did it.

829
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:07,980
Since you're not even close to being able to.

830
00:54:08,650 --> 00:54:10,880
What the hell is that, that you're doing this to me?

831
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:13,450
My mother's necklace.

832
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:18,380
I'm asking why you have the necklace that disappeared when my mother died!

833
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:20,620
Wait, that's your mother's necklace?

834
00:54:20,620 --> 00:54:23,190
But why are you asking me that?

835
00:54:23,190 --> 00:54:26,180
Since it was kept at your villa.

836
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,910
My villa?

837
00:54:30,110 --> 00:54:32,630
How would you know that it was there?

838
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:37,290
Hey. You dug through my villa, too, you fucking thief?

839
00:54:37,290 --> 00:54:40,450
Are you playing word games with me?

840
00:54:40,450 --> 00:54:41,730
Thief?

841
00:54:41,730 --> 00:54:48,120
I was considerate enough to give you a chance to answer, but you'd rather react this way?

842
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:50,010
Chance?

843
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:54,460
What chance did you ever give me?

844
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:57,670
The moment you entered Eunkang,

845
00:54:57,670 --> 00:55:03,100
you stole Eunkang from my father and me.

846
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:27,340
I think Chairman Eun Seon Woo has found out about Manager Kang's embezzlement.

847
00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:29,400
What?

848
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:31,440
How did he manage to—

849
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:34,500
Where is he?

850
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:36,030
He's trying to fix things.

851
00:55:36,030 --> 00:55:38,880
Drag him home before he causes more trouble!

852
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:40,450
Understood.

853
00:55:43,470 --> 00:55:45,800
Manager Kim Hong Soo has been taken by the police.

854
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:50,920
And the audit team started an internal investigation to make sure there aren't any other victims.

855
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:52,720
Yes.

856
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:55,390
You've done a great job today, Director Hong.

857
00:55:55,390 --> 00:55:58,750
Yes. I know you and Secretary Don did that today

858
00:55:58,750 --> 00:56:02,710
because of Manager Kim, but since when were you like that with Secretary Don?

859
00:56:02,710 --> 00:56:07,960
I'm quite exhausted today, so let's discuss that next time.

860
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:09,740
Okay, but you know—

861
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:13,950
Please prepare an official apology for the group's willingness to admit the damage

862
00:56:13,950 --> 00:56:20,250
to the employees and come up with measures to prevent a recurrence.

863
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:23,960
- And the request I made of you—
- Will be ready soon.

864
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:31,490
Did he just cut me off and leave?

865
00:56:31,490 --> 00:56:33,110
Here.

866
00:56:33,110 --> 00:56:35,500
Please come in.

867
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:43,780
What is all this?

868
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:47,430
The chairman instructed we create a beautiful and clean rest area

869
00:56:47,430 --> 00:56:49,610
for the employees in charge of

870
00:56:49,610 --> 00:56:52,700
beautifying the company.

871
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:54,750
What in the world?

872
00:56:54,750 --> 00:56:56,460
- Can we go in?
- Can we touch it?

873
00:56:56,460 --> 00:56:58,350
Whoa!

874
00:56:58,350 --> 00:56:59,980
Oh, my! Look at this!

875
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:02,150
It has everything!

876
00:57:02,150 --> 00:57:04,530
Oh, my! It's a massage chair!

877
00:57:04,530 --> 00:57:05,640
Come here!

878
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:07,140
Oh my god! Look at that!

879
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:09,210
Oh, my!

880
00:57:09,210 --> 00:57:11,560
Right and...

881
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:13,080
this.

882
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:16,690
It's the monthly company cafeteria menu.

883
00:57:16,690 --> 00:57:20,370
Monthly company cafeteria menu?

884
00:57:20,810 --> 00:57:21,960
What's this for?

885
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:24,390
Starting today, you'll have free access

886
00:57:24,390 --> 00:57:26,270
to the company's cafeteria for all three meals.

887
00:57:26,270 --> 00:57:28,320
Oh, my! For free?

888
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:31,220
Our cafeteria has five stars.

889
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:32,990
Five stars!

890
00:57:32,990 --> 00:57:35,330
What's going on?

891
00:57:35,330 --> 00:57:37,520
My long life is fruitful!

892
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:40,900
- Now, then.
- I can have four meals, right?

893
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:42,340
- What in the world?
- Whoa...

894
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:44,790
- The Chairman must've...
- Oh,

895
00:57:44,790 --> 00:57:49,840
by the way, you can start using the elevator today.

896
00:57:50,790 --> 00:57:52,430
The higher-ups told me...

897
00:57:52,430 --> 00:57:56,700
to tell you they're sorry for everything until now.

898
00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:59,480
Don't mind it. Thank you.

899
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:01,460
How did they know that my knee is the most

900
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:03,060
urgent?

901
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:10,510
Did you find out... the reason why Manager Kang had

902
00:58:10,510 --> 00:58:12,630
that necklace?

903
00:58:15,020 --> 00:58:18,610
I found out who my enemy is.

904
00:58:19,410 --> 00:58:21,290
You can go home for the day.

905
00:58:22,470 --> 00:58:26,180
Let's have a company dinner since I accomplished my first mission

906
00:58:26,180 --> 00:58:28,460
as your official assistant.

907
00:58:29,970 --> 00:58:31,660
Company dinner?

908
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:33,420
- Just us two?
- Yes.

909
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:36,150
They threw an intense welcoming party for when I was an intern.

910
00:58:36,150 --> 00:58:39,600
Isn't there something like that at our detective's office?

911
00:58:41,020 --> 00:58:43,880
After that intern dinner, I...

912
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:46,700
started to hate company dinners.

913
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:48,310
Company dinner?

914
00:58:48,310 --> 00:58:49,980
There are none.

915
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:51,650
Then an impromptu dinner between coworkers.

916
00:58:51,650 --> 00:58:54,140
Let's make it an impromptu dinner. Let's go.

917
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:57,350
I have a special remedy of mine for times like this.

918
00:58:57,350 --> 00:58:59,120
Let's go.

919
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:00,750
Wait, no...

920
00:59:00,750 --> 00:59:03,870
Let's go. Come along when I'm asking nicely.

921
00:59:17,830 --> 00:59:19,390
It's delicious, right?

922
00:59:19,390 --> 00:59:21,880
It feels like you're rewarded, right?

923
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:24,940
I eat this when I'm having a tough time.

924
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:27,520
Then my mood gets a lot better,

925
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:29,820
making me thank God that I'm alive.

926
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:34,790
Were there many days when you needed this pork belly?

927
00:59:34,790 --> 00:59:38,690
Well, I can't say that I never had.

928
00:59:38,690 --> 00:59:42,570
I had some questions that would pop up from time to time,

929
00:59:42,570 --> 00:59:45,420
but are hard to answer, you know?

930
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:47,280
What questions?

931
00:59:50,470 --> 00:59:53,550
"What kind of people were my parents?"

932
00:59:53,550 --> 00:59:57,370
"Who are the people coming out in my nightmares?"

933
00:59:57,370 --> 00:59:59,660
"What had happened in my childhood, which I

934
00:59:59,660 --> 01:00:02,570
don't remember at all?" Those things.

935
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:09,040
It's probably hard for you to deduce things like this even for you. Right?

936
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:10,850
You must have the wrong idea,

937
01:00:10,850 --> 01:00:12,950
but I'm not a fortune teller.

938
01:00:13,750 --> 01:00:17,440
But do you not know anything

939
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:19,490
about your parents?

940
01:00:21,310 --> 01:00:23,150
Yeah.

941
01:00:23,150 --> 01:00:25,790
What's your nightmare?

942
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:30,800
After I had a blackout before, something keeps coming to mind,

943
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:34,890
but I can't tell if it's a dream

944
01:00:34,890 --> 01:00:37,260
or lost memory.

945
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:41,800
Boss, another bottle of soju, please.

946
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:43,540
Okay.

947
01:00:46,450 --> 01:00:48,250
Don't pass out today.

948
01:00:48,250 --> 01:00:51,560
All right, all right.

949
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:54,060
It's fine. I like to pour it myself.

950
01:00:57,180 --> 01:00:58,740
Cheers.

951
01:01:04,530 --> 01:01:07,030
This meal was supposed to be for you,

952
01:01:07,030 --> 01:01:10,720
but I blabbered too much about myself.

953
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:12,930
No more questions starting now.

954
01:01:12,930 --> 01:01:15,000
I want to hear your story.

955
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,860
Let's see... someone with good looks

956
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:20,600
and wealth and has everything like you

957
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:23,750
probably never had a nightmare before. Right?

958
01:01:23,750 --> 01:01:25,590
Don Se Ra.

959
01:01:26,670 --> 01:01:30,510
The... more you have...

960
01:01:30,510 --> 01:01:32,330
the more you lose.

961
01:01:32,330 --> 01:01:34,030
Life's like that.

962
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:37,010
After Mom's case,

963
01:01:37,010 --> 01:01:40,230
every single day was a nightmare.

964
01:01:41,100 --> 01:01:42,830
But I ground my teeth,

965
01:01:42,830 --> 01:01:44,850
and hung in there.

966
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:53,700
"The living must live on."

967
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:56,240
So I managed to live on...

968
01:01:57,410 --> 01:01:59,560
sadly.

969
01:02:03,450 --> 01:02:07,330
Don Se Ra, you should eat the pork belly you like,

970
01:02:07,330 --> 01:02:10,600
and what was it? Eat tteokbokki...

971
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:12,630
to get through it all.

972
01:02:13,770 --> 01:02:16,510
You even remember that I like tteokbokki?

973
01:02:16,510 --> 01:02:20,760
Wow, Chairman Eun, how incredible.

974
01:02:21,450 --> 01:02:22,510
That's a compliment, right?

975
01:02:22,510 --> 01:02:25,030
Of course, it's a compliment!

976
01:02:25,030 --> 01:02:27,440
You compliment me every time,

977
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:30,630
but I always feel... insulted.

978
01:02:30,630 --> 01:02:32,300
The meat's burning. It's burning.

979
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:34,630
Please flip this one.

980
01:02:37,190 --> 01:02:39,180
Let's raise our glasses.

981
01:02:41,230 --> 01:02:43,030
Cheers!

982
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:55,400
How did he know about my relationship with Oh Ah Ra,

983
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:57,850
and what's with the necklace?

984
01:02:59,490 --> 01:03:01,590
Eun Seon Woo even looked into my background

985
01:03:01,590 --> 01:03:03,970
to bring me down?

986
01:03:06,010 --> 01:03:08,710
You must've taken me lightly,

987
01:03:08,710 --> 01:03:11,100
but you thought wrong.

988
01:03:25,940 --> 01:03:27,170
Stay outside.

989
01:03:27,170 --> 01:03:29,690
I have something to discuss with just Father.

990
01:03:39,030 --> 01:03:42,410
Eun Seon Woo kept talking about his mom's necklace...

991
01:03:42,410 --> 01:03:44,230
Do you know about it?

992
01:03:44,890 --> 01:03:46,150
Necklace?

993
01:03:46,150 --> 01:03:49,020
Yeah, he said it was at our villa.

994
01:03:49,020 --> 01:03:52,900
By any chance, are you the one who held on to it?

995
01:04:12,630 --> 01:04:16,610
I'm done with my duty in the company. Right?

996
01:04:16,610 --> 01:04:21,870
Yeah. Starting tomorrow, you can go straight to the secret base.

997
01:04:21,870 --> 01:04:23,350
Okay.

998
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:27,850
I guess it's time to return to my original job now.

999
01:04:27,850 --> 01:04:31,220
Then, what about you?

1000
01:04:31,220 --> 01:04:34,990
Chairman Eun within the company, and Investigator Eun outside...

1001
01:04:34,990 --> 01:04:38,330
I'll need to find evidence against my enemy. Right?

1002
01:04:39,010 --> 01:04:41,830
Who on earth is that enemy?

1003
01:04:41,830 --> 01:04:45,060
Well, I'm also an employee...

1004
01:04:45,060 --> 01:04:47,850
If I know the enemy and myself, it's one shot, one kill.

1005
01:04:47,850 --> 01:04:50,230
Sayings like that exist.

1006
01:04:50,770 --> 01:04:51,860
Fine.

1007
01:04:51,860 --> 01:04:55,180
You don't need to say anything if you want to.

1008
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:03,120
- Go inside.
- Huh?

1009
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:05,790
I'm going.

1010
01:05:05,790 --> 01:05:07,820
All right.

1011
01:05:07,820 --> 01:05:09,940
Goodbye.

1012
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:12,990
Hurry!

1013
01:05:12,990 --> 01:05:14,390
Go.

1014
01:05:14,390 --> 01:05:16,490
Why is he rushing?

1015
01:05:16,490 --> 01:05:20,130
He's the one who said he'll take me home.

1016
01:05:31,950 --> 01:05:33,870
That's weird.

1017
01:05:33,870 --> 01:05:36,110
I think they've been following us since before.

1018
01:05:36,110 --> 01:05:37,970
Am I wrong?

1019
01:05:50,530 --> 01:05:52,450
What the? Where did he go?

1020
01:05:52,450 --> 01:05:54,040
Find him!

1021
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:56,260
Shit, where did this bastard go?

1022
01:05:56,260 --> 01:05:58,330
This son of a bitch.

1023
01:06:10,830 --> 01:06:12,060
Who are you people?

1024
01:06:12,060 --> 01:06:13,920
Who sent you?

1025
01:06:36,670 --> 01:06:38,610
Chairman!

1026
01:06:50,410 --> 01:06:55,440
♫ My savior, please save me with your love ♫

1027
01:06:55,440 --> 01:07:00,440
♫ Without you, I'm too tired. My jetlag is only a scar ♫

1028
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:05,390
♫ Please save me, whoa, whoa, my savior ♫

1029
01:07:05,390 --> 01:07:09,940
♫ So no one can shake my heart ♫

1030
01:07:09,940 --> 01:07:15,020
♫ My savior ♫
[Good Job]

1031
01:07:15,020 --> 01:07:17,000
A-Abducted? Seon Woo was?

1032
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,830
How dare you drag President Byeon into this?

1033
01:07:18,830 --> 01:07:21,750
Until I catch those bastards and make them pay,

1034
01:07:21,750 --> 01:07:23,750
I'm not going to die.

1035
01:07:25,740 --> 01:07:27,010
Chairman!

1036
01:07:27,010 --> 01:07:28,940
Seon Woo... is dead?

1037
01:07:28,940 --> 01:07:30,640
Chairman Eun Seon Woo has gone missing.

1038
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:34,010
We can't leave Eunkang Group's executive seat vacant forever.

1039
01:07:34,010 --> 01:07:36,550
I have something to say to Vice Chairman.

1040
01:07:36,550 --> 01:07:38,200
We must find Chairman Eun.

1041
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:40,020
Se Ra most definitely went to the scene.

1042
01:07:40,020 --> 01:07:42,450
What if she gets caught by those people?

1043
01:07:42,450 --> 01:07:46,810
♫ My savior ♫
