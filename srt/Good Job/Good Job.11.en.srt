I found the culprit after 20 years but I don't know why I still feel leery.

00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,890
Of course, you're leery.

173
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:11,650
Vice Chairman ended up like that before he paid for his crimes.

Everything falls into place too perfectly...

177
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,550
like a perfectly solved puzzle.

Are you saying there's something else?

180
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:33,290
Wait! Are you saying...

181
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:37,560
Vice Chairman's suicide might not be what it seems?

182

Although, it's too early to tell.

I saw the news.

188
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,860
So Vice Chairman killed Angel Lady?

189
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:55,390
I think so. They found his suicide note.

190
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:59,760
He kept it well hidden until now, but why did he suddenly attempt suicide?

191
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:03,450
I think he made such an extreme choice because there was a witness.

192
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:04,480
A witness?

193

You know how I mentioned Kim Nam Gyu last time?

194
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:12,740
He turned out to be Vice Chairman's secretary, Kim Jae Ha.

195
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:15,110
What?

196
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:19,340
He's the Kim Nam Gyu who was with us at the orphanage when we were little?

197
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:22,320
Yeah, I was really shocked, too.

198
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:28,670
I suspect Vice Chairman's case to have been attempted murder.

199
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:33,650
Am I the only one who thinks it's weird for someone who's planning suicide to take his

201
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,760
It's only suspicion for now.

202
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:43,260
If his blood analysis shows traces of the medication,

203
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:46,260
isn't that a sign that it wasn't suicide?

I ask you to perform the blood analysis.

So I can find the true culprit who killed my mother...

207
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:05,260
If someone really attempted to murder Vice Chairman, there must be a reason.

What are you trying to investigate?

216
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:35,570
I want to make things clear,

217
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:39,950
so no one questions whether Vice Chairman attempted suicide or not.

218

Right!

I saved it so I could go with my sweetie.

What if he doesn't wake up?

What will you do if he just passes away like this?

Will you take responsibility?

If the investigation is approved,

Vice Chairman could go to prison.

Why would Father go to prison, you son of a bitch?

Are you really trying to turn my father into a murderer?

I'm not turning him into one. It's the truth.

With what evidence? Just because he possessed a mere necklace?

You expect me to believe that bastard?

I don't believe a single word that bastard says.

288
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:51,900
And my father wasn't weak enough to rely on medication.

289
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,030
But he took sleeping pills and attempted suicide?

I didn't think this was how you'd repay that affection.

How she said she'd let you meet your father soon.

That your father was... Vice Chairman Kang Wan Soo, was it?

But why did your father commit suicide?

330
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:32,500
Or maybe someone... covered it up as a suicide?

the reason you asked me to leave a trace is...

He needs to know he's been cornered,

Maybe it's because the case has been solved,

468
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:20,620
your mind must be at ease.

469

That's not what I'm saying.

470

There do seem to be some after-effects.

Wh-What kind of after-effects?

473
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:33,870
Like side-effects?

474
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:36,460
I guess the side-effect is...

475
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:40,400
that the effects of the drug are too strong,

476
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,470
so it's hard for me to stop.

477
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:46,290
What are you saying?

478
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:48,160
What do you mean?

479
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:50,210

saying I can't live without you now.

481
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,230
Now, I'm somewhat reassured.

482
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:01,850
You seem to be back to normal,

483
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:03,450
and we found the truth.

484
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:07,010
I think all the hardships are over now, right?

485
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:11,640
Right...

486
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,880
I guess.

00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:35,150
more to me than a simple employee.

492
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:38,240
To be honest...

493
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:42,190
whenever you look at me,

494
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:45,600
I worried that you might be reminded of your mom's case,

495
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,710
and contemplated whether I should stay

496
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:50,940
by your side.

497
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:54,660
But I still missed you and wanted to contact you,

498
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:57,420
so I held myself back 10 times

499
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:59,370
and finally relented.

500
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,850
My feelings for you keep growing,

501
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:04,980
but I wasn't sure if it made you uncomfortable

502
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:07,500
to see me.

503
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:13,710
♫  Do you know me?  ♫

504
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:17,780
♫  If I was only given one day  ♫

505
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:22,100
I'm not uncomfortable... at all.

506
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,880
I can no longer...

507
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:28,160
live without Don Se Ra.

508
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:34,800
I don't want to part with the person I love...

509
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,780
anymore.

510
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:43,000
♫  today I stupidly  ♫

511
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,940
Chairman...

512
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:48,450
If it's not with you,

513
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:52,170
nothing holds significance...

514
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:53,820
to me.

515
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:05,450
Gosh, you two...

516
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:14,860
I thought you two would be spacing out while gazing at the stars,

517
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,380
but "if it's not with you..."

518
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:17,390
Wait! What did he say?

519
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:21,340
"If it's not with you, nothing holds significance."

520
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:26,950
But what's with the atmosphere when you came all the way here to camp?

521
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:29,300
Yeah, what's with this atmosphere?

522
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:31,410
Shall we give this place a makeover?

523
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:33,130
Okay, Plan B!

524
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:34,810
Start.

525
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:39,040
Where did we leave the car again?

526
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:42,050
See how these small touches transformed the atmosphere?

527
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:43,860
The basics of camping!

528
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,280
Atmosphere.

529
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,550
The atmosphere is set.

530
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:49,920
While we're at it, let's just start Plan B.

531
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,890
Double date.

532
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:55,400
Cheers!

[Detective Han Kwang Gi]

535
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,100
It's a work call,

536
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:12,110
so I'm going to leave for a sec.

537
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:17,900
Yang Jin Mo, let's go buy some food together.

538
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:20,320
Hey, we have so much to eat. What more do we need?

539
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:24,090
I'm just scared of walking alone at night.

540
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:25,780
Come along.

541
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:27,760
Okay.

542
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,860
Okay, sure.

543
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:31,600
I'll be back. Wait a moment.

544
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:44,290
Do you think he noticed us tailing him?

545
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:47,200
Which way did he go?

546
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:52,460
The only way he could've gone is toward the camping site.

547
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:57,730
Yes, Detective Han.

548
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:02,240
Yes, I'm outside with Se Ra.

549
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,070
Begin.

550
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:05,500
Here?

551
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:06,860
It's...

552
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:09,890
- Star-Starry.
- Starry Camp Site

553
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:11,430
What?

554
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:12,990
Starry Camp Site?

555
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:16,130
We lost Kim Nam Gyu somewhere nearby.

556
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:18,430
What?

557
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:26,600
It seems like things will go down here.

558
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:29,350
Se Ra is at the top of the campsite.

559
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:31,300
I put her in your care.

560
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:34,520
Jin Mo, follow me.

561
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,620
Who is he?

562
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:42,500
Are you a quick runner, or are you better at taking blows?

563
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,440
I got hit by my mom, and when I was a student, my teacher also—

564
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,450
Okay, rather than running away,

565
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:49,300
don't do anything and just defend from behind.

566
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:51,610
Are we on our way to take him on right now?

567
00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:53,950
Move according to your instincts.

568
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:56,860
Let me move according to my instincts.

569
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:15,190
I think Kim Jae Ha is going to attack Chairman Eun. Call for backup.

570
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:16,640
Okay.

571
00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:24,120
Wait! Did these guys go to make the food?

572
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:26,110
What's taking them so long?

573
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:33,600
Na Hee, I... really like Chairman Eun,

574
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,890
but can I continue to like him?

575
00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:39,620
I wonder if I'm too much of a burden to him.

576
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:44,120
Then... are you sure you're okay if you don't see him?

577
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:51,990
Then, my friend, you should "go" rather than worry.

578
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:12,740
Chairman Eun! Attorney Yang!

579
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:13,900
The two of them are in danger!

580
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:16,080
Huh? Why?

581
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,310
Hey, get some rest.

582
00:42:18,310 --> 00:42:23,320
I became a lawyer by eating the law books whole, you bastard.

583
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:26,740
Seon Woo.

584
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,220
Yang Jin Mo!

585
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:33,610
Who sent you? Did Kim Jae Ha send you?

586
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:43,280
Are you trying to kill me? Are you that stupid?

587
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:46,270
This won't end just because you kill me.

588
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:49,060
What is it?

589
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:51,130
It's dangerous!

590
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,420
Well, what can you do?

591
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:57,110
We don't have the time to do this!

592
00:43:57,110 --> 00:44:00,060
Hold on, hold on! Let's call the police! Kwang Gi!

593
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:02,050
We can't wait until then.

Kim Nam Gyu...

596
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:25,360
Don Se Ra,

597
00:44:26,470 --> 00:44:28,960
you can see me?

598
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:33,760
You're like a blue goblin.

599
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:34,810
What?

600
00:44:34,810 --> 00:44:36,920
Your eyes...

601
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,320
they're blue.

602
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:44,210
You... How did you know?

603
00:44:44,210 --> 00:44:45,860
They're visible to my eyes.

604
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:46,880
[Blue Goblin]

605
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:52,270
The blue goblin... if you tell anyone... you'll die.

606
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,520
Blue goblin...

607
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,700
if you tell anyone, you'll die.

608
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:05,290
How did he...

609
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:09,800
Angel Lady...

610
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,660
Angel Lady!

611
00:45:16,070 --> 00:45:19,410
Se Ra... Se Ra! Se Ra!

612
00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:27,130
Se Ra! Se Ra! Jin Mo!

613
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:30,450
Chairman Eun! Se Ra!

614
00:45:51,970 --> 00:45:53,530
Jin Mo!

615
00:45:53,530 --> 00:45:55,650
I'm okay. He just grazed me.

616
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:43,520
Damn it!

617
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:51,960
Jin Mo! Jin Mo! Jin Mo, are you okay? Get up!

618
00:46:57,010 --> 00:46:58,690
Are you okay?

619
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:00,380
Thanks to you.

620
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:03,110
Is the culprit who you suspected?

621
00:47:03,110 --> 00:47:05,190
It seems so.

622
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:07,860
Se Ra, I should go to Se Ra.

623
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:09,710
Please take care of Jin Mo.

624
00:47:16,770 --> 00:47:19,180
Se Ra! Are you okay?

625
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:23,050
Se Ra, did you forget that I told you not to use supervision?

626
00:47:23,050 --> 00:47:25,730
How do you feel? Can you see me?

627
00:47:25,730 --> 00:47:27,810
Are you really okay?

628
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:30,900
It wasn't a nightmare.

629
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:33,380
It was what I saw.

630
00:47:34,730 --> 00:47:36,160
What?

631
00:47:37,070 --> 00:47:39,850
That night, 20 years ago,

632
00:47:39,850 --> 00:47:43,180
the culprit that killed Angel Lady...

633
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:45,440
I saw everything.

634
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:48,680
The Blue Goblin.

635
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:50,830
Blue Goblin?

636
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:56,200
Are you talking about what was reported in my mother's case?

637
00:47:57,230 --> 00:48:00,270
Brother, hat witness was me, wasn't it?

638
00:48:00,270 --> 00:48:03,270
That's why you told me I don't need to remember.

639
00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:07,690
What do those memories hold? Tell me the truth now.

640
00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:12,140
Then... you were really the witness?

641
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:17,530
Detective Han, what's going on right now?

642
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:24,410
Before you got into the accident, you said incomprehensible words.

643
00:48:24,410 --> 00:48:28,430
And I kept hearing news of Angel Lady's accident.

644
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:30,920
Then...

645
00:48:32,110 --> 00:48:34,160
the reporter...

646
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,740
I reported it.

647
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:41,010
Se Ra did see something, but I couldn't tell what she was saying.

648
00:48:41,010 --> 00:48:44,230
But I thought it might help in some way.

649
00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:48,170
Se Ra regained consciousness but couldn't remember anything.

650
00:48:48,170 --> 00:48:50,350
I thought it was for the better.

651
00:48:50,350 --> 00:48:54,550
Since she also forgot how Angel Lady died.

652
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:58,920
I should've run to her.

653
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:02,280
I could've saved her.

654
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:05,340
It's because of me.

655
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:10,090
Se Ra, it's not your fault.

656
00:49:10,090 --> 00:49:12,950
Don't be like this.

657
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:14,710
It was...

658
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:18,700
the man with blue eyes.

659
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,420
Blue eyes?

660
00:49:31,310 --> 00:49:33,160
Shit!

661
00:49:49,030 --> 00:49:51,680
Who is that person?

662
00:49:52,790 --> 00:49:55,100
Kim Jae Ha.

663
00:49:56,270 --> 00:49:58,970
It was Kim Nam Gyu.

664
00:49:58,970 --> 00:50:03,080
Kim Jae Ha did that to you?

665
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:07,310
Why... Why am I remembering this now?

666
00:50:10,490 --> 00:50:12,270
Why now?

667
00:50:17,870 --> 00:50:19,990
Kim Jae Ha.

668
00:50:49,350 --> 00:50:53,800
Director Hong, I need Kim Jae Ha's home address.

669
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,320
Yes.

670
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:58,810
No!

671
00:50:58,810 --> 00:51:00,400
You overexerted yourself today, so you need to rest.

672
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:03,680
No, I just started to regain my memories.

673
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:04,880
I want to go, too.

674
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:09,020
Get some rest at the secret base. I'll go over in a little while.

675
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:11,060
- But...
- Detective Han will come,

676
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:13,070

677
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:17,070
Staying here is helping me. Stay here in safety.

678
00:51:17,070 --> 00:51:18,210
I'm asking you a favor.

679
00:51:18,210 --> 00:51:21,600
Yeah, I'm always by Seon Woo's side.

680
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:24,850
I'll make something for you to eat. Get some rest.

681
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:13,750
Please move aside.

682
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:22,090
It's Vice Chairman's birthday.

683
00:53:22,090 --> 00:53:23,790
Of course.

684
00:53:27,130 --> 00:53:29,130
Can we do this without a warrant?

685
00:53:29,130 --> 00:53:32,240
That's why we're just walking in without breaking down the door.

686
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:33,820
I mean...

687
00:53:36,990 --> 00:53:39,160
What is this smell?

688
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:43,170
Hey, he must've fled.

689
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:49,190
What was this bastard scheming in here?

690
00:53:49,190 --> 00:53:53,060
I'll request for Assistant Kim's car to be tracked.

691
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:56,850
Hey, Seon Woo, this is giving me bad vibes.

692
00:54:00,730 --> 00:54:03,080
Yes, Director Hong.

693
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:04,550
Chairman?

694
00:54:04,550 --> 00:54:06,680
The results are out.

695
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:10,860
Vice Chairman and Assistant Kim are father and son.

696
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:16,610
And the security team just contacted me,

697
00:54:16,610 --> 00:54:18,300
but someone just entered your office

698
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:20,400
with your access card,

699
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:24,220
but I came and no one's here.

700
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:15,590
He built this discreet place and must've been tailing me from here.

701
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:19,760
He was digging into the case from 20 years ago,

702
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:23,410
while going back and forth from here to the office.

703
00:55:23,410 --> 00:55:25,170
Like a rat.

704
00:55:25,170 --> 00:55:29,490
How... How did you get in here?

705
00:55:31,190 --> 00:55:36,160
I saw Chairman Eun coming out of the lawyer's office when he was in the president's office.

706
00:55:36,710 --> 00:55:41,090
No matter how fast Eun Seon Woo is, he couldn't have done that in that short time.

707
00:55:41,090 --> 00:55:42,840
That's impossible.

708
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:49,930
Chairman and Brother all know now.

709
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:52,690
That you're the culprit who killed her.

710
00:55:52,690 --> 00:55:54,690
Turn yourself in.

711
00:55:55,870 --> 00:55:58,240
With what evidence?

712
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:00,940
That I'm Vice Chairman's son?

713
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:03,500
Since I saw it.

714
00:56:06,150 --> 00:56:08,090
You saw it?

715
00:56:09,510 --> 00:56:13,180
I wasn't sure, but you did make eye contact with me that time.

716
00:56:14,290 --> 00:56:17,740
She wasn't enough, so now you're after Chairman.

717
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:20,770
You're the one who sent those people, too, aren't you?

718
00:56:20,770 --> 00:56:23,110
How far will you go?

719
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:25,730
That's right.

720
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:29,280
You were like this back then, too.

721
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:33,830
I never got caught by anyone,

722
00:56:33,830 --> 00:56:39,080

I recall that Mrs. Yoon said your eyes were special.

I saw it.

729
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:12,460
I saw you killing her.

730
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:36,020
She was bleeding, but she had gotten back up...

731
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:38,070
but with a rock, you...

732
00:57:43,750 --> 00:57:46,580
killed her.

733
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:50,180
