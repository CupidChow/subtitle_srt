Let's just say for personal reasons.

61
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:20,960
Ninety percent of violent crimes usually happen because of personal emotions.

Everyone knows that Oh Ah Ra is Eunkang Group's exclusive model.

The fact that you personally went to her house

64
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:31,230
was because you had a close relationship with her. Is that right?

00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,870
On the other hand, actress Oh has signed on to work on two projects

165
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,340
- Wait...
- and also became Eunkang Group's exclusive model.

166
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:56,760
But why did the chairman disguise himself?

167
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,840
Even foreign fans have fallen into shock.

168
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,840
Next news.

169
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,400
[Eunkang]

170
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:09,460
I'm sorry for... causing you concern.

171
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:13,690
Gossip will be forgotten in no time.

172
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:15,880
You two really aren't dating?

173
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:19,310
I mean, it's strange.

174
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:22,270
The fact that you went to an actress's house at that time.

175
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,700
It was my fault.

176
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,190
It's definitely enough to misunderstand...

177
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:29,100
Are you sure it's a misunderstanding?

178
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,800
And not the truth?

179
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,030
If it were true,

180
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:37,140
do you think I'd use my woman as the group's model?

181
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:41,650
Well, there is a rumor that you don't like women.

182
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:44,580
And your problem is that you like women too much.

183
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,270
What?

184
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:50,120
Both of you, get out.

185
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,420
Chairman Eun, you should cancel all external schedules for now.

186
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,910
Chairman?

187
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:02,750
Please save it. I've already heard enough in there.

188
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,950
Fortunately, Vice Chairman Kang acted first and was able to silence the reporters,

189
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:08,460
but social media is another story.

190
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,510
This is why the secretarial office

191
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:12,980
is doing our best to take down as much as possible.

192
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:15,030
- Keep up the good work.
- Pardon?

193
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,540
Oh, yes.

194
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,690
Chairman?

195
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:20,370
You're not, right?

196
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:22,810
No, I'm not dating her.

197
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:25,000
Well, yes, that's what I thought,

198
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,490
but after Actress Oh Ah Ra rejected your confession on your knees

199
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:30,260
at the last anniversary event,

200
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,590
you sought her out in anger to argue...

201
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:34,810
There are rumors like that...

202
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:38,000
What? Confession? Rejected?

203
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,840
Is that really why you went there?

204
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,910
- I said, it's not.
- So it is.

205
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:44,450
I said, it's not!

206
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:47,640
I didn't get rejected because I confessed. Actress Oh Ah Ra...

207
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,010
Geez.

208
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:51,320
Why am I explaining this to you?

209
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,530
Anyway, I didn't.

210
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:57,060
All right then. Then we'll say that you didn't.

211
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:00,820
I have a lot on my mind right now, so cancel my afternoon schedule.

212
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:03,510
Yes, everything has already been canceled.

213
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:05,480
Who would you meet in this situation?

214
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:09,070
Wow, you did a great job.

215
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:11,110
You flatter me.

216
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:18,420
Who the hell is that woman?

217
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:21,330
Nothing is working out because of that woman!

218
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:36,200
Yang Jin Mo!

219
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,490
Make the first-floor bakery move out immediately.

220
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:41,470
Shit.

221
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:47,000
[Yang Jin Mo, Attorney at Law]
You scared me, so e-everything is so confusing, damn it!

222
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:56,590
Shouldn't I tell Kwang Gi?

223
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:59,970
I surmise the moment you utter that you're a witness,

224
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:03,120
he's going to hover over you for at least three months.

225
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:08,540
Wait! Actually, Kwang Gi will probably grab you by the legs and confine you in a room.

226
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:11,020
But if the person I saw was actually the culprit,

227
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,890
I shouldn't just turn a blind eye, no?

228
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:17,330
And what if Chairman unjustly goes to prison because of me?

229
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:19,970
I don't think you need to worry about him.

230
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:23,040
Right? That's right.

231
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,700
Don Se Ra... To keep my mouth shut for my personal safety

232
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,840
or to devote myself to justice?

233
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,170
That is the question.

234
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:33,670
Your nosiness is throwing a fit.

235
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:38,510
Yes, this is Bang Bang organic and handmade bakery shop.

236
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:40,250
Boss!

237
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:43,280
Move out?

238
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,010
Why?

239
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:47,920
Double the penalty fee?

240
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,440
Wait, so why exactly?

241
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,270
Hello? H-Hello, B-Boss!

242
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:55,440
What kind of bullshit is this?

243
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,850
What's wrong?

244
00:16:56,850 --> 00:17:00,680
Well, the realtor asked me to move out immediately, saying he'll double the penalty fee.

245
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,120
What? No way.

246
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,990
Gosh, speaking of power tripping.

247
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,990
Oh my god! He's trippin'!

248
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:09,410
Should I move out before the shop even opens?

249
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:11,540
Wait! Who's the building owner?

250
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:15,610
I don't know. He told the second-floor lawyer to make sure I move out immediately!

251
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:17,330
The second-floor lawyer?

252
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:19,480
These people!

253
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,790
Na Hee, you wait right here.

254
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,320
I'll defend this shop.

255
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:26,260
- What in the...
- Wait, Se Ra! Se Ra!

256
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:28,970
Se Ra! Se Ra...

257
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:32,530
Hello, are you here for Bang Bang?

258
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:43,070
What is that woman d-doing here?

259
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,840
Is she here alone?

260
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,690
You don't see the first-floor bakery owner, right?

261
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:49,410
Can't you tell by the look on her face?

262
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:52,580
She's pissed off because we told them to move out.

263
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,970
I never called the realtor.

264
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:56,920
I did.

265
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:01,610
You told me to. Why did you have to go make trouble?

266
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:03,020
Excuse me.

267
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:05,000
- I'd like to discuss something with you.
- What will you do?

268
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,930
What will you do?

269
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:08,040
Do what?

270
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:11,600
- Excuse me.
- Isn't negotiating and mediating the lawyer's job?

271
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,390
You're the one who caused this! Where are you going?

272
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,850
Don't you think it'll be more helpful if I'm not here?

273
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,900
- Excuse me!
- Yes!

274
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:27,440
- I said, I have something to say!
- Yes, coming!

275
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,740
How may I help you?

276
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:38,040
I heard the building owner told us to move out.

277
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:41,210
Yes, that's right. Something came up.

278
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:45,750
I understand this is due to personal feelings, but this is undeniably an abuse of power.

279
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,400
Yes, that's right. He has an innate abuser of power,

280
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,210
but we're more than willing to accept any conditions you'd like to request.

281
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:54,240
What if we can't do as he wants?

282
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,540
If there's a price you have in mind—

283
00:18:56,540 --> 00:19:00,350
He must think money can solve anything, but...

284
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:02,940
There was never a time it couldn't solve things.

285
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,830
Get out. I'll compensate you twice the amount.

286
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:08,470
I'll think of it as opportunity cost.

287
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:12,700
That's way better than being annoyed by an eyesore.

288
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,510
Attorney Yang, take care of it.

289
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:16,640
Understood, Chairman.

290
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,040
That's enough money to buy a store and still have left over.

291
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,930
You must think me a fool.

292
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:23,640
Excuse me, forget it.

293
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,720
A row of Dispatch reporters will be waiting in front of the building,

294
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,380
so please look forward to that.

295
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,270
The article title will be...

296
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:33,130
"Chairman Eun Seon Woo's Secret Double Life."

297
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:36,770
How's that? I like it.

298
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:44,550
You continue to threaten me even after finding out who I am?

299
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:47,430
I can stand anything else, but I won't let you mess with my friend.

300
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:49,320
Who do you think is to blame for all this?

301
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,810
Things wouldn't be this complicated if you didn't call the police.

302
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:54,610
Then should I have just turned a blind eye to a thief?

303
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:58,000
- What? Th-Thief?
- Yes, thief.

304
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,890
When you ran away at the casino and climbed the wall,

305
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:02,740
- everything about you just screamed, "Thief."
- Calm down.

306
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:06,800
Is being a thief your side job and abuse of power your specialty?

307
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,760
Abuse of power?

308
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,400
Did I tell you to leave empty-handed? I told you I'd pay you!

309
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,000
Why? Is it not enough?

310
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,610
This shop was created with my friend's sweat and tears.

311
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,390
Double the penalty fee...

312
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:27,000
Should I just pretend I have no choice and move to expand the shop?

313
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:30,730
So you can't move out?

314
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,550
Are you implying you want more money?

315
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:36,740
There are things in the world that can't be solved with money.

316
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,190
Calm down, for now—

317
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:40,640
Are you trying to teach me because you think I throw money at a problem?

318
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,660
Aren't you?

319
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:44,200
- You're trying the kick us out with money!
- What—

320
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,740
For now, you two...

321
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:49,060
Please, this way. Please calm down.

322
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,450
Let's leave the shop alone.

323
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:52,280
We have to worry about Oh Ah Ra's case, too.

324
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:55,280
Could you handle the aftermath if your double life is revealed?

325
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,130
Calm down. Calm down.

326
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,280
Okay.

327
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:06,800
The shop will be left alone.

328
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,030
How about it? Okay?

329
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:11,520
Okay.

330
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,700
Okay. Chairman?

331
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,390
I'll...

332
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:18,410
think about it.

333
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:21,770
I recommend that the chairman moves.

334
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:33,400
I was just going to keep this to myself, but

335
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:38,230
it'd weigh on my conscience to just ignore this and pretend it never happened.

336
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:41,940
I'm pondering whether I should say this...

337
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:45,060
What is it? Just get to the point.

338
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,480
In front of Oh Ah Ra's house that night,

339
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,360
I happened to see someone.

340
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,510
Should I just keep quiet?

341
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,600
Who did you see?

342
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,940
How about it?

343
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:14,650
In order to clear your name,

344
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:17,360
should I help you out?

345
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:21,410
Wait. You saw from up there?

346
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:23,220
That person?

347
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:27,070
Hey, that looks pretty far.

348
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:29,010
My eyes are—

349
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:33,420
...a bit pretty.

350
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:37,140
No matter... does that make sense?

351
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,900
Are you an eagle? An ostrich?

352
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,910
Are you some human telescope?

353
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:45,390
- I saw him.
- It's literally an impossible distance for a human to see.

354
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:47,010
I absolutely saw him!

355
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:48,210
He went this way.

356
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:51,900
He went that way with a suitcase this big!

357
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,940
He went inward from here.

358
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:00,640
He was lugging a suitcase and carrying a bag.

359
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,730
Doesn't all this seem true?

360
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:05,080
Conmen usually say things that sound true.

I'm telling the truth!

362
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:15,070
Look at this. I knew it.

363
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:19,280
He went this way for sure.

364
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,340
It's a dead end.

365
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:25,530
There are no CCTVs nearby to prove your claim true.

366
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,200
It doesn't seem like there is anything here.

367
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,940
Wait.

368
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:44,570
Let's check that CCTV.

369
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:55,030
That person there.

370
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:00,710
You saw that, right? He was really there, right?

371

It's hard to tell with this.

Sure.

00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:14,860
Look at the driver's seat.

377
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:21,080
It's the same suitcase guy from earlier, right?

378
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,900
Look into the license plate.

379
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,920
Yes, I'm on it.

380

You're unexpectedly skilled despite how you look.

381
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:33,260
Is a lawyer your disguise?

382
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:37,670
I was born with quite a few skills just to be a lawyer.

383

Let's just say this is just the tip of the iceberg.

Then it's only a matter of time before we catch the culprit.

388
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:57,440
Who said he's the culprit?

389
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,130
Isn't he the culprit?

390
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:01,080
How can you be so sure?

391
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:04,360
How do you know if the person you saw is the same as this person?

If they are, what is his relationship with Oh Ah Ra?

Did he really commit the crime?

If he did, why? And what did he do with Oh Ah Ra?

395
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:12,870
There are many factors to confirm.

00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:16,960
Is that right?

You're quite the detective.

I'm sick of hearing that I'm like Sherlock Holmes.

Except that he's a bit more famous than I am,

401
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:29,100
his looks, fortune, and personality can't compare to mine.

402

Your self-love is also off the charts.

403

You have a talent for making a compliment sound like a diss.

404
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,650
Is it because you're the chairman of a large company?

You have excellent communication skills.

406
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,650
Anyway, I found the culprit and the CCTV,

Senior, you were going through the CCTVs all night?

415

Yeah. The CCTV at the crime scene is out of order,

416
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,870
and there's nothing unusual on the nearby CCTVs.

417

What about the National Forensic Service results?

418
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:29,050
Identification results show no one else's blood except for Oh Ah Ra's.

No body, either.

00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:03,800
The timing was pretty close.

489
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,600
Big Sis said she'd report him to the police,

490
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,050
and we didn't see him after that.

491
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:10,370
Approximately how long ago was that?

492
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:13,440
About two to three months, I think?

493
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,720
Big Sis even took depressants because of this bastard.

494
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,000
How long have you been working with Oh Ah Ra?

495
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,640
Have you ever seen Oh Ah Ra wear this necklace or get it as a gift?

496
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,820
I'm not sure. I haven't seen it before.

497
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,780
Try asking the CEO.

498
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:33,280
He's been working with Big Sis since she debuted, so he might know.

499
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,710
- CEO?
- Yes.

500
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:57,700
He came out lugging the suitcase and moved by car.

501
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:04,780
The car's owner is Jang Min Soo. Age 33.

502
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:07,860
23-1 Yongnam-si, Inju-dong.

503
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:12,260
[Personal Information of Vehicle Registrant]
Jang Min Soo has two records of physical assault and several reports of domestic violence.

504
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:15,360
Request location tracking of Jang Min Soo's phone,

505
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,270
- and secure his vehicle's route, too.
- Understood.

506
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:23,720
I'm Yang Jin Mo, Eunkang Group's Chairman Eun Seon Woo's lawyer.

507
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:26,330
- Yes.
- As you may well know,

508
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:29,460
our chairman experienced a difficult situation because of Oh Ah Ra.

509
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:32,440
So I've been ordered to perform a thorough investigation.

510
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:36,140
So I've hired a private investigator.

511
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:39,440
And this is his partner, Don Se-

512
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,860
In Sook. Don In Sook.

513
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:45,930
I'm Don In Sook. It's a pleasure to meet you.

514
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:47,760
In Sook?

515
00:31:55,910 --> 00:32:00,030
By any chance, do you know anything about this necklace?

516
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,170
No, I haven't seen this before.

517
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:09,980
But what does this necklace have to do with this incident?

518
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:12,290
That's what we're investigating.

519
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:15,220
From what I hear,

520
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:18,700
Oh Ah Ra was experiencing conflict with her agency recently.

521
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:21,260
Who the hell told you that?

522
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:27,020
Nothing like that ever happened.

523
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:29,340
Oh, is that so?

524
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:34,240
The atmosphere within the group is not so good due to this incident.

525
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:39,880
Regarding Oh Ah Ra, if it's revealed that you tried to hide something,

526
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:44,430
we could file a large claim for damages against this agency.

527
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:45,590
Compensation for damages?

528
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:52,360
If... If... you cooperate with us even now, CEO...

529
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:54,320
I'll be able to...

530
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:56,830
stop that from happening.

531
00:32:56,830 --> 00:33:00,650
So you must be honest with us.

532
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:13,880
Hey! Hey!

533
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,940
Come on, encourage him to talk.

534
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,660
If it's a necklace of this quality...

535
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:26,910
Well, to be honest,

536
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:29,230
I think Ah Ra had a serious relationship with someone.

537
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:30,390
She didn't exactly say so, but—

538
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:34,570
So it's highly likely that the man gave this necklace to her?

539
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:38,260
Who is that man?

540
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:41,650
I really don't know that.

541
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:44,320
All I know is that...

542
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:48,050
they frequently met at Alien Club in Gangnam.

543
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:51,910
You're talking about the inner circle of H Group's CEO Song.

544
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:53,750
You know about it?

545
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:58,000
Well, not too much.

546
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,180
Just that it's a gathering of elite class children.

547
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,660
- CEO Yoon.
- Yes.

548
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:10,750
I'd like to make an offer.

549
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:13,060
What kind of offer...

550
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:21,930
Senior! I found him!

551
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:24,460
What the... What?

552
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:28,510
Okay, we found him.

553
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:32,450
If you turn left at this intersection, it's the road outside Cheongan.

554
00:34:32,450 --> 00:34:34,180
Check the CCTVs on the outskirts.

555
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:35,730
Okay.

556
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,630
Thank you for sparing your precious time with us.

557
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:41,600
I'm the one who should be thanking you.

558
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:46,810
Oh, as you asked, I'll make arrangements to replace the spot with Actress Ra Min Ji.

559
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:52,480
And... please put in a good word

560
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:57,300
to Chairman Eun about replacing Oh Ah Ra with Actress Ra Min Ji

561
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:00,180
to be the company's model.

562
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:02,700
- I understand. I'll put in a good word.
- Thank you.

563
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,960
Take care.

564
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,820
Take care!

565
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:23,710
Wow! It's so nice to be at a club after all this time.

566
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:24,860
How about it?

567
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:27,430
Isn't your heart beating fast? Huh?

568
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:29,840
You think it would?

569
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:35,200
She's so pretty!

570
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,670
Hey, it's Ra Min Ji.

571
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:39,570
Wow, how stunning.

572
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:42,340
Just as I expected.

573
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:45,280
Huh? Hey, isn't that Se Ra?

574
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:14,270
Whoa! Se Ra is dressed up as my ideal type.

575
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:17,090
The favor I asked of Ra Min Ji is...

576
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:19,780
Wow, how disastrous.

577
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:21,950
It's an eye-catching fashion.

578
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:26,400
That's how the necklace will stand out.

579
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,970
If that's the intent, I guess she succeeded.

580
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:33,560
The necklace will stand out.

581
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:38,210
Did you wait long?

582
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:40,990
The clothes were a bit uncomfortable...

583
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:44,760
Yeah. The eye of the beholder is very uncomfortable, too.

584
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:48,170
Who's the one who forced me to do this when I said I didn't want to?

585
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,240
Stay still.

586
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:20,460
Be careful.

587
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:23,360
Okay.

588
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:26,000
- I'll take care of my—
- I'm talking about the necklace.

589
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,490
Be careful with it.

590
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:30,880
That necklace is one of a kind.

591
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:34,350
It's the most precious necklace you'll wear

592
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:36,950
for the first and last time in your life.

593
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,290
All right.

594
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:46,700
In Sook.

595
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,490
Shall we go?

596
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:05,940
What? You're going in, too?

597
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,310
Yeah.

598
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:09,960
You need to go back to the car.

599
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:19,610
What the heck?

600
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:25,770
Setup is complete on my end.

601
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:27,990
Turn on your hidden cameras.

602
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:35,000
Wait.

603
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,950
Seon Woo, isn't that Actress Kim Ji Eun?

604
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:41,260
Man, I should've been the one in there.

605
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:44,470
Stop getting excited and focus on the job.

606
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:58,760
But, hey, the man who recognizes the necklace Se Ra is wearing—

607
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,240
Will probably be Oh Ah Ra's man.

608
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,560
Then won't Se Ra be in danger?

609
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,070
That's why you should keep your eyes on the monitor and keep watch.

610
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:07,640
Yes, yes, yes.

611
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:39,240
You're like a fish in water.

612
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,500
Get yourself together.

613
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:44,040
I'm doing my best without you having to breathe down my neck.

614
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,680
- Come with me.
- Where?

615
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:58,130
Where are we going?

616
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:01,410
Just follow me.

617
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:30,370
Hey, Seon Woo, isn't that Tae Joon?

618
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,810
Come visit the set together.

619
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:09,370
- Really?
- Okay, I'll come by one of these days.

620
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:13,150
Hey. Bring some beer.

621
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:18,520
Oppa, we're in the middle of a conversation.

622
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:21,650
No!

623
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:23,790
I'm telling you to bring it.

624
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:25,990
You don't get what I mean?

625
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:29,490
Oppa.

626
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:33,120
I think you're really drunk. You should stop drinking now.

627
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:36,300
I am a bit drunk.

628
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:43,090
Hey.

629
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:44,620
Come here.

630
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:49,570
I said, come here.

631
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,900
Okay, I'll pour it for you.

632
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:02,960
You're looking down on me, aren't you?

633
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:06,670
What? When did I ever look down on you?

634
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:08,410
Your eyes give it away.

635
00:42:08,410 --> 00:42:12,130
How dare you try to mess with me? You cheap piece of shit. So annoying.

636
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:14,080
Okay, Oppa. I'm sorry.

637
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:18,140
Don't get mad, and let's have fun tonight.

638
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:19,460
You want to have fun?

639
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:21,020
Yes.

640
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:26,380
Then shall we have fun until your life is reset? Huh?

641
00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:28,490
Yes.

642
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:34,170
If you want to have some real fun, you need to see some blood to get excited.

643
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:35,280
How about it?

644
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,940
Do you want to end your acting career and rest forever? Huh?

645
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:40,530
Oppa, I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

646
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:42,850
Hey, Tae Joon's seeing red.

647
00:42:42,850 --> 00:42:45,240
Tell someone to lock the door.

648
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:48,600
Hey, look at her.

649
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:51,290
Hey. Hey!

650
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:54,570
Ridiculous.

651
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:56,510
What the?

652
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:06,900
You sagging lump of monkey testicles.

653
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:11,210
What the?
- Are you crazy?

654
00:43:11,210 --> 00:43:12,650
Hey, Se Ra is bomb!

655
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:15,910
Hey, Seon Woo. Se Ra is in trouble.

656
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:18,900
What kind of shitty manners is this?

657
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,680
Are you a thug?

658
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:24,130
If you've drunk enough damn alcohol, go home and fucking sleep!

659
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:26,720
What a fucking psychopath!

660
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,560
No, no, no.

661
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,040
Who is this?

662
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,390
I haven't seen her around.

663
00:43:33,390 --> 00:43:35,430
Oppa, don't worry about it. Just...

664
00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:39,110
You butt out of it. Who is this?

665
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:42,530
She's a rookie actress from our agency.

666
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:44,600
I see...

667
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:53,490
So this is your attempt at appealing to me?

668
00:43:53,490 --> 00:43:55,600
What's your name?

669
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,860
It's none of your business.

670
00:43:57,860 --> 00:44:00,430
Let's try to be decent human beings first.

671
00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:06,680
I said, what's your name?

672
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:18,270
Let go. Let go!

673
00:44:18,270 --> 00:44:21,460
If your intention was to leave a lasting impression,

674
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:24,290
okay. Success.

675
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:28,180
Then we should have some real fun. Unforgettably.

676
00:44:28,770 --> 00:44:29,930
Let go.

677
00:44:29,930 --> 00:44:32,080
Let go of me.

678
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:33,490
Hey, did you see her?

679
00:44:33,490 --> 00:44:36,370
She told me to let go. To let go.

680
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:39,570
Hey! Liven up the atmosphere!

681
00:44:39,570 --> 00:44:44,000
She's looking down on me because the atmosphere is shit, you assholes!

682
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:49,410
Move. You won't step aside?

683
00:44:59,070 --> 00:45:01,850
You're dead meat tonight.

684
00:45:14,810 --> 00:45:16,480
Why did it take you so long?

685
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,980
I waited for so long.

686
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,610
You can't go inside.

687
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,860
[Eunkang, Eun Seon Woo]

688
00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:44,720
Chairman.

689
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:48,600
Open! The door.

690
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:58,370
I came here because I heard newcomers to the

691
00:45:58,370 --> 00:46:01,950
political and business world are planning their future initiatives,

692
00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:05,410
but I only see pieces of raw meat rotting away.

693
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:08,090
Manager Kang,

694
00:46:08,090 --> 00:46:12,380
here you are diligently holding a meeting you don't even have at work.

695
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:15,880
You should wash up, Manager Kang.

696
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:17,420
You little piece of—

697
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:18,910
But instead...

698
00:46:18,910 --> 00:46:21,740
I'll escort this woman...

699
00:46:22,510 --> 00:46:24,850
who seems to need my help.

700
00:46:36,310 --> 00:46:38,310
Fuck!

701
00:46:47,170 --> 00:46:48,900
Are you advertising that you're new to this scene?

702
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:51,890
Or are you the type to cause trouble without a second thought?

703
00:46:51,890 --> 00:46:53,910
What are you doing instead of what you should be doing?

704
00:46:53,910 --> 00:46:55,180
Are you fearless?

705
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:56,950
Of course, I'm afraid.

706
00:46:56,950 --> 00:46:59,980
But that's not how you should treat someone.

707
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:02,500
They're not even human.

708
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:05,700
How can I just stand there and watch someone get hurt?

709
00:47:07,870 --> 00:47:10,290
Looking at how eloquent you are,

710
00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:12,650
I guess you're all right.

711
00:47:12,650 --> 00:47:14,510
You're not...

712
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,930
hurt, are you?

713
00:47:36,810 --> 00:47:38,790
You bastard.

714
00:47:39,550 --> 00:47:43,140
What? Bastard?

715
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,560
The man wearing a mask directly in front of you.

716
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:55,650
He's got a hidden camera.

717
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:59,630
He has a hidden camera?

718
00:47:59,630 --> 00:48:01,380
Hold on.

719
00:48:13,070 --> 00:48:15,190
I don't see anything.

720
00:48:15,190 --> 00:48:19,470
How can you tell if he's recording when he's that far away?

721
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,240
Is that important right now?

722
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,890
We need to hurry over and catch him!

723
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:29,260
Stay put. It's dangerous.

724
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:37,500
Hey.

725
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:41,110
I'm a little photogenic...

726
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:44,550
Should I check if I came out nicely?

727
00:48:44,550 --> 00:48:46,160
Shit!

728
00:48:53,450 --> 00:48:55,110
Stay put!

729
00:48:55,110 --> 00:48:56,680
D***.

730
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:01,830
This bastard was stalking Big Sis.

731
00:49:01,830 --> 00:49:03,730
Manager?

732
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:12,300
Wow, look at the equipment quality.

733
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:14,060
He's a repeat offender.

734
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:16,220
This isn't your first time, is it? Where's the rest?

735
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:18,850
Are you the one who took Oh Ah Ra's video, too?

736
00:49:18,850 --> 00:49:22,150
Well, that was because I was told to record her everyday life.

737
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:26,330
So you recorded her everyday life and eroticized it and switched it to deep fake!

738
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:28,320
Do you want a deep sentence?

739
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:31,160
I mean, I just did as I was told.

740
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:32,940
As you were told...

741
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:36,450
This is the same as a manager murdering his actress!

742
00:49:37,430 --> 00:49:39,240
To be honest,

743
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:43,870
Big Sis suddenly said she would retire once her contract ended.

744
00:49:43,870 --> 00:49:47,800
So you did as you were told? And that was CEO Yoon?

745
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:49,540
The cellphone.

746
00:50:04,230 --> 00:50:08,640
[Can you take some photos of Ra Min Ji at the club today? / Sure. Something happened behind the doors. Can't get in there, though. / Chairman Eun Seon Woo is at the club, too]

747
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:15,110
So he's been managing his actresses with their videos?

748
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:18,150
What did you just say?

749
00:50:18,150 --> 00:50:20,640
You crazy asshole.

750
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,210
Come here.

751
00:50:22,210 --> 00:50:24,230
- Come here!
- Oh, no!

752
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:27,790
Please calm down. He's bound to hell if you hit him with that.

753
00:50:28,690 --> 00:50:31,980
It's the end for you and CEO Yoon.

754
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:35,000
I'm going to go and kill that bastard right now.

755
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,780
I approve of that passion,

756
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:41,170
but it's probably best to find some evidence first. Right?

757
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:43,630
What evidence?

758
00:50:44,190 --> 00:50:48,650
CEO Yoon must've hid them away somewhere very tightly.

759
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:52,500
I really don't know where he hid them.

760
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:55,050
Oh, you don't? Okay.

761
00:50:57,740 --> 00:51:00,160
Let's see...

762
00:51:01,370 --> 00:51:02,960
I've been caught by Chairman Eun Seon Woo!

763
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:05,460
He's looking for the other videos, too.

764
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:12,440
Damn it! That stupid fool!

765
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:14,410
Fuck!

766
00:51:24,470 --> 00:51:26,840
He hid it pretty well.

767
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:31,790
I know. Thanks for finding the USB for us.

768
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:34,910
I think Chairman is very angry thanks to you.

769
00:51:34,910 --> 00:51:37,490
There goes your contract down the drain.

770
00:51:37,490 --> 00:51:39,050
Why don't you hand it over?

771
00:51:39,050 --> 00:51:41,010
Don't come. Don't come. Don't come.

772
00:51:41,010 --> 00:51:43,400
Don't come. Don't come. Don't come. Don't come.

773
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:44,770
Don't come. Don't come! Don't come!

774
00:51:44,770 --> 00:51:46,530
I'll break it. I'll break it!

775
00:51:46,530 --> 00:51:48,060
It doesn't matter even if you break it.

776
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:51,330
It's not that difficult to restore a USB.

777
00:51:51,330 --> 00:51:53,240
Yeah? Then I guess I should eat it.

778
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:55,060
Hey, hold him! Hold him!

779
00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:56,730
Spit it out. Spit it out!

780
00:51:56,730 --> 00:52:00,340
Spit it out! Hey! Hey, spit it out!

781
00:52:01,770 --> 00:52:03,110
You need to take it out, not feed it to him!

782
00:52:03,110 --> 00:52:05,440
He bit my finger!

783
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,660
Hey! Hey!

784
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:11,630
Hey! He's choking. Spit it out!

785
00:52:11,630 --> 00:52:13,240
Hey, man! Spit it out!

786
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:16,280
Spit it out, man! Spit it out!

787
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:18,940
Spit it out! Spit it out!

788
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:22,100
Move aside! Move! Move!

789
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:44,730
My younger siblings used to play like this all the time.

790
00:52:44,730 --> 00:52:48,240
I'm just saying. Here.

791
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,720
It's Jang Min Soo's car.

792
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:04,300
Yeah.

793
00:53:14,790 --> 00:53:17,110
He transported it in this car.

794
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:22,040
Request a public warrant for Jang Min Soo, and call the forensic team.

795
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:24,080
And an emergency search warrant for Jang Min Soo's house.

796
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:25,870
Yes, understood.

797
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:30,720
Detective Lee from Yongnam Station speaking.

798
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:33,060
Bloodstains have been found in the suspect's car.

799
00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:36,420
Please complete the blood analysis as soon as possible.

800
00:53:46,950 --> 00:53:49,060
What is this?

801
00:53:49,950 --> 00:53:53,860
Check Oh Ah Ra's video that we got from CEO Yoon.

802
00:53:56,690 --> 00:54:00,740
That bracelet was also worn by the man I saw.

803
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:08,700
It's a bracelet sponsored by the Children's Cancer Foundation.

804
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:11,520
It's a foundation Oh Ah Ra sponsored.

805
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:13,710
That's Jang Min Soo.

806
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:16,990
Zoom in.

807
00:54:18,340 --> 00:54:21,410
It's him. Jang Min Soo.

808
00:54:21,410 --> 00:54:24,000
The tree-shaped keychain on his bag.

809
00:54:25,450 --> 00:54:28,500
The person lugging the suitcase had one, too.

810
00:54:29,570 --> 00:54:31,080
Wait...

811
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:35,160
Y-You can see that?

812
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:38,260
I can't see it.

813
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:40,980

I sincerely thank you for earlier.

Nope. No need to be grateful.

Of course, I'm grateful.

I think you misunderstood something.

It was for my necklace, not you.

Pardon?

Okay.

They say the rich are stingier...

829

How much could it be? One million won? Ten million won?

830

I knew you were naive enough to fuss all over the place,

but you really have no sense of reality.

Are you unable to calculate amounts higher than that?

Then... are you saying... billions?

834
00:56:01,870 --> 00:56:04,920
The auction price was one billion won, but...

835

One b-billion...

836
00:56:08,570 --> 00:56:12,670
To me, it's something you can't put a price on.

It might seem a little flamboyant,

847
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:55,890
but it's worth half of your salary for a year.

848

Yes. What kind of job did you take today?

853
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:15,150
It was the most extreme job I had ever taken.

854
00:57:15,150 --> 00:57:18,340
You should stick to that job forever.

855
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:21,830

That's right. How incredible.
