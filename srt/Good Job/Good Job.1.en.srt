I heard it shot up in the ranks of top companies people want to work in.

Eunkang was already the first to reach 100 trillion in the industry's annual sales.

It's been a while since we became the dream company for the highest paying salaries.

I thought the topic of our meeting today wasn't about Eunkang Group's virtual model,

263

but about a future strategic presentation for the Web3 era.

Was it not?

265
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,580
Let me ask you a question.

266
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,730
A year ago,

267
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:01,710

268
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,060
do you even remember what it was?

269
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:06,670
Yes, the metaverse...

270
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:08,290

271
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:10,880
I see you don't remember.

272
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:14,080
Let me ask you another question.

273
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,790
After launching the metaverse platform, the rivaling H Group

274
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:20,720
is looking at one million new subcribers.

275
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,580
But besides a virtual model,

276
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:26,570
we haven't made any progress at all.

277
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:28,240
Why is that?

278
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,800
All of that is just an illusion that the Big Techs have created.

279
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,820
Illusion?

How amusing.

282
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:42,920
Then, Chief Kang, I guess you hold the same opinion about NFTs?

283
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:47,560
Aren't those also similar to crypto coins that don't have any solid structure?

284
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:50,910
Here you are saying things without solid structure...

I'll do my best today as well.

333
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,330
What do I do?

334
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:54,940
Today's going to be my lucky day!

335
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:00,750
Woman at Baccarat, table 3, seat 2.

336
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,050
Is her side dish chips?

337
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:04,970
There's a chip attached to the bottom of her whiskey glass.

338
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,350
Hold 'Em, table 4.

339
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:12,770
The two of them are exchanging signals with each other.

340
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:21,710
Black Jack, table one, the man to the left.

341
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:25,480
He probably thinks his hands are quicker than his eyes, but what do we do?

342
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,780
He's no match for me.

343
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:31,470
He even hid a queen of hearts up his sleeve.

344
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:35,930
Please excuse me, sir.

345
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:37,850
What's wrong?

346
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:41,530
Please allow me to escort you that way.

347
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:03,360
Wow...

348
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:11,700
Did I overdo it?

349
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,250
As expected, Se Ra!

350
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:26,600
Nothing escapes you, every time.

351
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:30,440
Se Ra, you really have no intentions to work here every day?

352
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,060
I would love to do that, too,

353
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:35,020
but I have unavoidable circumstances.

354
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:37,810
I'm grateful I even get to work once a week.

355
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:40,150
So what's your secret?

356
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:42,180
It's not like you're a shaman.

357
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:46,150
How are you able to find those problematic customers...

358
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:47,790
one by one?

359
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:49,170
Secret?

360
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:50,840
Well...

361
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,700
There isn't one.

362
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:56,380
Let's just say I was born with it.

363
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:59,070
You wouldn't belive me even if I told you.

364
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:00,010
Sure.

365
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:01,760
Then please excuse me.

366
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,580
Good day.

367
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:10,550
I have a secret that sets me apart from others.

368
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:15,600
I was born with the eyes of an eagle.

369
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,260
To be more precise,

370
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:22,110
a super vision that's multiple times better than an eagle.

371
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:23,930
Not only long distances,

372
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:28,370
but I can see clearly even close objects like the minuscule swaying

373
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:30,300
of the hairs on a face.

374
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,000
So what I'm saying is,

375
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:38,000
there's no one who can escape my eyes.

376
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:43,060
Wow...

377
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:45,590
But the only problem is that...

378
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:58,590
I shouldn't overdo it.

379
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:13,070
Damn it! I lost.

380
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:19,290
God damn it.

381
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:33,240
Choon Gil.

382
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:37,410
Wow, you're really Choon Gil.

383
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:41,810
Your thumb might be injured, but you still have a reputation to maintain.

384
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:44,160
Isn't stealing chips a bit low?

385
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,190
Rising star, Kang Choon Gil?

386
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:47,680
Who are you?

387
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,310
That's none of your business.

388
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:53,220
Do you want to come with me quietly, or do you need a beating?

389
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,830
Accomplices?

390
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:01,260
Team 3, Baccarat, table 1. Hurry.

391
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:07,950
You two must've been planning a sweet strategy. So sorry to interrupt.

392
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:11,190
Well... sorry...

393
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:13,920
I can't speak Korean.

394
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:21,410
I saw everything. Where do you think you're going?

395
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:27,440
I understand you're imagining an unbelievable scene,

396
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:30,610
but please stop.

397
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:34,420
Why would you lower your volume if you're so innocent?

398
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,720
Like I said, you're misunderstanding me.

399
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:40,620
Let's go and see if this situation is a misunderstanding or not.

400
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:45,280
Geez. God damn it.

401
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:48,250
Geez. Shit!

402
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:49,720
Geez...

403
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:53,000
[Kang Choon Gil, Wanted Suspect for Robbery and Injury]

404
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,900
Thief Kang Choon Gil?

405
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,550
[5 million won]

406
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:00,530
Jackpot!

407
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:08,310
Is this how Royal Casino treats its guests?

408
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:11,030
We don't treat our guests this way.

409
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:14,430
But you're thieves.

410
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:19,760
Thief? Oh my!

411
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,740
Which part of me?

412
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:24,790
Wait! Which part of me, too?

413
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:27,790
You can go ahead and shut up.

414
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:30,880
"Which part of me?"

415
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:36,020
Let's say the sunglasses are for fashion.

416
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:41,100
And let's say that awkward fake mustache is just a concept.

417
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,120
- And this!
- What are you doing?

418
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,670
Did you wear this for warmth, you thief?

419
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:46,370
What?

420
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:49,050
You have a better chance of conning a ghost than me.

421
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:51,990
The police are on their way, so stay put.

422
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:56,570
Geez!

423
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:03,040
Hold on. Wait, hold on.

424
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:06,370
The reward is 5 million won for each of them, so...

425
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:09,400
10 million won. Awsome!

426
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:15,290
I can't believe there'll be a day where I can spend the whole day counting money!

427
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:19,210
[Police]
Okay.

428
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:20,990
Don Se Ra!

429
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:21,860
Yes?

430
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:25,270
Go to the floor and tell the dealer at Blackjack, table 2 to come and see me.

431
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:26,290
Okay, right now?

432
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:28,430
Right now!

433
00:34:28,430 --> 00:34:30,470
Okay, understood.

434
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:40,230
I don't think you're the police...

435
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:42,940
Who are you?

436
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:44,770
That's none of your business.

437
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:48,700
You...

438
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:51,480
know this necklace, right?

439
00:34:51,910 --> 00:34:53,870
I don't know.

440
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:55,960
Oh, you don't know?

441
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,770
You saw that woman earlier, right?

442
00:34:57,770 --> 00:34:59,690
She knows that you're a wanted person.

443
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:02,660
That means she probably reported you to the police right away.

444
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:06,410
Then soon... the police will barge in here.

445
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,290
Choon Gil.

446
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:11,790
I'm not here to catch you.

447
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:17,180
If you just cooperate, I can release you immediately.

448
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:18,960
How?

449
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,450
Well, how I do it is my business.

450
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:24,070
What do you want to do?

451
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:27,870
So what? What is it that you want?

452
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:29,700
I just asked you.

453
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:32,160
Where did you steal this necklace?

454
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:35,130
S-Steal?

455
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:37,710
My hands are clean.

456
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:42,730
I asked you this nicely, and you still don't know?

457
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:46,250
This won't do. Have a good time with the police.

458
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:47,880
Wait!

459
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:52,240
Then... if I just tell you that,

460
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,430
you'll release me?

461
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:56,830
Sure.

462
00:35:58,390 --> 00:35:59,810
Then...

463
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:02,200
let's get out of here first.

464
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:10,130
Yeah, it's me.

465
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:11,850
Hey, you were so funny back there.

466
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:13,610
How did that woman know all that?

467
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:15,160
I made that disguise meticulously.

468
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,960
Oh, shut it. Plan B.

469
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,580
Plan B?

470
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:22,120
Okay.

471
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:27,300
What's the problem?

472
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:30,040
I really have no idea!

473
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,290
What did I do wrong?

474
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:33,860
Why—

475
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:34,950
Let go!

476
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:37,850
Are you okay?

477
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:39,620
Sir...

478
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:47,540
Geez.

479
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,450
Hey.

480
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:54,330
Professional safe thief, can't you open the door?

481
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:58,750
I-I... I'm skilled in turning things. Doors are a first...

482
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:03,010
Wow, are you able to make a living with that single skill?

483
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:05,520
Move aside. Move aside.

484
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:17,300
Let go! I said, let go!

485
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:19,030
Let go!

486
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:20,900
Please calm down, sir!

487
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,580
Let go of me!

488
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:24,290
- Nobody's there.
- Let go!

489
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:25,170
Whoa! Whoa! Let go!

490

Please calm down, sir. There's no one there.

Please send support.

Sir!

494
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:35,440
- I said, go away!
- Please calm down, sir.

495
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,310
Please go away.

496
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:48,850
Sir!

497
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:50,500
Sir.

498
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:53,410

Life is such a struggle.

665
00:48:57,170 --> 00:48:59,870
I'm here.

666
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:01,890
You said it was a casino part-time job.

667
00:49:01,890 --> 00:49:04,360
You look so exhausted.

668
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:08,160
Don't even talk about it. It was a colorful day.

669
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:12,000
I took a bite thinking it was jam-filled bread,

670
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,900
but it was just plain bread.

671
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:17,530
So you were in an irritating situation, huh?

672
00:49:17,530 --> 00:49:18,440
That's right.

673
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:20,870
I chased after them and finally had them right in front of my eyes,

674
00:49:20,870 --> 00:49:23,640
but that bastard jumped off the roof.

675
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:26,610
And? Did he die?

676
00:49:26,610 --> 00:49:29,700
No. He ran way.

677
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:33,900
I know you're working diligently because of Soo Ah,

678
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:37,130
but if something goes wrong, you'll croak!

679
00:49:37,130 --> 00:49:39,390
You'll die, girl!

680
00:49:39,390 --> 00:49:42,270
Okay, I'll be careful.

681
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:46,690
You were really busy prepping for the opening all alone, right?

682
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:49,800
I thought my hands were going to fall off, working so hard by myself.

683
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:51,780
Gosh, I'm sorry.

684
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:54,070
Of course, you're sorry!

685
00:49:54,070 --> 00:49:57,820
Instead, there's something you need to resolve for me.

686
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:07,900
So, Kang Choon Gil stole the necklace from actress Oh Ah Ra's house.

687
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:09,550
What is this?

688
00:50:10,630 --> 00:50:13,900
Should we call this a coincidence?

689
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:15,190
Hey, Seon Woo.

690
00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:18,450
You know how Oh Ah Ra is your company's exclusive model?

691
00:50:18,450 --> 00:50:23,030
But why was that necklace in Oh Ah Ra's house?

692
00:50:24,490 --> 00:50:27,630
We'll find out once we see for ourselves. Get ready.

693
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:30,370
Get what ready?

694
00:50:30,370 --> 00:50:31,970
We know where the necklace came from.

695
00:50:31,970 --> 00:50:33,470
We need to go see it for ourselves.

696
00:50:33,470 --> 00:50:34,970
Right now?

697
00:50:36,390 --> 00:50:38,500
Today was so exhausting.

698
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:40,700
The blood isn't flowing to my hands.

699
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:43,310
It's a necklace we found after 20 years.

700
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:45,580
Gosh, hey!

701
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:47,460
I know. I know,

702
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:49,210
but instead of sneaking in there,

703
00:50:49,210 --> 00:50:52,440
if you make an official appointment and meet with her as Chairman Eun Seon Woo,

704
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:54,500
it'd be good for you and good for me—

705
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:57,640
She was robbed of her necklace and didn't even report it.

706
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:59,640
If we make an appointment with her and ask,

707
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:03,900
you think she'll honestly say, "Yes, Chairman, to be honest..."?

708
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:07,540
It'll be quicker for me to sneak in and do my own investigation.

709
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:09,510
Hurry up and get ready!

710
00:51:25,410 --> 00:51:29,470
I saw everything. Where do you think you're going?

711
00:51:29,470 --> 00:51:30,950
Sir!

712
00:51:30,950 --> 00:51:33,620
Hey, how did that woman come here?

713
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:36,580
Were we followed by any chance?

714
00:51:41,270 --> 00:51:42,830
What are you going to do?

715
00:51:42,830 --> 00:51:44,540
Just stay put.

716
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:46,660
Sit down for now.

717
00:51:47,490 --> 00:51:49,470
Hurry.

718
00:51:49,470 --> 00:51:52,230
Okay, get ready.

719
00:51:54,070 --> 00:51:56,290
Hello, we're the newly opened

720
00:51:56,290 --> 00:52:00,250
organic, handmade bakery, Bang Bang patisserie, Sa Na Hee.

721
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:03,050
I brought over some cake that I baked.

722
00:52:03,050 --> 00:52:07,460
You must be busy, but could you come out for a moment and show your mug—

723
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:10,610
...show our faces and get acquainted?

724
00:52:10,610 --> 00:52:12,740
Please leave it there.

725
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:17,780
You must be busy, Mr. Lawyer.

726
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:21,050
But it'd still be great if we could meet each other as neighbors.

727
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:23,100
So, please don't be like that and briefly...

728
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:26,850
briefly come out and take this inside.

729
00:52:26,850 --> 00:52:28,950
He could've come out and gone back in by now.

730
00:52:28,950 --> 00:52:30,780
Exactly.

731
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:32,860
Why is that woman so clingy?

732
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:35,730
Over a shitty cake when I don't even like cakes.

733
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:40,830
I said to just leave it there!

734
00:52:41,930 --> 00:52:44,450
I see that you're very,

735
00:52:44,450 --> 00:52:48,820
very, extraordinarily busy, right now.

736
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:53,360
Fine. Then I'll just leave this shitty cake on the floor.

737
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:56,460
Please do whatever the fuck you like.

738
00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:58,410
Fuck?

739
00:52:58,410 --> 00:52:59,800
He seems extremely busy.

740
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:02,910
Let's just put it down and go to the third floor.

741
00:53:10,890 --> 00:53:13,400
So the first floor bakery is opening,

742
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:17,310
and the owner and that woman are friends?

743
00:53:17,310 --> 00:53:19,830
In the future, even if we happen to meet,

744
00:53:19,830 --> 00:53:21,620
do you think she'll recognize us?

745
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:26,230
You had a disguise and I just acted insane.

746
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:37,580
What is that?

747
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:39,940
Why is it so big?

748
00:53:41,730 --> 00:53:44,780
It's the second-floor lawyer's.

749
00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:50,010
Hey! Hey! What are you doing?

750
00:53:50,010 --> 00:53:52,390
Let's bring this to him.

751
00:53:52,390 --> 00:53:55,290
The lawyer said he's very busy.

752
00:53:55,290 --> 00:53:56,790
Hey, quit it.

753
00:53:56,790 --> 00:54:00,310
You wench. It won't do you any good to be rude between neighbors.

754
00:54:00,310 --> 00:54:02,110
Come on. You grab that side.

755
00:54:02,110 --> 00:54:03,650
Let's try this.

756
00:54:03,650 --> 00:54:05,600
- Fine.
- One, two, three!

757
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:08,000
Straighten your knees!

758
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,020
Hold on, hold on.

759
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:19,660
[Your valuable package has been delivered]

760
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:22,780
Packages are always exciting to receive.

761
00:54:28,110 --> 00:54:29,300
Hold on. What the?

762
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:32,410
Why are the first-floor women moving my package?

763
00:54:32,410 --> 00:54:33,880
Hey, hey, hey! Where are you going?

764
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:35,820
You can't go out right now.

765
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:39,830
What are they doing?

766
00:54:39,830 --> 00:54:43,180
Shit! My speaker.

767
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:45,270
- One, two, three!
- Lift.

768
00:54:45,270 --> 00:54:46,500
We're almost there.

769
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:47,950
- Okay.
- It's so heavy.

770
00:54:47,950 --> 00:54:49,790
One, two, three!

771
00:54:49,790 --> 00:54:51,540
Wait, hold on.

772
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:53,810
Hold on!

773
00:54:57,330 --> 00:54:59,290
- Wait, wait...
- Calm down. Calm down.

774
00:54:59,290 --> 00:55:01,820
- Hey. Hey, hey!
- No! No!

775
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:02,630
No!

776
00:55:02,630 --> 00:55:04,100
Hey! Hey, hey!

777
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:06,080
Yang Jin Mo!

778
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:12,500
Geez.

779
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:14,080
Wait.

780
00:55:19,530 --> 00:55:22,480
Na Hee! Hey! Are you okay?

781
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,320
I thought my knees were going to give out.

782
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:25,500
- Hey...
- I'm okay.

783
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:26,420
Hey.

784
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:30,000
You scared me. Really.

785
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,070
Oh, my!

786
00:55:32,070 --> 00:55:35,170
Do you know how much this is?

787
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:40,200
Darn it.

788
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:43,120
The second-floor lawyer?

789
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:45,010
Yes, I'm the second-floor lawyer.

790
00:55:45,010 --> 00:55:47,890
Why would you move someone else's package? Huh?

791
00:55:47,890 --> 00:55:49,990
Do you have kleptomania?

792
00:55:49,990 --> 00:55:54,160
In this situation, if you look at civil law, article 750,

793
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:55,730
you must compensate for the damage.

794
00:55:55,730 --> 00:55:58,130
What if it's broken? How are you going to pay me back?

795
00:55:58,130 --> 00:56:02,660
Never mind. How would you pay for this by selling pieces of bread?

796
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:06,120
Should I kill him?

797
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:08,050
Na Hee, hold yourself back.

798
00:56:08,050 --> 00:56:10,110
Lower and open your fist.

799
00:56:10,110 --> 00:56:13,410
If you know how precious someone else's belonging is,

800
00:56:13,410 --> 00:56:17,270
you should know better than to step on

801
00:56:17,270 --> 00:56:21,670
the precious cake that someone else made for you.

802
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:30,880
I need to make some eye contact.

803
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:38,600
I'll let this go. Go ahead.

804
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:40,680
What are you saying? We're having a conversation.

805
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:43,280
I said let me see your face!

806
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:44,560
Whoa, hey!

807
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:46,310
Why are you trying to...

808
00:56:46,310 --> 00:56:47,520
Don't touch me.

809
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:49,150
This is...

810
00:56:49,150 --> 00:56:51,680
Hey! Get in!

811
00:57:09,190 --> 00:57:11,090
What is this?

812
00:57:11,090 --> 00:57:14,820
I feel like I've met an unbelievable nutjob.

813
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:18,180
But that helmet he was wearing is

814
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:20,540
somewhat familiar.

815
00:57:21,430 --> 00:57:24,470
Didn't you say you were missing your helmet when you got your scooter back?

816
00:57:24,470 --> 00:57:26,180
Yeah.

817
00:57:28,190 --> 00:57:29,250
Stop!

818
00:57:29,250 --> 00:57:30,260
Stop! My scooter!

819
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:31,780
Hey!

820
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:33,930
Mine!

821
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,460
That crazy...

822
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:44,060
That's right! Those thieves from earlier!

823
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:46,470
Hey. Hey, catch them!

824
00:57:46,470 --> 00:57:48,220
Se Ra!

825
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,450
[44N0194]

826
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:39,140
You can run, but you can't hide from my eyes.

827
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:16,410
So this is where you were.

828
00:59:21,350 --> 00:59:22,450
What the?

829
00:59:22,450 --> 00:59:24,990
How come he climbs someone else's walls so naturally?

830
00:59:24,990 --> 00:59:27,440
Was he really a thief?

831
00:59:43,990 --> 00:59:46,580
I'm going to catch him for sure this time...

832
00:59:50,390 --> 00:59:52,550
This is the police, right?

833
01:00:15,180 --> 01:00:17,830
What's that?

834
01:00:20,410 --> 01:00:22,130
Blood?

835
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:33,560
Jin Mo.

836
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:35,200
It's a bloodbath in here.

837
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:36,780
What?

838
01:00:36,780 --> 01:00:40,200
Damn, I feel a bit creeped out.

839
01:00:41,570 --> 01:00:42,680
Get out of there.

840
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:45,870
You shouldn't be there. Get out right now.

841
01:00:53,610 --> 01:00:55,810
Don't move!

842
01:00:55,810 --> 01:00:57,530
Put your hands in the air.

843
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:24,510
[Good Job]

844
01:01:24,510 --> 01:01:27,630
Oh my god! The thief was the chairman?

845
01:01:27,630 --> 01:01:31,860
I saw someone that day in front of Oh Ah Ra's house.

846
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:34,820
Does this make sense? Are you a human telescope?

847
01:01:34,820 --> 01:01:37,470
To see if the person who saw this and that person are the same person,

848
01:01:37,470 --> 01:01:39,490
- could you tell if you meet him?
- Of course.

849
01:01:39,490 --> 01:01:42,160
I'd recognize him 100%, 1,000%.

850
01:01:43,010 --> 01:01:45,560
Who's this? I haven't seen her around.

851
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:47,540
I thought you only knew how to get yourself in trouble,

852
01:01:47,540 --> 01:01:49,420
but I guess you have a good grip on reality, too.

853
01:01:49,420 --> 01:01:52,390
Stay still. It's dangerous.
