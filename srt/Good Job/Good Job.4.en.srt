[Episode 4]
We're headed to the address that you saw in Park Eun Jeong's car, right?

7
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:41,750
What about the license plate?

8
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,460
1-5-G-8-5-9.

9
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,890
Oh Ah Ra isn't dead?

10
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:48,210
What are you saying?

11
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,920
Then the people we've been looking for all this time aren't murderers—

12
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,470
I never said we were looking for a murderer.

13
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:56,400
I'm not interested in that, either.

14
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:04,030
Hey, are you insane?

15
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:21,660
We finally meet.

16
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:23,630
Oh Ah Ra.

17
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:30,480
Where did you get this cell phone?

18
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,480
It was discarded over there.

19
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,480
Over here!

20
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,130
Look here!

21
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:42,820
- What the hell is that?
- Over here!

22
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:46,850
Save me!

23
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,640
Everyone thinks Oh Ah Ra is dead.

24
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,690
- Why would you go this far—
- Since Han Byeol is Oh Ah Ra's child.

25
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,880
What are you saying?

26
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,190
What do you mean Oh Ah Ra's child?

27
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,520
You're right.

28
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:23,840
Han Byeol is my child whom I thought had died seven years ago.

29
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:39,980
I realized I was pregnant after I broke up with that man.

30
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:44,120
[Jang Han Byeol]
The name Han Byeol was my child's taemyung
(Name given to the fetus before birth).

31
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:51,370
I was drawn to that name the moment I saw it.

32
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:55,030
Hi, Han Byeol.

33
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,410
Your heart doesn't hurt anymore?

34
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:08,370
Look at me.

35
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,170
How is our Han Byeol?

36
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,810
He's healthy as of now.

37
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:30,000
By any chance are you Nurse Park Eun Jeong?

38
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:34,850
Oh Ah Ra—

39
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:39,770
I thought the name Han Byeol was just a coincidence, but it wasn't.

40
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:45,700
Even when I heard the truth from Eun Jeong, I couldn't believe it.

41
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:50,370
As soon as the child was born,

42
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:55,180
he told me to lie that he was dead.

43
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,990
I'm sorry.

44
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:02,080
I have wronged you.

45
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,750
- She said he was sent to an orphanage.
- No way...

46
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:10,690
I reunited with Han Byeol who had been adopted by Jang Min Soo,

47
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:15,670
and even though I knew Han Byeol was my child, there was nothing I could do.

48
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:20,340
Even though the child had been abused.

49
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:25,710
Jang Min Soo, even though the one who abused Han Byeol is an evil bastard,

50
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:29,700
I also couldn't forgive the man who lied to me that Han Byeol was dead.

51
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,750
I wanted to get revenge.

52
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:37,960
As soon as I saw the necklace in his safe, I knew it was the Queen's Tears.

53
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:41,210
I thought it could become his weakness.

54
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:43,550
That's why I brought it with me.

55
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:48,550
At first, I thought it was he who took it back.

56
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:54,380
So I didn't even report it stolen, but that wasn't the case.

57
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,800
Cut! Okay!

58
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,600
- Good job!
- Good job.

59
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,350
Are you okay?

61
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:11,470
The necklace was stolen,

62
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,910
and I thought I couldn't live like this.

63
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:17,330
I lost the necklace,

64
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:20,570
and if he found out Han Byeol whom he believed to be dead was alive,

65
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,350
I was scared.

66
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:26,990
So, I decided to leave with Han Byeol.

67
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:40,860
And I thought I could use Jang Min Soo to deceive everyone and leave...

68
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:46,710
That necklace, I never knew you were looking for it, Chairman Eun.

69
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:51,780
If you recognized who I was, you must also know why I was looking for you.

70
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:58,390
Ah Ra, Han Byeol's condition isn't very good.

71
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:03,380
Please let us leave now.

72
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,610
I have to get on a plane with Han Byeol in three hours.

73
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:07,270
Every second matters!

74
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,620
If he doesn't get surgery right away—

75
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:12,050
I have no intentions of stopping you from leaving with Han Byeol, however...

76
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:16,350
tell me who you got that necklace from.

77
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:21,230
You can't leave if you don't tell me that.

78
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:23,550
That child, either.

79
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,510
And you'll become the national liar instead of being the national actress.

80
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:29,760
I don't care what other people say!

81
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,900
Right now, I'm...

82
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:37,160
afraid something might happen to Han Byeol because of me.

83
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,460
- That's what scares me more.
- So then tell me!

84
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,510
Then I'll let you go.

85
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:50,400
That necklace I know it's your mother's.

86
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:54,600
There's a surgery in one week.

87
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,180
If we leave and safely finish the surgery,

88
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:00,730
- I promise I'll tell you—
- I don't trust promises.

89
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:05,010
I really want to save our Han Byeol, please.

90
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:11,020
That's why you should tell me whose hands that necklace was in.

91
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,620
Han Byeol.

92
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:15,420
Why?

93
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:18,870
Why did you make this lady cry?

94
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:21,540
It's okay. I'm fine.

95
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,230
Han Byeoul, are you in any pain?

96
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:27,350
It only hurts a little.

97
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:35,570
That's enough.

98
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,650
Let them go.

99
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:41,180
She's saying Han Byeol's surgery is urgent.

100
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,750
It's none of your business.

101
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:48,100
I shouldn't have joined you if it was something like this.

102
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,700
I never told you to. You're being disruptive, even now.

103
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,780
Be quiet and stay out of it.

104
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:55,600
Just let Oh Ah Ra go!

105
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,460
She'll tell you for sure.

106
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,930
What do you know about someone you met for the first time today?

107
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:02,730
Do you know how long I've been searching for this?

108
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:06,540
After 20 years, the necklace taken by my mother's killer reappeared in the world.

109
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:10,630
I just barely found a clue, and you want me to give up here?

110
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,880
Hey, Yang Jin Mo!

111
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,400
Yang Jin Mo. Yang Jin Mo!

112
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,040
Come on, Yang Jin Mo!

113
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:28,580
You want me to trust her after seeing this?

114
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:35,510
His fever is too high.

115
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:40,380
If his fever doesn't subside, getting on the plane will be difficult.

116
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:46,920
But if we miss the plane right now, it'll be hard to schedule another surgery.

117
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:50,550
Am I doing the wrong thing?

118
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:52,330
No.

119
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,210
You're Han Byeol's mom.

120
00:08:57,210 --> 00:09:00,310
Let's not give up, okay?

121
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,790
How long was I like this?

122
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,730
About one hour.

123
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:17,140
Are you all better?

124
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,330
Yeah, I feel refreshed.

125
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:21,060
Check the GPS on your phone.

126
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,250
Sure, the GPS?

127
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:26,620
Geez, I'm dumbfounded at the way I got attacked.

128
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,070
Let's see.

129
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:34,150
The GPS location is about 45 km from here.

130
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:37,910
You put a location tracker on Oh Ah Ra's car?

131
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:46,180
How incredible of you, Chairman Eun.

132
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,950
An 8:00 p.m. flight...

133
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:50,770
If it's around here, they probably can't get on it yet.

134
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:52,840
We can catch them.

135
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,690
Han Byeol.

136
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:00,100
Ma'am...

137
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:00,970
Yeah.

138
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:04,870
When are we getting on the plane?

139
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:09,000
Let's get on it when you're feeling better.

140
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,400
I don't hurt anymore now.

141
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,960
Then let's go.

142
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:17,570
If we're lucky, we might get there before the plane takes off.

143
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:19,070
Come on.

144
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:20,960
There we go.

145
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,300
Han Byeol, even if it hurts, just hang on—

146
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:28,000
That'll be impossible unless there's a miracle.

147
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:31,220
Must you absolutely be like this?

148
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,920
That's why you need to remember.

149
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:37,970
If you don't keep your promise, I'll find you no matter where you are, just as I did right now.

150
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:41,480
They're already too late.

151
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:49,220
I'm being considerate of the child, not you, Oh Ah Ra.

152
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:52,790
If you take my helicopter, you'll arrive at the airport within an hour.

153
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:57,980
I don't think you have the time to be touched.

154
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:01,060
Aren't you going to go before I change my mind?

155
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,050
A private helicopter.

156
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:16,720
Thank you, Uncle.

157
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,030
- I'm not an uncle.

158
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:20,650
- Uncle, goodbye.

159
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:23,100
I said I'm not an uncle—

160
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,840
Look at him.

161
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,500
You're smiling?

162
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:52,640

But viewing that as the starting point,

195
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:22,330
there's no way those bloodstains could've gotten on the bed or the wall.

196
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:25,800
They weren't drip stains nor were they projected bloodstains.

197
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:30,320
That means... someone splattered them intentionally.

198

And the stains left on the table...

199

00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:08,550
we're applying NFT technology within the metaverse platform

325
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:11,670
to develop the digital economy as well as

326
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:15,380
games and SNS activities.

327
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,640
That sounds good.

328
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,110
However,

329
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:22,590
the technology and design going into the platform are important,

330
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:25,450
but this is about building a world.

331
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:29,010
Don't you think we need a guide for the meta-citizens?

332
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:32,960
O-Oh, m-meta-citizens...

333
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,790
Of course, we need one. But that's still under discussion...

334
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:38,710
It can't be under discussion.

335
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:42,600
You'll be pressed for time to meet the release date.

336
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,530
Do you think it'll be possible?

337
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,140
Manager Kim.

338
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:52,290
Was this report really written by you?

339
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:57,250
Well... that... was written with our team members...

340
00:25:57,250 --> 00:26:01,580
Please come with that team member next time.

341
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:03,810
Well...

342
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:07,220
- You can't do this—
- I said, get out of the way!

343
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:18,170
I don't have a meeting scheduled with you today.

344
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:20,600
I'm the one in charge of this project.

345
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,620
You're abusing your authority to disregard the organization's system!

346
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:27,280
And your attitude right now is mutiny?

347
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:30,280
Manager Kim, do you have anything else to say?

348
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,670
No, Sir. Then...

349
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:42,120
Right.

350
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:45,540
That entertaining friend I met at the club last time...

351
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:50,450
Is she someone you know?

352
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:52,580
It seemed like you two knew each other.

353
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:54,630
Don't you?

354
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:56,870
If it's as you say...

355
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:59,480
I don't have any interest in women, right?

356
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:05,210
So... what exactly are you asking?

357
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,270
I had fun that night.

358
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:14,020
I wondered what kind of person was able to put that expression on your face.

359
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:18,110
If you ever meet her, please let her know... that I'd like to meet her again.

360
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:20,700
I have things I want to ask her, too.

361
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,920
If you're that curious,

362
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,340
why don't you look for her yourself.

363
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:41,270
Don't forget who you're working for just because you visit the Chairman's Office.

364
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:45,010
There was nothing for you to worry about.

365
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,980
Would you be here right now...

366
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:52,170
if you made me worry?

367
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:56,470
You'd better watch what you say until the end.

368
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,740
I think there's something there.

369
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:13,730
Yes, it doesn't seem like they're simply keeping you in check...

370
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:16,110
but they have rather suspicious...

371
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:20,800
No, what I mean is, are you wearing a back support?

372
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,740
I would never.

373
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:25,660
I saw you being pushed around by Chief Manager Kang earlier.

374
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:28,670
Don't you think you should build some back strength?

375
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:32,990
No. There's no problem at all with my back.

376
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,850
- It seems like you do.
- More importantly,

377
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:39,470
did you visit the hospital a few days back?

378
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,010
Chairman?

379
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:43,920
- Chairman. Chairman?
- Yes, hello?

380
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,540
Yes, yes. I understand.

381
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:48,490
Excuse me!

382
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:50,190
Me?

383
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:52,490
Not you?

384
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:56,890
By any chance, are you the type to rely on back support during work

385
00:28:56,890 --> 00:28:59,820
because you slightly tripped through the door a few days back?

386
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:02,270
No way, right?

387
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:03,880
I would never.

388
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:09,480
Anyhow, I think your scandal has died down a bit.

389
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:12,870
I'll set up your delayed external schedule going forward.

390
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:18,300
No. I'll focus on the internal company schedule for now.

391
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:21,490
It's not for now. You'll—

392
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,930
You'll have to focus on it going forward.

393
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:28,810
And Director Hong, you should focus

394
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:31,690
on treating your back going forward.

395
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:34,100
Remember to wear your back support.

396
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,520
Gosh.

397
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,920
I told them to give me an extra large.

You must be headed to work.

Your face is back to normal.

401
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:50,490
Yes, thanks to you.

Next time, no matter how frustrated you get,

403
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:55,480
don't just gulf down any kind of milk.

404
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,700
I'm usually very good at managing my frustration,

405
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,350
but you had such a big misunderstanding that day,

406
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:02,090
- so I lost my mind—
- H-Hold on. Hold on.

There's no chance of your face blowing up because of milk.

And it's good for your body and your taste buds, so try it out.

All of a sudden? Why?

Just gratefully accept it since I'm giving it to you.

Congratulations.

As if no one could tell you were a detective.

You're even romantic in detail.

Enough with the embarrassing flattery.

What business brings you...

431
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:08,080
Not much business.

Yeah, a bit.

- Is Chairman doing well?
- Yes, of course.

We are partners.

460
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:27,030
"Partners" doesn't really sound right.

461
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:29,950
"Colleagues" sounds like a better term. "Colleagues."

462

I like "partners" better.

Brother, I had a dream.

486
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:50,520
It's a scene I've seen somewhere,

487
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,710
but I have no memory of it...

488
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:53,720
A dream?

489
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:57,270
You know how I almost died because of my supervision?

490
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:59,890
Maybe it's a memory from that time...

491
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:04,100
Brother, how come you never tell me about that time?

492
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:06,330
You remember the whole situation.

493
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:10,390
It's because I don't know all the details, either.

494
00:34:10,390 --> 00:34:14,470
You know that lady who occasionally visited the orphanage?

495
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:16,620
The pretty lady...

496
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:18,260
Do you remember her?

497
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:23,690
There was a bunch of people who came to the orphanage to take photos like some event.

498
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:26,650
You're really cold in situations like this.

499
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:29,400
There were also people who were warm and friendly.

500
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,020
Let's go look at rooms for Soo Ah together.

501
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,330
I'll make some time.

502
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:33,640
Don't you worry.

503
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:36,320
The two of us are enough to look for a room for Soo Ah.

504
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,900
I'm going.

505
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:50,430
Is there something going on with Se Ra?

506
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:55,570
Gosh, it does seem like it,

507
00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:57,690
but she won't tell me.

508
00:34:57,690 --> 00:35:00,650
It's because you worry way too much.

509
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:04,930
Why do you think Se Ra went through the trouble of hanging this worry doll?

510
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,420
Who do you think it is?

511
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:15,210
The person who was aware of the dead body buried in Jang Min Soo's house.

512
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:18,340
Do you think Jang Min Soo had an accomplice?

513
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:22,060
Rather than an accomplice,

514
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:26,060
I have the feeling we're not the only ones chasing this case.

[Attorney Yang Jin Mo]
What was that?

516
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:31,820
I can't read her intentions.

517
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:34,910
How can someone change 180° like that?

518
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:37,510
"Older Brother!"

00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:40,410
Older Brother, my ass.

520

Yes, I'm Attorney Yang Jin Mo.

What brings you...

526
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:16,220
I heard from Sister Se Ra,

527
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:19,210
that you're a skilled lawyer...

528
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:24,930
You heard right. Please have a seat.

529
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:27,240
Here.

530
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:30,190
Se Ra said that I'm skilled?

531
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,890
Yes.

532
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,970
My goodness.

533
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:38,860
You must be Se Ra's younger friend.

534
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:41,690
- Yes.
- So what brings you—

535
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:43,810
Would you like some bread?

536
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:46,050
- I'm fine.
- You're fine?

537
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:49,920
May I ask what brings you here?

538
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:59,320
Did he act that way to Se Ra that night after recognizing the necklace?

539
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,270
Kang Tae Joon...

540
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:06,450
What is it that you know?

541
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:09,560
Thank you. Please enjoy and come again!

542
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:14,140
Isn't that Soo Ah?

543
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,340
What business does she have with that lawyer?

544
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:28,370
You're here?

545
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:31,260
Why was a student here?

546
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:35,970
I guess you're taking young clients now since you have nothing to do, Attorney Yang.

547
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:37,440
What do you mean, young client?

548
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,540
Paragraph 1 of Article 1 of the Attorney-at-Law Act,

549
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:43,290
"The duty of a lawyer is to defend basic human rights and to realize social justice."

550
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:46,490
There's no age preference in human rights. And...

551
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:51,310
she's Se Ra's younger friend.

552
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:53,140
Don Se Ra's younger friend?

553
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:54,600
Why would she come find you?

554
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,870
Why do you think so?

555
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:00,870
Try making a deduction with your profiling skills.

556
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:06,660
I'm not that curious after seeing your expression.

557
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:07,740
I don't want to tell you, either.

558
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:10,310
But your expression says otherwise, so go ahead.

559
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:12,100
I'll listen.

560
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:14,380
I'm only telling you because you asked me.

561
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:19,650
Apparently, Se Ra strongly recommended me saying I'm a very skilled lawyer.

562
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:21,740
I see...

563
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:24,910
She probably said you're a pro bono lawyer.

564
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:27,830
Pro bono lawyer, come follow me.

565
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:37,060
Gosh, I should probably defend Se Ra's friend pro bono, right?

566
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:39,140
Why? You should charge her.

567
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:42,180
Like how you charge me every single time as my lawyer.

568
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:44,750
Hey, you must really have zero worries.

569
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:48,190
Even though Se Ra knows all of your secrets.

570
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:51,890
Well, I know what Don Se Ra wants.

571
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:55,570
- What?
- Her nosiness didn't seem false.

572
00:38:56,330 --> 00:38:59,710
- So you trust her?
- So what I'm saying...

573
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:03,210
is that I must find out every detail I can about Kang Tae Joon.

574
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:06,570
Leave it to me.

575
00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:08,780
I need someone to keep an eye on him within the company.

576
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,910
There's someone I have in mind.

577
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,990
Hey, no way!

578
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:19,190
How do you know who it is that you're saying no?

579
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:22,000
She went through shit at the club that night!

580
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,040
You think Kang Tae Joon won't know?

581
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,780
It seems he even hired someone to look for her.

582
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:31,770
You seem to know exactly what's going on. Hey.

583
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:35,250
Does the Se Ra then and the Se Ra now look the same to you?

584
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:38,490
She'll be hidden in plain sight.

585
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:42,860
Kang Tae Joon's secretaries never last more than a month.

586
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:45,330
And Se Ra even has supervision.

587
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:47,140
What is our goal?

588
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:49,670
Surveillance. It's to surveil Kang Tae Joon.

589
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:51,910
Supervision. Se Ra.

590
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:53,380
Surveillance.

591
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:56,130
Doesn't it flow so naturally?

592
00:39:56,130 --> 00:40:00,800
Well, I guess she's better than nothing.

593
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:03,170
That's exactly right.

594

- Forget it. I'll do it.

Well, no need... to emphasize "absolutely."

00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:41,470
Good morning!

649
00:42:42,850 --> 00:42:46,940
Good... mor... ning!

650
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:49,940
What about Se Ra?

651
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:52,310
She's absent for her first day of work.

652
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:53,800
Are you sure she even agreed to come in?

653
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:56,130
- Should I give her a call?
- Don't!

654
00:42:56,130 --> 00:42:57,780
I'm going to.

655
00:43:06,370 --> 00:43:08,900
H-Hello?

656
00:43:11,470 --> 00:43:13,390
- She hung up.
- Without a word?

657
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:14,590
Yeah!

658
00:43:14,590 --> 00:43:15,930
Oh! That's Se Ra.

659
00:43:15,930 --> 00:43:18,930
She makes a quick turn on her way to work.

660
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:22,020
Why's that? For what reason?

661
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:27,690
Hey!

662
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:30,110
Why aren't you following me?

663
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:32,090
What? Why? What?

664
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:34,460
There's a dispute between the employer and the employee,

665
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:37,340
so there should be a mediator, Attorney Yang.

666
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:39,000
Hurry up and follow me.

667
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,140
Se Ra left for work.

668
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:45,080
Well, she didn't come, so that's why we're here.

669
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:49,030
Even if she's on the verge of collapsing with a high fever,

670
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:51,240
she's the type of person who still goes to work.

671
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:54,620
If she didn't go to work, there must be a good reason.

672
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:56,270
What reason?

673
00:43:56,270 --> 00:43:58,970
What's so special about working part-time at an investigation agency?

674
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:01,920
If there's a better-paying job, then she can ditch it.

675
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,470
Ditch?

676
00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:04,640
When I'm the employer?

677
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:07,260
It's not something she can ditch as she pleases.

678
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:11,000
It looks like you need our Se Ra badly.

679
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,720
Then just wait a little longer.

680
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,000
Do you know how much money you'd get if you convert my time into money?

681
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,290
It can't even be converted into money...

682
00:44:16,290 --> 00:44:18,000
Yang Jin Mo.

683
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:21,280
Do I look like someone who has time to waste?

684
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,460
It hasn't even been a day.

685
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:25,350
You scurry out here after waiting just a measly hour.

686
00:44:25,350 --> 00:44:27,920
I guess you two are different than how patient you look.

687
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:31,070
I don't know about him, but I've been waiting patiently.

688
00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:33,700
However, Se Ra hung up on me right after answering,

689
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:36,140
and she couldn't be reached afterward.

690
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:37,740
Such terrible manners.

691
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:39,280
Manners?

692
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,370
She usually answers calls without fail.

[If it's Don Se Ra, Awesome]

694
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:49,340
Does something like this happen often?

695
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:51,160
You know how she is from working with her.

696
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:54,430
She's such a diligent girl. She would never.

697
00:44:55,870 --> 00:44:58,790
Nonetheless,

698
00:44:58,790 --> 00:45:00,590
if she skipped out on her job,

699
00:45:00,590 --> 00:45:03,030
it must be related to Soo Ah.

700
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:05,790
Are you talking about student Han Soo Ah?

701
00:45:05,790 --> 00:45:07,340
Yes.

702
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:12,060
I've got a hunch on what's going on.

703
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:14,680
Is there anything that comes to mind?

704
00:45:15,870 --> 00:45:19,950
We have confidentiality obligations regarding our clients.

705
00:45:36,190 --> 00:45:40,520
Why must I need to tag along for your client's affairs?

706
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:42,400
I analyze the client's situation and

707
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:45,590
you bring our employee to the scene.

708
00:45:45,590 --> 00:45:47,490
Gosh.

709
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:51,230
Everyone must think I've got time to waste.

710
00:45:51,230 --> 00:45:53,390
Do you think I've got time to waste?

711
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:58,340
You're saying our Se Ra asked you a favor?

712
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:00,560
Yes, she's our employee

713
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:04,180
and she asked us to look into this, saying she's worried.

714
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:06,470
Se Ra takes good care of her younger siblings here.

715
00:46:06,470 --> 00:46:08,600
Gwang Ki is the same.

716
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:12,420

Soo Ah is soon to be discharged, but

719
00:46:19,770 --> 00:46:23,390
we suddenly lost touch after she left with her bankbook.

720
00:46:23,390 --> 00:46:25,100
Her bankbook?

721
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:29,400
Are you talking about the resettlement fund for protection terminated children?

722
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,260
Yes.

723
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:34,730
That's why I urgently called Se Ra.

724
00:46:36,050 --> 00:46:39,070
Could we take a look at Soo Ah's room?

725
00:46:39,070 --> 00:46:41,000
Sure, go ahead.

This Yeon Joo girl is the problem.

Are you getting a feeling?

734
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:33,510
A girl who works this many jobs wouldn't

be going to the Youth Rest Center.

00:52:48,850 --> 00:52:51,320
Delivery!

814
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:53,300
Who the hell—

815
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:56,230
- It's not you?
- Nope, not me.

816
00:52:56,230 --> 00:52:58,440
We didn't order delivery!

817
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:01,970
This is 8-24, is it not?

818
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:03,770
Shit, who the hell...

819
00:53:03,770 --> 00:53:05,750
Hey, follow me.

820
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:09,490
Don't start until I get back.

821
00:53:13,730 --> 00:53:15,840
Why are you so loud?

822
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:19,090
Hey, who is it? Hurry up and check.

823
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:30,060
I said I didn't order.

824
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:32,140
Then, who the hell is that guy?

825
00:53:34,610 --> 00:53:36,710
Hey, no one ordered anything.

826
00:53:36,710 --> 00:53:38,250
Just leave it there and go.

827
00:53:38,250 --> 00:53:39,870
I was told to get the money here.

828
00:53:39,870 --> 00:53:42,260
What? Come and get paid?

829
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:44,580
We'll pay you next time, just go.

830
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:47,040
I can't give it to you on credit.

831
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:49,250
Let me see. What even is this?

832
00:53:51,650 --> 00:53:52,770
What is all this?

833
00:53:52,770 --> 00:53:56,430
I didn't have time so that's all I was able to prepare.

834
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:07,470
Soo Ah...

835
00:54:07,470 --> 00:54:09,120
Soo Ah...

836
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:25,290
Hey.

837
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:36,240
What the?

838
00:54:39,310 --> 00:54:41,600
Soo Ah!

839
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:43,560
Sis!

840
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:45,740
Are you hurt anywhere?

841
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:48,100
How did you come here?

842
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:58,490
Sis, Yeon Joo. Yeon Joo.

843
00:54:58,490 --> 00:55:00,060
Okay.

844
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:03,050
Yeon Joo.

845
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:19,690
Yeon Joo, get yourself together.

846
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:23,170
Don't fucking move!

847
00:55:23,170 --> 00:55:24,910
Just try moving, any of you.

848
00:55:24,910 --> 00:55:28,410
Her head will roll right off.

849
00:55:30,740 --> 00:55:31,660
Soo Ah...

850
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:33,300
What are you doing, you idiots?

851
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:35,070
No...

852
00:55:38,970 --> 00:55:40,900
Plan B.

853
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:48,920
The time has come.

854
00:55:51,190 --> 00:55:53,840
Is it my turn now?

855
00:55:59,450 --> 00:56:03,250
Thanks to you, I'm getting tied up every other day.

856
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,170
Soo Ah, don't worry. It's okay.

857
00:56:08,170 --> 00:56:10,690
Sis, what do we do...

858
00:56:10,690 --> 00:56:13,110
You said she was no trouble since she was an orphan.

859
00:56:13,110 --> 00:56:15,170
What are we going to do about her dregs?

860
00:56:15,170 --> 00:56:17,940
I also didn't know...

861
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:21,500
Before it gets more twisted, untie this twisted rope and

862
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:24,320
just leave quietly, won't you?

863
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:28,410
This fucker has been talking trash like this when he's the one that's tied up...

864
00:56:28,410 --> 00:56:31,220
That's going to be hard since I have money to collect from her.

865
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:34,020
Or will you guys give me the money? I'm a pacifist.

866
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:37,710
She needs to pay for what she bought. Am I asking for too much?

867
00:56:37,710 --> 00:56:39,160
Are you talking about the money you get...

868
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:40,920
by abducting kids and mugging them?

869
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:43,660
- Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
- "Are you talking about the money..."

870
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:45,350
I'm scared to death, shit.

871
00:56:45,350 --> 00:56:46,990
That's none of my concern.

872
00:56:46,990 --> 00:56:48,790
I just need to get paid, you morons.

873
00:56:48,790 --> 00:56:50,970
Damn, these petty thieves.

874
00:56:50,970 --> 00:56:54,070
If you're going to scam someone, you should go big or go home.

875
00:56:54,070 --> 00:56:56,920
How much do you even make, selling drugs to kids?

876
00:57:02,190 --> 00:57:03,450
Is this funny?

877
00:57:03,450 --> 00:57:05,150
Let's see how long you can keep that smile.

878
00:57:05,150 --> 00:57:07,920
You're surrounded!

879
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:11,460
You're surrounded!

880
00:57:12,910 --> 00:57:14,110
Did you call the cops?

881
00:57:14,110 --> 00:57:16,050
You think I'd come alone when

882
00:57:16,050 --> 00:57:18,220
I'm walking into a drug den?

883
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:31,570
H-Hey, clean up!

884
00:57:31,570 --> 00:57:33,730
Move, move.

885
00:57:33,730 --> 00:57:35,140

00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:38,070
Soo Ah! Han Soo Ah!

887
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:43,510
Don't move!

888
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:49,990
What are you doing? Untie us!

889
00:57:53,180 --> 00:57:55,000
Where are they?

890
00:57:55,730 --> 00:57:57,660
Hurry! Hurry.

00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,760
Wait, w-wait.

01:01:07,410 --> 01:01:09,690
When you use supervision, do you faint and whatnot?

924
01:01:09,690 --> 01:01:12,500
If you use your supervision like today, you're...

fired.
