wouldn't it be a waste for a talented person like me to be just a lawyer?

45
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:40,340
So I was developing a new app for the latter half of the year,

If you absolutely must look into him,

00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,080
This is a murder case.

327
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,220
The culprit that killed her...

328
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,590
I want to find him, too.

329
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:54,890
What's the reason you're going this far?

330
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:55,950
Angel Lady?

331
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:57,930
She's just someone you met briefly 20 years ago.

332
00:21:57,930 --> 00:22:02,170
You know as well as I do, how special Angel Lady was to me.

333
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:03,790
I can't tell...

334
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:06,150
if Angel Lady was special to you...

335
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:08,930
or if Chairman Eun Seon Woo is special to you.

336
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:10,560
You and that man

337
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,930
are from totally different worlds.

338
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:16,000
I also have an ID from the Republic of Korea.

339
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,260
Stop playing around with Se Ra.

340
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:20,340
You should just stick to your role as well,

341
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,790
Don Se Ra's brother.

342
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:25,380
And stop crossing the line.

343
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,000
Let's go.

344
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,420
Don't worry too much

345
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,360
about what my brother said.

346
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,040
I think he's misunderstanding something...

347
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,990
It's not a misunderstanding.

348
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:50,440
Your brother at least has some intuition,

349
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,280
but you don't even have any tact?

350
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:55,120
- What?
- What's the use of having supervision?

351
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,690
When you can't see anything about me.

352
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:00,090
Or do you choose not to?

353
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:03,960
Well you told me never to use supervision on you!

354
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,030
Oh, is that it?

355
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:09,410
Wow, thanks for being so considerate of my words.

356
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:13,430
The high school Detective Han attended,

357
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:14,740
it's Dodam High School. Right?

358
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,120
My brother?

359
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,660
Yeah, it's Dodam High.

360
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,680
Yang Jin Mo contacted me.

361
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:23,150
He said Detective Han and Kim Nam Gyu attended the same school.

362
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:25,390
Then we should hurry to the school.

363
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:28,740
Don't you think we'll find something there?

364
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:38,970
You said you're going to see Se Ra...

365
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:41,450
Did you meet a criminal instead?

366
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:45,000
What crime did this lunchbox commit?

367
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,790
I don't think this will work.

368
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:48,670
Leaving things as is...

369
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:50,290
doesn't feel right.

370
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:51,780
What's going on?

371
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:53,740
Did you fight with Se Ra?

372
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:57,870
Hey, you— Never mind.

373
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:59,510
You should go home!

374
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:01,270
Go and be a good daughter.

375
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:04,340
Not showing my face is being a good daughter.

376
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:07,720
Seeing my face will raise my parents' blood pressure.

377
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,910
This is being a good daughter.

378
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:14,780
Why did you fight with Se Ra?

379
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:17,300
Because of something.

380
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:21,290
We need to stop those two before Se Ra gets hurt.

381
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:26,520
Anyhow, Kim Nam Gyu...

382
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,870
I have heard that name before.

383
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,980
Of course, he's not here.

384
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:35,420
There's no teacher who stays for over 20 years at one school.

385
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:36,510
I see.

386
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:38,930
There's really not a single person?

387
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,950
The principal used to work here back then

388
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:47,320
and came back here recently as he got apoointed.

389
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:53,210
Thank you for choosing our school,

390
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:54,840
but I am a bit confused.

391
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,360
Furthermore, for you to personally visit...

392
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,590
Both my employee and I

393
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:02,630
have deep connections with the students here.

394
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:06,070
We're also sponsoring kids from Dodam Orphanage that's nearby,

395
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:08,980
and those kids will one day attend Dodam High School, too.

396
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:12,410
I hope we'll be of some help to a variety of kids.

397
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:14,610
You're speaking of Love Orphanage, right?

398
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:15,750
Yes, that's right.

399
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:19,130
Its previous name was Love Orphanage and it's now called Dodam Orphanage.

400
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:20,170
I know it well.

401
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:23,360
Back when I was assigned students as their homeroom teacher,

402
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,720
I had a couple of them each year.

403
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,910
Then do you happen to

404
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:32,070
remember a student named Kim Nam Gyu?

405
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:34,270
He's in his late thirties now,

406
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:38,130
but he's said to have attended this school during his third year.

407
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:46,560
Oh, Kim Nam Gyu!

408
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,350
I remember him.

409
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:51,350
He was a very smart student, placing first as soon as

410
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:53,220
he transferred here in the first semester.

411
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,770
He really liked my subject, too.

412
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:58,170
All the other students were afraid of dissecting frogs,

413
00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:00,330
but he would calmly and efficiently proceed.

414
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:03,060
I thought he'd go to medical school.

415
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:05,520
But he didn't?

416
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:09,120
Do you know what he's doing nowadays?

417
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,980
I don't keep tabs,

418
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,980
but about 10 years ago?

419
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,990
I went to a seminar in Seoul

420
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:18,540
and ran into him at the hotel.

421
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:20,280
He became so different from back then

422
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,680
that I almost didn't recognize him.

423
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,500
He had even changed his name, so...

424
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,830
He changed his name?

425
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:41,730
He does seem to resemble someone...

426
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:46,580
Wait.

427
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:51,330
This man...

428
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:55,490
He gave me his business card at the time,

429
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:57,740
and he had changed his name.

430
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:03,150
Hey, Seon Woo.

431
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:05,820
I ran the Face Prediction Program,

432
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,710
but someone unexpected came up.

433
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:08,880
That's right.

434
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,920
Assistant Kim Jae Ha.

435
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:14,460
[Chief Manager Kang Tae Joon]

436
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:36,480
[Robbery and murder case...]

437
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:44,170
Se Ra said Eunkang Group's Vice Chairman Kang Wan Soo

438
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:46,470
was there that day.

439
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:49,200
And she's searching for Kim Nam Gyu...

440
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:53,270
How are they related?

441
00:27:58,030 --> 00:28:02,430
Nam Gyu, you're not alone in this world.

442
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,420
I'm fine.

443
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:06,360
Thank you for your consolation.

444
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,870
Your father...

445
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:10,420
will come to meet you for sure.

446
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:18,280
That's right.

447
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:22,050
That older kid that spoke often with Angel Lady.

448
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:25,330
His name was Kim Nam Gyu.

449
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:35,030
Kim Nam Gyu!

450
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:47,660
I never knew you were this close.

451
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:50,010
Vice Chairman is your guardian,

452
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:52,020
Kim Nam Gyu...

453
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:54,540
That's you, right?

454
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:59,180
Yes. Is that a problem?

455
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:01,700
Isn't it a little strange?

456
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,240
Not long after my mother passed away,

457
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:09,630
you went abroad and changed your name with the help of the Vice Chairman.

458
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:13,190
And you're now his right-hand man.

459
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:17,720
This situation is quite uncomfortable and

460
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,590
strange to me.

461
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:23,350
It's a painful memory for me, too.

462
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:26,540
I don't want to even speak of it.

463
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:31,390
When I went to the orphanage for the first time after my mother passed away,

464
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:33,900
I had a very difficult time.

465
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:36,690
The person who helped me back on my feet

466
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:38,520
was Mrs. Yoon.

467
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:41,490
She suggested that I study abroad,

468
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:43,340
and while I was preparing to go,

469
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,530
she passed away.

470
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,630
Not long after that, Vice Chairman said he'd sponsor me,

471
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:54,200
so I left to study abroad.

472
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,400
I'm currently repaying his kindness after coming back.

473
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,750
Is that really all?

474
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:03,870
The day my mother passed away,

475
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:08,420
you didn't see anything else?

476
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:13,720
I know you want to believe something else happened that day,

477
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,530
but nothing did.

478
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:17,310
That day, Vice Chairman

479
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:21,460
simply came to see me because he was curious to see which student

480
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:24,220
Mrs. Yoon was sponsoring.

481
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:34,850
What did Assistant Kim say?

482
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:37,340
He admitted he's Kim Nam Gyu.

483
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:40,050
And? Why did he stay under Vice Chairman?

484
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:43,550
He said he was able to live a different life thanks to Vice Chairman.

485
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:47,290
So that's what happened... That's why he couldn't talk about it.

486
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:51,030
Last time, he told me that he was indebted to him, so he can't betray him.

487
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:55,130
Indebted? Even so, helping him commit a crime?

488
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:56,310
That's not right.

489
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:59,160
Well, I don't think that's the end of it.

490
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:03,380
There's... something he's hiding.

491
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:08,090
Chairman Eun just... came looking for me.

492
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:12,730
So you're saying he knows you're Kim Nam Gyu now?

493
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:17,500
You claimed Kim Nam Gyu is dead to the world,

494
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,350
but in the end, Eun Seon Woo...

495
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:22,820
discovered your identity?

496
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:27,240
If I had denied it, it would've looked more suspicious.

497
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,480
What suspicion?

498
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,930
Since he found out about Kim Nam Gyu,

499
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:34,490
I had to give Chairman Eun what he needed.

500
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,920
It's not something you have to worry about.

501
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:42,580
I told him that you came to see me that day as well.

502
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:46,630
That bastard... gets on my nerves.

503
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:50,620
The members are turning their backs on me.

504
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:56,590
I really can't leave things as they are now.

505
00:31:57,330 --> 00:32:00,640
The girl who's also from the orphanage...

506
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,380
you said she has a special relationship with Chairman Eun. Right?

507
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:06,870
Don Se Ra?

508
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:10,990
Eunkang Foundation has been sponsoring Dodam Orphanage for a while now.

509
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:12,320
Yes.

510
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:16,170
They've been continuing to sponsor them even after Mrs. Yoon's death.

511
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:23,590
Bring that girl to the support meeting that's being hosted by Eunkang Foundation today.

512
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:25,040
Understood.

513
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:30,050
Do you...

514
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:33,160
have any plans in mind?

515
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:40,380
I thought I warned you not to talk back to what I say.

516
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:44,900
A couple of the members who supported Vice Chairman

517
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:49,510
seem to have changed their minds after the incident with Manager Kang.

518
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:52,500
Oh, right, and this...

519
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,780
You have to attend tonight's support meeting

520
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:57,910
hosted by the Eunkang Foundation.

521
00:32:57,910 --> 00:33:00,110
I'll just send a donation.

522
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:03,100
It's a foundation established after your mother's will.

523
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:06,930
The previous chairman attended every year.

524
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:10,910
It's a fund for children whose protection has been terminated...

525
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:13,600
Many of the members also attend with their spouses,

526
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:17,020
so I believe it will be a great opportunity for you to strengthen your position.

527
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:18,470
Furthermore, you're—

528
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:23,550
Stop. I... will attend.

529
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:27,730
All right. Then... I'll prepare accordingly.

530
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:35,820
CEO Sa!

531
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:36,980
You're here?

532
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,480
Yeah.

533
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:41,890
Yes, this is Don Se Ra.

534
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:46,970
Huh? A support meeting for our orphanage?

535
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,500
As soon as Chairman Eun returned...

536
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:58,630
People are quite shrewd.

537
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:00,820
I didn't know the executives who supported Vice Chairman

538
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:03,490
would turn their backs in such an instant.

539
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:05,470
I'm solely to blame.

540
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:08,150
Oh, not at all...

541
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:10,440
The chairman is coming.

542
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:17,340
What is Chairman Eun doing at a support meeting such as this?

543
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:19,980
Well, my wife's looking for me now, so please excuse me.

544
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:21,770
Wait, hey...

545
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:23,480
- I'm sorry.
- Vice Chairman,

546
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:28,250
please excuse me. I keep getting a call.

547
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:36,540
I'll remember each one of you.

548
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:39,700
Those flip-flopper bastards.

549
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:50,950
Vice Chairman, this is Don Se Ra.

550
00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:55,120
Thank you for inviting me, Vice Chairman Kang Wan Soo.

551
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:02,220
Secretary Don, or are you Chairman Eun's secretary now?

552
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:05,980
No, I have nothing to do with Eunkang now.

553
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:08,950
Then, are you Eun Seon Woo's woman?

554
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:13,060
I hear you're from an orphanage sponsored by Eunkang.

555
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:15,290
I heard you're in need of a lot of money.

556
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:18,190
Is that why you're sticking next to Chairman Eun?

557
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:21,340
I am from an orphanage and I do need money,

558
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:25,120
but that's not the reason why I'm staying by Chairman Eun's side.

559
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:28,220
And geez, who am I

560
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:31,810
that you threatened to cut all sponsorships if I didn't come?

561
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:35,340
Since I came and greeted you, I can leave now. Right?

562
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:38,150
I see you're acting up believing Chairman Eun has your back.

563
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:40,820
Another reason...

564
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:43,890
Do you two have feelings for each other?

565
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:48,780
That reason... could be you.

566
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:53,370
How daring.

567
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:57,280
Let's see how long you can stay that way.

568
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:12,840
Hello, I'm Kang Wan Soo.

569
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:17,610
I'm up here because there's someone I'd like to introduce to you.

570
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:19,540
Don Se Ra?

571
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:33,660
This is Don Se Ra, who grew up in our foundation-sponsored Dodam Orphanage.

572
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:40,600
As a sponsor, I've only seen the money that gets donated,

573
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:46,160
but I never imagined she'd grow up this well and work at Eunkang.

574
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:51,330
There might be a couple of you who recognizes her face.

575
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:54,990
But... how did you...

576
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:57,190
enter our company again?

577
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:58,780
I'm sorry?

578
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,150
Well...

579
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:06,270
Through me!

580
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:12,630
I'm Eun Seon Woo. I personally hired...

581
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:15,730
Don Se Ra myself.

582
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:19,140
- Personally?
- Why would he...

583
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:25,060
I never knew you had personally hired her.

584
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:31,270
But why did you specifically assign her as Manager Kang Tae Joon's secretary?

585
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:33,460
If you don't mind me asking.

586
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:39,320
Everyone gathered here today is Eunkang's family, wouldn't you say?

587
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:43,790
It would be nice to talk about ordinary family matters with everyone, Chairman.

588
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:45,060
Of course, it would be nice.

589
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:48,150
Everyone gathered here probably already knows,

590
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:52,960
Director Kang Tae Joon's secretary always quit after less than 3 months,

591
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:57,160
Manager Kang is quite the sore finger in our family...

592
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:01,710
then or now.

593
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,810
He said Assistant Kim wasn't enough,

594
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:08,560
and if it was Don Se Ra, who has years of experience, I thought

595
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,100
she'd be more than competent enough

596
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:15,040
to take care of Manager Kang Tae Joon.

597
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,800
Even so, for you to have

598
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:22,850
personally assigned him a mere secretary is a bit...

599
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:27,900
To call her a mere secretary, Don Se Ra's resume is quite extensive.

600
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:33,390
Don Se Ra, before entering the company, what jobs have you done?

601
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:37,080
Yes.

602
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,300
Starting from a Refund Specialist, also known as the Marines

603
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,110
of the customer service department,

604
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:44,150
to part-time child care who can make even crying children laugh,

605
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:47,330
and even a part-time job in dog behavior correction therapy

606
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:50,170
that can make even fierce, crazy dogs into cute dogs.

607
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:51,750
Of course,

608
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:57,350
we can also provide behavioral therapy for problematic humans.

609
00:38:57,350 --> 00:39:00,940
That's how important of a person they are.

610
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,880
Who are you talking about?

611
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:14,330
Manager Kang? Or Don Se Ra, who's standing here now?

612
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:22,280
Of course,

613
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:25,700
both of them.

614
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:28,650
In different ways.

615
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,980
What Chairman means

616
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:38,910
is that each employee of Eunkang Group is precious.

617
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,680
Vice Chairman Kang Wan Soo.

618
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,800
I'm greatly disappointed in you.

619
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:49,700
Is it okay to call a person up there in the name of the sponsor meeting,

620
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:53,520
recklessly without asking for her permission?

621
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,170
Then everyone...

622
00:39:57,170 --> 00:40:01,220
please enjoy... the rest of your time here.

623
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,150
Director Hong, please get the car ready.

624
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:23,180
All right.

625
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:27,460
I'm sorry. I put you in a difficult situation, didn't I?

626
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:29,580
The one to receive an apology should be you.

627
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:32,130
I didn't know Vice Chairman would do this.

628
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:35,190
If I had known, I'd have prevented this beforehand. I'm sorry.

629
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:36,980
I'm all right.

630
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:40,010
You had to stand in front of your employees because of me...

631
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:43,030
Chairman Eun.

632
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:50,740
You can't leave just anyone by your side.

633
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:53,030
Think of your reputation.

634
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:56,630
What wise words.

635
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:59,630
I'll pay more heed to my reputation from now on.

636
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:01,700
Please keep your distance...

637
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:04,070
from me.

638
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:07,350
Just because you both don't have parents doesn't put you in the same shoes.

639
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:10,380
I'm telling you this because you're like my son,

640
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:12,200
take my words to heart!

641
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:16,000
How dare you even think you have a chance!

642
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,620
Vice Chairman Kang Wan Soo.

643
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:22,250
I might not have inherited a fortune from my parents like someone,

644
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:24,160
but I lived a good life independently,

645
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:27,160
and I have enough to care for my siblings.

646
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:30,730
Look at you talking back to an elder.

647
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:33,740
This is why parenting is important.

648
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:37,840
I can see now that Seon Woo became this way after meeting you.

649
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:40,000
If Seon Woo's parents were alive,

650
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,530
to think how upset they'd be if they saw him right now—

651
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:47,320
Why don't you tell that to your son who's in jail right now.

652
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:52,570
If my parents names

653
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:55,330
pass through your lips again,

654
00:41:55,330 --> 00:41:57,920
I won't just sit back like I did today.

655
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:20,510
Forget about what happened today.

656

- From now on, I'll never—
- I'll...

658
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:28,050
take good care of myself.

659

Don't worry.

I have supervision

You don't need to be competent when you're with me.

663

I'm competent enough,

00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:46,050
and I'll stay by your side.

665
00:43:04,370 --> 00:43:07,950
Humiliating Don Se Ra in front of everyone...

666
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:09,950
was your mistake.

667
00:43:09,950 --> 00:43:12,260
You've only riled up Eun Seon Woo.

668

Are you trying to teach me a lesson?

669
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,920
Don't think about anything and just get some rest tonight.

The one who gave Tae Joon drugs was you, wasn't it?

672

Manager Kang Tae Joon...

673
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:32,790
was always anxious and worried that you wouldn't approve of him.

674
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:35,170
Is that why you made him depend on drugs,

675
00:43:35,170 --> 00:43:37,090
and made him go to jail like that?

676
00:43:37,090 --> 00:43:39,790
It's not because of me, he was always a feeble-minded kid.

telling me I'm your son,

684
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,950
was it all just to feel me out?

685
00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:09,250
I could've done anything for you.

Do you want me to?

Didn't you just say you'd do anything for me?

In the end, that was it.

The reason you needed me.

701

It's not just for me... but for us.

702

Eun Seon Woo?

706

The foolish one is you, not me.

710
00:45:29,410 --> 00:45:34,170
You do whatever it takes to protect useless Kang Tae Joon,

711
00:45:34,170 --> 00:45:36,880
but try to discard me, when I'm the one you need.

712
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:39,770
You still can't tell who you need more,

00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:42,620
and who's more helpful to you, Father?

You said you were going to a support meeting,

00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:15,070
he cowardly chooses to kill himself?

819
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:20,130
I'll do whatever it takes...

820
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:23,540
to bring him to life,

821
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:31,300
and kill him with my own hands.

822
00:55:50,770 --> 00:55:52,370
You shouldn't drive!

823
00:55:52,370 --> 00:55:54,860
You couldn't even sleep for the past few days.

824
00:55:56,090 --> 00:55:58,950
My head is clearer than ever before.

825
00:55:58,950 --> 00:56:00,540
Listen to me!

826
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:02,550
I'll take you home.

827
00:56:02,550 --> 00:56:04,760
Go to the secret base.

828
00:56:55,340 --> 00:56:57,840
If I just caught the culprit,

829
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:03,350
I thought those recurring nightmares...

830
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:07,240
would end.

831
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:12,460
What I never wanted to see...

832
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:17,030
but the time I have to face every time I open my eyes...

833
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:25,080
is too painful.

834
00:57:41,950 --> 00:57:44,000
All this time,

835
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:48,630
I was scared and afraid of everything I had to face,

836
00:57:49,350 --> 00:57:52,010
so I hid them with glasses.

837
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:56,240
But for the first time in my life,

838
00:57:57,420 --> 00:57:59,680
there's someone I want to...

839
00:58:00,970 --> 00:58:03,540
see with these two eyes.

840
00:58:08,010 --> 00:58:11,380
I want to face the difficult times with him,

841
00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:13,840
I also want to be the first one...

842
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:16,050
to see him...

843
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:19,860
smile in his happiest moments.

844
00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:24,830
To the point where I feel blessed...

845
00:58:26,260 --> 00:58:29,020
for possessing supervision.

846
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:51,030
♫ Your smile was always out of reach ♫

847
00:58:51,030 --> 00:58:57,740
♫ It is warmer than it was yesterday ♫

848
00:58:57,740 --> 00:59:06,400
♫ I had to act as if I knew nothing and turn away ♫

849
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:11,240
♫ Do you know me? ♫

850
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:21,500
♫ If I was only given one day ♫

851
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:27,800
♫ I'd face you and look at you ♫

852
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:35,200
♫ And stay in the same place as you stupidly ♫

853
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:40,700
♫ Today once again ♫

854
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:47,700
♫ I embrace you in the corners of my heart ♫

855
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:56,080
♫ Your endlessly beautiful eyes ♫

856
00:59:56,080 --> 01:00:02,850
♫ They are clearer than they were yesterday ♫

857
01:00:02,850 --> 01:00:09,880
♫ To hold someone you can't reach dear to your heart ♫

858
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:15,900
♫ It can be difficult sometimes ♫

859
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:26,650
♫ If I was only given one day ♫

860
01:00:26,650 --> 01:00:32,880
♫ I'd face you and look at you ♫

861
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:40,330
♫ And stay in the same place as you stupidly ♫

862
01:00:40,330 --> 01:00:45,840
♫ Today once again ♫

863
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:48,970
♫ I embrace you in the corners of my heart ♫

864
01:00:48,970 --> 01:00:54,530
♫ This touching night, I want to express ♫

865
01:00:54,530 --> 01:01:04,000
♫ All of my sincerity for you who resemble a star ♫

866
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,910
[Good Job]

867
01:01:07,910 --> 01:01:10,620
Don't you barely have enought time to be affectionate with each other?

868
01:01:10,620 --> 01:01:14,700
Is Don Se Ra really Eun Seon Woo's Achilles heel?

869
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:16,990
Everything just falls together too perfectly.

870
01:01:16,990 --> 01:01:19,460
Like a solved puzzle.

871
01:01:19,460 --> 01:01:21,770
I need Assistant Kim's home address.

872
01:01:21,770 --> 01:01:23,990
What was this bastard thinking in here?

873
01:01:23,990 --> 01:01:28,000
He must've been chasing me from a discreet place like this...

874
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,170
like a rat.

875
01:01:29,170 --> 01:01:31,270
Go to the secret base immediately.

876
01:01:31,270 --> 01:01:32,710
Lady...

877
01:01:32,710 --> 01:01:39,540
I remember now.
♫ I only have you ♫
