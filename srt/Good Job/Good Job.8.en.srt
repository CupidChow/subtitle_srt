8
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:02,150
I'm done with my duty in the company. Right?

9
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:03,380
Yeah.

10
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:07,330
Starting tomorrow, you can go straight to the secret base.

Okay.

I guess it's time to return to my original job now.

Then, what about you?

14
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:20,570
Chairman Eun within the company, and Investigator Eun outside...

15
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:23,760
I'll need to find evidence against my enemy. Right?

16
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:27,330
Who on earth is that enemy?

17
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:30,670
Well, I'm also an employee...

18
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:33,340
If I know the enemy and myself, it's one shot, one kill.

19
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:36,230
Sayings like that exist.

That's why Secretary Don should do a good job.

27
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:02,400
Until now, I've been Secretary Don, Assistant Don, cleaning lady,

28
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,310
your girlfriend, and even your wife!

29

How better of a job can I do than this?

30

Girlfriend and wife?

31
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:13,030
That's right.

32
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:16,350
I'm looking forward to what my next role will be.

33
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:18,280
Keep looking forward and go inside.

34
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,650
Huh?

35
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,340
I'm going.

36
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,610
All right.

37
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:25,870
Goodbye.

38
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:28,320
Don't even look back and hurry inside.

39
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,620
Hurry!

40
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,050
Go.

41
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:35,060
Why is he rushing?

42
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:38,720
He's the one who said he'll take me home.

43
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,520
That's weird.

44
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,880
I think they've been following us since before.

45
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,780
Am I wrong?

46
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,450
Shit.

47
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,510
What the? Where did he go?

48
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:10,810
Find him!

49
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:12,710
Shit, where did this bastard go?

50
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:14,490
This son of a bitch.

51
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:30,320
Who are you people? Who sent you?

52
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,540
Chairman!

53
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,900
Load him... into the car.

54
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:05,300
Where did he go?

55
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,680
He was here just now.

56
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,500
Blood!

57
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:17,980
Chairman!

58
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:23,270
Chairman! Chairman!

59
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,370
No!

60
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:28,550
Taxi! Over here!

61
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,360
Taxi...

62
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,540
Please hurry and chase them.

63
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,370
Hurry!

64
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:40,800
What is this?

65
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,280
This is our shop's new menu: vegan bread.

66
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,360
Have a taste and tell me what you think.

67
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,650
You want me to try it?

68
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:50,300
Looking at you,

69
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:54,790
I reflected on myself for not being able to consider the diversity of customers.

70
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:57,130
I've fixed my shortcoming, so give it a try.

71
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,160
So you want me to tell you honestly?

72
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,610
Yes!

73
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:02,690
Just enough so I'm not hurt.

74
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:05,310
- Then I can't.
- No! Fine.

75
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:07,700
I'm ready.

76
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,710
Okay.

77
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,070
Here I go.

78
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,810
I'm eating it.

79
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,310
How is it?

80
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,580
For starters, the bread...

81
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,480
is too crude and ugly.

82
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,730
- I knew it.
- But...

83
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:32,710
it's savory and sweet,

84
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:35,550
and really soft.

85
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:40,590
It has somewhat of a... luxurious flavor.

86
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,850
And the more I chew,

87
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:45,620
there's a whirlwind at the tip of my tongue.

88
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:48,640
It's best bread I've eaten until now.

89
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,130
Oh, my gosh!

90
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:53,740
How is it that even your description of flavor is intelligent?

91
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,690
How lawyer-like of you!

92
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:57,850
My bread-pride is soaring.

93
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:00,540
And there's something I didn't tell you last time,

94
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,730
but you know that vegan bread you gave me?

95
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:06,000
I became really sick after eating that.

96
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,240
Why?

97
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,950
Did it make your stomach turn? That shouldn't have happened.

98
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:12,770
It's because I was suffering bread withdrawal symptoms.

99
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:14,820
Oh, my gosh!

100
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,320
Judging by your rating of the taste of bread,

101
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,420
and how you dealt with Soo Ah's incident,

102
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,860
your abilities can't even be described.

103
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:30,020
Sincerity... you know your sincerity is your best charm. Right?

104
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:33,520
As a lawyer, as someone with such sincerity,

105
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,650
being complimented by you

106
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:39,780
boosts my self-esteem and makes me feel approved of.

107
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,210
Gosh, Seon Woo, that jerk,

108
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:44,950
has no manners. No manners!

109
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,910
Chairman Eun Seon Woo is too much.

110
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:51,470
Whether it's company affairs or investigation affairs,

111
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:53,180
I'm the one who supports him from behind,

112
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,370
but he runs around thinking he's all that

113
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:57,610
and doesn't even acknowledge me in the back.

114
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:59,710
- Gosh.
- It's true, right?

115
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:02,860
That Investigator Eun is Chairman Eun Seon Woo?

116
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:09,380
W-What? W-Which aspect?

117
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:11,010
Whenver you're flustered...

118
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:14,520
did you know you go, "W-What? W-Which aspect?"

119
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,100
Wait, wait, so...

120
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,430
let's clear things up.

121
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:23,080
You're Chairman Eun's friend as well as his personal lawyer!

122
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,080
- Yes, Se Ra?
- There's big trouble!

123
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,370
Chairman... Chairman's been abducted!

124
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:35,570
What?

125
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:37,040
A-Abducted?

126
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,670
Seon Woo was?

127
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,830
Yes, I'm chasing after them in a taxi,

128
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,700
but I need your help!

129
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,300
Okay, where are you?

130
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,490
Yes.

131
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:49,260
I'll be right there.

132
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,830
Where do you think you're coming?

133
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54,890
You think I can sit back when Chairman has been abducted?

134
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:56,920
Furthermore, Se Ra is chasing after them.

135
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,370
Na Hee, it's really dangerous. Get back inside.

136
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:01,270
And it's fine for you and Se Ra to be in danger?

137
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:04,720
Let's rescue Chairman first.

138
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:07,200
Na Hee, this is a manual car!

139
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,830
- I have a special license.
- Special license?

140
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:28,740
Make a right at that intersection!

141
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,620
The license plate number is 23N9944.

142
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:44,050
They're going toward Guri.

143
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,000
Seon Woo's current cell phone location is around the Samjin intersection.

144
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,560
- Is that right, Se Ra?
- Yes, they're heading in that direction.

145
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,940
Se Ra! H-Hold on! Hold on!

146
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,000
Seon Woo, are you okay?

147
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,450
Okay, I got it.

148
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:43,610
Seon Woo, calm down. Calm down.

149
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:45,410
If what I say is correct, knock once

150
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:47,410
and if not, knock twice.

151
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:49,570
Have we seen these guys before?

152
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:53,430
You think they're sent by someone we know?

153
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:56,770
Brother, this bastard's cell phone is turned on.

154
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:58,540
- What?
- Eun Seon Woo!

155
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,910
You didn't take his cell phone earlier?

156
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:02,960
The plan suddenly changed from assault to abduction...

157
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,810
Shit.

158
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:10,300
Seon Woo! Seon Woo!

159
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:13,330
Se Ra, where are you right now?

160
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:16,000
Seon Woo's last known cell phone location is Taeneung!

161
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,500
Okay, that's where I'm heading now.

162
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,160
They just turned towards Topyeong!

163
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,410
I think I lost them.

164
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:33,350
Hold on, Se Ra.

165
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:37,300
If they disappeared in Topyeong's direction,

166
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:40,060
they probably took Deokso IC-

167
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:42,230
They probably got onto Deokso IC, Se Ra!

168
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:44,690
Keep going that way.

169
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:47,280
Sir, you must not lose them.

170
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,670
Se Ra, the abduction car—

171
00:10:58,670 --> 00:10:59,970
just—

172
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:03,680
just took a beltway towards Namyangju!

173
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,450
Where is he?

174
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:38,730
- All right, put him down there.
- Okay, Brother.

175
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,340
Chairman.

176
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:26,710
Attorney Yang, I found him!

177
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:29,920
He's in some warehouse near Seungri Church.

178
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,460
We're almost there, Se Ra!

179
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:35,670
Report this to the police first, and just wait.

180
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,870
You must not move on your own,

181
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,820
understand?

182
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,920
Yes, all right—

183
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,580
S-Se Ra!

184
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:50,290
What the? It turned off.

185
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:53,130
Gosh, now of all times.

186
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:55,680
It got disconnected.

187
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:05,140
Did you put someone on Chairman Eun's tail?

188
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:07,440
That jerk's the one who put someone on my tail.

189
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,980
So I just planned to rough him a bit.

190
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:13,940
By whom?

191
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,800
He's someone I trust.

192
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,950
You know.

193
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:21,090
President Byeon?

194
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,950
Do you know what kind if man President Byeon is?

195
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:28,380
Just wait and see.

196
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:32,790
If Eun Seon Woo, that bastard acts up, I won't just sit back either.

197
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,220
[President Byeon]

198
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,340
Yeah, how did it go?

199
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,730
Well, yes.

200
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:48,730
He was more rough than I expected, so we did see some blood.

201
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:50,040
Yeah? Good job.

202
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,700
But you know?

203
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:55,620
I think our pay is a bit too low.

204
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:58,650
You want more when all you did was rough him up a bit?

205
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:00,790
Yes.

206
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:06,260
I think we deserve... one more bill to cover the kids' hospital fees.

207
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,700
All right.

208
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:12,330
And things took a slight turn.

209
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:16,100
Our kids ended up escorting Chairman here.

210
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,540
What?

211
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:20,000
You have Eun Seon Woo in your hands?

212
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,090
What are you thinking?

213
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:25,970
I was just planning to give him a few slaps,

214
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:28,320
but he ended up seeing the kids' faces.

215
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,560
So I wanted to make sure that wouldn't be a problem—

216
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,240
So what the hell are you going to do?

217
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,010
Hey, you!

218
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,790
Vice Chairman.

219
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,240
Have you been well?

220
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,000
What kind of messy job is this?

221
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,430
Are you threatening us right now?

222
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:54,360
Hey, how could I threaten you when we're souch good friends?

223
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:59,280
He's quite a valuable person, so I just thought you should know.

224
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:03,960
And it would be even better if you could tell me how we should proceed

225
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,760
in this unexpected situation.

226
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:10,140
Proceed as you would normally.

227
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,560
As we would normally...

228
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,900
Must I even explain that to you?

229
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:20,450
Gosh, what a temper.

230
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:23,510
Assistant Kim, get in here.

231
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:31,140
You'll have to pay President Byeon a visit.

232
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:33,360
He's not someone trustworthy.

233
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,920
Keep an eye on him until the end.

234
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,770
Rude bastard.

235
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:45,360
Does he not see me?

236
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:50,180
You're the one who's blind!

237
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:54,030
You dare to drag President Byeon into this?

238
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,390
I'm going nuts.

239
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:13,520
What he wanted was Chairman Eun's death?

240
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:29,000
You mean little punks...

241
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:34,070
you should've been careful not to scratch up our precious guest.

242
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:35,910
I'm sorry.

243
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:48,190
Why don't you get up now, Chairman? Huh?

244
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:58,010
This isn't... exactly the greatest bed.

245
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:00,970
You must have received quite a sum.

246
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:05,020
Fearlessly using a knife on me like that.

247
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:09,080
We've received enough to escort you to this lowly place.

248
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,630
What do they want from me?

249
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,350
Do they want me dead?

250
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:16,870
Whoa... Seeing how quick to understand you are,

251
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:21,150
there must have been a number of people trying to kill you.

252
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:23,270
You're a pretty valuable person,

253
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:27,160
and I figured one wrong move might get us in trouble.

254
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:30,770
So I intuitively used my brain.

255
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:34,150
I see you used it to the highest capacity.

256
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:35,440
How smart of you.

257
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,370
Is it because you've only been in high positions?

258
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:40,710
Your tongue...

259
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:45,170
is quite short.
(Seon Woo spoke informally.)

260
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:47,550
That evil jerk!

261
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:54,330
I'm giving you a heads-up since we've shared some blood.

262
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:57,060
Think carefully about the consequences before you act.

263
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:00,730
Let's see how long you can stay so haughty.

264
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:04,150
You're the type who earns his beatings.

265
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:06,720
Rather than earning my beatings...

266
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:12,190
I'm the type who's good at earning money.

267
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:13,630
Money. That's right!

268
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:17,160
You should've brought that up in the first place!

269
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:22,460
Then shall we share an honest conversation?

270
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,160
What a bummer.

271
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:29,900
I don't do business with kids who lack intellect.

272
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:37,400
Kids who lack intellect.

273
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:40,240
Intellect...

274
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,880
Hey, this looks perfect. This one!

275
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,990
Chairman is asking for a bath.

276
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:47,540
Fill up some water for him.

277
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:51,420
Please understand if some water gets in your mouth.

278
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:53,220
Chairman.

279
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,520
- Chairman!
- What are you bastards doing?

280
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,080
Gosh, those vil jerks!

281
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,490
Attorney Yang!

282
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:02,310
- Na Hee!
- Are you okay?

283
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:04,150
Is this their base?

284
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:05,720
Yes, there's big trouble.

285
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,770
Chairman Eun doesn't look too good.

286
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:10,410
Hey, why are you here?

287
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:13,370
I came to rescue you. I'll keep you safe.

288
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:17,780
First, let's rescue Seon Woo.

289
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:20,360
- Us?
- How?

290
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,570
Follow me!

291
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:16,880
You're sure this is deadly, right?

292
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,290
I want to live a kind life now.

293
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:23,330
Don't worry, it's glacial acetic acid.

294
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:27,320
Okay then, let's rescue Chairman.

295
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,320
Raise it.

296
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,430
Come on now.

297
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:36,680
Hey, is this going to take all night?

298
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,730
Let's finish up here quickly and go home and rest!

299
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:42,720
- Understood!
- W-W-Wait, wait!

300
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,410
Hey, you!

301
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:48,620
I have a question.

302
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:51,410
How much did you ask for in exchange for my body?

303
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:57,540
Why would someone facing their death be curious about that?

304
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:00,850
I'd like to prove my worth even if I'm dead!

305
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:02,900
How many bills did you ask for?

306
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:07,220
If it's a petty amount, I'm going to haunt you after my death.

307
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:10,330
I'm going to chase you around forever!

308
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:15,100
Happy now?

309
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,490
500 million? Are you kidding me?

310
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:20,660
You only know how to fill a tank with water, but do you not know the ways of the world?

311
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:23,100
Did you forget who I am?

312
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,420
Eunkang Group's Chairman.

313
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:28,040
Do you think we would've taken you without even knowing that?

314
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,770
That's right, Eunkang!

315
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:31,150
Don't you watch the news?

316
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:33,330
Do you not the value of our company?

317
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:36,210
I'm the chairman of Eunkang Group!

318
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:37,490
Can't you tell?

319
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:39,910
How much simpler do I have to spell it out for you?

320
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:41,850
500 million?

321
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:44,970
My ransom is a mere 500 million?

322
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,790
How could you be so naive to the world?

323
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:51,060
Minimum... five billion.

324
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:55,470
F-Five... billion?

325
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,800
Think carefully.

326
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,220
Instead of committing a crime for 500 million,

327
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:05,350
wouldn't it be better if you could get five billion in return for saving my life?

328
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:09,990
I'll send you one billion, immediately!

329
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:11,460
If I get out of here safely,

330
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:15,510
I'll gather up all the money I have at home and give you four billion!

331
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:18,870
How about it?

332
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:22,940
Settling at five billion. Deal?

00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:08,750
You're not lying, so I won't worry. Are you?

502
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:10,620
You keep saying it's because of you,

503
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:12,940
but you're quite overreacting.

504
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:14,520
Gosh...

505
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:18,130
Right, I have to contact Attorney Yang.

506
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:21,550
Yang Jin Mo already knows.

507
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:23,190
What?

508
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:26,160
Then the two of you completely fooled us?

509
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,400
What do you mean, fool?

510
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,400
We didn't intentionally plan for this,

511
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,770
but as per our plan...

512
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:51,200
We changed our plan after spotting Assistant Kim.

513
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:54,270
Then, at the valley...

514
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:58,510
The reason why Assistant Kim came was because Vice Chairman sent him to confirm if those people

515
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:00,520
did their job.

516
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,290
I needed to make him believe.

517
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:06,760
Even so... Do you know how worried I was?

518
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,200
I'm sorry.

519
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,630
You think sorry will cut it?

520
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:14,630
I'm so mad.

521
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:17,130
I'm seriously in pain.

522
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:18,880
Oh, right.

523
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,550
Where are you going?

524
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:24,440
Se Ra went to the site for sure,

525
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,980
so what if she gets caught by those people?

526
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:29,460
Se Ra is safe.

527
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:31,020
How would you know?

528
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:33,710
She's with Seon Woo right now.

529
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:34,940
Wait.

530
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:37,350
Then... Investigator Eun is alive?

531
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:38,410
Yes, well...

532
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:40,720
- Earlier...
- Gosh!

533
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,940
Seon Woo said he had no other choice.

534
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,870
Please understand.

535
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,420
Then, where are they right now?

536
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:50,160
They're at...

537
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,610
Seon Woo's angga.

538
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:53,730
Don't go?

539
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:55,820
It's not, go, don't go,

540
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:59,170
but angga, a secret location.

541
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:06,570
How long was this place empty?

542
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:08,750
About 20 years now?

543
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:10,870
It's been empty...

544
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:13,030
ever since my mom died.

545
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:14,660
After that...

546
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:18,390
Then, this place is safe?

547
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:22,220
No one will even imagine I'd be here.

548
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:24,200
Since...

549
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,630
this place isn't...

550
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:30,070
somewhere my father and I would want to return to.

551
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:35,700
How long are you planning to stay here?

552
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,490
For now?

553
00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:41,260
I need to make everyone believe I'm dead.

554
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:44,110
There are things I need to look into in the meantime.

555
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,020
I guess we'll soon find out...

556
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,260
what Vice Chairman Kang's next plan is.

557
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:51,860
[Eunkang]
Following Chairman Eun Seon Woo's disappearance,

558
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:54,350
it's been revealed that not only sexual harassment,

559
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:56,160
but embezzlement have been committed within the Eunkang Group,

560
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,910
but they placed the responsibility on the victim to make them resign,

561
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:00,410
making people angry.

562
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:02,950
In the midst of Chairman Eun Sen Woo's disappearance,

563
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:05,120
the group will—

564
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,280
Chairman.

565
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:13,950
Where on earth are you?

566
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:17,710
Chairman!

567
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:25,090
If you're hiding in there to make fun of me,

568
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:28,320
I'll forgive everything, so—

569
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:30,060
Wait.

570
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,950
Why does this open?

571
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:36,010
Ch-Chairman?

572
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:37,230
Chairman—

573
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:38,770
Hey!

574
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:46,640
This many books...

575
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,480
He's not even going to read them...

576
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,440
What the hell?

577
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:00,920
What—

578
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:08,850
Elevator?

579
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:11,530
Wow! Hey! Hey!

580
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:16,510
I think the situaition is worsening.

581
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:18,440
Is it okay for us to stay put like this?

582
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,180
It becomes clearer in situations like this...

583
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:23,590
who's on my side and who isn't.

584
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:26,870
Why is your world so complicated?

585
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:30,100
Na Hee, this must be kept an absolute secret...

586
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:32,510
from Detective Han.

587
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:36,010
I already know that much.

588
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,590
Wait...

589
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:42,610
Wait. What is all this?

590
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:46,780
He was always going back and forth from the Room of Contemplation...

591
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:49,780
As I expected...

592
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:52,870
that man doesn't look like he's contemplated a day in his life.

593
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:57,260
I guess the two of us have a secret of our own now.

594
00:39:58,290 --> 00:39:59,900
Although...

595
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:03,640
we did have a secret before, too.

596
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:06,040
Gosh, honestly...

597
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:10,180
Some time has passed, so I'm just...

598
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:12,330
asking you nonchalantly.

599
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:15,070
How was it, that time?

600
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:18,340
Well...

601
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:20,550
a bit...

602
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:22,280
A bit...

603
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,990
what?

604
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:26,350
Well, generally speaking...

605
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:28,050
a bit...

606
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,280
If you think about it,

607
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:41,560
you and I are a bit...

608
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,330
suited for each other.

609
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:45,000
We are?

610
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,320
Well...

611
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:49,710
you can say that in some aspects.

612
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:51,340
Well...

613
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:53,280
which aspects?

614
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:58,900
Which aspects...

615
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:02,710
in regards to which area?

616
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:26,610
Huh? Director Hong! How did you—

617
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:27,480
How did you...

618
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:31,090
What are you two doing here right now? Huh?

619
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:34,160
When we don't even know if Chairman is alive or dead!

620
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,970
The two of you, in this discreet place!

621
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:38,480
Discreetly!

622
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,580
Eating bread... with Bang's Boss!

623
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:45,400
I'm disappointed in you, Attorney Yang.

624
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:48,970
Wait, D-Director Hong!

625
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:50,640
Bang!

626
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,040
Bang...

627
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:55,160
[Vacant leadership at Eunkang Group due to Chairman Eun's disappearance...]

628
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,900
Thanks.

629
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:06,580
Manager Kim Hong Soo's case...

630
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:08,920
The audit team is investigating the victims,

631
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:12,870
but Eunkang Group is saying they're going to sue them for defamation.

632
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:17,530
Since we're trying to dig into who tried to bury this case...

633
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:19,810
they just want to cover it up.

634
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:23,950
Chairman Eun Seon Woo is the one who told the victims to inquire about a police investigation,

635
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:26,690
but the group is claiming that never happened.

636
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:30,700
And that's when Chairman Eun went missing...

637
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:34,370
You don't really think Chairman Eun Seon Woo died, do you?

638
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:37,610
Nothing else was found at the scene?

639
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:39,420
A body wasn't found yet

640
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:42,580
and they're investigating the source of the drugs found in his car.

641
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:47,400
I'm going nuts.

642
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:50,910
The person you have called is not available—

643
00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:54,300
Why is Se Ra's phone off? It's making me anxious.

644
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:56,510
What should we do now, Senior?

645
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,200
When did we ever investigate with our brains?

646
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:02,940
We'll just tackle it full on.

647
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:04,600
Let's go.

648
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:26,490
Kang Tae Joon!

649
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,920
Hello.

650
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,890
What's the problem?

651
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:35,410
I'm Detective Han Kwang Gi from Yongnam Police Station.

652
00:43:35,410 --> 00:43:38,890
I have a few questions to ask you in regards to Manager Kim Hong Soo's investigation.

653
00:43:38,890 --> 00:43:42,310
If you listen to the victims and Kim Hong Soo's statement,

654
00:43:42,310 --> 00:43:44,750
there's definitely someone higher up...

655
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:47,500
Does Manager Kang Tae Joon by any chance...

656
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,280
have something to do with the cover up?

657
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,960
Is there evidence that I did it?

658
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:54,820
What is this rudeness... without even a warrant.

659
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:58,330
What is this?

660
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:01,620
I'm asking you.

661
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:04,250
How are you doing your job?

662
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,330
I'm sorry.

663
00:44:06,330 --> 00:44:08,800
Must I deal with a pest like him on my way to work?

664
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,110
Hey, did you just say pest?

665
00:44:11,110 --> 00:44:12,220
It's fine.

666
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:15,660
Pests usually gather around smelly shit.

667
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:30,800
I'll be back again to clean shit up soon!

668
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,070

Gosh...

You think wiping it like that will have any effect?

684

Scrub it a but harder, harder, harder.

This isn't something normal!

689

- Give it to me.
- Hey.

690
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:51,500
I mean, Seon Woo might be safe now,

691

but the abductors might be observing us from somewhere!

692

Running away and hiding isn't my style.

I know very well how you feel.

694

But you saw what kind of people those guys are.

695
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:03,950
I did!

696
00:46:03,950 --> 00:46:06,190
Never in my life did I think I'd meet someone who'd order someone killed

or people who would do exactly as he ordered.

709
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:49,520

710

Isn't that person, Chairman Eun Seon Woo's attorney?

713
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:06,500
He is.

714

Are they dating?

Yes...

717

I'm unfamiliar with that side of Na Hee...

718
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:19,970
but jealous as well.

719
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:23,740
Chairman Eun Seon Woo is currently missing,

720
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:28,390
but his attorney is being lovey dovey with Na Hee?

721
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:55,120
Should you at least go to the hospital?

This is a photo my mother took when she was a volunteer.

This is our orphanage.

Weren't you at Dodam Orphanage?

Before that, it was Sarang Orphanage.

738

Everyone at the orphanage called her that.

747

That's right.

748

Angel Lady.

769
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:10,660
drove the other kids to make fun of me.

770
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:12,750
But she

771
00:51:12,750 --> 00:51:15,820
told me it was because I'm special and that it's okay.

772

And that I don't necessarily need to be the same

as other people.

774

that you possessed supervision.

they said I was just fooling around and lying.

778
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,370
But she wasn't like that.

779
00:51:39,370 --> 00:51:42,160
She listened to me seriously,

780

But it's obvious even if I wasn't there.

972
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:21,570
You probably used your supervision

973

to rake in all the treasures.

974
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:26,240
I told them where the treasure was hidden,

975
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:28,290
and gained some popularity.

976
01:06:28,290 --> 01:06:30,640
That's not even fair play.

977
01:06:31,780 --> 01:06:33,560
But...

978
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:35,710
it wasn't dangerous for you...

979
01:06:35,710 --> 01:06:37,780
to use your supervision back then?

980
01:06:37,780 --> 01:06:40,590
I realized after I got into the accident.

981
01:06:40,590 --> 01:06:44,680
Kwang Gi said I got into the accident while using my supervision.

982
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:48,400
So after that, I learned how to control using my supervision.

983
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:50,380
Accident?

984
01:06:50,380 --> 01:06:54,180
You got into an accident while looking at something?

That's difficult.

You should be careful from now on.

Would you like to try one?

It might be the contrary,

Does it taste like your mom's?

01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:09,560
I think you'd probably know better than I do.

the first time someone fed a kimbap to me.

1014

Oh, that's because I developed a habit of feeding Kwang Gi candy when we were younger.

We'll now start Eunkang Group's interim board meeting.

1047
01:11:06,550 --> 01:11:09,120
The Board of Directors has been convened because the absence

1048
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:12,240
of the CEO was deemed urgent.

Although he's still missing,

during the company's urgent situation,

1051

we can't leave Eunkang Group's executive seat vacant forever.

I agree.

1053
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:24,430
To be honest, after Chairman Eun Jae Seong passed away,

1054
01:11:24,430 --> 01:11:27,860
we appointed Vice Chairman Kang Wan Soo as Chairman,

1055
01:11:27,860 --> 01:11:31,770
but he gave that seat to Chairman Eun Seon Woo. Isn't that right?

1056
01:11:33,250 --> 01:11:37,500
I'm really sorry to the directors who trusted me and supported me.
