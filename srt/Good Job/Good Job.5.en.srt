I'm sorry.

498
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:48,550
I provided the wrong documents.

499
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:56,690
The person presiding over the meeting doesn't even know the order, takes it out on his subordinates,

500
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:59,060
and doesn't even realize he's an embarrassment.

501
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:01,360
Manager Kang,

502
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,860
having no knowledge in today's society...

503
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:06,220
is indeed a sin.

504
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:10,880
What?

505
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,310
Where did you find that ditzy intern of no use?

506
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:21,610
Get rid of her. I can't stand the sight of her.

507
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:24,510
Secretary Song quit, so you'll need her.

508
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:25,970
Leave her by your side.

509
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:27,680
Whatever.

510
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:42,000
I'm sorry.

511
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
It's hard, isn't it?

512
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,280
Everyone's like that at first.

513
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:49,890
Thank you for earlier, Assistant Kim.

514
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:53,600
You only need to remember a few things about Manager Kang.

515
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:58,520
Keep private calls from outside the company and unbooked visitors completely blocked.

516
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:02,410
As for work, the secretarial staff should handle as much as possible.

517
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,870
Oh, and...

518
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:07,790
besides answering when he asks a direct question...

519
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,340
- Right?
- Right.

520
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,940
You're well aware.

521
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:15,500
It's hard now, but you'll get the hang of it after a few days.

522
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,940
- Hang in there.
- Okay.

523
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:25,810
Se Ra, come here for a sec.

524
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:28,290
I heard you got an earful from Kang Ddo.

525
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:30,990
- Kang Ddo?
- Manager Kang Tae Joon.

526
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:34,340
He's Vice Chairman Kang Wan Soo's son, but he's also the son he gave up on.

527
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,980
He's called Kang Ddo amongst ourselves.

528
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:38,190
What a good thing to teach our rookie.

529
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:39,870
We just want her to be careful.

530
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:41,130
Of course.

531
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:44,880
So she doesn't become a frog that is killed by an inadvertently thrown stone.

532
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,110
Anyway, hang in there.

533
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:49,090
You saw earlier, right?

534
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:53,670
How Assistant Kim showed no sign of being flustered in front of Manager Kang.

535
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:56,100
He's a senior with quick wits.

536
00:36:56,100 --> 00:37:00,520
Assistant Kim always perfectly resolves whatever trouble Manager Kang creates...

537
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,670
sweetly.

538
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:03,560
You're all going to attend the welcome party, right?

539
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,250
A welcome party?

540
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:07,560
Director Hong said to throw a welcome party for new recruits,

541
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:10,170
so all interns must attend.

542
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:13,620
Se Ra, tell Assistant Kim he must come,

543
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:15,310
to today's welcome party.

544
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:16,870
He probably won't.

545
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:18,920
He never comes to company gatherings.

546
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:22,640
You must absolutely convince him to come, okay?

547
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,100
I'll do my best.

548
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,710
You must control yourself at work.

549
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:38,950
Are you giving me a warning?

550
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:40,820
Vice Chairman is brimming with worry.

551
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:42,240
I'll do as I please.

552
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,460
You should just focus on what I order you to do!

553
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:50,300
Assistant Kim Jae Ha...

554
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:53,720
is in charge of managing Kang Tae Joon's affairs?

555
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:03,570
Yang Jin Mo, please attach a tracking device to Kang Tae Joon's car.

556
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:05,870
I'll work on that now.

557
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:13,490
What brings you here to my room? Please sit here.

558
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:16,760
No, no. You should sit there, Chairman.

559
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,000
Director Hong, please sit, too.

560
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,190
I'm all right.

561
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:22,780
Okay, you prefer to be comfortable, huh?

562
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,480
From what Director Hong tells me,

563
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:28,900
you're turning down all marriage proposals?

564
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:31,790
Oh, I've been busy.

565
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:34,880
And I have no thoughts on getting married yet.

566
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,850
An owner's marriage affairs directly affect corporate management.

567
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:41,880
You must think about it strategically.

568
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,710
I know what you're trying to say, but

569
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:45,240
I still need to familiarize myself with corporate management.

570
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,090
You know that Seho Group

571
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:51,340
bought a stake in our Eunkang System before you took office. Right?

572
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:55,230
-Yes.
- If the two groups connect through marriage,

573
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:57,810
they will be a reliable resource.

574
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:02,770
I'll make plans soon,

575
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:06,670
so don't cancel for my sake, at least. Okay?

576
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,810
Director Hong, please take good care of him.

577
00:39:09,810 --> 00:39:11,670
Understood.

578
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:13,130
No, no.

579
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:14,560
No need to follow me out.

580
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,600
Have a nice day!

581
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,940
Then...

582
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:25,240
Director Hong?

583
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,700
Yes?

584
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:32,190
Are you happy that I'm being forced to go on blind dates?

585
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:33,340
No, I'm not.

586
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:35,690
There's a welcome party for the new interns,

587
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:38,180
so I'm just excited about that.

588
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:40,640
Oh, are you making fun of me right now?

589
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,590
Of course not.

590
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:44,440
At today's welcome party, just thinking about

591
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,350
what nice things I should say...

592
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:49,330
what juicy things I should say...

593
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:50,940
to the new interns

594
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:52,580
is making me excited.

595
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:54,960
I see...

596
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,290
Then...

597
00:39:56,890 --> 00:39:58,740
I'm so excited.

598
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,570
Look.

599
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:14,380
Look at this.

600
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:17,820
You saw it, right?

601
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:22,530
I don't know how in the world something like this could be found inside a cake.

602
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:24,860
A moment, please...

603
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:26,360
What is this?

604
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,230
It looks like a steel scrubber...

605
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:29,990
How should I know?

606
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:31,400
Anyway, the inside of my mouth

607
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:34,060
is a mess because of this. What will you do?

608
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:36,940
But there's no way this could've been inside.

609
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:39,060
We don't even use steel scrubbers,

610
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:43,660
and layer cakes are thinly spread out layer by layer with freaking— I mean...

611
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:46,390
scrapers, so there's no way that could've been inside.

612
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:47,900
Then you're saying...

613
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:50,340
that I'm lying right now?

614
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:56,280
Then I'll refund you the total amount of the cake.

615
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,100
- I'm sorry.
- Refund?

616
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,790
Are you talking out of your ass? What refund?

617
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,660
What do you see me as?

618
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:03,790
You took me too lightly.

619
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:05,650
I'll look into legal proceedings,

620
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:07,310
so prepare yourself.

621
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:11,110
You want to look into legal proceedings?

622
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:21,740
I'm Attorney Yang Jin Mo.

623
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:23,570
Look, a lawyer. Good thing you're here.

624
00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:24,780
Good thing I'm here.

625
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:27,340
I'm Miss Sa Na Hee's personal lawyer.

626
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:32,230
You're saying you're her lawyer?

627
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:37,240
Yes, I'll guide you through legal proceedings regarding what happened today.

628
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:40,600
Sir, exactly how badly did you get hurt?

629
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:46,000
Yes, Chairman?

630
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,020
I'm sorry.

631
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:51,200
I'm dealing with a case of suspected dissemination of false information and obstruction of business.

632
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,440
Hello?

633
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,950
All right. Yes.

634
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:57,250
Hey... Hey!

635
00:41:57,870 --> 00:41:59,660
You really just hung up on me?

636
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:01,030
Listen, you gentleman.

637
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:02,290
Dissemination of false information?

638
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:04,770
What the hell are you saying right now?

639
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:07,160
If it...

640
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:09,980
happens to be false information...

641
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:11,730
Article 314 of the Criminal Code.

642
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:14,630
"A person who obstructs business by force or disseminates false facts

643
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:19,000
shall be sentenced to up to five years in prison or fined up to 15 million won."

644
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:22,710
So, where and how does it hurt?

645
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:27,100
Then I'll...

646
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:31,380
try rubbing some ointment on it. I think it'll heal well.

647
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:35,000
Sir, then please keep me updated. Take care!

648
00:42:37,370 --> 00:42:38,990
Are you okay?

649
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:40,820
That was quite surprising, huh?

650
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,370
Diligently carrying out my primary job.

651
00:42:49,370 --> 00:42:51,170
I've attached the tracking device on his car.

652
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:52,700
Primary job?

653
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:55,400
So tail him on your own tonight.

654
00:42:55,890 --> 00:42:58,190
Yang Jin Mo...

655
00:42:58,190 --> 00:43:01,350
You're being very suspicious these days.

656
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,390
What the?

657
00:43:17,590 --> 00:43:20,100
The door is opening.

658
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:26,490
The door is closing.

659
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:42,290
So what's your impression about working as a secretary?

660
00:43:42,290 --> 00:43:43,690
Don Se Ra?

661
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:45,580
Yes. Oh...

662
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:47,740
I'm still very lacking,

663
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:50,530
and I hold great respect for my seniors.

664
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:53,510
It's not that you're lacking...

665
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:56,230
There's no one who can manage Kang Ddo—

666
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:02,780
There's a lot you learn when you meet a difficult boss.

667
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:05,090
And how you should hold yourself, too.

668
00:44:05,090 --> 00:44:07,680
That's true.

669
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,330
He's trying to discipline us again.

670
00:44:11,770 --> 00:44:14,320
Do you have a role model, Senior?

671
00:44:14,930 --> 00:44:16,640
Since the day...

672
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:20,390
I joined the company, I always...

673
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:23,300
Senior Jae Ha?

674
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:25,110
Of course, it's Assistant Kim!

675
00:44:25,110 --> 00:44:26,720
Me, too!

676
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,390
Jae Ha! Jae Ha!

677
00:44:28,390 --> 00:44:30,120
Jae Ha! Jae Ha!

678
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:31,650
Jae Ha! Jae Ha!

679
00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:34,090
Ma'am!

680
00:44:34,090 --> 00:44:35,650
How much do we owe you?

681
00:44:35,650 --> 00:44:37,310
Let's get up now.

682
00:44:37,310 --> 00:44:40,300
We drank a lot. Get up.

683
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:42,930
Get up.

684
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:50,330
The wine we drank last time.

685
00:44:50,330 --> 00:44:51,770
I ordered it again.

686
00:44:51,770 --> 00:44:54,440
I'm not in the mood to drink with you.

687
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:57,820
You're the one who called me here.

688
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:00,480
Are you just stupid, or do you just lack tact?

689
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:04,390
Then, why did you call me here when you told me not to even contact you?

690
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:09,210
You have a selfie from the last time we met at the club, right?

691
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:10,860
Give it to me.

692
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:12,870
What do you want with my selfie?

693
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:15,310
There's someone I need to find.

694
00:45:15,310 --> 00:45:17,210
Hand it over.

695
00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:22,270
By any chance, is it the rookie actress who came with me?

696
00:45:22,270 --> 00:45:24,560
That bitch? Are you interested in her?

697
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:27,120
Shut your mouth and just give me your phone!

698
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:31,030
What does Kang Tae Joon want with Don Se Ra's photo?

699
00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:33,320
By any chance...

700
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:36,530
the necklace Don Se Ra had on?

701
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:48,810
How does a wine bar sound for round two? Here.

702
00:45:48,810 --> 00:45:51,340
Oh, my. That place is really hot!

703
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:53,030
Is it going to be on you?

704
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:55,490
Wait, but didn't you say you were going home today?

705
00:45:55,490 --> 00:45:56,980
My dad's coming home late tonight.

706
00:45:56,980 --> 00:45:59,630
Your dad? Today?

707
00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:01,130
If not tonight,

708
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:03,630
when else would we be able to go to a high-end bar like that?

709
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:04,730
Let's go! Let's go, let's go!

710
00:46:04,730 --> 00:46:05,750
- Let's go, let's go!
- Let's go, let's go!

711
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:07,760
- Let's go!
- Then let's go!

712
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,310
- Go, go!
- Okay!

713
00:46:09,310 --> 00:46:12,350
Okay, today I'll—

714
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:16,450
Find her.

715
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:21,200
Understood.

716
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:32,040
Chairman Eun Seon Woo?

717
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,330
You're Chairman Eun Seon Woo, right?

718
00:46:37,490 --> 00:46:40,840
Do we... know each other?

719
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,540
We will know each other.

720
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:44,690
We've never been introduced to each other,

721
00:46:44,690 --> 00:46:48,140
but I've seen you a few times at events my father hosted.

722
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:50,970
Chairman Jang from Seho Group is my father.

723
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:52,840
Oh, I see.

724
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:54,640
Then, I'll take my leave.

725
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:56,740
Let's meet formally next time.

726
00:46:56,740 --> 00:46:58,090
Sure.

727
00:46:58,090 --> 00:47:01,200
Let's meet if we get the chance.

728
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:06,840
What are you doing here?

729
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:09,480
Are you tailing me?

730
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:10,750
Me?

731
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:14,300
I don't think we're friendly enough to meet outside and

732
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:16,520
share a conversation, are we?

733
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:18,730
How about we just continue on our way?

734
00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:20,520
Of course, we should.

735
00:47:21,110 --> 00:47:23,180
But why do I keep getting the feeling...

736
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:26,490
that you're following me?

737
00:47:34,010 --> 00:47:36,840
What are you still doing here?

738
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:39,490
As you can see, I'm having a drink.

739
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:42,720
We're not the best of friends,

740
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:45,340
so I'll just move somewhere else.

741
00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:47,350
Why?

742
00:47:47,350 --> 00:47:49,510
Are you afraid you'll get caught lying now?

743
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:50,610
[Director Hong]

744
00:47:50,610 --> 00:47:52,750
What lie?

745
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:58,210
Excuse... Chairman?

746
00:48:02,030 --> 00:48:05,840
Aigoo! Aigoo, Director Hong. Over here!

747
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:09,370
Wait! You really had plans?

748
00:48:09,370 --> 00:48:11,670
You even take care of the secretaries?

749
00:48:11,670 --> 00:48:14,030
This is the difference between you and me.

750
00:48:14,030 --> 00:48:17,180
Arranging get-togethers is one of my duties as well.

751
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:18,500
Director Hong,

752
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:20,600
you never mentioned this.

753
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:24,500
Why are they here, out of the blue?

754
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:27,510
He's an unpredictable man to begin with, so...

755
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:29,430
Why? Are you displeased?

756
00:48:29,430 --> 00:48:30,920
No!

757
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:34,120
Oh, Assistant Kim!

758
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:35,520
I had a good feeling about coming here.

759
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:37,810
I reserved that center seat over there.

760
00:48:37,810 --> 00:48:39,770
Please have a seat.

761
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:56,600
Long time, no see.

762
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:01,210
Hurry up with the glass.

763
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:03,980
Go, this instance!

764
00:49:06,370 --> 00:49:09,160
I... I'll take my leave now.

765
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:13,190
My secretary can't leave. Come on, sit down.

766
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:22,290
All right, since our glasses are full,

767
00:49:22,290 --> 00:49:24,470
let's empty them.

768
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:30,900
For Chairman Eun Seon Woo, who has arranged this dear gathering...

769
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:33,580
should I say something like this?

770
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:47,300
What the hell? You can't even read the atmosphere.

771
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:50,980
Don't you think you're the one who can't read the atmosphere?

772
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:54,170
I thought you only lacked tact in corporate meetings,

773
00:49:54,170 --> 00:49:57,250
but I guess you're the same in get-togethers.

774
00:49:57,250 --> 00:49:59,780
Everyone seems to be uncomfortable,

775
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:01,770
so why don't we take our leave?

776
00:50:01,770 --> 00:50:03,220
Director Hong?

777
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:05,310
Uncomfortable, my ass.

778
00:50:05,310 --> 00:50:07,020
Sit down.

779
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:08,850
All right, today...

780
00:50:08,850 --> 00:50:10,600
let's clean out all the drinks here

781
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:14,390
with Chairman Eun Seon Woo's card. Yeah?

782
00:50:14,390 --> 00:50:17,660
An extra glass for our new secretary.

783
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:19,260
Yes.

784
00:50:28,950 --> 00:50:32,710
What can we do to liven up the mood?

785
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,460
How about a round of Yaja Time?
(A game where honorifics and formal language are thrown out altogether)

786
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:38,810
Whoa! Yaja Time!

787
00:50:38,810 --> 00:50:40,430
- Okay!
- Yaja Time!

788
00:50:40,430 --> 00:50:44,660
Goodness gracious, that's old. It's old, but I like it.

789
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:47,720
Tae Joon, it must be fun.
(Spoken informally)

790
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:52,020
Why does Kang Ddo act like Kang Dddo even at a get-together?

791
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:53,130
Kang Ddo?

792
00:50:53,130 --> 00:50:54,710
Manager Kang...

793
00:50:54,710 --> 00:50:56,880
Kang Ddo...

794
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,810
How amusing.

795
00:50:58,810 --> 00:51:00,960
Kang Ddo?

796
00:51:03,190 --> 00:51:05,370
How fun.

797
00:51:05,370 --> 00:51:08,230
I think it'll be fun at work tomorrow, too.

798
00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:09,920
Kang Ddo!

799
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:12,360
Again, again, again!
(Ddo also means "again")

800
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:15,770
Hey! I admit you're good-looking,

801
00:51:15,770 --> 00:51:18,480
but you need to fix that temper of yours.

802
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,850
A get-together is a get-together!

803
00:51:20,850 --> 00:51:23,160
Stop abusing your power, Mr. Superior!

804
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:25,900
Oh, Senior must be drunk.

805
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:27,270
I'm not drunk.

806
00:51:27,270 --> 00:51:29,410
No, no, no. Let her be.

807
00:51:29,410 --> 00:51:31,190
Let her continue.

808
00:51:31,190 --> 00:51:33,850
Assistant Kim!

809
00:51:33,850 --> 00:51:38,210
Why are you so silent when we're drinking?

810
00:51:38,210 --> 00:51:42,460
Can I ask you a question?

811
00:51:43,070 --> 00:51:48,270
Do you have a girlfriend... or not?

812
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:53,010
Why aren't you answering?

813
00:51:53,010 --> 00:51:55,340
- Speak up, speak up.
- This is nuts.

814
00:51:55,340 --> 00:51:57,380
Hey!

815
00:51:57,950 --> 00:52:03,660
You talk way too much. I didn't ask you!

816
00:52:04,550 --> 00:52:08,740
Geez! This might be a get-together, but still...

817
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:11,730
And you, too, punk.

818
00:52:11,730 --> 00:52:17,060
Kang Ddo! Why do you never listen?

819
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:20,820
What the hell is Kang Ddo?

820
00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:22,150
Guess what it means!

821
00:52:22,150 --> 00:52:23,180
What it means!

822
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:25,130
That's enough.

823
00:52:25,130 --> 00:52:28,900
Manager Kang Tae Joon, nutcase.
(Ddo-rai is slang for lunatic in Korean)

824
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:31,760
Kang... Ddo!

825
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:33,990
Bingo!

826
00:52:39,370 --> 00:52:43,240
Oh, my gosh. Gosh.

827
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:46,250
Hey, can't you see my glass is empty?

828
00:52:46,820 --> 00:52:48,230
Pardon?

829
00:52:50,590 --> 00:52:52,970
I'll pour you a drink, Sir.

830
00:52:58,070 --> 00:53:02,030
As expected of Assistant Kim to care about me like this.

831
00:53:02,030 --> 00:53:06,430
I almost discourteously made a woman pour me a drink.

832
00:53:13,130 --> 00:53:16,990
Receive a glass from me. You have no problem with that, right?

833
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:20,800
Thank you.

834
00:53:31,570 --> 00:53:32,880
Let's go!

835
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:35,450
- Please take care of the rest!
- Okay.

836
00:53:35,450 --> 00:53:36,780
Goodbye!

837
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:40,600
- Careful, careful!
- No problem!

838
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:44,770
Why did you drink so much? Wait, it's this car.

839
00:53:44,770 --> 00:53:45,900
Get home safely!

840
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:47,390
Okay.

841
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:55,660
From now on, if possible... let's not butt in on staff get-togethers, Kang Ddo.

842
00:53:55,660 --> 00:53:56,800
That little...

843
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,410
Manager Kang.

844
00:54:06,170 --> 00:54:09,180
You must be happy you're so popular.

845
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:10,970
Get home safely, Sir.

846
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:21,260
Why is the taxi fare so expensive?

847
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:23,680
What is she still doing there?

848
00:54:25,190 --> 00:54:27,490
Se Ra, are you all right?

849
00:54:27,490 --> 00:54:28,540
Yes.

850
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:30,200
Why is Assistant Kim...

851
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:32,330
If you're headed toward the bakery,

852
00:54:32,330 --> 00:54:34,420
I can drop you off on the way. Do you want to ride with me?

853
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:36,830
How did you know?

854
00:54:36,830 --> 00:54:39,780
We've met at the bakery before.

855
00:54:40,370 --> 00:54:43,780
She can't even hold her drink. What if she gets caught?

856
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:46,660
No wonder you looked familiar.

857
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:48,050
- Let's go.
- Oh.

858
00:54:48,050 --> 00:54:50,760
It's okay. I need to sober up, so... I'll walk.

859
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:53,180
Why are they talking for so long?

860
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:54,580
Then get home safely.

861
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:56,020
Okay.

862
00:54:57,950 --> 00:55:00,460
Goodbye!

863
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:06,540
Gosh, Don Se Ra.

864
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:11,070
Whatever! Whatever. Let's go.

865
00:55:13,990 --> 00:55:18,250
Mr. Ground, please don't come at me.

866
00:55:18,250 --> 00:55:20,670
Please don't.

867
00:55:20,670 --> 00:55:23,290
The place is swarming with taxis, but why isn't she riding one?

868
00:55:23,290 --> 00:55:25,500
Is she planning to walk home?

869
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:32,590
Mr. Tree? Please excuse me.

870
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:37,770
Look at her. My goodness.

871
00:55:38,740 --> 00:55:41,680
She's not a child. She'll find her way home.

872
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:43,870
Whatever, I'm leaving!

873
00:55:44,930 --> 00:55:49,330
Why did you drink so much, Don Se Ra?

874
00:55:54,890 --> 00:55:58,990
What the? What the? Don Se Ra.

875
00:55:58,990 --> 00:56:01,180
Wait! Where'd she go?

876
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:04,590
Geez, she's really making me worry.

877
00:56:07,010 --> 00:56:11,600
Okay, I'm only worried about her as her employer.

878
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:15,130
I would've done the same for anyone, not just Don Se Ra. Right?

879
00:56:15,130 --> 00:56:17,740
My good, Don Se Ra.

880
00:56:24,270 --> 00:56:28,370
Don Se Ra! What are you doing?

881
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:38,470
Hey, why would you sit there? You need to go home!

882
00:56:38,470 --> 00:56:41,860
The buses aren't running now. Gosh! I shouldn't have followed her.

883
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:45,390
My caring heart is the problem.

884
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:49,360
Don't. Don't do that.

885
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:52,490
Don't! That's not good. Not good.

886
00:56:58,330 --> 00:57:01,860
Hey, hey, hey! Why are you lying down here?

887
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:05,880
Don Se Ra, have you really gone insane? Wake up!

888
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:10,700
You need to wake up. Put your shoes on. You're not home.

889
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:13,710
Na Hee, you just got home?

890
00:57:13,710 --> 00:57:18,620
Na Hee, listen. That bastard...

891
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:24,320
shoved me into the lion's den. I almost died...

892
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:29,720
That bastard? Me? Lion's den?

893
00:57:32,170 --> 00:57:35,220
How will you face me tomorrow?

894
00:57:39,210 --> 00:57:42,630
Stay still. Don't move, okay?

895
00:57:47,010 --> 00:57:50,090
Put this on. Why would you take your shoes off?

896
00:57:50,090 --> 00:57:52,450
Gosh, you're such a handful.

897
00:57:52,450 --> 00:57:54,970
Stop. Why would I wear shoes at home?

898
00:57:54,970 --> 00:57:57,990
You need to wear your shoes since you're home.

899
00:57:57,990 --> 00:57:59,210
I don't understand.

900
00:57:59,210 --> 00:58:00,830

So cozy.

903
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:16,270
You're doing this on purpose, aren't you?

904
00:58:16,270 --> 00:58:18,880
Stay still, or you're going to fall.

905
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:23,600
Na Hee's back is so manly!

906
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:26,770
I'm manly!

907
00:58:30,970 --> 00:58:33,120
Why is it so steep?

908
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:40,030

00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:50,370

Why is your face so flattened?

914
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:17,380
Hold on.

915
00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:23,060
Looking at you this way, you look a lot like the person I know.

916
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:26,930

No... Eun Ddo!

919

Eun Ddo?

925

Am I dreaming?

926
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:07,190
I keep hearing Eun Ddo's voice somewhere...

927
01:00:07,190 --> 01:00:11,240
Is he here to catch me? Na Hee!

928
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:15,320
Tell him I'm not here! I'm scared!

929
01:00:19,530 --> 01:00:24,210
Fine. Sleep tight, okay? Tight!

930
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:34,090
