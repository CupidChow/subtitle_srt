00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:56,470
So handsome.

5
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:57,560
Look at him.

6
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:58,190
Look.

7
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:59,300
That guy.

8
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:00,270
Who is he?

9
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,259
He's so handsome.

10
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,310
Look.

11
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:04,350
So handsome.

12
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:05,880
Elegant too.

13
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:06,640
Follow him.

14
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:13,530
Greetings, Boss.

15
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:15,900
Hello, ladies.

16
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,670
-Hello.
-Hello.

17
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,210
Get a grip.

18
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:22,920
Young man,

19
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,510
you're so handsome.

20
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:25,600
I'm Liu Ruoqian,

21
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,680
an Imperial Academy student.

22
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:29,490
Imperial Academy!

23
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:31,590
You're an Imperial Academy student?

24
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:33,130
You must know how to read.

25
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,579
I know a bit.

26
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:35,600
Then

27
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,850
read this recruitment notice

28
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:38,800
for me.

29
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:41,870
Blossom Beauty's hiring

30
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:42,310
women...

31
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:42,910
Stop.

32
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:44,270
Women.

33
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:46,280
Only female workers.

34
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:48,120
That's because

35
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,710
you haven't

36
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,150
met me yet.

37
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,650
Yes, yes, yes.

38
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:56,230
I still only hire women.

39
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,270
Blossom Beauty wants

40
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,030
considerate workers who'll satisfy

41
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:01,950
customers,

42
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:03,500
right?

43
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,440
If I can do that

44
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:13,170
or

45
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:15,540
be better than other women,

46
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:18,360
do you still insist on

47
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,420
only hiring women?

48
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:23,390
Buddy.

49
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,190
Look.

50
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,320
I only have female customers.

51
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,810
The considerate service you said

52
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:30,690
is impossible

53
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,310
as men and women shouldn't be intimate,

54
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:33,950
right?

55
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,610
I have a clear

56
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:38,040
conscience.

57
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:39,540
Nonsense!

58
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,800
We don't mind.

59
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:42,020
-Yes, we don't mind.
-Yes, we don't mind.

60
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,620
-We don't mind.
-We don't mind.

61
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:44,660
Let me tell you.

62
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:47,030
Our shop has its principles.

63
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:48,440
Principles are set by people.

64
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,310
Just change them.

65
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:50,910
Boss.

66
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:51,980
Look.

67
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:54,210
Look at what the ladies said.

68
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,220
They're all open-minded.

69
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:57,740
The only one against it

70
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:58,630
is you.

71
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,310
If you

72
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,350
really have concerns,

73
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,440
I can dress up as a woman

74
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,720
in front of you.

75
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:16,170
Is this appropriate?

76
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,580
So appropriate.

77
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,630
-So appropriate.
-So appropriate.

78
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:20,830
Boss.

79
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:22,209
I’m determined

80
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:23,350
to get this job.

81
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,769
My biggest strength

82
00:04:24,769 --> 00:04:25,930
is persistence.

83
00:04:26,029 --> 00:04:27,190
Then I'll refuse you

84
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:27,920
persistently.

85
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,830
Then I'll visit daily,

86
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:29,580
persistently.

87
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:29,920
You...

88
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,450
I'll work for free

89
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:31,710
during the probation.

90
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:32,670
Is that

91
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:33,670
sincere enough?

92
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:34,590
You'll...

93
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:36,740
work for free?

94
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,080
I'll consider it.

95
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,030
For how long?

00:04:40,909 --> 00:04:44,780

A word, please.

101
00:04:59,409 --> 00:05:00,540
Is everything okay?

102
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:03,400
Is there trouble?

103
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,130
Don't panic.

104

Mr. Jiang's here

105
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:06,750
to congratulate me

106

on my opening.

107

the new products.

Take a look around.

110
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:31,990
If you yell

111
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:33,740
so sternly at my shop,

112
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:34,670
it'll seem like

113
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:36,310
I offended the Inspection Office.

114
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:36,950
It'll

115
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:38,690
scare my customers away.

116
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:40,080
If you don’t

117
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:41,110
want to offend us,

118
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,270
don't hire Liu Ruoqian.

119
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:44,030
Why?

120
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:44,880
You should know

121
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,340
he worked in Ghost Market,

122
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,310
so it's clear

123
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:48,400
who his boss was.

124
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,790
I know.

125
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,020
But his boss is guilty,

126
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,010
not him.

127
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,480
I hope he wasn't involved.

128
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,970
But you can't be sure

129
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:58,230
or guarantee it.

130
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:00,040
So,

131
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:01,590
don't hire him first.

132
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,300
Wait till I figure it out.

133
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:05,030
Come back.

Hey.

do things?

to people

139
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:12,930
like we're suspects.

140
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,990
I-I won't argue with you.

141

But this time,

142
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:18,590
you must trust me.

143
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,560
Why should I?

144
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:22,640
I'm the one hiring.

145
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:23,420
Besides,

146
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:24,490
he seems nice.

147
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:26,090
Even working for free.

148
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,360
Mr. Liu, check this out for me.

149
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:37,960

It's for whitening.

00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:47,340
She doesn't look like

359
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,270
a troublemaker.

360
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,470
How about this?

361
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,490
Let her work to offset her debt.

362
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:53,660
Aren't we

363
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,680
short of workers?

364
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,760
She seems quite smart.

365
00:13:58,790 --> 00:13:59,550
Work?

366
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,190
I may look like this,

367
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:02,180
but I'm very strong.

368
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,460
I know you're strong.

369
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,180
Since Mr. Lan asked,

370
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,220
you can

371
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,470
stay here to work.

372
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:09,390
I'm leaving. Let's go!

373
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,310
Well...

374
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:41,550
Bravo!

375
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:44,430
Bravo!

376
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:47,900
Your Grace,

377
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,370
it's my honor to have you at Longxin Teahouse.

378
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:51,630
I’m waiting for Shang.

379
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:52,890
Don’t bother about me.

380
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,540
Your Grace.

381
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,730
It's dangerous for a noble like you

382
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:58,880
[Li Wufang]

383
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,530
with all sorts of people here.

384
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:00,410
Let me arrange a temporary guard

385
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:01,330
for you.

386
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,190
Temporary guard?

387
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:05,350
Tong Sai'er.

388
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:07,460
Yes!

389
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:14,440
What can I do for you?

390
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:15,710
A task for you.

391
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,640
Take good care of this guest.

392
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,250
Don't let anyone bully her.

393
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:21,650
If anyone tries to be unruly,

394
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:23,040
teach them a lesson.

395
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:23,660
Yes.

396
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,680
If you take good care of her today,

397
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:27,550
I'll consider you for

398
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:28,960
full-time employment.

399
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:31,170
Boss.

400
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:32,390
Alright.

401
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,720
Take care of this distinguished guest.

402
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,720
Enjoy the tea and opera.

403
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:08,630
Ms. Yan.

404
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:11,390
You have

405
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:13,010
a good appetite as usual.

406
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,600
Your shop's now famous in the capital,

407
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,230
but you still

408
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:17,630
took the time to eat here.

409
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:19,250
Any wise words today?

410
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:20,610
Have this too.

411
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:23,360
Buddy.

412
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:24,890
The Mr. Cao

413
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:26,620
you introduced to me

414
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:28,300
can't be found.

415
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:31,210
I heard he's also a crook.

416
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:32,630
Who would've known?

417
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,920
Any other informants

418
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:36,910
in the capital?

419
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:39,880
There's one more place.

420
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,220
But...

421
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:42,940
What?

422
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,740
But its nature

423
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:47,220
is different from Ghost Market.

424
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:49,900
Elaborate.

425
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:54,290
Longxin Teahouse,

426
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:55,510
exclusive to

427
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,120
officials and nobles.

428
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:01,190
Commoners

429
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:02,420
can't enter?

430
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:05,550
Longxin Teahouse's boss comes from

431
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:06,530
a prominent family.

432
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:08,310
He has countless businesses

433
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:09,460
just in the capital.

434
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:10,630
Their fruits

435
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:11,270
and tea

436
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:12,220
are costly.

437
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:13,380
Commoners

438
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:14,470
can't afford them.

439
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:16,349
Like the Moon River tea

440
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:17,369
exclusive to them

441
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:19,760
is the cream of the crop.

442

If I get there,

443
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,160
who should I

444
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:23,750
look for to get info?

445
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:24,770
Well...

446
00:17:25,609 --> 00:17:26,609
It's hard to say.

447
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:32,420
Got it.

448
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,050
On days with

449
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,350
the number 8,

450
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,990
an informant will be

451
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,430
selling info there.

452
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:42,780
Number 8?

453
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,460
Isn't it the 28th today?

454
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,020
Yes.

455

456

come talk to you.

460
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,040
It's a complex symbol.

461

Let me tell you.

462
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,070
It's top secret.

463

00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:22,650
Your Grace.

537
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,710
What happened last time

538
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:27,160
was an accident.

539
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,150
I didn't mean

540
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:30,100
to tease you.

541
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:31,360
Here.

542
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:32,470
Have some tea.

543
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,610
I haven't touched this cup.

544
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:37,180
This cup of tea

545
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,040
isn't enough to make amends.

546
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:41,930
How about this?

547
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:42,610
I run

548
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,200
a cosmetics shop,

549
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:45,160
Blossom Beauty.

550
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,330
I'll give you

551
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:48,950
a 50% discount for life.

552
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,380
I don’t care for that.

553
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:53,750
You know

554
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:55,510
you offended me.

555
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:56,670
It's

556
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,300
child's play for me to kick you out

557
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,540
of the capital.

558
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:04,030
Since you are here,

559
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:05,920
Your Grace...

560
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,360
Why don't you show me the way?

561
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:13,310
There is a way.

562
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,280
What’s your relationship

563
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:17,730
with Jiang Xinbai?

564
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:20,600
Why are you shocked?

565
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:22,870
With Mr. Jiang skills,

566
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:24,670
how could you abduct him?

567
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:26,510
Do you think I'm a fool?

568
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:33,620
You and Jiang Xinbai

569
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:36,310
are either close

570
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,620
or...

571
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:40,610
you have something on him.

572
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:45,310
Jiang Xinbai.

573
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,860
You sure are a character.

574
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:49,090
You even have a feud with your sister.

575
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:52,100
Does she not know

576
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,040
Xinbai's face blind?

577
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:56,880
How can I leverage this?

578
00:22:57,570 --> 00:22:58,430
Say something.

579
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:01,990
Your Grace.

580
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,030
You and Mr. Jiang

581
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,290
are siblings.

582
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:06,450
Just ask

583
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:08,450
your brother directly.

584
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:09,740
Why make it difficult

585
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:11,000
for a commoner like me?

586
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:16,710
Go home

587
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:18,130
and put in some effort.

588
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,570
It's best to

589
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:20,590
simplify things.

590
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:22,680
Is that a threat?

591
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:24,230
N-No.

592
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:26,470
Did you tell Xinbai

593
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,010
what I told you that day?

594
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:28,840
No.

595
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:30,700
Really?

596
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,150
Yes.

597
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:36,610
I shall take my leave.

598
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:38,820
I'm not done yet.

599
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:41,110
Stop there!

600
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:55,970
Wait.

601
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:57,590
Don't you recall meeting at Ghost Market?

602
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:58,650
I even praised you.

603
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:38,950
How lively.

604
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:43,890
Commander Shang.

605
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:45,000
Save me.

606
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:49,210
Who are you?

607
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:50,510
How arrogant.

608
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:53,190
I am Jinwu Guards' commander-in-chief,

609
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:54,030
Shang Bieli.

610
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,030
Who are you?

611
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:58,600
I'm Tong Sai'er.

612
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:00,710
A foreigner?

613
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:03,100
You'll still get the same treatment.

614
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,290
Your crimes will be

615
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:06,300
punished accordingly!

616
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:07,450
Stop!

617
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:08,720
My lord.

618
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:10,850
Mr. Shang.

619
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:15,420
Oh no.

620
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,680
Will Jinwu Guards

621
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,730
arrest us?

622
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,280
Commander Shang.

623
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,800
My buddy and I were just

624
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:22,720
messing around.

625
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,120
It's not a private fight.

626
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:25,230
Right, buddy?

627
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,120
Say something.

628
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:28,870
Buddy!

629
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:31,670
Why is he so strange?

630
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,260
He's even wearing a mask.

631
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:35,090
Is he my Young Sir?

632
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,480
Let's take a look.

633
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:46,850
Is this a joke too?

634
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:49,510
She's just playful...

635
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:51,830
Public disturbance!

636
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:52,570
Arrest her!

637
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:53,210
Yes!

638
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:00,230
Good buddies, right?

639
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,200
Not really...

640
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:03,630
Arrest her too!

641
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:10,120
Suoluo.

642
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:11,230
I'm busy.

643
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:12,390
I'll meet you

644
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:13,500
another day.

645
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:14,550
Mr. Shang.

646
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,880
I've verified it.

647
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:18,630
Yan Nanxing did

648
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:20,310
go to Heman then.

649
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,040
So I caught

650
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:24,750
the right person.

651
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:26,470
Let's wait and see

652
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,610
if Xinbai

653
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:29,110
will come pick her up.

654
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:56,830
What's with

655
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:57,960
the ruckus outside?

656
00:26:58,230 --> 00:26:59,380
Why was Xinbai's

657
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:00,290
abductor here?

658
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:02,600
Is this place unsafe?

659
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:04,370
Shang Bieli took my money.

660
00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:06,740
He won't let anything happen to me.

661
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:08,310
Jiang Xinbai...

662
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:11,150
is clinging to me

663
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:12,060
like a leech.

664
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:13,410
Mr. Li.

665
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,570
Why don't you

666
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,120
send me out of the capital?

667
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:17,800
Don't worry.

668
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,540
I'll arrange it soon.

669
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:22,700
[Jinwu Guards]

670
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:30,940
Bro!

671
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:32,230
Here, here, here.

672
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:35,240
Well, it was a misunderstanding

673
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,400
today.

674
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,160
In the martial world...

675
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:38,790
So noisy!

676
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:39,630
Shut up!

677
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:47,310
Buddy.

678
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:49,030
Buddy...

679
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,100
He has a bad temper.

680
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,270
Let me explain...

681
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,030
Cut the crap!

682
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:01,970
Forget it.

683
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:06,350
I'll spend the night behind bars.

684
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:18,880
I mean,

685
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:21,080
with your skills

686
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:23,060
and temper outside,

687
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:24,660
I thought you

688
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:25,770
were a heroine.

689
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:27,470
You're scared just

690
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:29,590
by being in prison.

691
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:33,160
W-What's wrong?

692
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:38,920
That's not why I'm crying.

693
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:41,100
Then why are you crying?

694
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,680
How dare you ask me?

695
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:43,820
Fine.

696
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,470
I shouldn't ask you.

697
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:46,780
Even if you're

698
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:47,910
not sleeping,

699
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:49,350
I'm going to sleep.

700
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:50,550
Please cry

701
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:51,370
quietly.

702
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,920
I...

703
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:56,620
How dare you sleep?

704
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:57,460
Get up!

705
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,480
Get up!

706
00:28:59,190 --> 00:28:59,790
Stand up!

707
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:00,310
You...

708
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:00,940
-Hurry!
-What do you want?

709
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,690
-Get up!
-What do you want?

710
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:04,290
I want compensation!

711
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:07,580
What's there to compensate for a portrait?

712
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:10,590
Will you pay me?

713
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:12,450
-Will you pay me?
-You…

714
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,950
-Will you pay me?
-What are you doing?

715
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:14,670
Yes, yes.

716
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:16,190
I'll pay, happy?

717
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:17,320
I'll pay.

718
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:18,870
Let me tell you.

719
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:20,700
I have

720
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,530
magical hands.

721
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,630
Not just a portrait;

722
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:25,960
it'd only take me 15 mins

723
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:27,060
to fix

724
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:28,260
a person's face.

725
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:29,670
Really?

726
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,400
Of course.

727
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:33,010
Well, my name's Yan Nanxing.

728
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:33,840
And you?

729
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:34,950
Tong Sai'er!

730
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:36,770
Tong Sai'er.

731
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,310
What a nice name.

732
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:40,670
Well,

733
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:42,120
who's it in

734
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,300
that portrait?

735
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,600
Why are you...

736
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:58,160
suddenly silent?

737
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:00,950
Didn't you ask me

738
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:02,110
to fix the portrait?

739
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,480
If I don't know who it is,

740
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,520
how'd I fix it?

741
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:11,710
Fine.

742
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:13,960
Forget it.

743
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:16,330
I'm unlucky enough today.

744
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,250
Let's talk about

745
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,880
your troubles later.

746
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:24,620
You said you'd

747
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:25,320
fix it for me.

748
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:25,890
Tell me

749
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:26,830
how you'd fix it.

750
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,600
Sai'er.

751
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:31,150
Here's the thing.

752
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:31,790
Look.

753
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,900
To fix the portrait,

754
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,300
we've to get out first.

755
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:36,940
How can we fix it

756
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:37,930
in here?

757
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:41,010
Then how do we get out?

758
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:42,810
How?

759
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:45,430
How?

760
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:47,470
Good question.

761
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:00,400
Poison Girl.

762
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:01,590
We meet again.

763
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:06,030
Why are you here?

764
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:07,850
Here to get me out?

765
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:08,710
What else?

766
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:10,510
Would I stay here myself?

767
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:11,350
Let's go.

768
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:11,830
Okay.

769
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:13,950
Miss.

770
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,270
Who are you?

771
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:16,830
Tong Sai'er.

772
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:17,980
Tong...

773
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:20,580
You and her...

774
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:21,750
Actually,

775
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:23,060
we aren't close.

776
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:26,180
We're very close.

777
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,130
You promised

778
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:29,190
to fix my portrait.

779
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:30,350
Ms. Yan.

780
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:32,350
Mr. Jiang said

781
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:33,820
to take you away.

782
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:35,630
Just you.

783
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:39,370
It's an emergency.

784
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:40,730
She's like

785
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:41,910
a freebie.

786
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:43,150
Please.

787
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,260
Do you think this is your home?

788
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:47,370
This is Jinwu Guards' prison.

789
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:48,450
They're our

790
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,280
arch enemies.

791
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:51,770
I'm overstepping bounds to take you out.

792
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:54,310
If it's too hard for you,

793
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,110
I won't go out.

794
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:59,350
Looking for me?

795
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:00,970
How could you threaten me?

796
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:02,880
Thanks. Let’s go.

797
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:11,990
My lord.

798
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:13,020
She's here.

799
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:20,730
Thank you

800
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:22,390
for saving us.

801
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:24,800
Yan Nanxing.

802
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,630
You must be crazy

803
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:29,130
to break into Jinwu Guards' prison.

804
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,510
I didn't!

805
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:32,220
They arrested me.

806
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:33,920
How many times

807
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:35,680
have you endangered yourself?

808
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:36,840
Do you have

809
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,810
multiple lives?

810
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,400
Don't worry about me.

811
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,150
Just don't drag me

812
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:43,400
into your perils.

813
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:44,710
You...

814
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:53,070
Mr. Jiang.

815
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,010
Taking someone from my prison

816
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,740
without saying goodbye?

817
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:02,310
And yet

818
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:03,520
you still came.

819
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:08,730
I've never seen you

820
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:11,020
so anxious about a woman.

821
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:13,510
Are you bewitched?

822
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,400
How do I look

823
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:16,430
anxious?

824
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:22,240
Aren't you?

825
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,710
In that case,

826
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,720
I'd like to see

827
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,600
my...

828
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,150
Why are you

829
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:35,830
so rude?

830
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:36,550
You haven't

831
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:37,180
apologized to me.

832
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:38,580
Now you're bullying her.

833
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:44,530
I'll scold him for you.

834
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:46,150
You...

835
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:48,340
Y-Y-You? Are you serious?

836
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,330
Aren't you ashamed

837
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:50,130
bullying two frail ladies

838
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:50,750
as a grown man?

839
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:51,470
Listen.

840
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:52,670
Bully us again

841
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:53,820
and I'll... I'll...

842
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,320
get you arrested!

843
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:01,000
Let's go.

844
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:03,770
Get you arrested!

845
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:10,010
Did I hear it right?

846
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:12,150
Get me arrested?

847
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:15,870
Report to you or me?

848
00:34:18,469 --> 00:34:20,730
She can report to the Inspection Office.

849
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,480
Fresh candied haws!

850
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:30,280
Candied haws!

851
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,250
How much is it?

852
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,080
Five coppers.

853
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:33,610
Here.

854
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,199
Five coppers for one.

855
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,260
Forget it.

856
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:14,030
I...

857
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:22,910
Boss.

858
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:23,810
You're back.

859
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:24,470
Yes.

860
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,560
With a little tail.

861
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,860
It's really a little tail.

862
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,440
This little tail

863
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:50,310
is amazing.

864
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,080
If the portrait's not fixed,

865
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,010
she won't leave.

866
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:54,010
A portrait?

867
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:55,850
What portrait?

868
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:57,070
Shall I draw another one

869
00:35:57,070 --> 00:35:57,840
for you?

870
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,840
R-Ruoqian, hold this for me.

871
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:02,220
I'll be back soon.

872
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:03,370
Wait, wait, wait.

873
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:04,620
My shop is here.

874
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:05,310
I won't run.

875
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,170
I...

876
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:08,350
Hello.

877
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:09,560
I'm Liu Ruoqian.

878
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,550
What's your name, Little Tail?

879
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:12,690
What little tail?

880
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,240
I have a name.

881
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,390
I'm Tong Sai'er.

882
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:19,300
Tong Sai'er.

883
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:26,060
What's wrong?

884
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,160
A thank you isn't enough?

885
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,740
You even came to me.

886
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,100
Why did you go to Longxin Teahouse

887
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:35,030
yesterday?

888
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:36,660
Is it

889
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,430
related to the person

890
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:39,630
you were looking for?

891
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,520
Jiang Xinbai and Jinwu Guards don't get along.

892
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:43,960
What if Young Sir's

893
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,240
really a Jinwu Guard?

894
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,000
He'll ruin things.

895
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:48,400
No.

896
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,350
I heard

897
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:51,440
Longxin Teahouse's

898
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,690
Moon River tea's delicious.

899
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:53,570
I went to try it.

900
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:55,640
Who knew I'd run into

901
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:57,490
someone I didn't want to meet.

902
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,440
Are you

903
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:00,870
referring to

904
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,100
Shang Bieli

905
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:03,550
or Suoluo?

906
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:05,990
Why ask when you already know?

907
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:09,710
Yan Nanxing.

908
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:12,670
Don't mess with

909
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:13,800
either of them.

910
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:15,350
I can't always

911
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:17,040
be by your side to protect you.

912
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:18,330
Mr. Jiang.

913
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:20,190
Why do you still not get it?

914
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:21,590
It's because

915
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:22,820
you're always around me

916
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:24,250
that I'm in danger.

917
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,390
Without you around,

918
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,470
I might even

919
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:29,040
get along well with them.

920
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:31,680
So I'm hindering you

921
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:33,310
from making friends?

922
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:35,700
I dare not

923
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:37,120
make friends again

924
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:38,410
for the rest of my life.

925
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:45,840
Yan Nanxing.

926
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:48,320
It's fine if you don't

927
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,320
see me as a friend.

928
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,190
But I told myself

929
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:52,550
I must

930
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:53,590
protect you

931
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:55,170
if I run into you again.

932
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:58,350
It's my promise to myself.

933
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,010
It has nothing to do with

934
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:01,860
your appreciation.

935
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:05,310
Ridiculous.

936
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:07,350
What appreciation?

937
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:08,900
My lord means

938
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,250
you can't refuse his kindness toward you.

939
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,380
Nonsense!

940
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,970
He's just stubborn.

941
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:20,280
Will it kill you to apologize?

942
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:27,050
A vertical stroke.

943
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:28,800
A left-falling stroke.

944
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:29,710
Yes.

945
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:30,670
A right-falling stroke.

946
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:31,430
A dot.

947
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:33,130
A vertical stroke.

948
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:34,350
A left-falling stroke.

949
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:35,590
A right-falling stroke.

950
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:36,150
Yes.

951
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,770
The word "heart" below.

952
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:39,390
A dot. A right curve and hook.

953
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:41,870
Yes.

954
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:44,800
This is the word "Blossom" in Blossom Beauty.

955
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:47,930
Blossom... Beauty.

956
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:50,990
Yes.

957
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:52,430
Try it again.

958
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,110
Okay.

959
00:38:58,950 --> 00:38:59,720
Boss!

960
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:02,310
Boss.

961
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:03,600
Boss, look.

962
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:05,750
Ruoqian taught me to read and write,

963
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:06,770
and told me the names of

964
00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:07,830
all your products.

965
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,640
I just wrote this. Look.

966
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:16,380
You sure like

967
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:18,160
calling me Boss.

968
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:23,270
Boss.

969
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:24,830
Sai'er's very smart.

970
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:26,230
A quick learner.

971
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,190
She's illiterate,

972
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:29,150
but she grew up

973
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:30,230
in the mountains

974
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:32,580
and know all kinds of plants and spices.

975
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:33,420
She knows more than

976
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:35,080
I've learnt in medical books.

977
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:38,420
Salves are

978
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,270
identified by their main ingredients.

979
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:41,150
Sai'er can identify them

980
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:41,880
with a whiff.

981
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:43,490
Even I have to

982
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:44,450
consult her.

983
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,640
This is the Seven White Cream.

984
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:54,300
Its main ingredients include Angelica dahurica,

985
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,490
Atractylodes macrocephala, Ampelopsis japonica, Aconite,

986
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:56,450
and Poria cocos.

987
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:57,800
Its main function is...

988
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:01,670
It is...

989
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:03,500
Nourishing the skin.

990
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:04,150
Yes.

991
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:05,870
Nourishing the skin.

992
00:40:06,290 --> 00:40:07,400
It helps lighten

993
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:08,420
dull skin.

994
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,950
In short, it's for

995
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:11,670
whitening, right?

996
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:13,440
Try one more.

997
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:15,770
This is

998
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,650
Fairy Powder.

999
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:18,830
Its main ingredient is Motherwort.

1000
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:19,590
Function?

1001
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,530
This little girl

1002
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,400
can guess nearly

1003
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:23,360
the full formula

1004
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:24,290
with a whiff.

1005
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,090
She's quite eloquent too.

1006
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:28,550
She even remembers so many herbs.

1007
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:30,360
One of you's uncouth

1008
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:32,160
while the other's refined.

1009
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,400
You get along well.

1010
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:35,830
Sai'er.

1011
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:37,150
I need time

1012
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:38,890
to fix your portrait.

1013
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:41,050
Since you've called me

1014
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:42,230
your boss,

1015
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:43,110
how about

1016
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:45,130
staying in my shop for now?

1017
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:46,030
Really?

1018
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:51,310
Boss.

1019
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:52,590
You're so nice to me, Boss.

1020
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:53,320
Stop.

1021
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:54,340
Calm down.

1022
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,280
Listen.

1023
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:56,880
I don't raise idle folk.

1024
00:40:57,350 --> 00:40:58,390
You can't stay here

1025
00:40:58,390 --> 00:40:59,230
for free.

1026
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:00,580
You've to work for me.

1027
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:01,870
I'll pay you

1028
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:02,980
accordingly.

1029
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:03,810
Yes.

1030
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:07,350
I mean, no.

1031
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:08,460
Why?

1032
00:41:08,810 --> 00:41:10,450
I'm still working for

1033
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,540
Longxin Teahouse.

1034
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:12,980
I can't just leave.

1035
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:14,260
Don't worry.

1036
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:16,630
It's just Longxin Teahouse.

1037
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:17,590
I'll talk

1038
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:18,180
to them.

1039
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:19,830
Well,

1040
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:20,730
I...

1041
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:29,310
I owe them money for a meal.

1042
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:31,590
How much?

1043
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:33,230
A little much.

1044
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:41,540
Here.

1045
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:42,300
Eat more.

1046
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:46,990
Ruoqian.

1047
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:49,250
Your noodles are delicious.

1048
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:51,250
I'll make it for you again.

1049
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:52,150
Here.

1050
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:53,470
Eat more.

1051
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:55,920
I've

1052
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:57,210
already paid your debt

1053
00:41:57,270 --> 00:41:58,470
at Longxin Teahouse.

1054
00:41:58,830 --> 00:41:59,490
From now on,

1055
00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:00,750
just stay here at ease.

1056
00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:09,570
But Boss,

1057
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:10,860
although you

1058
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:11,860
paid my debt,

1059
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,600
Longxin Teahouse's boss

1060
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:14,190
Li Wufang

1061
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:15,470
can't be trifled with.

1062
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:17,310
I heard he owns several music houses

1063
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:17,920
and restaurants

1064
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:18,780
in the capital.

1065
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:19,450
Besides,

1066
00:42:19,890 --> 00:42:21,460
his father and grandfather

1067
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,410
are officials.

1068
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:25,000
If you offend him,

1069
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:27,390
he'll make your life miserable.

1070
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:29,260
Boss.

1071
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:31,070
Are we closing down?

1072
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:32,640
Nonsense!

1073
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:35,350
The capital is a place with laws.

1074
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:36,470
Officials are

1075
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:37,680
still under the law.

1076
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:38,870
It's fine. Eat up.

1077
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,100
Officials?

1078
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:46,830
Boss.

1079
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,960
You know an official too.

1080
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:50,360
Yes.

1081
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:51,420
Boss.

1082
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:52,850
Go beg Mr. Jiang.

1083
00:42:53,350 --> 00:42:54,210
That horrid...

1084
00:42:57,710 --> 00:42:59,040
That's a horrid choice.

1085
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:00,180
He has no power.

1086
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:01,410
Forget about it.

1087
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:02,870
But I think

1088
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:04,090
he's quite powerful.

1089
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:05,790
High-ranking and skilled at fighting.

1090
00:43:05,790 --> 00:43:07,320
Kind and from a good family.

1091
00:43:07,350 --> 00:43:08,520
He also cares a lot about you.

1092
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:09,680
Gentle and elegant.

1093
00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:10,910
And Boss...

1094
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:12,340
Stop, stop, stop.

1095
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:13,500
Stop.

1096
00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:15,410
Let's eat first.

1097
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,120
Come on.

1098
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:17,780
Eat more.

1099
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:18,940
Boss.

1100
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:22,560
Could it be you like

1101
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:23,870
the masked guy?

1102
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,150
Shang Bieli?

1103
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:28,710
You know him too?

1104
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:32,560
Do you know why

1105
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:33,810
he's always masked?

1106
00:43:33,830 --> 00:43:35,260
What does he look like?

1107
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:37,140
No idea.

1108
00:43:37,310 --> 00:43:37,950
Masked?

1109
00:43:37,970 --> 00:43:39,170
In all these years,

1110
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:40,150
no one's seen him

1111
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:41,230
without a mask.

1112
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:47,650
Ruoqian.

1113
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,300
Has he been

1114
00:43:49,330 --> 00:43:51,900
living in the capital

1115
00:43:51,930 --> 00:43:54,450
or did he move here later?

1116
00:43:56,150 --> 00:43:57,470
He seems to have been here

1117
00:43:57,470 --> 00:43:58,630
for many years.

1118
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:00,030
His background's

1119
00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:01,030
a bit mysterious.

1120
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:07,950
Mysterious?

1121
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:10,590
Could Shang Bieli

1122
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:11,560
be Young Sir?

1123
00:44:11,970 --> 00:44:13,220
Why's he

1124
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,630
always wearing a mask?

1125
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:18,600
-Where does he live?
-Where does he live?

1126
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:22,910
[Shang Residence]

1127
00:44:40,270 --> 00:44:41,820
He even sleeps with a mask.

1128
00:44:43,310 --> 00:44:44,100
What's he hiding

1129
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:45,500
under his mask?

1130
00:45:09,190 --> 00:45:10,790
That's Tong Sai'er's knife.

1131
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:13,320
Is she trying to kill Shang Bieli?

1132
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:20,220
She wants to remove his mask.

1133
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:22,340
Why's she so persistent?

1134
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:27,540
Woman?

1135
00:45:28,670 --> 00:45:29,400
Assassin!

1136
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:36,780
Go after the assassin!

1137
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:01,750
It's you?

1138
00:46:03,730 --> 00:46:04,610
I...

1139
00:46:05,290 --> 00:46:06,270
I can explain.
