Then sleep with me.

00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:21,230
Ms. Yan,

7
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,310
hurry and add some cold water for me.

8
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,510
I'm getting steamed over here.

9
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:28,590
Ms. Yan.

10
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:30,990
Ms. Yan!

11
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,350
It's getting hot.

12
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:36,470
Sorry, Mrs. Bao.

13
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:41,430
I'm sorry.

14
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,470
Much better now.

15
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,350
Water, please.

16
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,470
Is something bothering you?

17
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:55,220
I have a friend.

18
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:59,140
If a man told her

19
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,470
he said he'd sleep with her,

20
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:03,310
what...

21
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,300
do you think he means?

22
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,190
Is he a pervert?

23
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:09,270
Not really.

24
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,350
If both of them are unmarried,

25
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,660
it's completely natural that passion flows between them

26
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:21,150
when they officially get married and consummate their relationship.

27
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:21,990
But...

28
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,590
if he's asking to sleep with you when you've just met,

29
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:26,250
he's definitely up to no good.

30
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:28,480
I suggest to break up

31
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:29,160
with him.

32
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:30,329
Yes, that's a must.

33
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,110
Who is this friend of yours?

34
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:38,310
Bring her over and let me get to know her.

35
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,310
I'll introduce her to a good guy.

36
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,230
Me! Me!

37
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:42,990
You're everywhere.

38
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:44,670
No, no need.

39
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:50,890
Indeed, he's not a good man.

40
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,950
That pervert! That rascal!

41
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,710
You want to sleep with me?

42
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,440
I just know you’re up to no good.

43
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,630
Boss.

44
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:07,630
Ruoqian and I have made

45
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,150
the flyers just as you've asked.

46
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:09,870
Take a look.

47
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:11,830
Boss,

48
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,870
I think it’s weird that

49
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:15,860
you're asking the customer

50
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,260
if they are feeling cold.

51
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,750
Did you recently develop

52
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,280
some new ointment for cold?

53
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:23,329
When you're older and want to find me,

54
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:24,610
just say, "Are you cold?"

55
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:26,110
I'll let you wear my clothes,

56
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:27,370
and I'll know it's you.

57
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,190
Boss?

58
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:34,790
Boss!

59
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:37,270
I’m asking you.

60
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,880
Why are you asking if they're cold?

61
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:42,990
"Are you cold?"...

62
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:46,630
is the code word that I share with Young Sir.

63
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,650

to serve her at her place.

67
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,510
Send these flyers out for me.

68
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:58,350
Remember to go to places where there is

69
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,340
more human traffic, such as the inns,

70
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,740
theatres and teahouses.

71
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,140
And the martial club!

72
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:05,250
That's where more men are.

73
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,960
Maybe that's where Young Sir is at.

74
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,560
Remember, the martial club!

75
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:09,830
Okay.

76
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:10,990
I'll go now.

77
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,190
Remember to go to the martial club!

78
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:15,830
Okay.

79
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,070

You're back so soon?

85
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:48,030
I'm back with one piece of good

86
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:49,090
and bad news each.

87
00:05:49,409 --> 00:05:51,340
Which one do you want to hear first?

88
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:54,590
The bad news first.

89
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:55,820
General Nan has fled to

90
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:56,680
the South.

91
00:05:56,909 --> 00:05:58,950
We don't know which state specifically.

92
00:05:58,950 --> 00:05:59,990
After Tumen collapsed,

93
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:01,300
both Gongye and Moqi clans

94
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,100
were revived.

95
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,310
Without anyone in charge of Heman,

96
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:06,040
the people can't live in peace.

97
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:08,870
At this point,

98
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:10,760
what good news can there be?

99
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:14,350
Before Nan Jifeng went missing,

100
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:16,080
he did leave some clues behind.

101
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:17,430
He sent his old army buddies

102
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,690
to protect his parents

103
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:19,870
and dismissed

104
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:21,070
his family's servants and generals in advance.

105
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:22,730
It looks like he was prepared.

106
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:23,790
My lord.

107
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,550
If Nan Jifeng had

108
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:27,450
predicted this would happen,

109
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:28,830
why didn't he

110
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:29,960
tell you in advance?

111
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,780
I'm afraid it's because he couldn't.

112
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,930
The mastermind is in the capital,

113
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,110
so his messages and letters

114
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:37,909
can't enter the capital either.

115
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,240
There's something I forgot.

116
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,190
Someone has been asking about

117
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:43,520
your marriage in Heman.

118
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:45,890
They even drew Ms. Yan's portrait

119
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,470
and sent it back to the capital.

120
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:48,360
Don't worry, my lord.

121
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,420
I've already swapped the portraits.

122
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:58,570
Who do you think

123
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,110
could be behind this?

124
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:06,150
This girl.

125
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,490
She's always up to something.

126

What new products

128
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:15,710
did Blossom Beauty release?

129
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:16,940
Our new products

and orange osmanthus rouge.

132

This bride is not Yan Nanxing.

133

How could this happen?

134
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:55,930
Miss?

135
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:00,140
It's really you.

136
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:02,470
It's you.

137
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:03,670
Miss,

138
00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:05,440
are you waiting for a guest?

139
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:10,910
Do you...

140
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,810
think I have a guest?

141
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:15,990
Your guest...

142
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:17,410
didn't ask for you?

143
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:20,310
What?

144
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,390
Do you come here often?

145
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,030
Yes, I do.

146
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:32,050
Well, that's unexpected.

147
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:33,580
Looks like...

148
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:35,950
you won't get the reward again tonight.

149
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:36,430
So what?

150
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:39,000
Are you going to give me a red packet again?

151
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:40,659
Fine.

152
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:46,720
Let me support you.

153
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:48,909
Well...

154
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,330
What do you want me to do?

155
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,650
If you don't want to sing or dance,

156
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:55,030
just chat with me.

157
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:56,550
That's all?

158
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,710
You don't have any customers, do you?

159
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:59,460
Something's better

160
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,260
than nothing.

161
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:04,480
What are you doing here?

162
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,550
I'm chatting with this lady.

163
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,600
What are you talking about?

164
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,860
You shouldn't be here.

165
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:09,870
Don't offend her.

166
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:12,110
Why would I?

167
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,740
I have given her money.

168
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:14,870
Are you crazy?

169
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:16,290
She's an esteemed guest.

170
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,710
Sorry, he didn't mean it.

171
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:21,750
You may leave.

172
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:24,450
Say no more.

173
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,540
You're on your own.

174
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,960
So you're not a dancer.

175
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:39,430
Please pardon me.

176
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:41,920
You want me to pardon you

177
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,290
with a simple apology?

178
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:44,510
Then...

179
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:46,250
how can you forgive me?

180
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:49,950

I'll show my support for you.

00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:59,640
Show me a song and dance.

184
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:02,390
I can't sing or dance.

185

How about this?

186
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:05,570
Show me whatever you know.

May I borrow your handkerchief?

188
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:15,270
What for?

189
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:37,850
Here's a flower for you, Miss.

190
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,350
How did that come about?

191
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,270
I hope you'll be magnanimous

192
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,870
and forgive my mistake.

193

It's okay.

What brings you here?

Add a set of bowl and chopsticks now.

Exactly who on earth

made my father this angry?

210
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:40,350
Jiang Zhiyi.

211
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:42,990
Let me make this clear today.

212
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:45,470
The heir of Yuejiang's Residence

213
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:47,790
shall not only bear the Jiang surname,

214
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,520
but he must also consider himself Jiang at heart.

215

Otherwise,

bring disaster to our family.

But Father, Xinbai...

219
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:58,630
It's okay if I have no grandsons.

220
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:00,910
I'll just nurture my granddaughter instead.

221

But just in case,

222
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,940
if there ever comes a day where my granddaughter

223
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,340
is also unsatisfactory,

224
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:06,910
I'd rather choose

225
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:08,460
someone else in the family.

226
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,480
Mr. Pei, you have a peaceful family.

227
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,390
You have three daughters

228
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:26,940
who treat you well and dear.

229
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,070
But in my opinion,

230
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,090
you still lack something.

231
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,640
What do I lack?

232
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:38,010
You're lacking a son.

233
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,070
Am I...

234
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,040
really lacking?

235
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:47,630
Yes, you are.

236
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:51,000
Your three daughters have yet to get married.

237
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,820
May I propose a marriage

238
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,100
for Xinbai?

239
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:01,070
Your Highness.

240
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,790
You have both a son and daughter,

241
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,590
and that makes your family complete.

242
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:06,420
But I...

243
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,170
I have three dearest daughters too.

244
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:11,210
I'm very content.

245
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:14,190
There's a saying,

"A grown daughter cannot be kept.

247
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:18,110
Otherwise, it will turn into trouble."

248
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:20,230
Why not let the two young people

249

Who knows, they might hit it off.

Mr. Pei,

252
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,350
my family is very open.

253
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,300
I don't mind Xinbai marrying into your family.

254
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:40,290
Your Highness.

255
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:41,580
Well...

256
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,550
There's no need for that.

257
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,590
Xinbai...

258
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:49,030
is just doing his job in his capacity.

259
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:52,130
It's inevitable that he would offend others.

260
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:53,900
Besides, with instigation of outsiders,

261
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,190
the animosity between

262
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:56,340
Xinbai and his grandfather

263
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,580
is getting deeper.

264
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:01,170
I would also like to ask you to watch over Xinbai.

265
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:04,080
On this,

266
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,470
you can rest assured, Your Highness.

267
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,330
Of course I'll watch over Xinbai.

268
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:09,470
However,

269
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,710
we don't have to set up a marriage

270
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:13,070
just because of this.

271
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:16,110
Only by becoming a real family

272
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:17,870
can I be at ease.

273
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,430
But...

274
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:23,760
Mr. Pei.

275
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,250
Alright.

276
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:27,630
Okay.

277
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:30,350
Then...

278
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:33,020
As per your opinion,

279
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,950
my third daughter, Yaoyao,

280
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:39,910
is outgoing.

281
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:41,510
And as far as I know,

282
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,990
she and Xinbai

283
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,670
have met before.

284
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:48,790
But first, let's make it clear.

285
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:50,650
It's just for the two young people

286
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,250
to meet each other.

287
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:54,500
If they don't think well of each other,

288
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,200
then as parents,

289
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:58,440
let's not force it any further.

290
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:01,240
Of course.

291
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,190
Nanxing.

292
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,510
What does she want now?

293
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,590
Xinbai is not young anymore.

294
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,280
I want to arrange a marriage for him.

295
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,590
I don't seem to know

296
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:22,950
any other girls.

297
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,500
Did I ask you for introductions?

298
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:30,030
I've already found someone.

299
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:33,140
The third daughter of the Pei family.

300
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:34,410
Not bad, right?

301
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:38,710
They're a perfect match.

302
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:40,510
I'll prepare my gift money.

303
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:44,150
You don't need to pay.

304
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:45,640
I want you to make money.

305
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:48,790
I want you to be the matchmaker.

306
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,440
If it's successful,

307
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:52,530
I'll give you a large sum of money as the matchmaker.

308
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:53,590
I guarantee you'll be satisfied.

309
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:54,920
I'll be the matchmaker?

310
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:59,230
Think about Xinbai's personality.

311
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:00,560
Do you think he will

312
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:02,320
actually go for the blind date?

313
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:03,260
No, he won't.

314
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:04,230
That's right.

315
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:05,890
So I'll leave Xinbai with you.

316
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:07,470
Why?

317
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,170
You guys are each other's

318
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:10,270
ride or die.

319
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:12,590
You must have a way to make him go.

320
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:15,670
B-But I...

321
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:16,710
I...

322
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:18,070
Besides...

323
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,670
Look into my eyes.

324
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:25,830
We are like sisters.

325
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:28,440
So, Xinbai is like your nephew.

326
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:29,710
My nephew?

327
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,350
I've never heard him

328
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,000
mention anyone

329
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,250
he liked since he was a kid.

330
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,430
Except that ex-wife,

331
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:41,990
which we are unclear about.

332
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:44,360
But...

333
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:46,310
even if he can't forget her,

334
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:48,230
it's all in the past.

335
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,010
Think about it.

336
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:51,670
If you have such a nephew,

337
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:53,350
wouldn't you be anxious for him?

338
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:54,270
Yes, I would.

339
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:54,990
Then...

340
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:00,440
Can you bear to watch

341
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:02,410
your nephew become

342
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,090
a widower for the rest of his life?

343
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:06,870
Can you bear to

344
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:08,850
see your nephew be left in the lurch

345
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:10,510
for the remainder of his life?

346
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,740
My heart hurts now.

347
00:17:33,099 --> 00:17:34,540
It hurts so bad.

348
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:36,790
If you don't agree,

349
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:38,670
I won't be able to feel good at all.

350
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,680
I'm so sad.

351
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:43,270
It hurts everywhere.

352
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:48,890
I suddenly feel refreshed.

353
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,230
Blossom Beauty Beauty Salon!

354
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:55,830
Don't miss it!

355
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:57,110
Sir, take a look.

356
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,030
Miss! Miss!

357
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:00,080
Young man, take a look.

358
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,740
Look at you, you're so pretty.

359
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:02,450
Come and find out more

360
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:04,450
about Blossom Beauty Beauty Salon.

361
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,060
Miss, take a look.

362
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:06,830
Miss.

363
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:08,240

364
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:09,110
our products,

366
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:11,310
Really?

367
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,230
I'll give it a try then.

368
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:13,880
Okay.

369
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,390
I'll wait for you.

370
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:16,030
Okay.

371
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:24,070
Young man,

372
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,050
Blossom Beauty Beauty Salon.

373
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:25,990
Have a look.

374
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:27,210
We have a wide range of services.

375
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:27,910
You can bring your wife

376
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:28,910
to come and experience it.

377
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:29,470
Here.

378
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,020
Do I look like I have a wife?

379
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,490
I'm sorry.

380
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:38,190
Sai'er, Ruoqian.

381
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:40,230
-Boss!
-Boss!

382
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:41,350
Boss.

383
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:43,190
Boss, why are you here?

384
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:45,420
Aren't you going to the Princess' Residence?

385
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:46,320
I've been there.

386
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,250
I came to see you.

387
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:48,530
How is it going?

388
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:50,340
We're almost done giving them out here.

389
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,630
We'll go to the martial club next.

390
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,590
We aim to give them out across the entire capital.

391
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,650
It's getting late.

392
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:55,550
You guys hurry up.

393
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:56,470
Stay safe.

394
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:57,300
Okay.

395
00:18:57,850 --> 00:18:59,050
What about you, Boss?

396
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,550
I have something to do.

397
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:01,880
I won't follow you guys.

398
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,270
Okay, we'll be going.

399
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:06,350
All the best.

400
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:24,680
Why are you here?

401
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:26,590
I had a meal on you the last time.

402
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:27,950
I've come to return the favour.

403
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:29,810
You can have a taste of my cooking.

404
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:31,950
It's so late.

405
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,390
I've already eaten.

406
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:34,950
If you have eaten...

407
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:36,350
then let's have supper.

408
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:38,590
-No, Yan Nanxing.
-Excuse me.

409
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:47,790
All right.

410
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:52,390
The corn is ready. It smells so good.

411
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:57,190
How is it?

412
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:03,630
This is what you consider as cooking?

413
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:04,910
Yes. Is it delicious?

414
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,470
I've never seen such an

415
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,330
unskilled meal before.

416
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:12,470
As long as it tastes good, no?

417
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,190
Try this.

418
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:14,840
I'll try this first.

419
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:16,640
Have some water.

420
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,150
Here.

421
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:24,550
Not bad.

422
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:26,570
As long as it's delicious.

423
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:29,410
So, tell me.

424
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:32,240
Now that I've eaten your meal,

425
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:33,470
what exactly

426
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:35,070
brings you here

427
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,490
tonight?

428
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:41,030
Actually, I just...

429
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:42,550
really wanted you to try

430
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:43,230
my cooking.

431
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:44,830
And also,

432
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:47,690
I want to discuss something with you.

433
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,950
Your mother...

434
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,240
have found you

435
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:56,110
a blind date.

436
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:57,840
But I refused immediately.

437
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,730
I looked into it carefully.

438
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:02,540
One of them is quite decent.

439
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,530
She's the Prime Minister's third daughter.

440
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:05,830
Would you like to meet her?

441
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:07,160
I'll arrange it for you.

442
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:11,350
It's not easy to digest

443
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:12,760
too much food at night.

444
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,540
You've already eaten. Don't deny it.

445
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:20,710
Just take it as you're helping me.

446
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:23,030
Help me out this time. Just this time.

447
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,390
Please. Please.

448
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:25,710
No.

449
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:31,360
She's the third daughter of the Prime Minister.

450
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,190
I heard that she is well-educated

451
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:34,150
and beautiful.

452
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:36,190
It's not like you're losing out.

453
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:39,430
Just meet her once.

454
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:42,210
Do you want me to go?

455
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:47,910
Does it matter what I think?

456
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,160
Your mother

457
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,670
keeps threatening to close my shop.

458
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:51,870
How dare I refuse her?

459
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:54,390
Besides, if I'm really doomed,

460
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:56,050
who will help you with your case?

461
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:57,850
It's not worth it for you either.

462
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:01,030
Think of it as you're meeting her

463
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:02,870
for the sake of us.

464
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:06,830
For the sake of us?

465
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,590
Of course, for us.

466
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:11,290
Please, just this once.

467
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:16,110
Fine.

468
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:17,390
I'll go.

469
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:18,510
Really?

470
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:19,550
Yes.

471
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:21,570
I'll arrange it immediately.

472
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:24,260
But...

473
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,570
Don't you regret it.

474
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:34,260
Help me grill some more mushrooms.

475
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:36,110
Okay.

476
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:41,790
Us...

477
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:17,620
It's you.

478
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:21,010
Pretty sister!

479
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:21,930
Pretty sister!

480
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,680
Pretty sister!

481
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:25,170
Can you get the kite for us?

482
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,830
Pretty sister, over here.

483
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:30,380
Please help us retrieve it.

484
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:37,060
I wouldn't climb a tree

485
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,520
for such a trivial matter.

486
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:41,110
It's inappropriate.

487
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:44,910
Just buy a few more.

488
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:46,950
Sister,

489
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:48,550
we only want this kite.

490
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:50,630
So you don't even know how to climb a tree?

491
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:52,310
Even brother Ruoqian knows how to.

492
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:52,870
Sister.

493
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,980
You're a grown-up.

494
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:55,990
You don't even know how to climb trees?

495
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:57,430
Sister, you're so useless.

496
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:59,510
You're useless! You're useless!

497
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:01,430
Did I say I don't know how to climb trees?

498
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:02,060
Did I?

499
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:03,680
You did.

500
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:04,910
No, I didn't.

501
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:13,510
Just wait for me here.

502
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:24,750
Sister, come on!

503
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,510
You can do it!

504
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,390
Come on!

505
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:30,150
Go for it!

506
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:31,830
Come on!

507
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:49,830
Miss.

508
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:51,340
Miss!

509
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:12,190
You're awake.

510
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:18,440
How come it's you again?

511
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:19,720
I'm Liu Ruoqian.

512
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:22,090
What is this place?

513
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:23,320
This is my house.

514
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:25,310
Your house?

515
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:28,470
Why am I at your house?

516
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,250
You passed out just now.

517
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:31,880
I don't know where you live.

518
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:33,010
My home was nearby,

519
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,310
so I brought you here to rest.

520
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:35,910
Who asked you to take me home?

521
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:36,830
Miss.

522
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:39,870
This is your book, right?

523
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:41,360
So you like to

524
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,800
read books such as "Drunken Beauty" too?

525
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:46,990
One should read all kinds of books

526
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:48,790
and gain all sorts of knowledge.

527
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:52,020
Can you lend it to me?

528
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:53,950
I just want a glimpse.

529
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:54,730
I'll return it to you when I am done.

530
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:55,520
I'll return it to you when I am done.

531
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:55,980
Give it—

532
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:59,900
Uh... t-the meal is ready.

533
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,380
Why don't you eat before leaving?

534
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:02,970
No need.

535
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:03,910
Miss.

536
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:05,550
Look at how skinny you are.

537
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:07,620
I am guessing you don't eat well at home.

538
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:08,560
The meal is ready.

539
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,790
Just have a taste of my cooking.

540
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:10,250
No need.

541
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:10,890
Let's go.

542
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:11,430
Here.

543
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:14,230
More dishes incoming.

544
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:16,240
All right.

545
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:16,570
Come.

546
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:17,680
Time to eat.

547
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:18,470
Here.

548
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:20,970
Father.

549
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:23,230
Let's eat.

550
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:25,200
[Slave]

551
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:27,110
Slaves?

552
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:30,030
We are slaves.

553
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:33,310
Although we've got rid of our master,

554
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:35,440
we have yet to leave the slave clan yet.

555
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:38,430
But regardless whether we are slaves or not,

556
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,750
we eat like everyone else,

557
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:41,430
we get along with our neighbors,

558
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:42,720
and we see the same sky.

559
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,400
Similarly, the sun also sets

560
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,730
in the West for all of us.

561
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:48,510
Yes.

562
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:51,920
That's not what I meant.

563
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:52,790
It's my first time

564
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:54,070
eating at someone else's house.

565
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:56,270
I was looking around because I'm curious.

566
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:57,270
Please excuse me.

567
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:59,150
-It’s okay.
-Feel free to look around.

568
00:26:59,150 --> 00:26:59,690
Yes, it's nothing.

569
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:00,430
Let's eat.

570
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:01,050
Let's eat.

571
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:02,440
I just made this.

572
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:03,690
Mother.

573
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,710
Son, try it.

574
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:06,260
Okay.

575
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:08,510
It's tasteless!

576
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:09,990
Did you forget to add salt again?

577
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:11,310
Nonsense. It's delicious.

578
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:12,630
Yeah, this is delicious.

579
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:14,350
-Put more salt next time.
-He’s being picky.

580
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:14,950
Is it good?

581
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:15,350
Yes.

582
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:17,290
Fine, it's good if you say so.

583
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:20,230
Okay.

584
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:22,430
You try it too.

585
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:24,150
Yes, Miss.

586
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:26,270
-Eat up!
-Give it a try!

587
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:28,390
Eat.

588
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:29,070
Eat.

589
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:39,590
It's delicious.

590
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:41,270
You see, everyone says it's delicious.

591
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:42,380
As long as it tastes good.

592
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,430
If it's good, then eat more.

593
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:44,260
-Come on.
-Don't stand on ceremony.

594
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:46,230
Since it's good, have another piece.

595
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:46,830
Miss.

596
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,240
What's your name?

597
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:50,810
Father, stop asking. It's rude.

598
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:56,960
My name is Suoluo.

599
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:58,500
It's the name of a tree

600
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,280
that grows at the Southwest border.

601
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,460
This name is so special.

602
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:02,860
My father was a borderer.

603
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:03,590
So,

604
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:04,990
he gave me this name

605
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:06,690
to commemorate his hometown.

606
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:09,990
So you're a borderer.

607
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,120
Well yes, that's half my ethnicity.

608
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:15,070
Whether a borderer

609
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:15,750
or a slave,

610
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:17,590
we all live in the capital,

611
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:18,990
so we are people of the capital.

612
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:20,050
We are all the same.

613
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,830
My son is right.

614
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:24,350
Miss, whenever you're free,

615
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:25,610
just come by for a meal.

616
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:27,960
We just have to add a pair of chopsticks, and it's livelier.

617
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,350
Make yourself at home here.

618
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:29,790
Okay.

619
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:31,490
Help yourself.

620
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,900
And this. This is delicious too.

621
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:40,830
Isn't it pretty?

622
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:41,540
Take care.

623
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:43,220
Take care.

624
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:44,900
Mrs. Bao's stuff

625
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,520
are all pretty.

626
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:47,720
Mrs. Bao.

627
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:50,740
Hello, ladies.

628
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,560
This is...

629
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:53,910
Let me show you our new product.

630
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:56,210
This is our newly developed

631
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:57,270
fragrance powder.

632
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:02,750
Done.

633
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:10,350
Ms. Yan, your skills

634
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,200
truly live up to its reputation.

635
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,640
It's my honor

636
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:14,670
to make you happy.

637
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:19,440
His Grace...

638
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:20,860
Is he here yet?

639
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:22,590
He...

640
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:24,400
will be here soon.

641
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,540
Just hold on.

642
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:33,960
Mr. Jiang, you're here.

643
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:38,530
It's Mr. Jiang.

644
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:45,310
He's so handsome, isn't he?

645
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:47,920
Mr. Jiang, you're here.

646
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,710
He's here!

647
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:54,430
He's so handsome.

648
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:56,990
How punctual.

649
00:29:57,370 --> 00:29:58,670
Look how anxious he is.

650
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,460
I don't see you

651
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:02,060
dressed so attractively

652
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:03,390
when you come and see me.

653
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,120
Yan Nanxing

654
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:11,870
must entertain Ms. Pei today.

655
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,220
She must be the one beside her.

656
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:22,120
Let's go.

657
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:30,450
Even the flowers aren't as pretty as how you are dressed.

658
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:32,680
You look beautiful today.

659
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:41,230
You are talking about me?

660
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:43,750
Really?

661
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:45,590
Yes.

662
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,630
It's a real honor to

663
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,680
be able to meet you today.

664
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:53,830
Stop it.

665
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:55,790
Unfortunately,

666
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,340
I'm married.

667
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:01,880
We're just not meant to be.

668
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:07,050
Sai'er.

669
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:09,190
Take Ms. Pei to the private room to rest.

670
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:09,760
Hurry up.

671
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:11,430
He is...

672
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:12,150
Come on.

673
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:13,110
Excuse me.

674
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:13,830
Hurry up.

675
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:15,320
Let me make you some tea.

676
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:17,040
Am I really that beautiful?

677
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,050
Yes, you are.

678
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:19,790
Come here.

679
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:24,240
You did that on purpose.

680
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,310
Of course not.

681
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,330
I don't know who she is.

682
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:28,070
No, you do.

683
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:29,630
You did it on purpose.

684
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:31,310
I've heard

685
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:32,510
you've met Ms. Pei

686
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:33,390
before.

687
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:34,790
You're usually such a bragger.

688
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:36,150
How could you not recognize her?

689
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:36,950
She and I

690
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:38,590
have met only once.

691
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:39,750
Then your face blindness

692
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:40,710
is way too inconsistent.

693
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:41,900
If you want to recognize someone, you can.

694
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,960
And when you don't, you choose not to.

695
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:45,150
Well, I recognize you.

696
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:46,390
What's the use of recognizing me?

697
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:48,450
I'm not going on a blind date with you.

698
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:50,150
Go back.

699
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:52,110
Cajole her well,

700
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:54,190
and clear up any misunderstanding.

701
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:55,510
If you continue to be like this,

702
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:57,070
you deserve to be single forever.

703
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:58,110
I'm not single.

704
00:31:58,630 --> 00:31:59,630
I consider myself

705
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:00,750
a widower.

706
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,600
I'm not dead yet.

707
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,620
Don't curse me.

708
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:07,860
You're laughing?

709
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:08,910
Hurry back now

710
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:09,770
and cajole her.

711
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:10,550
Don't you cause my shop to close down.

712
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:11,390
Let's go.

713
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:26,990
Well...

714
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:28,430
If both of you need anything,

715
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:30,030
feel free to call me anytime.

716
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,450
What are you doing here?

717
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:15,310
Boss.

718
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,680
Ruoqian is looking after the front hall anyway.

719
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,610
Let's eavesdrop through the wall.

720
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:21,110
Why should we?

721
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:23,310
I don't want you to regret it.

722
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,830
If things go wrong,

723
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:26,870
we still have a chance to make things up.

724
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:27,740
I'll regret it?

725
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:30,000
What do I have to regret?

726
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:31,270
Besides,

727
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:33,410
do I look like that kind of person?

728
00:34:19,469 --> 00:34:20,620
Ms. Pei, please give me a moment.

729
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:22,139
I'll go get some more tea.

730
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:23,190
No need.

731
00:34:25,219 --> 00:34:25,780
I'm full.

732
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:32,190
I am wondering...

733
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,130
I wonder what are

734
00:34:37,949 --> 00:34:39,280
some of your interests?

735
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:42,870
Reading and investigating cases.

736
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:44,780
What kind of books

737
00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:49,909
do you usually read?

738
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,780
Books on the art of war.

739
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:54,750
For example?

740
00:34:56,389 --> 00:34:56,989
"Wuzi".

741
00:34:57,909 --> 00:35:00,230
Especially, the chapters on managing the military,

742
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:02,630
discussing commandership and encouragement of soldiers.

743
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:03,760
I often review them.

744
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:09,190
Who asked you to talk about these things with her?

745
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,430
May I ask...

746
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:14,670
what kind of woman do you like?

747
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:19,200
It's not the kind of woman whom

748
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:21,290
you greeted at the front hall, right?

749
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,040
I mistook that woman

750
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:27,090
for you just now.

751
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:29,430
I...

752
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:34,700
The last time we met was at the palace's banquet

753
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,920
during Dragon Boat Festival last year.

754
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:38,310
At that time,

755
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:40,080
we were standing far apart.

756
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:41,250
I couldn't see clearly

757
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:42,380
how you looked like.

758
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,350
I only remembered

759
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:46,610
you had a half-knife chignon.

760
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:47,950
That lady just now

761
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,020
also styled her hair the same way.

762
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:52,190
That's why I mistook her for you.

763
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:56,750
I see.

764
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:00,150
But...

765
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:02,590
You have yet to

766
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:03,750
answer my question.

767
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:07,030
Your Grace,

768
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:09,250
what kind of woman

769
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,280
do you like?

770
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:18,530
I don't care about looks.

771
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:27,220
Your Grace...

772
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:28,620
Do you mean...

773
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:31,670
Do you mean that I'm ugly?

774
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,490
Men are all liars.

775
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:34,070
Right?

776
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:36,350
I didn't mean to offend you.

777
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:38,790
But compared to appearance,

778
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,010
I care more about temperament.

779
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:46,630
Well then...

780
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:49,890
What kind of temperament do you like?

781
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:51,030
What kind?

782
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:04,110
Someone who is valiant,

783
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:05,610
intelligent and poised.

784
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:09,390
She doesn't need to be overly gentle or modest,

785
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:12,270
and it doesn't matter if she has a bit of temper.

786
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:14,390
She has her own principles,

787
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:18,050
and has a free, brave, and open-minded spirit.

788
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:21,220
Underneath an unruly appearance,

789
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:23,020
she has a kind

790
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:24,900
and righteous heart.

791
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:29,650
Although she may be harsh with words,

792
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:30,880
she has a big heart.

793
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,710
She doesn't judge others

794
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:35,640
by the usual moral standards.

795
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,110
Boss.

796
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:42,510
Why does it seem like

797
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:44,310
he's not describing Ms. Pei?

798
00:37:58,270 --> 00:37:59,230
I understand what

799
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:00,430
you are trying to say.

800
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:02,350
Since you are dissatisfied with me,

801
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:04,350
please explain it to the elders

802
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:05,610
personally yourself.

803
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,530
I even ask for your mercy

804
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:11,830
to not make me sound so bad.

805
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:13,390
Wait.

806
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:18,540
Do you need me to send you back?

807
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:21,630
No need.

808
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:44,800
What are we going to do now that she's gone?

809
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:47,180
Boss.

810
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:50,670
Boss!

811
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,750
Do you feel that

812
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:55,610
the person Mr. Jiang was describing

813
00:38:55,610 --> 00:38:57,210
as the kind of person he likes

814
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:58,350
was you?

815
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,150
Me?

816
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:01,750
No, no way.

817
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:02,520
Yes.

818
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:03,480
No.

819
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:04,390
It was!

820
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:05,400
No, it wasn't!

821
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:06,030
He definitely was.

822
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:07,230
Definitely not.

823
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:09,320
Please bring me a pot of tea.

824
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:12,350
He's calling you.

825
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:21,100
Mr. Jiang.

826
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,450
It's okay if you are not interested in her.

827
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:24,590
But you should have at least let her

828
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:25,990
leave with some dignity.

829
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:29,370
She is the daughter of the Prime Minister after all.

830
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:30,870
Don't worry.

831
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:33,130
I'll talk to Mother.

832
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:34,830
You'd better.

833
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,980
Don't get me into trouble.

834
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:44,430
Was it really because of the reasons you mentioned

835
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:46,190
that you didn't fancy her?

836
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:49,990
I'm talking to you.

837
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:51,710
You said just now,

838
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:55,310
"intelligent and valiant."

839
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:57,990
Were you referring to me?

840
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:00,070
Did I?

841
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:01,670
No?

842
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:04,670
Yan Nanxing.

843
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:07,110
You are really good at flattering yourself,

844
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:07,790
aren't you?

845
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:10,350
Do I need to?

846
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:12,030
I know you.

847
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:13,230
You're just like a piece of wood.

848
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:14,690
How many girls do you know?

849
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:15,870
Whatever being intelligent

850
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:17,130
and valiant was about.

851
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:19,030
Oh right.

852
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:21,360
You can't even tell the difference

853
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,620
between men and women.

854
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:27,470
Fine.

855
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,490
It's you if you say so.

856
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,680
That's so reluctant.

857
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:33,580
It's as if I am forcing myself

858
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:35,070
onto you as your lover.

859
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:40,910
Yan Nanxing, what about you?

860
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:43,750
What kind of man do you like?

861
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:46,360
I...

862
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:47,990
Jiang Xinbai, where are you?

863
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,100
Mother.

864
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:00,070
Have some tea.

865
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:05,970
You've messed everything up.

866
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:07,550
Tell me!
