Why would I?

73

Since you knew my name,

74
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,350
you could find out

I took you home to let you rest.

90
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,170
I didn't know you were a chancellor

until we had dinner together.

But I had no other intentions after I found out,

00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:17,200
nor did I think too much.

94

What kind of friends do you need?

105
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:42,790
Only those who can

106
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,160
always stay by my side

107
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:45,630

Be your people?

So,

00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:02,350
stop saying

113

and disturb the chancellor?

122
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:30,110
You asked him to clean this place up?

Yes.

124
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,730
His name is Liu Ruoqian.

125
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:37,470
He's the slave student the Imperial Academy

126
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,000
made an exception to admit.

127
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:39,980
He told us

128
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:41,830
he wanted to work in order to earn tuition.

129
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:42,690
So, we asked him

130
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:44,190
to do some physical labor.

131
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:48,270
However,

132
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:50,750
as a slave,

133
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:53,660
you're not qualified to take the imperial exams

134
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,260
and can never be an official.

135
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,230
What's the use of studying

136
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:58,870
at the Imperial Academy?

137
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:02,030
Why are you still standing here?

138
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:02,670
Go away.

139
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:06,190
Is becoming an official the only purpose of study?

140
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:08,270

Dean Yan, as a teacher,

144
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,600
how can you judge your student

145
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,260
based on traditional values?

146
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:22,230
I didn't mean to humiliate him.

147
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:23,030

to teach him some rules.

00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:25,160

Please don't argue about me.

152
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:31,770
Since I was a child,

153
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:33,020
I've heard many humiliating words

154

like this.

155
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,780
If I cared about these words,

156
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:39,590
I wouldn't be studying at the Imperial Academy.

157

Although I'm a slave,

158
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,350
I'm not ashamed of it.

159

No matter what others say,

160
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:46,880
it can't hurt me.

161

Don't tell him it's from me.

00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,250
Although your nose has grown back,

179
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,120
it will take some time

180
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,870
to get your sense of smell back.

181
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:57,030
It's okay.

182
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,190
I got this.

183
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:59,230
I will get

184
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:01,030
Mr. Shang's sense of smell back.

185
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:02,610
I never owe anyone.

186
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:04,430
If there's anything you want me to do,

187
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:05,360
just let me know.

188
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:09,550
Don't mind if I do.

189
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:11,390
Actually,

190
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:13,190
I want you

191
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,530
to find someone for me.

192
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:15,990
I know who you want to find.

193
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:16,390
Boss,

194
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:16,950
you want to find

195
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:18,550
the boy who saved you, right?

196
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:21,770
The Inspection Office

197
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:22,590
is better

198
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:24,590
at finding people than the Jinwu Guards.

199
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:26,920
Why don't you ask Jiang Xinbai to help you?

200
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:28,590
I don't want him

201
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:30,710
to worry about this anymore.

202
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:31,910
So,

203
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,400
I can only ask you for help.

204
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:35,070
Okay.

205
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,470
Thank you.

206
00:13:52,840 --> 00:14:00,800
Bravo!

207
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:13,640
Chancellor.

208
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:16,440
Chancellor.

209
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:19,200
We meet by chance this time.

210
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:20,620
I didn't follow you.

211
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,470
I know.

212
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,220
I misjudged you

213
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,070
at the Imperial Academy today.

214
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,260
Don't worry about it.

215
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,800
I really don't mind it.

216
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:31,870
Chancellor.

217
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:32,870
Let me take these.

218
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:34,070
Thank you.

219
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:40,000
Chancellor.

220
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,100
Someone from the academy told me

221
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,300
you gave me a pay rise.

222
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:44,790
Thank you.

223
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:46,640
You deserve it.

224
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,780
Are you going this way too?

225
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:55,390
I'm carrying these books for you.

226
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:56,520
Let me walk with you.

227
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:57,950
Where are you going?

228
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,870
I'm going to the bookstore.

229
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,370
Then I'll go to the bookstore with you.

230
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:28,630
It's late.

231
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:30,350
Why isn't he back yet?

232
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:35,410
Even if he doesn't want to come home for dinner, he should change his dressing.

233
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,080
Ms. Yan.

234
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:09,690
Where is your lord?

235
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,380
He's been reading the file

236
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,290
on Li Wufang's case

237
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:13,750
in the file room since noon.

238
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:14,510
You can go in.

239
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:15,630
I'll stay out.

240
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:16,430
Thank you.

241
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:25,240
You only care

242
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,180
about the case.

243
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:29,560
Why didn't you go home early to change your dressing?

244
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,910
Sit still.

245
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:39,250
Let's do it.

246
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,550
What's wrong?

247
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:45,290
What are you doing?

248
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,760
Taking off your clothes.

249
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:50,710
How can I change your dressing with your clothes on?

250
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,390
I don't think it's appropriate.

251
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,830
What are you shy about?

252
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:54,830
I also

253
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,510
changed your dressing at home.

254
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:58,150
We're not at home after all.

255
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,450
We're at the Inspection Office.

256
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,310
What are you afraid of?

257
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:03,710
There's no one else here.

258
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:05,670
Anyway...

259
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:06,680
Anyway...

260
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:09,280
This feels strange.

261
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,830
You're so troublesome.

262
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:19,510
Okay.

263
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:21,410
Let's get started.

264
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,000
What now?

265
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,990
Actually,

266
00:17:30,089 --> 00:17:31,000
my wound

267
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,060
has almost healed.

268
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:33,720
I knew it.

269
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:37,430
If you don't want to change your dressing,

270
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:39,960
you should at least take the oral medication.

271
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:41,430
Luckily,

272
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:42,250
I was smart.

273
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:45,230
See? I've prepared it.

274
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:49,480
Alright.

275
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:51,730
It hasn't turned cold.

276
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:52,430
Here.

277
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:53,440
Let me feed you.

278
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,060
It's not hot anymore.

279
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,760
I'll blow on it for you.

280
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:06,150
Okay.

281
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:07,680
It's cooler now.

282
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:08,750
Wait.

283
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:20,630
I see.

284
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:22,950
Is Chief Constable Jiang

285
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:24,150
afraid

286
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,590
of bitterness?

287
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:34,060
Who said I'm afraid of bitterness?

288
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:34,860
Then drink it.

289
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:43,920
Drink it.

290
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:56,470
Here.

291
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,300
The bitter taste is gone, right?

292
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,720
♫Sit with you at night and listen to the wind♫

293
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,020
Yes.

294
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:17,150
♫When the wind flutters, the heart does too♫

295
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:20,770
♫Step by step, no words are spoken♫

296
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,740
♫Barged into sight♫

297
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:28,210
♫When did your figure grow hazy?♫

298
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,860
♫And how clear is it?♫

299
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,610
♫I don't intend to break your heart♫

300
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,820
♫Silently fall into my arms♫

301
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:44,390
Mr. Yao.

302
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:45,790
Are you going home?

303
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:46,310
Yes.

304
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:46,950
Well,

305
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:48,110
has Mr. Jiang gone home?

306
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:48,990
It's very late.

307
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:50,310
I think he has gone home.

308
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:51,870
Take a look around and lock the door.

309
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:52,390
Okay.

310
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,030
You were so stupid.

311
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:02,880
You went there

312
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:05,230
just because Li Wufang asked you to?

313
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:08,560
What else could I do?

314
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:11,270
I couldn't just watch you get hurt

315
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:12,300
and do nothing.

316
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:15,330
What if he was trying to scare you?

317
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:16,990
What if I was fine?

318
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,860
I couldn't take the risk.

319
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:32,230
Back then,

320
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:35,460
when my father was investigating

321
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,620
the Zornia case,

322
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:38,860
he found

323
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:40,350
a very important witness.

324
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,800
As long as the witness testified,

325
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,310
he could have removed

326
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:47,250
the force behind the Zornia.

327
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:50,790
However,

328
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:53,550
the night before the witness testified

329
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:55,150
against the Zornia gang,

330
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:57,750
the witness died.

331
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,780
His whole family was killed.

332
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,160
Was the murderer found?

333
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:11,180
This matter

334
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:14,070
became my father's lifelong pain.

335
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:16,030
That witness

336
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:18,340
had the same surname as you.

337
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:19,920
His surname was Yan too.

338
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:22,090
His name was Yan Zhizhong.

339
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,190
Actually...

340
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,260
Actually, my surname is not Yan.

341
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:30,710
My mother said

342
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,230
she named me

343
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,180
after my savior.

344
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:34,520
His surname was Yan.

345
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:44,230
Yan Nanxing.

346
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:46,070
Although

347
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,080
you're not related to Yan Zhizhong,

348
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,650
and although you are not my witness...

349
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:52,550
Whenever I

350
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:54,990
think of how

351
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:56,880
Li Wufang kidnapped you

352
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,210
and forced me to submit,

353
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,370
whenever I think of

354
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:02,910
how you almost got hurt

355
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:04,270
because of me,

356
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:07,860
whenever I think of...

357
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:08,860
But I trust you.

358
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,410
I believe

359
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,050
you are no longer

360
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:15,710
the Jiang Xinbai from before.

361
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:16,820
Now,

362
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:19,360
you can save the people from danger

363
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:21,990
and rescue every person in front of you.

364
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:24,280
You can also protect me.

365
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:39,420
I will.

366
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,180
Are you hungry?

367
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:54,670
Let's go home and eat.

368
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,270
I feel so hungry.

369
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:03,550
Why is the door locked?

370
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:07,520
Is anyone here?

371
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:10,990
Is anyone here?

372
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:14,480
I think it was locked from the outside.

373
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,220
What should we do?

374
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:22,830
Don't worry.

375
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,870
Tomorrow is the Doors Open Day.

376
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:25,710
It will open

377
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:26,980
two hours earlier than usual.

378
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,440
What is the Doors Open Day?

379
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,460
The Inspection Office

380
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,990
has a Doors Open Day

381
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:38,590
on the 1st and 15th of each month.

382
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:39,520
We open our doors

383
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:41,550
and if the common people

384
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:42,580
have any injustices,

385
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:44,230
they can come and complain.

386
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:47,090
Let's make do with it tonight.

387
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:48,190
Tomorrow,

388
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:49,470
as soon as

389
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:50,490
the door opens,

390
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:52,910
I'll take you to eat something delicious.

391
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:58,350
Okay.

392
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:04,510
But

393
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:06,550
we...

394
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:35,030
I know

395
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,020
you want to protect me,

396
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,830
but I still hope

397
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:42,890
that if you face any difficulties

398
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,700
you can face it with me in the future.

399
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:48,510
Don't bear everything

400
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:51,430
or make decisions

401
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:53,430
all by yourself.

402
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:56,360
You should at least tell me.

403
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:59,150
Okay?

404
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:04,070
Okay?

405
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:06,390
I'm talking to you.

406
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,200
Are you asleep?

407
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:12,650
Don't pretend to be asleep.

408
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:14,010
I'm not gullible.

409
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:20,770
Are you really asleep?

410
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:42,990
You're injured

411
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:46,110
and you still worked so hard.

412
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:50,860
You must be tired.

413
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,440
Why are you so pretty?

414
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:17,710
[Guangyu Hall]

415
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:20,790
Zhiyi,

416
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,440
you can't sleep at all

417
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,110
for so many nights.

418
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:23,910
This can't do.

419
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,570
It breaks my heart to see it.

420
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:26,100
How about

421
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,390
we call an imperial physician for a checkup?

422
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:29,470
What for?

423
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:31,320
When I entered the palace yesterday,

424
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,380
Her Majesty told me

425
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,670
that half a month ago,

426
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:34,930
Xinbai and Shang Bieli

427
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,670
were both called by His Majesty.

428
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:38,530
His Majesty even lost his temper.

429
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:39,190
I wonder

430
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:40,190
what happened.

431
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:42,570
Just thinking about it makes me nervous.

432
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:43,550
It hurts.

433
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:44,810
I didn't do anything.

434
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:45,670
It still hurts.

435
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:46,910
Okay, it's my fault.

436
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:52,840
Don't worry.

437
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:54,440
It's been a long time since then.

438
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,300
It will be fine.

439
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:57,430
Being with a king is like being with a tiger.

440
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:58,710
You know how Xinbai is.

441
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,030
Since childhood,

442
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,190
he only tells us good news.

443
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:01,810
We don't even know

444
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:02,720
what happened.

445
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,150
We can't help at all.

446
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:06,750
How about

447
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:08,200
I go to the Inspection Office

448
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,460
and ask what happened?

449
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:10,630
No.

450
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:12,460
It's been so many days

451
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:14,190
and he hasn't even come to see me.

452
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:15,310
Why would you go to see him?

453
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:15,840
Don't go.

454
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:17,510
Fine.

455
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:18,210
I won't go.

456
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:21,560
Is today

457
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:23,850
the Inspection Office's Doors Open Day?

458
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:26,230
Don’t move. It’s not done yet.

459
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:27,630
I'm going to report my son

460
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:28,710
and say my son is unfilial

461
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:29,950
and shows off at home.

462
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:30,580
So early?

463
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:31,840
I'm done.

464
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:32,710
You need to look proper.

465
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:33,710
It's not done yet.

466
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:35,480
I won't. I'll just be improper.

467
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:43,950
My lord.

468
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:45,430
My lord?

469
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:49,030
My lord,

470
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:51,110
why did you two sleep here?

471
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:01,590
Don't tell anyone

472
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:02,450
about this.

473
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:04,680
It's too late.

474
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:12,540
Right? Look.

475
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:13,490
Yes.

476
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:23,470
I can explain.

477
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:23,950
Shut up.

478
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:27,400
Speak up.

479
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:31,210
Speak up.

480
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:32,880
Speak up.

481
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:41,850
Mr. Jiang,

482
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:42,860
what's going on

483
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,620
between you and Ms. Yan?

484
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:45,790
Are you two

485
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:47,030
together?

486
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:48,750
Is the rumor true?

487
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:51,280
We have to face

488
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:52,490
what we must face.

489
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:57,790
Zhiyi!

490
00:30:58,170 --> 00:30:59,290
Don't be angry.

491
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:00,310
Zhiyi.

492
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:08,830
Let go!

493
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:17,220
Yan Nanxing.

494
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:20,030
It's okay.

495
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:21,990
No matter what happens,

496
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:23,790
we'll face it together.

497
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:24,870
I...

498
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:28,720
Didn't she leave the capital?

499
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:30,350
Were you hiding her

500
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:31,310
these days?

501
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:32,350
Yes.

502
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:34,000
During this period,

503
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:34,790
Yan Nanxing

504
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,410
has been living in my house.

505
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:40,090
She is a traveler,

506
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:42,790
but she's been freeloading off of you.

507
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:43,590
What else

508
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:46,030
have you two done?

509
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:47,870
We even—

510
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:50,130
We reconciled and patched things up.

511
00:31:57,870 --> 00:31:59,800
I want to talk to Yan Nanxing alone.

512
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:00,990
Get out.

513
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:10,940
Will you be okay?

514
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:16,270
Sure.

515
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,610
Have a good chat.

516
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:24,160
Don't worry.

517
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,450
I won't do anything stupid.

518
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:28,710
Go.

519
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,430
You're not leaving?

520
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:08,930
She almost discovered me.

521
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:11,190
This girl

522
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,300
is quite similar to your mother.

523
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:14,460
She's smart,

524
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:15,840
gentle,

525
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:17,110
and kind.

526
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:19,410
Right, Mr. Yan?

527
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,010
Name your price.

528
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:27,550
What price?

529
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:32,200
How much money do you need to leave Xinbai?

530
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:36,740
I didn't expect

531
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:38,710
such cliche words

532
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:40,310
would come from

533
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,110
the princess.

534
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,290
So tacky.

535
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:44,730
You're too shy to do it?

536
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:45,840
Fine.

537
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:48,160
I'll name the price for you.

538
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:49,390
One hundred taels of gold

539
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:51,330
is enough for you to live a good life.

540
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:52,080
As long as you leave,

541
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,540
I'll pay you immediately.

542
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:05,190
What is this?

543
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,870
You said you would give me 100 taels of gold,

544
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:09,470
but I don't see anything yet.

545
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,740
I'm different.

546
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:12,150
I'm a woman of my word.

547
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,460
I'll give it to you now.

548
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:15,630
Since I promised you,

549
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,780
I will reward you with gold

550
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:19,120
as long as you leave.

551
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:21,560
If you give me 100 taels of gold,

552
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:23,650
I'll give you 100 taels of gold

553
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:24,850
and one copper coin.

554
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:27,510
If you give me 1,000 taels of gold,

555
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:29,330
I'll give you 1,000 taels of gold

556
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:30,920
and one copper coin.

557
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:31,530
You!

558
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,290
I'll always give more than you.

559
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:41,389
Why are they speaking nonsense?

560
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:43,000
Are they going to fight?

561
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:45,230
Let them spill their hearts out.

562
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:46,940
Wait for them to

563
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,000
release their emotions.

564
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:48,719
After that,

565
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:50,600
everything will be doable.

566
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:52,190
That makes sense.

567
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:53,449
Let's listen more.

568
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:54,909
You're a traitor.

569
00:34:54,929 --> 00:34:56,159
I treated you as my best friend,

570
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,170
but you seduced my son

571
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:58,080
and cheated me of my feelings.

572
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:58,989
How did I lie to you?

573
00:34:58,989 --> 00:34:59,790
I met your son

574
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:00,310
before I met you.

575
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:01,270
How did I lie?

576
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:01,960
You!

577
00:35:01,989 --> 00:35:02,800
What?

578
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,460
You said I was your close friend.

579
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:04,389
I'm not good enough for you.

580
00:35:04,389 --> 00:35:05,400
You are heartless.

581
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:05,960
They're fighting.

582
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:06,800
When did I ever look down on you?

583
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,790
Never.

584
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,659
You say you don't mind,

585
00:35:08,659 --> 00:35:09,409
but your feelings are honest.

586
00:35:09,409 --> 00:35:10,290
I'm your best friend when I say nice things.

587
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:11,199
I'm heartless when I don't.

588
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:12,010
You're such a wicked mother-in-law.

589
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:12,310
Wicked...

590
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:13,230
Wicked mother-in-law?

591
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:14,150
Wicked mother-in-law!

592
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:14,630
Okay.

593
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:16,410
I'll be the wicked mother-in-law.

594
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:17,060
You hit me?

595
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:22,570
Wait a bit more.

596
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:23,630
I'm so worried.

597
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:24,230
Just wait.

598
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:25,590
Okay.

599
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:30,120
Yan Nanxing!

600
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:30,720
Hurry up!

601
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:31,910
Let go!

602
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:32,850
Let go!

603
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,080
-Enough, Yan Nanxing.
-Stop fighting!

604
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:36,230
Zhiyi!

605
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:37,190
Why are you fighting?

606
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:38,390
You are the princess.

607
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:39,520
What are you doing?

608
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,710
Are you helping me or her?

609
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:42,240
It has nothing to do with me.

610
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:55,110
Zhiyi.

611
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:56,440
Can't sleep?

612
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:16,590
What's wrong?

613
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:17,950
I'm angry.

614
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,670
Actually,

615
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:22,670
I’ve been thinking of Yan Nanxing

616
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:23,830
every day,

617
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,610
but she said those things about me.

618
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:27,760
What did she say?

619
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,790
She said I only listen to what I want to hear.

620
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:32,020
She said I'm arrogant.

621
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:33,550
She said I'm unreasonable.

622
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,090
She even said I'm a wicked mother-in-law.

623
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:37,660
I'm not a wicked mother-in-law,

624
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:38,110
right?

625
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:44,170
Why aren't you saying anything?

626
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:51,330
I'm not that kind of person, am I?

627
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:01,440
You're not usually like this.

628
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,470
But

629
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:05,210
you care more about the people and things

630
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:06,950
around Xinbai.

631
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:09,110
Your concern makes you anxious,

632
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:09,640
so

633
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,000
you treat Yan Nanxing

634
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,430
a bit more strictly.

635
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:15,590
Look,

636
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:17,350
so many people

637
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,040
saw Xinbai and Yan Nanxing

638
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:19,900
together today

639
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:21,670
and you made a scene too.

640
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:24,140
Who knows what the people

641
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:25,890
are saying

642
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,030
about this now?

643
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:30,150
What should I do?

644
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:32,590
I was just angry.

645
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:33,950
I couldn't help it.

646
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:36,360
Don't cry.

647
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:38,270
It's okay.

648
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:42,340
At most, those ignorant people

649
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:43,950
will say

650
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,010
that Blossom Beauty closed

651
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,990
because you abused your power

652
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:49,720
and bullied a commoner.

653
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:51,510
But it's okay.

654
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:52,970
How about this?

655
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:54,800
Yan Nanxing is living with Xinbai

656
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,030
because she has nowhere to stay.

657
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:56,950
In my opinion,

658
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:01,230
you should let Yan Nanxing reopen Blossom Beauty.

659
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:04,190
Suoluo told me already.

660
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,600
Xinbai has taken the title deed.

661
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:12,040
How come even Suoluo

662
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:13,190
is biased

663
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:14,240
toward her brother now?

664
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,150
That's good.

665
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,480
It's sibling love,

666
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:17,630
right?

667
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:19,510
Fine.

668
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:22,080
Blossom Beauty can reopen,

669
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:23,580
but Yan Nanxing

670
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:25,240
can never be my daughter-in-law.

671
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:25,810
Why?

672
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:27,630
You don't understand.

673
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:28,310
When Xinbai

674
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:30,110
went on a blind date with Ms. Pei,

675
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:31,830
I asked Yan Nanxing to be the matchmaker.

676
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:32,910
If Pei Linfu

677
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:34,140
realizes that Xinbai

678
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:35,710
brought his ex-wife

679
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:37,140
on a date with his daughter

680
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:38,340
and made up in the end,

681
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,350
he might get angry and treat Xinbai badly.

682
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:41,610
Then what should we do?

683
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:44,590
It's that complicated?

684
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:45,790
Yes, it's that complicated.

685
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:47,080
Let's put Pei Linfu aside.

686
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,360
Yan Nanxing herself

687
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:49,630
is a troublemaker.

688
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,950
Xinbai is already treading on thin ice.

689
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:53,460
I can't let him be harmed by her.

690
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:53,980
So,

691
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,060
I must break them up

692
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:56,880
and be a wicked mother-in-law.

693
00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:00,310
Why is love

694
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:01,610
so hard?

695
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:03,960
It's as hard as flying in the sky.

696
00:39:05,330 --> 00:39:06,200
I ask the world,

697
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:08,470
what is love?

698
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:09,460
I just—

699
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:09,870
All right.

700
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:10,670
Stop talking.

701
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:12,940
Just remember one thing.

702
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:14,210
Keep an eye on Blossom Beauty.

703
00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:15,340
If anything happens,

704
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:16,540
tell me immediately.

705
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:21,950
I'll keep an eye on her.

706
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,530
What happened to your face?

707
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,470
Who hit you?

708
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:27,590
Let me see.

709
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:29,070
Why is it so red?

710
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:30,150
Is it five fingerprints?

711
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:30,550
Yes.

712
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:33,350
Stretch out your hand and check.

713
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:34,090
Compare it.

714
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:36,210
Isn't the size just right?

715
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,480
It wasn't me.

716
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:39,710
You're playing dumb.

717
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:54,910
You haven't eaten anything all day.

718
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:55,990
Eat some first.

719
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:58,270
These drumsticks and scallion pancakes

720
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:59,600
are all your favorites.

721
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:07,360
I didn't come to save you in time

722
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:09,230
because I wanted to give you two some space

723
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:10,070
to

724
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:12,530
vent your anger

725
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:14,850
and be honest with each other.

726
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:16,750
What trick is this?

727
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:23,270
To be honest,

728
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:25,070
it's good that you two

729
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:26,650
made a scene like this.

730
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:27,760
How is it good?

731
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:29,370
First,

732
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:31,550
for the sake of the people,

733
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:33,790
my mother won't target you anymore.

734
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:34,430
Second,

735
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,750
since everyone knows

736
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:38,030
about our relationship now,

737
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:39,290
Yuejiang's Residence

738
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:40,720
won't ignore it either.

739
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:42,390
Li Wufang

740
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:44,190
already has his eyes on you.

741
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:45,180
This means

742
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:46,590
the people behind him

743
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:47,840
will be after you too.

744
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:48,510
I'm afraid

745
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:50,750
I won't be able to

746
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:53,040
protect you by myself anymore.

747
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:54,670
So,

748
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:57,550
you wanted us to make up

749
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:01,470
and make it public

750
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:03,030
so I can be

751
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:05,090
protected by Yuejiang's Residence?

752
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:10,470
Then

753
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:12,230
is there

754
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:13,230
any other reason?

755
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:16,670
What other reasons do you think

756
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:17,530
there could be?

757
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:19,510
You

758
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:20,500
are so weird.

759
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:21,680
How would I know?

760
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:23,390
You're so smart.

761
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:25,090
How could you not know?

762
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:26,110
I'm not smart.

763
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:27,290
You have to tell me.

764
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:39,360
What is this?

765
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:43,780
Blossom Beauty can reopen.

766
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:45,810
Now that I'm your Boss,

767
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:46,680
no one

768
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:48,840
will dare to kick you out again.

769
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:50,510
How did you get it?

770
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:52,870
I have my own ways.

771
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:57,750
When Li Wufang

772
00:41:58,190 --> 00:41:59,740
arrested me that day,

773
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:01,910
was this

774
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:04,280
the important thing that you wanted to

775
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:06,120
talk to me about?

776
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:13,790
Well...

777
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:15,960
Well, thank you.

778
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:18,560
What do you mean "well, thank you"?

779
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:21,450
You're still unhappy?

780
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:23,590
Wait.

781
00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:27,970
Look what this is.

782
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:29,920
What is this now?

783
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,830
I got the title deed

784
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:36,690
of your residence too.

785
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:42,750
You...

786
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:44,430
You...

787
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:46,350
really...

788
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,650
can do anything you want.

789
00:42:54,990 --> 00:42:55,790
No, Yan Nanxing.

790
00:42:55,790 --> 00:42:56,250
I'm not—

791
00:42:56,330 --> 00:42:57,660
I'm not kicking you out.

792
00:42:57,830 --> 00:42:58,760
Enough. Stop it.

793
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:02,350
If you think

794
00:43:02,350 --> 00:43:03,020
you like living here,

795
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:04,280
of course you can stay.

796
00:43:04,330 --> 00:43:04,910
No need.

797
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:07,560
I don't like it here.

798
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:09,230
Anyway, you gave me

799
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:10,650
the title and land deeds.

800
00:43:10,950 --> 00:43:11,680
Tomorrow...

801
00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:12,670
Tomorrow,

802
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:13,870
I'll move back.

803
00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:15,360
No, Yan Nanxing.

804
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:17,170
You haven't eaten yet.

805
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:22,750
Thank you.

806
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:25,110
Yan Nanxing!
