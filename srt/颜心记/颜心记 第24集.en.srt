00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:50,670
Missing?

5
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,509
According to Daqi's law,

6
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:53,440
every adult man

7
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:54,729
should be registered.

8
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:56,509
There are three copies of the register.

9
00:01:56,509 --> 00:01:57,509
One in the county,

10
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:58,840
one in the state,

11
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,110
and one in the Ministry of Revenue.

12
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:02,910
The register is updated every three years.

13
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:04,040
The record of the man

14
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:04,950
you're looking for

15
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:05,950
hasn't been updated

16
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:06,940
for 15 years.

17
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,509
I copied his record

18
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:11,170
from the Ministry of Revenue.

19
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,320
Take a look. Is it him?

20
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:20,070
Went missing?

21
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,990
What does that mean?

22
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,090
His whereabouts are unknown.

23
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:28,310
Or

24
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:30,720
he may have died.

25
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,800
I've said what needs to be said.

26
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:46,510
Thank you

27
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:47,880

This is good too. Try it.

Here.

This one. Hurry.

This one is amazing.

00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,450
-Smell it.
-Sai'er.

103

Sai'er.

104
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,250
How about this?

105
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:23,830
If he's upset you,

106
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:25,050
I'll go beat him up.

107
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:26,560
No, no, no.

108
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:27,030
Sit.

109
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:27,910
Sit down.

110
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,470
Actually, he didn't do

111
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:33,090
anything wrong.

112
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:34,909
He saved my mom and me after all.

113
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:36,760
I just feel

114
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:37,860
a bit embarrassed.

115
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,260
Why are you embarrassed?

116
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,540
He'll regret rejecting you.

117
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,409
You're adorable, Sai'er.

118
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:47,130
You have a point.

119
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:48,810
It seems that

120
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:49,870
I have to work hard.

121
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,370
You're already working hard.

122
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:53,470
Well,

123
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,260
I'm talking about Blossom Beauty.

124
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,640
The store has reopened.

125
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:57,530
I'm going back.

126
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,310
Here.

127
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:01,550
Take this.

128
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:02,900
Take it.

129
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:03,590
Smell it.

130
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:04,070
Okay.

131
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,300
Pack up later.

132
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:08,530
I'll send you back.

133
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:14,480
You're always

134
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:15,710
jabbering around me.

135
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:18,070
After you leave,

136
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:21,190
I don't know if I can get used to the quiet.

137
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,070
Don't worry.

138
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,650
I promised you

139
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:25,430
to help you regain your sense of smell.

140
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:26,790
I'll visit often.

141
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,320
It's not visiting.

142
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:31,510
It's coming back.

143
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:34,120
Apart from Blossom Beauty,

144
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:35,610
this is also your home.

145
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:37,200
Understand?

146
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:45,670
Smell this.

147
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:53,700
This one is nice too.

148
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:54,110
Here.

149
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,190
And this one.

150
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:57,470
This is good.

151
00:07:59,230 --> 00:07:59,790
Take it.

152
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,810
Stay close to me.

153
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,710
Mr. Shang.

154
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,250
You don't have to escort me to work.

155
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,790
Don't you think it's too high-profile?

156
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,660
I want everyone in the capital to see us.

157
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:17,530
Why?

158
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:20,000
You're a troublemaker.

159
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,720
When I'm not around,

160
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:23,210
they'll recognize you

161
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:25,410
and know you're under my protection,

162
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,380
so they won't dare mess with you.

163
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:29,090
Thank you, Mr. Shang.

164
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:32,610
Sai'er.

165
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:35,419
You can take your time

166
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:36,690
to find your fiancé.

167
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,669
Your mother asked you to find him

168
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:40,789
because she wanted you

169
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:42,250
to have someone to rely on.

170
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:44,380
If you can find someone

171
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,800
who can take care of you

172
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:47,240
and give you a home,

173
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,960
she'd be relieved, right?

174
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:54,380
Although I don't

175

No rush.

to be my sworn brother?

00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,430
would've died for nothing.

352
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:28,580
If I hadn't

353
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:30,610
asked General Nan to go to Tingzhou…

354
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:33,590
If I had warned them

355
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,120
of every possible danger

356
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:36,740
before they left…

357
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,030
maybe this tragedy

358
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,430
wouldn't have happened.

359
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:47,510
General Nan

360
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:48,130
narrowly escaped death

361
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:49,660
in Heman.

362
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:51,960
However…

363
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,270
I won't let

364
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,900
General Nan die for nothing.

365
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,370
And I won't let Yao

366
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:13,030
get hurt for nothing.

367
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:50,370
[Here Lies My Brother]

368
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,140
Brother.

369
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:56,430
You can rest in peace now.

370
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,810
After I avenge you,

371
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:06,350
I'll take you back to Heman.

372
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,800
I'll bury you next to Gaya.

373
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:52,210
Mr. Jiang.

374
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:55,030
It's early in the morning.

375
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:56,830
Are you going to see His Majesty?

376
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:02,880
Are you going to use these fake artworks

377
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,970
and ledgers to denounce me?

378
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:09,150
Mr. Jiang.

379
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:11,110
Let me remind you.

380
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:13,270
Some of the paintings

381
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,900
on these ledgers aren't in my hands.

382
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:17,910
For example,

383
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:21,200
the painting called Flying Fairy.

384
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:23,840
Does it sound familiar?

385
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:29,390
Your Highness, I know you love paintings and calligraphy,

386
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:30,030
so

387
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,260
I went to Qiuci to get the painting

388
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,220
"Flying Fairy"

389
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:35,700
for you.

390
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,060
Mr. Jiang,

391
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,500
you haven't visited

392
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:43,830
your grandfather in a long time, right?

393
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:45,980
He's old now.

394
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:47,990
Spend more time with him.

395
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:05,140
The sun is setting, and the boat is drifting away.

396
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:09,960
The fairy is dancing in the air as gracefully as a swan.

397
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,620
Brilliant.

398
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,660
This is brilliant!

399
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,640
Your Grace, you're indeed

400
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:19,050
the most talented woman in the country.

401
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:20,780
This poem

402
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,110
and this painting

403
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:22,750
really

404
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,980
complement each other, My Highness.

405
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:27,650
If you can stamp it,

406
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:30,070
this painting

407
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:31,460
will become

408
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:33,030
priceless

409
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:34,600
and unparalleled.

410
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:35,950
Really?

411
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:36,880
Yes.

412
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:37,820
Then…

413
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:38,940
Stamp it?

414
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:39,480
Stamp it.

415
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:45,500
Stamp it.

416
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:51,540
Great.

417
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:54,570
I

418
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:56,870
got to appreciate this painting

419
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,910
with Your Highness and Your Grace.

420
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:02,350
I feel very honored.

421
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:04,210
The honor is mine.

422
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,240
I just came to visit my grandfather

423
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,140
and didn't expect

424
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,100
to see such a great painting.

425
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,350
Xinbai?

426
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,080
What brought you here?

427
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,430
Hi, Mr. Jiang.

428
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,740
Are you here to appreciate the painting?

429
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:22,670
What a pleasant surprise.

430
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:23,740
Lu Dingzhao.

431
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:26,050
You're so despicable.

432
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:26,630
Xinbai.

433
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:28,110
That's no way

434
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,400
to talk to an elder.

435
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:30,610
Your Highness.

436
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,620
There must be some misunderstanding.

437
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:35,670
Mr. Jiang.

438
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:37,830
I've given His Highness

439
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,190
many artworks as gifts.

440
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:40,980
Flying Fairy

441
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,000
is just one of them.

442
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:45,300
Why did I do that?

443
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:48,030
I believe

444
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,990
someone as smart as you

445
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:52,470
can definitely

446
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,290
have it all

447
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:56,150
figured out,

448
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:57,210
right?

449
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,200
Your Highness.

450
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:05,420
Since both your grandson and granddaughter

451
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,540
are here,

452
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:07,700
I

453
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,820
will leave you guys to talk.

454
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:14,950
Mr. Jiang.

455
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,200
Take care.

456
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:25,660
Grandfather.

457
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,110
Xinbai.

458
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,290
What did

459
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,320
Mr. Lu mean?

460
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:35,340
Lu Dingzhao and Li Jun

461
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:37,780
are the ringleaders in the Zornia case.

462
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:41,230
General Nan

463
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:43,160
was also killed by them.

464
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:43,980
What?

465
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:45,590
What?

466
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,560
General Nan died?

467
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:52,310
Does Shang know?

468
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,080
Lu Dingzhao has had a trap

469
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,210
set for me.

470
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:01,440
The paintings he sent Grandfather

471
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,260
are the beginning of his trap.

472
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,400
If I expose him,

473
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,110
Grandfather

474
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:09,950
will be implicated.

475
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:11,870
I…

476
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:12,740
I…

477
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:14,790
I'm tearing it apart.

478
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:15,590
It's too late.

479
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:30,860
[Yanxing Gate]

480
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:44,540
Jiang Xinbai.

481
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:47,350
Looks like he's not coming.

482
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:51,950
Dead?

483
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:55,210
How did Nan Jifeng die?

484
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,120
On his way to Tingzhou,

485
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,950
he was ambushed and killed.

486
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:02,340
Tingzhou?

487
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:06,720
When did he leave the capital?

488
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:09,470
Why didn't he come to meet me first?

489
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,100
He…

490
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:15,420
He and I were looking for evidence.

491
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:16,680
What evidence?

492
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:19,180
The evidence that Lu Dingzhao and Li Jun

493
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:21,040
have been profiting from Zornia.

494
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:23,140
Have you found any?

495
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:29,020
Do you know

496
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:31,700
it's a felony

497
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:33,170
to falsely accuse

498
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:35,890
a high-ranking official?

499
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:38,810
I'm telling the truth.

500
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,680
Your Majesty,

501
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,700
please let me investigate them.

502
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,180
I can definitely find the evidence.

503
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:43,980
Investigate?

504
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:46,540
How?

505
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:50,110
Looking into two officials

506
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:51,540
to prove alleged crimes

507
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:54,900
or going to Tingzhou recklessly

508
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,190
to look into Nan Jifeng's death?

509
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:00,160
Both of them.

510
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:01,310
How dare you!

511
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,350
Mr. Lu and Mr. Li

512
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,540
have clean records,

513
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:05,860
while Nan Jifeng

514
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,460
was still a wanted criminal.

515
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:09,580
Without any evidence,

516
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:12,490
you want me to allow you to investigate them.

517
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,660
Do you want me to be laughed at

518
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:17,240
for not knowing right from wrong?

519
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:18,990
Your Majesty.

520
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:19,430
I…

521
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,220
Where is Jiang Xinbai?

522
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:23,820
I don't know.

523
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,870
I allowed you two to work together.

524
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:30,980
Haven't you taken my words

525
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,260
seriously?

526
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,710
I'm afraid Jiang Xinbai

527
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:36,310
doesn't know when Nan Jifeng

528
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:39,350
left the capital either.

529
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:42,440
You have nothing to say?

530
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:44,980
Guards.

531
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:48,220
Yes.

532
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,270
Cane him 100 times.

533
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:51,380
Yes.

534
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:55,980
One.

535
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:57,340
Two.

536
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:58,630
Three.

537
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:00,150
Four.

538
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,470
If it hurts,

539
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:07,850
just say it.

540
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:17,370
How could this happen?

541
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:18,820
You and Mr. Jiang…

542
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,720
Don't mention him.

543
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:54,380
Father.

544
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,270
I don't think you can

545
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:58,170
get off the hook this time.

546
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,060
Father!

547
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:01,300
Are you a fool?

548
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:02,140
Why did you

549
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,520
accept these things?

550
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,760
They're using them against us now.

551
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,390
What should we do?

552
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:05,910
Zhiyi.

553
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:08,410
Father has been deceived.

554
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,180
It's my fault.

555
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,880
I won countless wars on the battlefield,

556
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,430
yet

557
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:15,070
I've been fooled

558
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:16,640
by that old fox Lu Dingzhao.

559
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:17,980
Tomorrow,

560
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,460
I'll explain everything to His Majesty.

561
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,060
Xinbai.

562
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:24,430
Back then,

563
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,180
I gave up on your father.

564
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:27,220
This time,

565
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,540
I won't drag you down too.

566
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:31,150
No.

567
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:33,460
Since this is their trap,

568
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:35,860
I'm afraid no one will believe you're innocent.

569
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:36,420
Besides,

570
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:37,450
His Majesty

571
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:38,780
has always seen the Jiang family

572
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:39,860
as a threat.

573
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,130
If this matter

574
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:42,170
gets out of hand,

575
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,360
I'm afraid His Majesty won't help us.

576
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:46,940
Suoluo is right.

577
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:48,800
End of the day,

578
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:50,780
their target is me.

579
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,160
If anyone is to blame,

580
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:56,150
I'm to blame for dragging Grandfather in.

581
00:30:56,910 --> 00:30:57,550
Boy,

582
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,180
over the years,

583
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:02,340
because I've been busy protecting the Jiang family,

584
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,750
I've misunderstood you

585
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:05,980
and been harsh on you.

586
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:07,530
Sorry.

587
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:11,330
Lu Dingzhao is such a scumbag.

588
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,440
I won't let him

589
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:14,430
get away with it!

590
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:34,260
Sai'er?

591
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,260
Mr. Jiang.

592
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:38,430
His Majesty gave Shang the cane.

[Peace Reigns]

594
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:43,190
Mr. Jiang.

595
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:44,430
Check on Shang.

596
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:02,320
Why didn't you come?

597
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,020
Why didn't you fight back?

598
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,310
I stood you up.

599
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:14,860
I failed you

600
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,350
and General Nan.

601
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:21,340
Why did you fail us?

602
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,140
Why?

603
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:36,560
Jiang Xinbai, listen.

604
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,450
No matter what reason you have,

605
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:42,540
my brother and I

606
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:43,870
will never forgive you.

607
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,110
Shang.

608
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,280
Shang, calm down.

609
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,290
Let me treat your wounds.

610
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:51,420
They're too severe.

611
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:56,430
Let's go.

612
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,140
Slow down.

613
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,240
Be careful. Slow down.

614
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:07,840
What happened?

615
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:19,070
Shang Bieli said Lu Dingzhao and Li Jun

616
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:21,110
have been profiting from Zornia

617
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:23,580
and murdered Nan Jifeng.

618
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:25,580
Do you agree?

619
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,360
They're indeed suspicious.

620
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:29,140
But

621
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:31,620
I have no evidence.

622
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:33,140
Then, did Nan Jifeng

623
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:35,150
go to Tingzhou

624
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:38,070
to find the truth?

625
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:41,630
Yes.

626
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:45,500
General Nan

627
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:48,280
died wrongly because I was arrogant

628
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,930
and willful.

629
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:52,700
Mr. Shang

630
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:54,870
didn't know General Nan

631
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:56,620
left the capital.

632
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,700
Did he?

633
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:03,340
I didn't tell Mr. Shang about it

634
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:04,670
until General Nan left.

635
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:06,700
Mr. Shang

636
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:08,080
and General Nan

637
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:09,060
were very close.

638
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:10,320
If he had known,

639
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,179
he wouldn't have let General Nan

640
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:14,239
take the risk of leaving the capital.

641
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:16,500
General Nan's death

642
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:17,830
should be

643
00:34:18,699 --> 00:34:19,630
blamed on me.

644
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:21,690
Blamed on you?

645
00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:24,280
You're in big trouble yourself,

646
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,940
yet you're trying to help him?

647
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:28,750
You're right.

648
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:32,710
You're too arrogant.

From now on,

652
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:45,690
you're dismissed.

653
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:49,060
Go home and reflect on yourself.

00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:51,000

661

the new chief constable.

00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:55,990
I can be relieved.

665
00:36:58,070 --> 00:37:00,000
I was worried Lu Dingzhao and Li Jun

666
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,020
would get a henchman of theirs

679
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:39,030
It seems that

680
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:41,550
the death of Nan Jifeng

681
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:45,010

703
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,420
but are now drowning your sorrows

704
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:03,280
and wallowing in self-loathing.

705
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:05,820
Is this what General Nan would want to see?

706
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:14,020
I let you down, my lord.

707
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:16,770
I failed General Nan.

708
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:19,100
My lord.

709
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:22,130
Why didn't I die?

710
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:26,780
General Nan died.

711
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:29,860
I got badly injured.

712
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:33,330
You were dismissed.

713
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:36,300
Have we

714
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,620
lost the game?

715
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,480
Wickedness runs rampant.

716
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:47,390
His Majesty is merciless.

717
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:50,020
Is such a country worth saving?

718
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:52,380
Is it really worth sacrificing so much?

719
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:14,090
I remember,

720
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:16,140
when I was young,

721
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:19,360
I asked my father similar questions.

722
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:27,620
Father,

723
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:30,320
you devoted yourself to the country and the people,

724
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,660
but you ended up

725
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:33,090
being criticized by all.

726
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:33,980
Father.

727
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:36,500
Why aren't you angry?

728
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:38,060
Why?

729
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:42,880
The country asked everyone to obey me

730
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,380
because it believed

731
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:46,420
that I had some strengths

732
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:50,870
and could endure the humiliation and bear the heavy burden.

733
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:53,440
I don't understand.

734
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,550
You'll understand,

735
00:40:58,180 --> 00:40:58,690
Son.

736
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:06,680
Do you have the answer now?

737
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,430
All I know is that

738
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,440
I seem to have understood

739
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:19,150
why my father

740
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,910
was so adamant back then.

741
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:26,950
Because

742
00:41:27,890 --> 00:41:29,130
this is our mission

743
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:30,620
and duty.

744
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:34,230
Have you figured something out?

745
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:42,540
Maybe

746
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:44,700
we should try

747
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:45,580
everything.

748
00:41:46,930 --> 00:41:48,260
Even if we'll hit a wall,

749
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:50,860
it's better than doing nothing.

750
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:10,650
Take the medicine.

751
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:13,060
Get better soon.

752
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:14,500
Leave the rest

753
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:15,700
to me.

754
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:17,820
I'll find a way.

755
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:12,920
General Nan's death

756
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:15,320
was not your fault.

757
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:18,830
But General Nan died

758
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:20,860
because of me.

759
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:26,020
Maybe

760
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:29,240
when Yan Zhizhong died back then,

761
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:30,780
my father

762
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:34,060
felt the same way I do now.

763
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:35,980
No.

764
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:38,100
This is those bad guys' trap.

765
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:40,580
If you break down,

766
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:42,220
they'll get what they want.

767
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:43,720
We need to make a comeback.

768
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:49,590
Yan Nanxing.

769
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:51,230
Don't worry.

770
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:54,120
I won't break down.

771
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:56,040
And I won't give up easily.

772
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:57,820
But

773
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:00,350
I want to ask you,

774
00:44:01,770 --> 00:44:02,920
if we can't

775
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:03,870
make a comeback

776
00:44:05,350 --> 00:44:06,810
and I can't be reinstated,

777
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:07,700
or even worse,

778
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,060
if I can't stay in the capital…

779
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:13,060
That's fine.

780
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:14,440
I'll take you away.

781
00:44:14,930 --> 00:44:15,990
This is a big world.

782
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:17,920
We can always find a place to stay.

783
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:22,250
But now,

784
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:24,890
it's not time for us to give up.
