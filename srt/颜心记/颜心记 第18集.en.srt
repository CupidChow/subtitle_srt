Well...

00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:01,710
Since you'd decided

10
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:02,970
against the marriage,

11
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:04,480
why did you mock her?

It concerns your prospects and future.

how can you stay safe?

46

to the capital.

154
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:07,790
Why didn’t you

00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:09,030
come look for me?

156
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:11,710
Why should I trust

157
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:13,310
a man who can't keep his word?

158
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:15,240
What do you mean?

159
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:16,710
What do you think?

160
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,650
Explain my crime first

161
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:25,250
before convicting me.

162
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:27,670
You said

00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,050
you'd keep investigating in the capital.

164

You should know they were

sent by the Ministry of Personnel.

176

00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:04,350
Are you suspecting me?

180
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:07,350
At first,

181
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:09,070
I did.

182
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:13,710
Then why are you

183
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:14,940
looking for me now?

184
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:20,150
I know you solved

185
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,950
the Ghost Market's Zornia case,

186
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,210
eliminating a Zornia cartel

187
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:24,400
in the capital.

188
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:38,430
Just because the magistrate and lieutenant

189
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:39,960
were recommended by Li Jun,

190
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,950
you suspect he

191
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,990
and even the entire Ministry of Personnel

192
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:46,010
are overseeing the Zornia business?

193
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:47,810
As those two started framing me,

194
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:49,190
Li Jun went to His Majesty

195
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,390
to complain about me.

196
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:53,480
Is that just a coincidence?

197
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,510
Over the years,

198
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:56,960
all officials were

199
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,710
sent to Heman

200
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:59,870
through the Ministry of Personnel.

201
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:02,130
They're sealing off

202
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:02,890
a path.

203
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:15,030
I want to meet His Majesty,

204
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,840
but I haven't found a chance.

205
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,110
You're now a guilty official

206
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:24,240
who's running away.

207
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:25,850
Without evidence,

208
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:27,240
it's just nonsense.

209
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:29,530
His Majesty will only punish you.

210
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:31,370
It's not the right time

211
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:32,790
to meet him.

212
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,930
I know you're also watching the Li family.

213
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:38,620
How did you know?

214
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,190
We met when I was undercover

215
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:41,210
in the Lis' casino

216
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:42,240
to get evidence.

217
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:44,170
You didn't expose me then.

218
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:45,550
I guess you hoped

219
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:46,680
I'd find something.

220
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:52,910
Somewhat.

221
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,030
Come on, I bet you

222
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:56,840
just didn't recognize him.

223
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:02,590
So...

224
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:04,850
what've you found out?

225
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,280
I'm only cleared of half

226
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:08,640
of my suspicions of you.

227
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,560
I'll tell you when they are

228
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:11,510
all cleared.

229
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:15,260
Fine.

230
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:18,750
I want to go

231
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,280
see Bieli first.

232
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:22,150
I know you two

233
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,270
had a misunderstanding,

234
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:24,400
so I didn't go to him,

235
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,680
in case I'd add fuel to the fire.

236
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:28,470
You can't see him now.

237
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:29,420
Why?

238
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:31,710
He might be

239
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,240
related to the Zornia case.

240
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:34,510
Some Jinwu Guards

241
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:35,910
are dealing with Zornia.

242
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:37,350
Impossible!

243
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:39,910
She saw it too.

244
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:46,070
He's too close to the Li family.

245
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:47,870
I've to be wary of him.

246
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:51,550
Evidence aside,

247
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:54,210
what you saw might not be true either.

248
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:55,950
Even if you put the evidence

249
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:56,830
in front of me,

250
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,170
I'd still believe him.

251
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:02,280
Why do you

252
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:03,550
trust him so much?

253
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:07,630
We have a deep brotherly bond.

254
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:10,470
We've experienced

255
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:13,440
near-death situations together.

256
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:15,910
But people change.

257
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,190
Sometimes, trust

258
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:19,950
can't be

259
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:21,550
explained.

260
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:24,870
But I only

261
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:26,910
believe in evidence.

262
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:38,240
General Nan.

263
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,400
You’re guilty now.

264
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:41,780
If Commander Shang

265
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:42,910
knows what happened to you

266
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:44,150
and wants to avenge you,

267
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,370
we can't stop him.

268
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:47,310
Right now,

269
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:49,670
you should hide for a while

270
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:51,390
before we make plans.

271
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,290
Then

272
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:58,390
I’ll have to disturb you for a while, Dr. Yan.

273
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,030
Y-You want to stay here?

274
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:07,950
My... My place is very shabby.

275
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:09,740
I don't mind.

276
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:10,620
I do.

277
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,540
Her home's too far away.

278
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:21,600
It inconveniences your investigation in the capital.

279
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,670
Then I'll stay at your place.

280
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:26,550
No way.

281
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:32,980
I'm not used to living with others.

282
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:36,080
Where should I live then?

283
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:39,990
How about...

284
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,310
he stays in Yuejiang's Residence?

285
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:45,430
Your mother won't betray you.

286
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:46,430
Besides,

287
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,790
no one would dare search Yuejiang's Residence.

288
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:49,230
Right?

289
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,020
But my mother and I

290
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:54,710
just had a fight.

291
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:57,920
There's no grudge between mother and son.

292
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:58,870
Look.

293
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:01,130
It's a good chance to make up with her.

294
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,170
That's a good idea.

295
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:12,290
You sure accept help readily.

296
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,000
It's settled then.

297
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:22,740
[Yuejiang's Residence]

298
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:24,630
General Nan, don't worry.

299
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,780
I will protect you.

300
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:29,930
Thank you, Your Highness.

301
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:33,290
Thank you, Mother.

302
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:35,960
Don't thank me.

303
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,640
It's not for your sake.

304
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,280
But we're hiding

305
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:42,570
an imperial criminal.

306
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:43,550
General Nan.

307
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:46,070
I hope you won't go out

308
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:47,350
and

309
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,160
don't wander around inside.

310
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:50,940
Don't move unless necessary.

311
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:52,350
Yes.

312
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:55,750
Mother.

313
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:59,210
Try to keep this from Grandpa

314
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:00,120
and Suoluo.

315
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:01,940
Especially Suoluo.

316
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,720
She's friends with Shang Bieli.

317
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,840
If he knows about this,

318
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:08,590
with how impulsive he is,

319
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:10,760
he might cause trouble.

320
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:12,480
Yes, Your Highness.

321
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:14,380
The less trouble, the better.

322
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:16,000
It saves us trouble.

323
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:20,230
Okay, I'll listen to you.

324
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:21,560
I won't tell her.

325
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,120
How can family members...

326
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:28,230
keep secrets from each other?

327
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:30,520
Greetings, Mother.

328
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:32,030
Mother.

329
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:34,230
Even Dr. Yan, an outsider,

330
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:35,230
knows about it,

331
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:36,750
but you can't

332
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,080
tell me, your daughter?

333
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:41,630
Suoluo.

334
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:47,470
Be discerning about

335
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,150
what you say.

336
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,520
General Nan is Mr. Shang’s brother,

337
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,610
so he's my friend.

338
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:55,350
I won't betray him.

339
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:56,590
Also,

340
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:58,650
when it comes to my family's

341
00:16:58,650 --> 00:16:59,910
safety and interests,

342
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,120
I've always been discerning.

343
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,910
Don't worry.

344
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:18,950
Your sister knows what to do.

345
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:23,200
It's all your fault.

346
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:25,150
If you didn't mess up the blind date,

347
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:26,109
Mr. Pei could've helped us

348
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:26,950
think of a way

349
00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:27,790
to hide him.

350
00:17:27,869 --> 00:17:28,630
Mother.

351
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,070
I know

352
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:33,830
you worked hard to arrange it for me.

353
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:34,390
But

354
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,180
because I'm in danger,

355
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:37,310
I'd

356
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:39,630
rather risk my life

357
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,770
than get others involved.

358
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:42,950
Are you confused?

359
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:44,430
What do you mean?

360
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:45,630
I'm setting up

361
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:46,820
a shield for you.

362
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:53,270
Mother.

363
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,270
You are my shield.

364
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:58,470
For my mother,

365
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:01,150
I'll also protect myself.

366
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:03,240
In my heart,

367
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:05,630
you're always my shield

368
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:07,350
and my weakness.

369
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:11,820
Forget it.

370
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:14,320
Let's not mention that now.

371
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:16,070
Just for now.

372
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:18,370
Don't think I'm annoying.

373
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:19,300
In this world,

374
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:20,550
only I'd worry

375
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:21,770
about your marriage.

376
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:25,430
And Nanxing.

377
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:27,310
She's been

378
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,600
worried sick for you.

379
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:29,670
Thank her now.

380
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:32,350
I...

381
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:33,870
I will repay her.

382
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:36,350
Sure.

383
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:37,870
All right.

384
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:38,630
Go back now.

385
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:40,680
We'll leave now.

386
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:41,670
Leave it to me.

387
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:44,150
Go.

388
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:45,480
Let's go.

389
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:55,790
How do you want to repay me?

390
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:00,290
How do you want me to repay you?

391
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:04,280
I'll think about it.

392
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:29,350
Gaya.

393
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:32,870
Today is your birthday.

394
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:35,970
I'm here to talk to you.

395
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:38,820
I miss you so much.

396
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,900
What's General Nan doing?

397
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:52,990
Your Grace.

398
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,400
Today is Lady Gaya's birthday.

399
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,000
He asked us to set up an altar.

400
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:58,130
I'm on my way to report it to Princess.

401
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:58,790
Okay.

402
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:13,470
Gaya.

403
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:16,910
Why didn't you wait for me?

404
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,580
How are you doing over there?

405
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,050
-Wait for me...
-General Nan.

406
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,150
My condolences,

407
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:39,550
General.

408
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:45,790
Actually,

409
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:47,270
I'd often heard about you

410
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:48,070
from Shang.

411
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,550
I've admired you for a long time.

412
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:54,470
By the way,

413
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:56,310
I should thank you.

414
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:57,150
Thank me?

415
00:20:58,670 --> 00:20:59,590
For what?

416
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,890
You and your wife

417
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:04,350
officiated my brother's wedding in Heman.

418
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:04,960
They received

419
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,620
you and your wife's kindness.

420
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:08,960
Of course I should thank you.

421
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:10,430
You...

422
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:13,550
know about it?

423
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:15,680
Of course.

424
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:17,470
He's my brother.

425
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,640
How could I not know?

426
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:22,890
What's wrong with you?

427
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:24,670
You know he's a fugitive.

428
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:26,180
Why didn't you stop him?

429
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:28,360
How dare he set up an altar in my residence?

430
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,710
Summoning ghosts and gods?

431
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:31,110
If someone's summoned here,

432
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:32,040
who'd pay for it?

433
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:33,300
But

434
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:35,520
I feel sorry for Nanxing

435
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:37,830
for having to keep it a secret.

436
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:40,430
In the future,

437
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:42,350
our family must make it up to her.

438
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,800
Gaya once said

439
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:49,200
Yan Nanxing and Jiang Xinbai will

440
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:50,690
have three marriages.

441
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:52,030
We've held

442
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:53,850
the first one for them.

443
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:56,790
The second and third ones

444
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:59,190
depend on their fates.

445
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:02,440
What did you say?

446
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:05,430
Get up!

447
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,010
What did you say?

448
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:09,880
Who has three marriages with whom?

449
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:12,350
Xinbai's bride in Heman

450
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,470
is Yan Nanxing?

451
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:16,450
Is it Blossom Beauty's Yan Nanxing?

452
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:30,680
Say something!

453
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:33,290
You dare to get married

454
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:34,780
but not admit it?

455
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:39,990
No wonder...

456
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:42,440
You're always so indifferent,

457
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:44,190
but you treat her so well.

458
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:45,110
And you!

459
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,320
You're always so fussy,

460
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:49,640
but you can do anything for him.

461
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,720
You newlyweds

462
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,150
sure share a strong bond!

463
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:53,790
That's not it!

464
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:55,590
Back then,

465
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:56,800
we got married

466
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:57,830
to solve the case.

467
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:59,330
We just held a ceremony.

468
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:00,440
Nothing else!

469
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:04,510
W-W-What she s-said

470
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:05,680
is quite true.

471
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,270
Shut up!

472
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:09,070
Mother.

473
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:10,130
You shut up too!

474
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:13,280
Don't interfere

475
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,280
when I'm talking!

476
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:15,710
Get out!

477
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:17,880
All of you, get out!

478
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:18,800
Yan Nanxing.

479
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,300
Stay here.

480
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:25,160
I'll be outside.

481
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:27,150
If anything happens,

482
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:30,000
just call me at the door.

483
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:53,310
You went to great lengths to put on this show.

484
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:54,370
Are you satisfied?

485
00:23:58,550 --> 00:23:59,150
You three

486
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:00,670
are already in costume.

487
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:03,190
Do you blame me for asking for a show?

488
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:03,910
Suoluo.

489
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,430
You two, stop arguing.

490
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:07,960
It's all my fault.

491
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:09,690
-Shut up!
-Shut up!

492
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:12,320
Yan Nanxing.

493
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:15,670
I order you to close down Blossom Beauty

494
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:17,330
and get out of the capital!

495
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:18,880
Why?

496
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:19,720
I didn't

497
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,990
come here for Jiang Xinbai

498
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:22,250
but for my own affairs.

499
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:23,790
I don't care.

500
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:26,170
I'm the Princess of Yuejiang.

501
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:28,480
Even if I abuse my power to punish you,

502
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,440
what can you do?

503
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:31,010
This is unfair.

504
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:32,150
Marriage

505
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:33,410
is between two people.

506
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:34,790
You've let your dear son off,

507
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:35,350
but

508
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:37,370
you're finding fault with me.

509
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:39,970
How dare you talk back?

510
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:41,270
Guards!

511
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,450
Kick her out!

512
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:51,950
Mother!

513
00:24:58,270 --> 00:24:59,530
Be it the Heman wedding

514
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,080
or keeping it from you,

515
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:02,510
I did it all on my own.

516
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,480
It's unrelated to Yan Nanxing.

517
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:07,830
Jiang Xinbai.

518
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:09,450
Listen carefully.

519
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,470
Your marriage

520
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:12,400
concerns the whole family.

521
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:13,990
You can't be willful.

522
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:15,630
Tie her up!

523
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:15,940
Yes.

524
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,820
Don't you dare!

525
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:22,810
A country has its laws.

526
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:24,170
A family has its rules.

527
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,350
She didn't break the law.

528
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,300
She also divorced me long ago,

529
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:29,630
so she need not

530
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:31,250
abide by our family's rules.

531
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:35,590
Fine.

532
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:37,910
I'll show you

533
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,030
a 100 ways to make her

534
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:42,000
close down her shop

535
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:43,490
and get out of the capital!

536
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:48,310
What's wrong?

537
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:49,390
Do you not

538
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:50,790
receive male customers?

539
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:58,580
Who said that?

540
00:25:58,830 --> 00:25:59,510
Today,

541
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,200
we'll only receive

542
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,410
male customers.

543
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:03,950
Sai'er, Ruoqian,

544
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,270
let's show these customers

545
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:07,470
our hospitality.

546
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,720
-Okay!
-Okay!

547
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:13,830
I'm really sorry, everyone.

548
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:14,400
Here.

549
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:16,240
This is a small token of appreciation.

550
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,440
Take it back to use it.

551
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:18,640
Thank you.

552
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,900
Sorry for the trouble.

553
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:20,790
Next time,

554
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:21,870
we'll serve you well.

555
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:22,630
Okay, thank you.

556
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:23,340
This is for you.

557
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,740
I'm really sorry.

558
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:25,760
Next time...

559
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:30,270
What's wrong?

560
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:32,620
Nothing.

561
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:34,550
See you next time.

562
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:36,170
I'll give you a 50% discount.

563
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:39,670
Be gentle!

564
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:40,590
Ouch!

565
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:41,210
Be gentle!

566
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,060
Is this how you serve

567
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:43,780
customers?

568
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,000
I'll report you!

569
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:46,190
If you

570
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:48,100
aren't satisfied with our service,

571
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,300
you don't have to pay.

572
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:51,710
If you're here to make a scene,

573
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,990
I’ll have to report you

574
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:54,450
to the Inspection Office.

575
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:55,870
I remember.

576
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:58,190
You smashed so many things

577
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,540
in my shop just now.

578
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:00,950
Ruoqian.

579
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:03,230
You're familiar with our dynasty's law.

580
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:04,070
Tell us.

581
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:05,970
How long will they be detained

582
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:07,310
for smashing things?

583
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:08,550
70 days.

584
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:10,500
70?

585
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,260
Still wanna make a scene?

586
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:18,390
Move!

587
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:20,950
Move aside!

588
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:23,680
What are you looking at? Stop looking.

589
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:26,620
Remember to return our basket!

590
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:39,510
I'm so mad!

591
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:40,750
My head's about to explode!

592
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:41,550
You know what?

593
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:43,040
She bullied my men!

594
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,380
Suoluo.

595
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:45,200
Listen.

596
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:46,830
Use whatever method

597
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:47,800
you can

598
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:48,610
so Yan Nanxing

599
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:49,790
can't gain a foothold in the capital

600
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:50,470
and gets out of here.

601
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:51,800
The sooner, the better.

602
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:53,710
I know you're resourceful.

603
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:54,920
Don't tell me you can't.

604
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,760
You can, right?

605
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,590
Don't worry, Mother.

606
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:57,580
You must get it done.

607
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:58,230
Leave it to me.

608
00:27:58,230 --> 00:27:58,380
Okay.

609
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:59,580
You'll be satisfied.

610
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:01,160
This fan's useless.

611
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,060
I'm so hot.

612
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:03,400
I'm so angry!

613
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:10,110
I've bought this house.

614
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:12,110
Please move out

615
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:13,670
in a day.

616
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:17,850
Here's the compensation fee.

617
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:20,390
Fine.

618
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:22,100
I still have Blossom Beauty.

619
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,960
I've also bought Blossom Beauty.

620
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:26,510
Please move out of it

621
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:27,950
in a day too.

622
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:29,880
You're Imperial Academy's chancellor,

623
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,710
yet you resort to such dirty tricks.

624
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:32,550
Ms. Yan.

625
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,040
I've already told you that

626
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:36,060
since you're my brother's friend,

627
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,340
you aren't my friend.

628
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:39,160
If you aren't my friend,

629
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:40,280
you're my enemy.

630
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:42,390
You chose it yourself.

631
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:45,480
Luckily,

632
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:47,430
I chose to be friends

633
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:48,510
with your brother.

634
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:49,450
He's stubborn,

635
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:50,310
but he isn't

636
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:52,910
indiscriminate and spiteful like you.

637
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:54,750
As an outsider,

638
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:56,480
you have no right to compare us.

639
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:00,360
If I can't stay here,

640
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:02,370
I'll find someplace else.

641
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,440
With money,

642
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:05,510
I won't have trouble finding a place.

643
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:06,830
I'm afraid no one here

644
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:08,990
would dare be your landlord.

645
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:11,030
Ms. Yan.

646
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:12,390
The world is vast.

647
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:15,020
Why don't you go somewhere else?

648
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:17,310
Don’t you worry about me.

649
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19,550
This is still my home today.

650
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:20,890
Your Grace,

651
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,290
I won't send you off.

652
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:26,670
Take your time to pack up.

653
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:30,150
I forgot.

654
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:33,710
There are many people in the capital lately.

655
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:35,110
The inns are all full.

656
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:37,520
It won't be easy to find a place.

657
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:43,190
Bullying with your power!

658
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:44,920
One bad apple spoils the bunch!

659
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:57,150
That's the situation.

660
00:29:58,190 --> 00:29:59,070
We'll be closed

661
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:00,670
for the time being.

662
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:02,480
Not necessarily, Boss.

663
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:06,860
I've written three petitions.

664
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:09,260
Report this to the Ministry of Revenue.

665
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,100
[To: Ministry of Revenue
From: Liu Ruoqian]

666
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:12,070
Report this to the Ministry of Personnel.

667
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,140
[To: Ministry of Personnel
From: Liu Ruoqian]

668
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,550
And this one

669
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:15,140
[To: His Majesty
From: Liu Ruoqian]

670
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:15,630
can be presented to His Majesty.

671
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:18,230
Although I haven't figured out

672
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:19,870
how I'd get it to His Majesty,

673
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:22,120
we can't sit back and do nothing

674
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,470
and let these nobles

675
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:24,510
bully us.

676
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:26,430
Ruoqian.

677
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:28,640
This is too troublesome.

678
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:29,630
Boss.

679
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:30,470
Let's take

680
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:31,750
the efficient route.

681
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:32,950
Tonight,

682
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:34,750
I'll sneak into Duke's residence.

683
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:35,430
With

684
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:36,740
this blade

685
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,200
on the Princess' neck,

686
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,400
she'll stop messing with us.

687
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:48,150
Boss.

688
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:51,430
Sai'er, Ruoqian.

689
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:53,600
These are your salaries

690
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:55,190
for this and next month.

691
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:56,840
Keep it well.

692
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:58,750
It’s enough for a while.

693
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,660
Wait, Boss.

694
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:02,510
We haven't worked for it yet.

695
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:03,670
How can we accept it?

696
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:04,290
Take it back.

697
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:04,810
Yes.

698
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:06,600
We can't accept this money.

699
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:07,790
Take it.

700
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:12,510
Just take it.

701
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:14,350

She and Mother are in a fight.

878
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:23,010
What if she

879
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:23,970
spouts nonsense

880
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:25,510
outside

881
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:26,430
about us hiding

882
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:27,710
an imperial criminal?

883
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:29,310
You keep everything from me.

884
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:30,610
Even Yan Nanxing knows

885
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:31,340
more than me.

886
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:34,170
Yan Nanxing will never

887
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:35,290
hurt anyone

888
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:37,310
for her own selfish reasons.

889
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:38,470
Why are you so sure

890
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:39,950
she won't betray us?

891
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:41,190
Just because

892
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:42,270
she was once your woman?

893
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:42,750
Yes.

894
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:44,790
Because she's my woman.

895
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,080
I trust her.

896
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:51,390
I'm afraid you're blinded

897
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:52,220
by love.

898
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:55,650
Things only turned out like this

899
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:57,380
as you offended Mother for her.

900
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:00,850
So you couldn't tell right from wrong

901
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:02,210
and drove her away?

902
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:04,550
That was Mother's order.

903
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:05,570
As a child,

904
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:06,830
it's natural to share

905
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:08,030
their parents' burdens.

906
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:09,080
It's filial piety.

907
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,920
But if our parents are in the wrong,

908
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,720
we should point out the mistakes

909
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:14,390
instead of letting them be a laughingstock

910
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:15,230
by defending

911
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:16,850
their so-called dignity.

912
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:18,930
This is the real filial piety.

913
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:20,390
You have your reasons

914
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:22,150
and I have my reasons.

915
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:23,070
Your reasons?

916
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:26,910
Let's put aside Yan Nanxing.

917
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,970
You asked Shang Bieli to take away Nan Jifeng.

918
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:32,470
Ruling out your suspicion of Yan Nanxing,

919
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:33,930
what logic warrants that?

920
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:34,870
I told you.

921
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:37,260
This is the best-case scenario

922
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:38,050
for General Nan

923
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:39,170
and our family.

924
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:41,890
I have a clear conscience.

925
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:43,480
A clear conscience?

926
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:46,310
Suoluo.

927
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:48,150
You always say

928
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:49,760
I'm the one endangering

929
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,910
our family.

930
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:53,670
But have you ever thought about

931
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:55,580
how your actions

932
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,630
are really trapping our family

933
00:41:57,630 --> 00:41:58,430
in injustice?

934
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:04,800
Benevolence, justice, loyalty, bravery.

935
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:07,070
This is our ancestral motto.

936
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:11,950
The Jiangs have earned great military merits for generations.

937
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:13,030
It's not for honor

938
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:15,230
but for the country

939
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:16,790
and the people.

940
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:19,730
As a Jiang descendant,

941
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:21,870
if you only care about our family's

942
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:23,130
safety and interests,

943
00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:24,670
you'll truly be

944
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:26,270
letting our ancestors down.

945
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:29,300
Be it investigating Zornia

946
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:31,050
or saving Nan Jifeng,

947
00:42:31,870 --> 00:42:32,990
I've lived up

948
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:34,550
to our ancestral

949
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:35,270
motto.

950
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:37,530
But what about you?

951
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:39,810
What have you done?

952
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:45,800
To think you're

953
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:47,810
Imperial Academy's chancellor.

954
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:49,190
Suoluo.

955
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:51,890
You've really let me down.

956
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,170
His Majesty conferred the title on me.

957
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,700
It's not up to you whether I deserve it or not.

958
00:43:05,990 --> 00:43:07,280
I have work to do.

959
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:08,230
Goodbye.
