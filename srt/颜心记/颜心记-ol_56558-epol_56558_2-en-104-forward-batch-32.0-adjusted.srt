4
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:32,310
It's him!

5
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,110
Oh no.

6
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,710
Why is he staring at me?

7
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:39,190
His clothes and hairstyle...

8
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,060
You are?

9
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:53,500
Why did he touch me?

10
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:54,950
What does he want?

11
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:00,079
This...

12
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,320
lady.

13
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:03,230
It's late.

14
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:05,240
What are you doing in the water?

15
00:03:07,579 --> 00:03:08,110
You...

16
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,400
Miss?

17
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:11,880
He's kidding me, right?

18
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:14,950
But I don't think

19
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:16,480
he's joking with me either.

20
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:19,030
Or is it because it's dark now,

21
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,400
and he can't see me clearly?

22
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:29,329
Do I have to pull you up?

23
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,610
No, I'll be exposed.

24

Search every ship!

25
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:36,270
Yes.

26
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,490
Hurry! Search carefully.

27
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,620
Some of you go over there!

28
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:21,470
Miss.

29
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,120
Are you okay?

30
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:27,950
You guys go over there.

31
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:28,440
Yes.

32
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:30,550
Get up.

33
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:32,010
Hurry! Search carefully.

34
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:33,550
Come on, get up.

35
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:34,800
This way.

36
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,460
Search carefully.

37
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:37,120
Over there.

38
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:40,800
Be careful!

39
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:53,950
Hey!

40
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:07,380
Miss.

41
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:10,280
Are you really okay?

42
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:14,930
Well...

43
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:16,830
Your hands,

44
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,530
and your feet...

45
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,310
Stop trying to hide.

46
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:40,440
The boat is rocking.

47
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:43,150
Stop.

48
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,600
It's a man's hands and feet.

49
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,850
Why did he disguise as a woman?

50
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,060
It's you again.

51
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,550
By the sound of his voice,

52
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:17,780
it's Lieutenant General Li,

53
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:20,580
who almost took me away from the theatre last time.

54
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:22,550
Officer.

55
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:23,990
How have you been?

56
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:25,230
Who's inside?

57
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:28,870
It's a lady in there.

58
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:30,310
Please excuse us.

59
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,150
A lady?

60
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,040
You mean a courtesan?

61
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,760
Have you seen a man?

62
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,470
They are looking for

63
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:38,190
the man who just came up

64
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,470
dressed as a woman?

65
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,210
Did this man have something to do with

66
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:43,070
the riot at the General's Residence?

67
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,400
He must know something.

68
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:45,510
A man?

69
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,530
What kind of man?

70
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:50,310
What's his age or height?

71
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:52,280
Any distinguishing features?

72
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:54,300
A man! That's it!

73
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:56,990
Officer.

74
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:58,590
It's already late.

75
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,750
Yet, you are disturbing everyone with your search.

76
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:01,870
Besides his gender,

77
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:03,160
you can't even tell me the characteristics

78
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,180
of the person you are looking for.

79
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:06,110
It's dark, and it happened all of a sudden.

80
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:07,510
I didn't see him clearly!

81
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,190
Who are you putting on airs with?

82
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:11,470
You've misunderstood.

83
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:12,470
I just want to say

84
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:14,260
there is no man here

85
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,590
that you're looking for.

86
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:17,390
That's not up to you to conclude.

87
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,390
We wouldn't know until we search.

88
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:19,980
Officer.

89
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,270
Without an official order,

90
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:26,070
it's not right to trespass

91
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,830
people's private property.

92
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,830
So what? I'll just break in.

93
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:34,470
Officer.

94
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:37,630
The General's Residence will be

95
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:38,110
held accountable

96
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:39,840
for your stubborn insistence.

97
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,920
Are you sure you want to do this?

98
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,290
That makes sense.

99
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:45,910
He's saving me?

100
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,320
He doesn't even know who I am now.

101
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,590
Why is he helping me?

102
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,510
No, I can't get him into trouble.

103
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,750
I will insist on

104
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,030
searching today.

105
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:54,650
Lieutenant General Li,

106
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:55,580
he's over there!

107
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:56,310
Go!

108
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:28,980
[Notice of arrest]

109
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,090
Isn't she the female doctor named Yan Nanxing?

110
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:30,730
Didn't she run a free clinic just a few days ago?

111
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:32,390
She looked like a good person.

112
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,190
When she was treating

113
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:35,100
Madam last night,

114
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,630
a man suddenly appeared.

115
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,470
General and Madam suspect that

116
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:40,070
they colluded

117
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:41,350
to murder Madam.

118
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:42,590
And I heard that

119
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:43,360
many strange things

120
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,240
have been happening in the nearby villages.

121
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:45,950
Maybe it's the work of

122
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:47,810
this mother-and-daughter gang.

123
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,320
If we go with what you said,

124
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:53,510
there should be one more man from last night

125
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:55,310
that the General's Residence is looking for.

126
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:56,470
Why is it just the two of them

127
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:57,910
on the wanted poster?

128
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:02,550
That means the mother and daughter are the key.

129
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:03,310
By the way,

130
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:04,750
Phantom Physician

131
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,750
is staying at a shabby temple 20 miles away from the city.

132
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,750
She seems to be waiting for someone.

133
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:11,110
She must be waiting for Yan Nanxing.

134
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:14,240
We must find Yan Nanxing

135
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,429
before Nan Jifeng does.

136
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:16,670
I want to know

137
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:17,960
what happened at

138
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,960
Nan Jifeng's residence that night.

139
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,750
It even drove Nan Jifeng

140
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,950
to issue an arrest warrant far and wide.

141
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,880
It must be something serious.

142
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:28,500
You suspect it's related to the Zornia plant?

143
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:31,150
Yao.

144
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,190
I'm heading out of town.

145
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:35,250
You stay in the town to look for clues.

146
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:37,520
At the same time,

147
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,170
get rid of our stalker.

148
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:42,510
But Sir, you don't recognize faces,

149
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,550
nor are you familiar with the place.

150
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:46,590
This isn't my first mission.

151
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:48,360
What are you worried about?

152
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,410
For some reason,

153
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:51,230
I feel that you've

154
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:53,110
met your opponent this time.

155
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,110
Just Yan Nanxing?

156
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,990
It's been four or five days.

157
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:19,670
Why haven't I changed back?

158
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,010
Oh dear moon.

159
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:25,370
You're really messing with me, aren't you?

160
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:26,460
When you have a full moon,

161
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,510
I'll get my period.

162
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:29,070
And when I get my period, I will shapeshift into someone else.

163
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:30,390
And I always get in trouble whenever I shapeshift.

164
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:32,270
And whenever I am in trouble, I will rant to you.

165
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,530
Aren't you tired of it?

166
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,060
Even if you aren't, I am.

167
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:48,720
That was a hard fall.

168
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:51,010
It hurts so much.

169
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,240
I've shapeshifted back!

170
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,220
When did it happen?

171
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:15,230
This weather

172
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:17,200
is more fickle than I am.

173
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,080
Forget it.

174
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,370
I can't afford to offend.

175
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:34,070
Did she become a snail

176
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:35,190
or a turtle?

177
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:36,810
Why hasn't she come back yet?

178
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:12,310
Why did the whistle suddenly stop?

179
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:15,320
The old lady is slacking off again.

180
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:18,000
Fortunately, I'm already nearby.

181
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:23,320
Where are you?

182
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:31,270
Sir, I'm sorry.

183
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:35,830
Madam.

184
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:39,530
Aren't you being

185
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:41,390
too accurate with the horse dung?

186
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:42,870
Oh, you're a girl.

187
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:44,310
I'm really sorry.

188
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,190
If you don't mind,

189
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,630
go in and get changed

190
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:48,600
before you continue.

191
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,230
Forget it.

192
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:51,080
I have something on.

193
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:53,430
See you.

194
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:10,870
Let go of me.

195
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:15,920
Handsome young man,

196
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,590
why are you tying me up here?

197
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,190
Don't worry.

198
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:22,670
I won't roast you.

199
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,200
Don't burn the house down.

200
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:27,390
Let go of me.

201
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:28,470
Tell me.

202
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:31,750
What did you and your daughter

203
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:32,590
do in Heman?

204
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:35,350
Why does General Nan want you arrested?

205
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:37,870
Why should I tell you?

206
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,700
Tell me everything you know.

207
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:42,270
If your daughter

208
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:43,730
has been wrongly accused,

209
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:46,360
I can guarantee her safety.

210
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:51,070
Why are you laughing?

211
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:54,390
You don't look like

212
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:57,400
someone sent by the General's Residence.

213
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:58,790
Are you here

214
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:00,290
to deal with that General?

215
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:28,920
What do you want?

216
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:33,670
Be quiet.

217
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,240
It's him again.

218
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:06,520
The smell of horse dung?

219
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:11,530
A horse dealer?

220
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:16,830
Young man,

221
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:18,270
please...

222
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:21,130
find somewhere else to rest.

223
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,320
He doesn't recognize me?

224
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:26,310
Or did he forget me so soon?

225
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:27,830
My face

226
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:29,650
might not be the most beautiful,

227
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,070
but at least

228
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:32,270
I'm pretty as a fairy.

229
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:33,910
How could he forget me

230
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:34,870
so quickly?

231
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:47,560
There's a teahouse nearby.

232
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,070
Go have some tea.

233
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,480
Consider it my treat.

234
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,390
Is he trying to warn me of danger?

235
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:08,510
Could it be an ambush by the authorities?

236
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:13,590
Go.

237
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:32,630
Thanks.

238
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,079
The older, the wiser.

239
00:17:51,109 --> 00:17:52,550
I'm aging like fine wine.

240
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:54,910
Handsome young man, get some sleep.

241
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:30,580
I knew you were unreliable.

242
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:31,990
What do you mean,

243
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:33,720
"Everything's fine with Mum?"

244
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:34,920
What now?

245
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:36,300
You can't even find him.

246
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:40,190
Let's get rid of your bad luck.

247
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,270
Do you know how many constables were there?

248
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:44,630
I've been dodging left and right,

249
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:45,760
trying to avoid them

250
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:47,150
like a wild monkey.

251
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:49,110
I'm exhausted.

252
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:50,350
Listen.

253
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,370
We're in trouble this time.

254
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:53,590
We're being blamed for all the bad things done by

255
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,630
female thieves in the neighboring provinces

256
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:56,160
who haven't been arrested.

257
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:57,030
Really?

258
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:00,400
Who can we blame?

259
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:01,760
It's all your fault.

260
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:04,170
You insisted on running away from home.

261
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:05,230
If you didn't,

262
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:06,230
how could you be poisoned by

263
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,680
some unbelievable shapeshifting poison?

264
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,830
If you weren't poisoned,

265
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:09,470
we wouldn't need to

266
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:10,370
go to the General's Residence

267
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:12,030
to steal the damned antidote.

268
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,230
How dare you blame me?

269
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:15,460
If you hadn't used me

270
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,790
as a guinea pig since young to test drugs,

271
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:17,830
would I run away from home?

272
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:18,550
If I hadn't,

273
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:19,950
would I even get poisoned?

274
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:20,950
If I hadn't,

275
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:21,910
would I shapeshift every month

276
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:22,910
when I'm on my period?

277
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:24,190
It's all your fault.

278
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:25,910
Forget it.

279
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:28,530
I told you, we don't get along.

280
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:29,550
As usual,

281
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:30,490
let's split up.

282
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:36,710
Fine, let's split.

283
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:39,150
We're definitely not compatible in our ba-zi.

284
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:41,180
We'll definitely be unlucky if we stay together.

285
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,110
You've got the nerve to dislike me?

286
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,030
So what?

287
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:47,430
You're all grown up now.

288
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:48,510
You can go to anywhere you want.

289
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:49,610
What am I supposed to do with you?

290
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:50,740
Then leave me alone.

291
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,880
What? You're missing me already?

292
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,110
Don't forget.

293
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,190
When you're traveling around,

294
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:08,910
remember to help me ask around about that matter.

295
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:09,710
What matter?

296
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:11,800
It's about that person.

297
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,070
Who?

298
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:14,710
That one.

299
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:18,990
That young man?

300
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:21,190
Okay, I got it.

301
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:22,430
I'll ask around

302
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,110
to see if he is still alive.

303
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:26,710
Of course he is.

304
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:28,110
I'm asking you to find out

305
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:29,510
where he is.

306
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:31,510
I got it, little girl.

307
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,690
I really owe you from my past life.

308
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:35,540
Be careful out there.

309
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:36,750
Take care.

310
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:37,750
Well...

311
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:42,710
You take care too.

312
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,720
So naggy.

313
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:00,830
It's you.

314
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:03,080
You helped me several times.

315
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:03,830
I was hoping to find you

316
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:04,630
and thank you.

317
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:11,780
What do you mean?

318
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,260
Tie yourself up first.

319
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:16,070
You want to arrest me?

320
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,700
I ask that you do it yourself.

321
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:19,310
I won't be gentle.

322
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:20,920
I don't want to hurt you.

323
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:27,270
Okay.

324
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:03,430
You don’t want to go back to Heman?

325
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:04,960
Judging from what you said,

326
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:07,190
there's still room for discussion?

327
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:08,270
Of course.

328
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,750
I could have captured

329
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:11,880
your mother as well.

330
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,550
But I had let her go.

331
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,190
So I have to thank you instead?

332
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:16,100
No need.

333
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:18,550
I already know

334
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:19,830
how you offended

335
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:20,550
Nan Jifeng.

336
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:22,970
I want to help you.

337
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,480
How did you know?

338
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,450
On the same night of your accident,

339
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:27,520
your accomplice

340
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,340
broke into my pleasure boat.

341
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:30,770
He was the one who told me.

342
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:32,430
My accomplice?

343
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:36,030
It was a man.

344
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:39,390
He disguised himself as a woman that night,

345
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:41,180
didn't he?

346
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:42,870
Yes.

347
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:44,320
He's my accomplice.

348
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:46,240
What did he tell you?

349
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,800
He didn't make it clear either.

350
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:50,510
So,

351
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:51,670
if you could

352
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:52,930
explain more clearly,

353
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:54,470
I can also help you better.

354
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:58,990
Why are you laughing?

355
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:01,540
I laughed at how good you are at tying people up,

356
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:04,670
but you're not very good at getting words out of someone.

357
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:09,110
In that case,

358
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,680
when we first met

359
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:11,680
at the theater,

360
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:14,040
you had no intention to help me.

361
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:15,310
You approached me

362
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,860
with an ulterior motive.

363
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:20,710
But you got your grand plan

364
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:21,470
all wrong.

365
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,280
The reason why I'm wanted

366
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:24,830
has nothing to do with

367
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:26,250
what you're trying to do.

368
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,760
Let's not

369
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:28,720
waste time here.

370
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:29,960
Let me go.

371
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,470
Retreat.

372
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:30,890
What are you doing?

373
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,350
You already kissed me once, and you want a second time?

374
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:35,610
What are you thinking?

375
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:38,310
Yesterday, I was saving your life by giving you oxygen.

376
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:40,310
I was trying to save you just now too.

377
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:41,870
We've kissed anyway.

378
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:43,570
You can say whatever you want.

379
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:52,270
Don't bother trying.

380
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:53,750
You won't be able to untie

381
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:54,950
the knots that I tied.

382
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:56,770
Then help me untie it.

383
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,520
I won't run away.

384
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:02,370
Even if you want to run,

385
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:04,480
you have to treat your wound first.

386
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:07,760
Otherwise, you won't get far even if you run.

387
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:17,080
Are you feeling better?

388
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:18,470
Untie me.

389
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:39,980
Where are we?

390
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:44,110
We were swept here by the rapids.

391
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:49,670
Let's take a look over there.

392
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:19,420
Zornia.

393
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:27,950
It originates from Lanna.

394
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:28,990
It has a peculiar spiritual nature,

395
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:30,480
and it's beyond ordinary reach.

396
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,080
But this plant is poisonous.

397
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:34,910
Zornia?

398
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,490
Why is there

399
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:37,950
such a large Zornia field?

400
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,280
Be careful.

401
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:42,340
It's a really large Zornia field.

402
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,700
If you inhale the Zornia flower's pollen,

403
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:46,030
it can lead to hallucinogenic poisoning.

404
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,310
Since someone is planting Zornia here,

405
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,350
it means someone

406
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:51,350
lives nearby.

407
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:53,870
Let's find a place to stay

408
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:55,470
and find out what's going on.

409
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:56,750
Stay?

410
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:59,030
Those who grow Zornia are not good people.

411
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:00,290
How can we settle down?

412
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:04,710
It hurts.

413
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:09,350
It hurts.

414
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:15,950
She has a sickly pallor

415
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:16,950
She's injured.

416
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:21,090
Her pulse is also erratic.

417
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:22,070
This is clearly

418
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:23,800
the symptom of being poisoned.

419
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:24,550
What?

420
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:25,790
It's that serious?

421
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:27,030
We should find her family

422
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:27,630
first.

423
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:28,640
Little girl.

424
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:35,470
Yuda!

425
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:37,190
Yuda!

426
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:38,250
Yuda!

427
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:39,030
Granny!

428
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:39,910
Granny.

429
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:41,550
What happened?

430
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:42,370
What's going on?

431
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:43,210
Yuda is gone.

432
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,240
Yuda is gone?

433
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:45,070
What's going on?

434
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:45,630
Yuda!

435
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:46,860
Everyone, come here.

436
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:48,680
Please look for the kid.

437
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:50,790
Let's go.

438
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:51,870
Let's split up.

439
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:52,910
Let's go.

440
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:58,870
Where can we find her?

441
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:04,430
Over there.

442
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:05,270
Let's go.

443
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,390
Yuda!

444
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:07,550
Yuda!

445
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:08,590
Yuda!

446
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:09,910
Yuda!

447
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:12,470
Go away!

448
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:14,910
Yuda!

449
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:16,030
Yuda!

450
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:16,710
Granny,

451
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:18,050
is she your granddaughter?

452
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:19,910
We don't welcome outsiders here.

453
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:21,620
Leave now!

454
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:23,550
Leave now!

455
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:25,030
Judging from your accent,

456
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,220
you're from Lanna.

457
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,390
It's none of your business.

458
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:28,350
Go. Leave now.

459
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,180
Lanna?

460
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:31,350
Stop talking to them.

461
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:33,810
Get lost!

462
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:34,450
Get lost!

463
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:35,000
Child.

464
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:36,570
What's wrong with her?

465
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:38,200
I don't feel good.

466
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:38,710
Yuda!

467
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:39,710
Let me take a look.

468
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,400
Granny,

469
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:41,760
the little girl is sick.

470
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:43,060
Let me treat her first.

471
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:43,860
I'm a doctor.

472
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:45,120
Can you do it?

473
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:45,910
Can you?

474
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:46,560
Can you?

475
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,790
I really am a doctor.

476
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:49,830
Granny, please trust me.

477
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:50,830
I'm a doctor.

478
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:52,150
Look.

479
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:54,370
I have an acupuncture bag.

480
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:55,150
Look,

481
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:56,430
I have an acupuncture bag.

482
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:57,560
I really am a doctor.

483
00:30:58,790 --> 00:30:59,430
Granny.

484
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:00,990
Then please save her.

485
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:01,750
Save her.

486
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,560
I don't feel good.

487
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:07,750
I don't feel good.

488
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:15,410
♫Sit with you at night and listen to the wind♫

489
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,840
♫When the wind flutters, the heart does too♫

490
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:22,610
♫Step by step, no words are spoken♫

491
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:26,120
♫Barged into sight♫

492
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:30,030
♫When did your figure grow hazy?♫

493
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:33,390
♫And how clear is it?♫

494
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:36,250
♫I don't intend to break your heart♫

495
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:39,030
♫Silently fall into my arms♫

496
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:41,670
How's the child?

497
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:44,230
I think she's better now.

498
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:47,510
Granny,

499
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:50,170
why didn't you take her to the doctor?

500
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:52,850
Because they would be driven out.

501
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:54,710
Within Daqi,

502
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:56,900
planting Zornia is a crime.

503
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:58,750
Once discovered,

504
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:00,270
all the villagers

505
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:01,870
will be expelled.

506
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:04,080
Lanna has been subjugated.

507
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,830
They don't dare to go out to find a doctor.

508
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:07,510
We didn't touch the Zornia.

509
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:11,000
Lanna was destroyed because of Zornia.

510
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:14,430
We hate it more than you do.

511
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:15,790
Then why

512
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:18,280
did the child become like this?

513
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,830
The kids don't know.

514
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,710
When the Zornia plant grows,

515
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:25,140
they always go to the fields.

516
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,150
After all, I can't

517
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:28,350
lock them up at home.

518
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:29,980
As time passed,

519
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,550
she fell sick.

520
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:36,270
This is why

521
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,100
she got this sickness.

522
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:43,580
Granny,

523
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:45,380
who planted

524
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,400
the Zornia field?

525
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:02,350
Is she really in pain?

526
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:06,230
Her pulse is unstable

527
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:07,400
and she's pale.

528
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:08,780
Is this not enough?

529
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:10,590
I just want to know

530
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:13,110
how serious it is.

531
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,240
Yuda!

532
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:16,110
She can barely

533
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:17,060
make a sound now.

534
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:20,010
When the illness attacks,

535
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:21,430
erythema

536
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:23,980
will grow all over.

537
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,870
One will be extremely itchy

538
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:27,720
and one's breathing will become unstable.

539
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,850
As time passes,

540
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:30,560
one's limbs will be cold

541
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:31,700
and go into shock,

542
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,700
until one dies untreated.

543
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,290
You must save us.

544
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:38,550
You must save my child.

545
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:39,990
Granny,

546
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:41,710
I will save her.

547
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:43,230
Really?

548
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:46,130
Please save her.

549
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:47,590
I’ll find a way now.

550
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,370
Yan Nanxing.

551
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:52,110
I'm sorry.

552
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:00,870
Aren't you just

553
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:01,790
a traveling doctor who can only

554
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,090
treat facial paralysis?

555
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:04,830
Why do you know how to cure this disease?

556
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:06,270
Don't underestimate traveling doctors.

557
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:07,400
We're very capable.

558
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:11,610
This is a matter of life and death.

559
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:12,510
I never

560
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:15,170
joke around with people's lives.

561
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:17,810
Don't get in the way if you can't help.

562
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:19,120
Yan Nanxing!

563
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:32,880
Yan Nanxing.

564
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:36,370
A terminal illness

565
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:37,850
can't be cured overnight.

566
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:40,290
If you don't explain yourself today,

567
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:42,050
I won't let you continue.

568
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:45,030
If you consume

569
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:46,219
processed Zornia for years,

570
00:34:46,219 --> 00:34:47,880
the treatment will take time,

571
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:49,290
but Yuda

572
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:51,960
has only been in contact with Zornia powder

573
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:52,830
and got a toxic rash.

574
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:54,480
Inducing vomiting is sufficient

575
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,409
Do you understand what I'm saying?

576
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:16,960
Your arm is injured.

577
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:18,929
Let me do it.

578
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:21,960
You can wait on the side.

579
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:03,550
Yan Nanxing.

580
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:07,510
You brought me into the mountain

581
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:08,870
to pick these poisonous herbs

582
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:10,470
that even pests won't touch.

583
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:12,590
Plus this...

584
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:15,720
cow manure

585
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,810
and horse urine?

586
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:20,580
You call this medicine?

587
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:23,590
These things

588
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,350
are foul and poisonous

589
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:26,750
to you mundane people,

590
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:28,810
but after I give them my magical touch,

591
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:30,010
they become quality items

592
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:31,250
for detoxification.

593
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:37,410
That's easy for you to say.

594
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:40,110
That child is so weak.

595
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:41,150
If she

596
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:42,270
eats this stuff

597
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:43,870
and really vomits

598
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:44,930
everything in her—

599
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:46,870
Don't jinx her.

600
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:50,030
Listen.

601
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:52,490
I can definitely cure her.

602
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:57,030
You...

603
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:33,440
How is the child?

604
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:37,480
She's a bit better after taking the medicine.

605
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:42,830
By the way,

606
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,510
there's something

607
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:45,990
that I find strange.

608
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:47,710
Why are there no young people

609
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:48,750
in this village?

610
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:50,550
I'm afraid

611
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:51,950
they either died

612
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:53,550
or ran away

613
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:55,570
because of the Zornia.

614
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:32,270
You're awake!

615
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:33,430
Miss,

616
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:35,590
did you save me?

617
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:36,320
Yes.

618
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:38,270
It's nothing.

619
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,510
Are you feeling better?

620
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:41,470
Da.

621
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:43,330
-Grandma.
-Da.

622
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:44,900
You're awake.

623
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:48,150
Grandma.

624
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:53,640
Miss, thank you.

625
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,590
It's my pleasure.

626
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:55,190
Thank you.

627
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:07,230
Granny,

628
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:10,230
where's that guy?

629
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:12,500
He went to the Zornia field.

630
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:24,470
Father,

631
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:26,380
you devoted yourself to the country and the people,

632
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,990
[The former chief constable of the Inspection Office, Xi Zhaoming]

633
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:28,360
but you ended up

634
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:29,790
being criticized by all.

635
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:31,710
Why aren't you angry?

636
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,040
Why?

637
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:36,890
The country asked everyone to obey me

638
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:38,450
because it believed

639
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:40,940
that I had some strengths

640
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:44,590
and could endure the humiliation and bear the heavy burden.

641
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:45,720
I don't understand.

642
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:47,590
Son,

643
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:50,920
you'll understand in the future.

644
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:57,030
Yuda is awake.

645
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:02,440
Are you unhappy?

646
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:04,990
We saved someone.

647
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:09,480
What's there to be happy about?

648
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:11,750
As long as there is still Zornia,

649
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:12,750
this kind of thing

650
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:14,210
will happen every day.

651
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:16,390
Can you save them all?

652
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:18,430
I'll save them one by one.

653
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:22,030
Granny.

654
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:23,970
Who forced you all

655
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,460
to grow the Zornia?

656
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:28,430
They wouldn't give their names.

657
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:30,830
They dress mysteriously too.

658
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:33,710
I really don't know.

659
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:35,550
If we foreigners

660
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:37,480
want to stay here,

661
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:38,950
we

662
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:41,700
can only obey them.

663
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:47,840
Lanna Village won't be at peace

664
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,900
unless the Zornia is not eliminated.

665
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:53,590
Why don't we settle this once and for all

666
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:54,430
and burn it?

667
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,070
Hey!

668
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:19,880
You're too impulsive.

669
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:21,390
Stop pretending.

670
00:41:21,590 --> 00:41:23,120
I know you wanted to burn it.

671
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,270
I just did

672
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:25,470
what you wanted to do.

673
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:26,880
You're welcome.

674
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:32,490
You burned

675
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,980
the Zornia field.

676
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:35,390
Those people...

677
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:38,150
won't forgive us.

678
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:39,830
Granny,

679
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:42,700
the perpetrator should be held accountable.

680
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,100
If they ask you anything,

681
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,760
just tell them the truth.

682
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:48,630
What truth?

683
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:50,690
You want them to come after me?

684
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:53,670
Don't worry. With me here,

685
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:55,190
they won't hurt you.

686
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:59,310
What should we do?

687
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:04,350
Granny.

688
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:07,910
I promise you

689
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:10,130
no one will force you

690
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:11,990
to plant Zornia anymore.
