00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:06,670
Missing?

5
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,509
According to Daqi's law,

6
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:09,440
every adult man

7
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,729
should be registered.

8
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:12,509
There are three copies of the register.

9
00:02:12,509 --> 00:02:13,509
One in the county,

10
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:14,840
one in the state,

11
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,110
and one in the Ministry of Revenue.

12
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,910
The register is updated every three years.

13
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,040
The record of the man

14
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:20,950
you're looking for

15
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:21,950
hasn't been updated

16
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:22,940
for 15 years.

17
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,509
I copied his record

18
00:02:25,509 --> 00:02:27,170
from the Ministry of Revenue.

19
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,320
Take a look. Is it him?

20
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:36,070
Went missing?

21
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,990
What does that mean?

22
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,090
His whereabouts are unknown.

23
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:44,310
Or

24
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:46,720
he may have died.

25
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:59,800
I've said what needs to be said.

26
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:02,510
Thank you

27
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:03,880

This is good too. Try it.

Here.

This one. Hurry.

This one is amazing.

00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,450
-Smell it.
-Sai'er.

103

Sai'er.

104
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,250
How about this?

105
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:39,830
If he's upset you,

106
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:41,050
I'll go beat him up.

107

No, no, no.

108
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:43,030
Sit.

109
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:43,910
Sit down.

110
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,470
Actually, he didn't do

111
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:49,090
anything wrong.

112
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:50,909
He saved my mom and me after all.

113
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:52,760
I just feel

114
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:53,860
a bit embarrassed.

115
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,260
Why are you embarrassed?

116
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,540
He'll regret rejecting you.

117
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,409
You're adorable, Sai'er.

118
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,130
You have a point.

119
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:04,810
It seems that

120
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:05,870
I have to work hard.

121
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:08,370
You're already working hard.

122
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:09,470
Well,

123
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,260
I'm talking about Blossom Beauty.

124
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,640
The store has reopened.

125
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:13,530
I'm going back.

126
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,310
Here.

127
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:17,550
Take this.

128
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:18,900
Take it.

129
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:19,590
Smell it.

130
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:20,070
Okay.

131
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,300
Pack up later.

132
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:24,530
I'll send you back.

133
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:30,480
You're always

134
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:31,710
jabbering around me.

135
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:34,070
After you leave,

136
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:37,190
I don't know if I can get used to the quiet.

137
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,070
Don't worry.

138
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:39,650
I promised you

139
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,430
to help you regain your sense of smell.

140
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,790
I'll visit often.

141
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,320
It's not visiting.

142
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:47,510
It's coming back.

143
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:50,120
Apart from Blossom Beauty,

144
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:51,610
this is also your home.

145
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:53,200
Understand?

146
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:01,670
Smell this.

147
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:09,700
This one is nice too.

148
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,110
Here.

149
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,190
And this one.

150
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,470
This is good.

151
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:15,790
Take it.

152
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,810
Stay close to me.

153
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,710
Mr. Shang.

154
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,250
You don't have to escort me to work.

155
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,790
Don't you think it's too high-profile?

156
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,660
I want everyone in the capital to see us.

157
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:33,530
Why?

158
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:36,000
You're a troublemaker.

159
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:37,720
When I'm not around,

160
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,210
they'll recognize you

161
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:41,410
and know you're under my protection,

162
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,380
so they won't dare mess with you.

163
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,090
Thank you, Mr. Shang.

164
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,610
Sai'er.

165
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:51,419
You can take your time

166
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:52,690
to find your fiancé.

167
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,669
Your mother asked you to find him

168
00:08:55,669 --> 00:08:56,789
because she wanted you

169
00:08:56,789 --> 00:08:58,250
to have someone to rely on.

170
00:08:58,789 --> 00:09:00,380
If you can find someone

171
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,800
who can take care of you

172
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:03,240
and give you a home,

173
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,960
she'd be relieved, right?

174
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:10,380
Although I don't

175

No rush.

to be my sworn brother?

00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,430
would've died for nothing.

352
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:44,580
If I hadn't

353
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:46,610
asked General Nan to go to Tingzhou…

354
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:49,590
If I had warned them

355
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,120
of every possible danger

356
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:52,740
before they left…

357
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,030
maybe this tragedy

358
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:57,430
wouldn't have happened.

359
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:03,510
General Nan

360
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,130
narrowly escaped death

361
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:05,660
in Heman.

362
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:07,960
However…

363
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,270
I won't let

364
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,900
General Nan die for nothing.

365
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,370
And I won't let Yao

366
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:29,030
get hurt for nothing.

367
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:06,370
[Here Lies My Brother]

368
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,140
Brother.

369
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,430
You can rest in peace now.

370
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,810
After I avenge you,

371
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,350
I'll take you back to Heman.

372
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,800
I'll bury you next to Gaya.

373
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,210
Mr. Jiang.

374
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,030
It's early in the morning.

375
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,830
Are you going to see His Majesty?

376
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:18,880
Are you going to use these fake artworks

377
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,970
and ledgers to denounce me?

378
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:25,150
Mr. Jiang.

379
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:27,110
Let me remind you.

380
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,270
Some of the paintings

381
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,900
on these ledgers aren't in my hands.

382
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:33,910
For example,

383
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,200
the painting called Flying Fairy.

384
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:39,840
Does it sound familiar?

385
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:45,390
Your Highness, I know you love paintings and calligraphy,

386
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:46,030
so

387
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:48,260
I went to Qiuci to get the painting

388
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:50,220
"Flying Fairy"

389
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:51,700
for you.

390
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,060
Mr. Jiang,

391
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,500
you haven't visited

392
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:59,830
your grandfather in a long time, right?

393
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:01,980
He's old now.

394
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:03,990
Spend more time with him.

395
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:21,140
The sun is setting, and the boat is drifting away.

396
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:25,960
The fairy is dancing in the air as gracefully as a swan.

397
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:28,620
Brilliant.

398
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,660
This is brilliant!

399
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:32,640
Your Grace, you're indeed

400
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:35,050
the most talented woman in the country.

401
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:36,780
This poem

402
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,110
and this painting

403
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:38,750
really

404
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,980
complement each other, My Highness.

405
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,650
If you can stamp it,

406
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:46,070
this painting

407
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:47,460
will become

408
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:49,030
priceless

409
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:50,600
and unparalleled.

410
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:51,950
Really?

411
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:52,880
Yes.

412
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:53,820
Then…

413
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:54,940
Stamp it?

414
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:55,480
Stamp it.

415
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:01,500
Stamp it.

416
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:07,540
Great.

417
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:10,570
I

418
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:12,870
got to appreciate this painting

419
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,910
with Your Highness and Your Grace.

420
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:18,350
I feel very honored.

421
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:20,210
The honor is mine.

422
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,240
I just came to visit my grandfather

423
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,140
and didn't expect

424
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:25,100
to see such a great painting.

425
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:28,350
Xinbai?

426
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,080
What brought you here?

427
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,430
Hi, Mr. Jiang.

428
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:36,740
Are you here to appreciate the painting?

429
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:38,670
What a pleasant surprise.

430
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:39,740
Lu Dingzhao.

431
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,050
You're so despicable.

432
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:42,630
Xinbai.

433
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,110
That's no way

434
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,400
to talk to an elder.

435
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:46,610
Your Highness.

436
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,620
There must be some misunderstanding.

437
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:51,670
Mr. Jiang.

438
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:53,830
I've given His Highness

439
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,190
many artworks as gifts.

440
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:56,980
Flying Fairy

441
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,000
is just one of them.

442
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:01,300
Why did I do that?

443
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:04,030
I believe

444
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,990
someone as smart as you

445
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:08,470
can definitely

446
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,290
have it all

447
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:12,150
figured out,

448
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:13,210
right?

449
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:18,200
Your Highness.

450
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:21,420
Since both your grandson and granddaughter

451
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,540
are here,

452
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:23,700
I

453
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,820
will leave you guys to talk.

454
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:30,950
Mr. Jiang.

455
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,200
Take care.

456
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:41,660
Grandfather.

457
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:43,110
Xinbai.

458
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,290
What did

459
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,320
Mr. Lu mean?

460
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,340
Lu Dingzhao and Li Jun

461
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:53,780
are the ringleaders in the Zornia case.

462
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,230
General Nan

463
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:59,160
was also killed by them.

464
00:25:59,300 --> 00:25:59,980
What?

465
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:01,590
What?

466
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,560
General Nan died?

467
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:08,310
Does Shang know?

468
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,080
Lu Dingzhao has had a trap

469
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,210
set for me.

470
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:17,440
The paintings he sent Grandfather

471
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,260
are the beginning of his trap.

472
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,400
If I expose him,

473
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,110
Grandfather

474
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:25,950
will be implicated.

475
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:27,870
I…

476
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:28,740
I…

477
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:30,790
I'm tearing it apart.

478
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:31,590
It's too late.

479
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:46,860
[Yanxing Gate]

480
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:00,540
Jiang Xinbai.

481
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,350
Looks like he's not coming.

482
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:07,950
Dead?

483
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:11,210
How did Nan Jifeng die?

484
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,120
On his way to Tingzhou,

485
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,950
he was ambushed and killed.

486
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:18,340
Tingzhou?

487
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:22,720
When did he leave the capital?

488
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:25,470
Why didn't he come to meet me first?

489
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:26,100
He…

490
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:31,420
He and I were looking for evidence.

491
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:32,680
What evidence?

492
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:35,180
The evidence that Lu Dingzhao and Li Jun

493
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:37,040
have been profiting from Zornia.

494
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,140
Have you found any?

495
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:45,020
Do you know

496
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:47,700
it's a felony

497
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:49,170
to falsely accuse

498
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:51,890
a high-ranking official?

499
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:54,810
I'm telling the truth.

500
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,680
Your Majesty,

501
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,700
please let me investigate them.

502
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,180
I can definitely find the evidence.

503
00:27:59,180 --> 00:27:59,980
Investigate?

504
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:02,540
How?

505
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:06,110
Looking into two officials

506
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:07,540
to prove alleged crimes

507
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,900
or going to Tingzhou recklessly

508
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,190
to look into Nan Jifeng's death?

509
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:16,160
Both of them.

510
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:17,310
How dare you!

511
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,350
Mr. Lu and Mr. Li

512
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:20,540
have clean records,

513
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:21,860
while Nan Jifeng

514
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,460
was still a wanted criminal.

515
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,580
Without any evidence,

516
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:28,490
you want me to allow you to investigate them.

517
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,660
Do you want me to be laughed at

518
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,240
for not knowing right from wrong?

519
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:34,990
Your Majesty.

520
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:35,430
I…

521
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,220
Where is Jiang Xinbai?

522
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:39,820
I don't know.

523
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:44,870
I allowed you two to work together.

524
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:46,980
Haven't you taken my words

525
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,260
seriously?

526
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:50,710
I'm afraid Jiang Xinbai

527
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:52,310
doesn't know when Nan Jifeng

528
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:55,350
left the capital either.

529
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,440
You have nothing to say?

530
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:00,980
Guards.

531
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:04,220
Yes.

532
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,270
Cane him 100 times.

533
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:07,380
Yes.

534
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:11,980
One.

535
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:13,340
Two.

536
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:14,630
Three.

537
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:16,150
Four.

538
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,470
If it hurts,

539
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:23,850
just say it.

540
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:33,370
How could this happen?

541
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:34,820
You and Mr. Jiang…

542
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:37,720
Don't mention him.

543
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:10,380
Father.

544
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,270
I don't think you can

545
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:14,170
get off the hook this time.

546
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:15,060
Father!

547
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:17,300
Are you a fool?

548
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:18,140
Why did you

549
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,520
accept these things?

550
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,760
They're using them against us now.

551
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,390
What should we do?

552
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:21,910
Zhiyi.

553
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:24,410
Father has been deceived.

554
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:26,180
It's my fault.

555
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,880
I won countless wars on the battlefield,

556
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,430
yet

557
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:31,070
I've been fooled

558
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:32,640
by that old fox Lu Dingzhao.

559
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:33,980
Tomorrow,

560
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,460
I'll explain everything to His Majesty.

561
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,060
Xinbai.

562
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:40,430
Back then,

563
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,180
I gave up on your father.

564
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:43,220
This time,

565
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:45,540
I won't drag you down too.

566
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:47,150
No.

567
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:49,460
Since this is their trap,

568
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:51,860
I'm afraid no one will believe you're innocent.

569
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:52,420
Besides,

570
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:53,450
His Majesty

571
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:54,780
has always seen the Jiang family

572
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:55,860
as a threat.

573
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,130
If this matter

574
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:58,170
gets out of hand,

575
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:01,360
I'm afraid His Majesty won't help us.

576
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:02,940
Suoluo is right.

577
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:04,800
End of the day,

578
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:06,780
their target is me.

579
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,160
If anyone is to blame,

580
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:12,150
I'm to blame for dragging Grandfather in.

581
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:13,550
Boy,

582
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,180
over the years,

583
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:18,340
because I've been busy protecting the Jiang family,

584
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:20,750
I've misunderstood you

585
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:21,980
and been harsh on you.

586
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:23,530
Sorry.

587
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:27,330
Lu Dingzhao is such a scumbag.

588
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,440
I won't let him

589
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:30,430
get away with it!

590
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:50,260
Sai'er?

591
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,260
Mr. Jiang.

592
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:54,430
His Majesty gave Shang the cane.

[Peace Reigns]

594
00:31:58,460 --> 00:31:59,190
Mr. Jiang.

595
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:00,430
Check on Shang.

596
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:18,320
Why didn't you come?

597
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,020
Why didn't you fight back?

598
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,310
I stood you up.

599
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:30,860
I failed you

600
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:33,350
and General Nan.

601
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:37,340
Why did you fail us?

602
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,140
Why?

603
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:52,560
Jiang Xinbai, listen.

604
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,450
No matter what reason you have,

605
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:58,540
my brother and I

606
00:32:58,540 --> 00:32:59,870
will never forgive you.

607
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,110
Shang.

608
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,280
Shang, calm down.

609
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,290
Let me treat your wounds.

610
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:07,420
They're too severe.

611
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:12,430
Let's go.

612
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,140
Slow down.

613
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:15,240
Be careful. Slow down.

614
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:23,840
What happened?

615
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:35,070
Shang Bieli said Lu Dingzhao and Li Jun

616
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:37,110
have been profiting from Zornia

617
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:39,580
and murdered Nan Jifeng.

618
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:41,580
Do you agree?

619
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,360
They're indeed suspicious.

620
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:45,140
But

621
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:47,620
I have no evidence.

622
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:49,140
Then, did Nan Jifeng

623
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:51,150
go to Tingzhou

624
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:54,070
to find the truth?

625
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:57,630
Yes.

626
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:01,500
General Nan

627
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,280
died wrongly because I was arrogant

628
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,930
and willful.

629
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:08,700
Mr. Shang

630
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:10,870
didn't know General Nan

631
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:12,620
left the capital.

632
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,700
Did he?

633
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:19,340
I didn't tell Mr. Shang about it

634
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:20,670
until General Nan left.

635
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:22,700
Mr. Shang

636
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:24,080
and General Nan

637
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:25,060
were very close.

638
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:26,320
If he had known,

639
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,179
he wouldn't have let General Nan

640
00:34:28,179 --> 00:34:30,239
take the risk of leaving the capital.

641
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:32,500
General Nan's death

642
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:33,830
should be

643
00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:35,630
blamed on me.

644
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:37,690
Blamed on you?

645
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:40,280
You're in big trouble yourself,

646
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,940
yet you're trying to help him?

647
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:44,750
You're right.

648
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:48,710
You're too arrogant.

From now on,

652
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:01,690
you're dismissed.

653
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:05,060
Go home and reflect on yourself.

654
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:07,000

661

the new chief constable.

00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:11,990
I can be relieved.

665
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:16,000
I was worried Lu Dingzhao and Li Jun

666
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,020
would get a henchman of theirs

679
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:55,030
It seems that

680
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,550
the death of Nan Jifeng

681
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:01,010

703
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:17,420
but are now drowning your sorrows

704
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:19,280
and wallowing in self-loathing.

705
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:21,820
Is this what General Nan would want to see?

706
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:30,020
I let you down, my lord.

707
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:32,770
I failed General Nan.

708
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:35,100
My lord.

709
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:38,130
Why didn't I die?

710
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:42,780
General Nan died.

711
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:45,860
I got badly injured.

712
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:49,330
You were dismissed.

713
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:52,300
Have we

714
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,620
lost the game?

715
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:01,480
Wickedness runs rampant.

716
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:03,390
His Majesty is merciless.

717
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:06,020
Is such a country worth saving?

718
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:08,380
Is it really worth sacrificing so much?

719
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:30,090
I remember,

720
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:32,140
when I was young,

721
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,360
I asked my father similar questions.

722
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:43,620
Father,

723
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:46,320
you devoted yourself to the country and the people,

724
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,660
but you ended up

725
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:49,090
being criticized by all.

726
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:49,980
Father.

727
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:52,500
Why aren't you angry?

728
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:54,060
Why?

729
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:58,880
The country asked everyone to obey me

730
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:00,380
because it believed

731
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:02,420
that I had some strengths

732
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:06,870
and could endure the humiliation and bear the heavy burden.

733
00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:09,440
I don't understand.

734
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:13,550
You'll understand,

735
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:14,690
Son.

736
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:22,680
Do you have the answer now?

737
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:30,430
All I know is that

738
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,440
I seem to have understood

739
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:35,150
why my father

740
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,910
was so adamant back then.

741
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:42,950
Because

742
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:45,130
this is our mission

743
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:46,620
and duty.

744
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:50,230
Have you figured something out?

745
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:58,540
Maybe

746
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:00,700
we should try

747
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:01,580
everything.

748
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:04,260
Even if we'll hit a wall,

749
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:06,860
it's better than doing nothing.

750
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:26,650
Take the medicine.

751
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:29,060
Get better soon.

752
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:30,500
Leave the rest

753
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:31,700
to me.

754
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:33,820
I'll find a way.

755
00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:28,920
General Nan's death

756
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:31,320
was not your fault.

757
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:34,830
But General Nan died

758
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:36,860
because of me.

759
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:42,020
Maybe

760
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:45,240
when Yan Zhizhong died back then,

761
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:46,780
my father

762
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:50,060
felt the same way I do now.

763
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:51,980
No.

764
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:54,100
This is those bad guys' trap.

765
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:56,580
If you break down,

766
00:43:56,690 --> 00:43:58,220
they'll get what they want.

767
00:43:58,260 --> 00:43:59,720
We need to make a comeback.

768
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:05,590
Yan Nanxing.

769
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:07,230
Don't worry.

770
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:10,120
I won't break down.

771
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:12,040
And I won't give up easily.

772
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:13,820
But

773
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:16,350
I want to ask you,

774
00:44:17,770 --> 00:44:18,920
if we can't

775
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:19,870
make a comeback

776
00:44:21,350 --> 00:44:22,810
and I can't be reinstated,

777
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:23,700
or even worse,

778
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,060
if I can't stay in the capital…

779
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:29,060
That's fine.

780
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:30,440
I'll take you away.

781
00:44:30,930 --> 00:44:31,990
This is a big world.

782
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:33,920
We can always find a place to stay.

783
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:38,250
But now,

784
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:40,890
it's not time for us to give up.
