[Episode 7]

4
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:07,840
Since you knew

5
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,199
my identity and motive,

6
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,450
why didn't you expose me earlier?

7
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,330
It wasn't time yet.

8
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:17,820
Gaya!

9
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:19,630
Gaya!

10
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:23,870
Hubby.

11
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:28,829
Gaya.

12
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:30,960
What's going on?

13
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:32,990
I...

14
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:37,340
Since Her Ladyship doesn't want to talk,

15
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:38,070
why don't

16
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,550
I start this off?

17
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:42,020
General Nan.

18
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,900
I once asked you why

19
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:46,850
the three clans left you alone even when

20
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,310
the job they paid you for

21
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,230
was undone.

22
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:51,190
The real reason is...

23
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:55,350
your wife acted on your behalf.

24
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:03,770
It's you...

25
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:08,530
who relayed all my deployment plans

26
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:10,950
to the three clans?

27
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:12,420
Yes.

28
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:15,600
You also leaked the identities and whereabouts

29
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,790
of the five men

30
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:20,030
I assigned as spies,

31
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:22,620
such that they

32
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:23,590
never came back?

33
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:26,190
Yes.

34
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:31,750
Why?

35
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:33,740
Why?

36
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,400
Because I want you to live!

37
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,230
What did I do to deserve this?

38
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:56,150
Hubby.

39
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,550
Jiang Xinbai.

40
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,070
When did you notice

41
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:02,950
Gaya's off?

42
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:07,570
That night,

43
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,730
Lieutenant General Li

44
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,710
noticed I've been

45
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,240
to your study's secret room

46
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,710
and tried to kill me.

47
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:16,630
He failed

48
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:19,269
and I brought Mr. Li back

49
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:20,390
to confront him.

50
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:21,790
So,

51
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,000
Her Ladyship

52
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:24,930
and Lieutenant General Li

53
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:27,420
came up with a sympathy ploy.

54
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:36,010
Hubby, watch out!

55
00:04:40,909 --> 00:04:41,590
Hubby!

56
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:42,750
Hubby!

57
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:49,270
I guess

58
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:50,870
your original plan

59
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,720
was to let Mr. Li

60
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,210
assassinate General Nan.

61
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,909
When you take the stab for him,

62
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,190
he can be

63
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:58,350
cleared of

64
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,550
suspicions.

65
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,590
But you didn't expect

66
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:03,710
General Nan to take the stab for you.

67
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,280
For a period after that,

68
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:06,590
I really

69
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,230
didn't quite doubt you.

70
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:11,240
Until the three clans were taken down.

71
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:12,360
I always felt

72
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:15,520
they were taken down too fast.

73
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:17,910
But Heman's cartel

74
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:19,570
isn't that simple.

75
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:20,990
So I guess

76
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:23,030
there must be

77
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:25,410
a mastermind behind them.

78
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:27,750
When they were taken down,

79
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,210
General Nan enacted a nationwide lockdown.

80
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:32,430
No boats were allowed to enter or leave.

81
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:34,230
But at that very moment,

82
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:35,900
you claimed Nanxing and I are fated

83
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,180
to have three marriages

84
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,190
and suggested

85
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:39,840
to hold a wedding for us.

86
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:41,310
You wanted to leave Heman

87
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:42,750
on the wedding night.

88
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,400
You wanted to transport

89
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:45,750
Zornia out

90
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:47,530
with the wedding ship.

91
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,190
That's when I knew

92
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:51,920
you

93
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,860
were the mastermind.

94
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:58,110
At this point,

95
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:01,750
punish me however you want.

96
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:03,680
Gaya.

97
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,520
Stop being stubborn,

98
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:07,190
okay?

99
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,750
Lady Gaya.

100
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,230
I let that boat and that man go

101
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,350
on purpose.

102
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,600
Because that boat of Zornia

103
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:22,390
can help me

104
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,980
find its owner.

105
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:26,070
Don't waste your energy.

106
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:28,310
I won't say anything.

107
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,870
There's no turning back for you.

108
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:31,990
Gaya.

109
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,070
I know

110
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,480
you love General Nan very much.

111
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:37,230
Now,

112
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,260
only by helping the Inspection Office

113
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,120
solve this case

114
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:42,590
and find the mastermind...

115
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:44,720
So he works for the Inspection Office.

116
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,840
He never trusted me.

117
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:49,710
He has been lying to me.

118
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:52,230
I'm so stupid.

119
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,290
Apprehend Gaya!

120
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:00,710
Wait!

121
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:04,230
Nan Jifeng.

122
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,080
I don't expect you to punish your family.

123
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,040
But if you try to

124
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:09,750
obstruct our investigation,

125
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,550
I won’t go easy on you.

126
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,730
I'm not trying to stop you.

127
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,800
I want you to detain me too.

128
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:19,790
Hubby.

129
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:20,950
The crime

130
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:22,950
my wife committed...

131
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:26,770
started because of me.

132
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,910
I deserve the same punishment.

133
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:30,590
Hubby.

134
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:31,950
No.

135
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:34,120
Your involvement is separate.

136
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,670
It's not the same crime.

137
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:36,670
Detain me!

138
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:40,840
Let the Ministry of Justice

139
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,690
and His Majesty convict me!

140
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:44,630
No.

141
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,110
No, Hubby.

142
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,110
No.

143
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:48,110
No.

144
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,720
I won't forgive you either.

145
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:55,960
But I'll accompany you.

146
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,220
Hubby.

147
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:04,030
Nan Jifeng.

148
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:06,300
Don't be impulsive.

149
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:07,750
I understand

150
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:08,610
your devotion.

151
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,590
But it's your duty

152
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:11,930
to not let down His Majesty

153
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:13,210
and the Heman people.

154
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:16,440
After we've clarified things,

155
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:18,230
we’ll give you an explanation.

156
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,030
Take her away!

157
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:20,790
Hey!

158
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:22,800
Don't you dare move!

159
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:33,460
Gaya!

160
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,190
Gaya!

161
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:37,789
Gaya.

162
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:39,190
Hurry!

163
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:39,720
Gaya.

164
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:40,350
Hurry!

165
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:40,840
You...

166
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,240
Hurry.

167
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:42,500
Why are you so silly?

168
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:44,500
Why are you so silly?

169
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:45,550
Dr. Yan.

170
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:46,720
Dr. Yan, please save her.

171
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,180
Dr. Yan.

172
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:49,830
I shouldn’t live.

173
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,190
I can't live either.

174
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,440
Who said that?

175
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:54,190
You can live.

176
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:54,950
Who said so?

177
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:56,210
You can live, you know?

178
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:56,910
Gaya.

179
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:58,370
You can live, you know?

180
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,940
I can't be interrogated.

181
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:03,900
They won't let you go.

182
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:06,190
I want you to live.

183
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:08,630
Only when I die

184
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,550
can you live.

185
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:15,080
Gaya.

186
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:17,950
Why did you do that?

187
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:20,390
Maybe one day,

188
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:23,910
you'd face the same dilemma.

189
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,940
When the person you love the most

190
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:32,390
is pitted against your conscience

191
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:33,190
and faith

192
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:35,510
and you must give one up...

193
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:38,750
Then,

194
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:41,110
you'd understand me.

195
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,110
That feeling...

196
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,910
like you're in purgatory.

197
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:56,910
Gaya.

198
00:09:58,870 --> 00:09:59,430
Gaya.

199
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:01,630
Gaya.

200
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:08,150
Gaya.

201
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:19,230
Gaya.

202
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:41,040
Yan Nanxing.

203
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:43,960
Yan Nanxing!

204
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,160
Where are you going?

205
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:50,960
It's none of your business.

206
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:53,860
Zornia killed many people.

207
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,270
If it continues to spread,

208
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,070
more people will die.

209
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,750
I didn't come to Heman

210
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:07,910
as a lone, brave man.

211
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,320
My most trusted brothers

212
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:11,790
are all outside the city

213
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:13,110
waiting for my order.

214
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,820
We have the most thorough arrangements

215
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:15,310
and plans...

216
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:16,600
So you lied to me!

217
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:22,150
You told me

218
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,230
you trust me,

219
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:24,550
that we're friends.

220
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:26,310
But you're using me!

221
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:30,780
You've never experienced my hardship.

222
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:31,710
You don't know

223
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,200
I nearly died once.

224
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:34,810
I fought for my life

225
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:37,380
against the Heavens!

226
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:39,470
I still have

227
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:40,930
many people I've yet to see

228
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:43,390

[Spirit tablet of beloved wife, Gaya]

289
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:19,589
My lord.

290
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:21,829
You don't have to

291
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:23,230
apologize.

292
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:26,790
I know you're not the real

293
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:27,470
culprit...

294
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:30,250
who killed my wife.

295
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:32,240
She must've killed herself

296
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,830
to protect this major secret,

297
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:34,790
in which...

298
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,290
she couldn't

299
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,120
fathom anyone who could

300
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,000
protect me,

301
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,790
so she refused the interrogation

302
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:43,870
in the capital.

303
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:46,640
You also think

304
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:49,510
the culprit is in the capital?

305
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:51,630
Only

306
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,020
the capital

307
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:54,560
can control all channels.

308
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,390
For the Zornia epidemic,

309
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:58,670
Heman's just for importing

310
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:00,710
and not the center.

311
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:02,980
Zornia was

312
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:06,000
on the verge of being totally banned.

313
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:07,070
But recently,

314
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:09,290
it's gaining momentum again.

315
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:11,910
I came to Heman

316
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:14,450
to figure this clue out from the root.

317
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:16,690
But I didn't expect...

318
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:22,710
Lanna Village no longer grows Zornia.

319
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:23,710
Please make arrangements

320
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,510
for the villagers' livelihood.

321
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:28,880
You didn't come here

322
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:31,350
for nothing.

323
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,750
It was risky for that batch of Zornia

324
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,470
to enter the capital.

325
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:37,990
A storm must be waiting for you there.

326
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:40,390
My lord.

327
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:42,790
Stay alert.

328
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,140
I've taken care of Lanna Village.

329
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:46,630
Please rest assured.

330
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,230
Young lady!

331
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:18,950
Who are you?

332
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,240
Don't come over.

333
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:24,550
Don't be afraid.

334
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:26,350
I am

335
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:27,630
a good person.

336
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:29,710
Seeing how you're

337
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:31,790
all alone on an arduous trip,

338
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,400
I felt sorry for you.

339
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:34,240
I found you

340
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:35,150
a good husband.

341
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:36,040
It's him?

342
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:36,870
I guarantee

343
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:39,150
you'll live a comfortable life.

344
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:40,840
Just go get married,

345
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,920
so I can earn this money.

346
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,830
Or you'll lose

347
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,070
your life.

348
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:49,670
Scumbag.

349
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:52,440
Foxes may grow grey but never good.

350
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,720
Sir.

351
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:02,030
Please be kind

352
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:03,630
and let me go.

353
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:06,910
My mother is sick.

354
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,410
I'm on my way to my maiden home.

355
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:11,910
I don't have money with me.

356
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:13,590
But

357
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:16,030
I brought

358
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:18,160
an antique fragrance bottle.

359
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,430
It's quite valuable.

360
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,430
Antique?

361
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:22,870
Hurry up.

362
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:23,950
Take it out.

363
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:25,270
Let me help you

364
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:25,920
appraise

365
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:28,000
if it's more valuable than you.

366
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:31,550
Where is it?

367
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:34,630
No.

368
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,600
It's in this pouch.

369
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:41,110
Yes, that's it.

370
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:45,110
It does look like an antique.

371
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,030
The spices inside

372
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:49,150
are costly.

373
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:50,470
Don't open it.

374
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,930
The smell will fade.

375
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:56,180
If I don't open it,

376
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:58,300
how'd I verify its value?

377
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:04,050
It smells quite...

378
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:22,510
Sis.

379
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:23,880
What's this for?

380
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,390
Let's talk it out.

381
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:27,370
Enemies can't be avoided indeed.

382
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:28,630
To think you'd

383
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,750
fall into my hands one day.

384
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,270
Please spare me.

385
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:36,670
Have I ever offended you?

386
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:38,100
Fine.

387
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:40,240
I'll let you know why you've to die.

388
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:41,520
15 years ago,

389
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:42,470
you abducted

390
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:43,360
a girl and a boy

391
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,840
in Yazhou.

392
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:46,400
That girl

393
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,710
let him go secretly,

394
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:49,470
so you got angry

395
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:50,750
and

396
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:51,990
sold her to a family.

397
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:53,070
Do you remember this?

398
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:53,830
No!

399
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:54,910
Heroine.

400
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,900
Did you get the wrong person?

401
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:58,080
You don't remember?

402
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:05,750
Heroine.

403
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:07,590
Let me help you

404
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:08,790
jog your memory.

405
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:10,670
Wait!

406
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:11,990
I remember.

407
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:15,870
I think something like this did happen.

408
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:18,750
How did you know about it?

409
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,360
Because I'm that girl.

410
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:21,270
Impossible.

411
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:22,240
Impossible.

412
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:23,310
Cut the crap.

413
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:25,150
Just answer my questions.

414
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:26,500
Okay.

415
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:28,030
Let me ask you.

416
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:29,430
On the day of the incident,

417
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:30,720
the boy came back

418
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:31,670
and saved me.

419
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:32,960
What happened next?

420
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:35,080
It's been so long.

421
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:36,370
Who can remember that?

422
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:37,150
Heroine.

423
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:40,110
I need to use the toilet.

424
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:41,710
Why don't you let me down?

425
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:42,840
You don't remember?

426
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,470
Yet you still...

427
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:48,670
want to use the toilet.

428
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:49,740
-I remember!
-Remember now?

429
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,190
Y-Y-Yes, I do.

430
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:54,290
Here's what happened.

431
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,490
After finding out you ran away,

432
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:57,590
I chased you down.

433
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:04,970
Stop there!

434
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:05,970
After them!

435
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:08,100
-Brat.
-You stole my stuff!

436
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:10,470
Go!

437
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,570
Don't look back!

438
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:29,430
Watch out.

439
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:37,880
When we arrived,

440
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:39,230
you and him

441
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,020
had already collapsed.

442
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,330
One of them fed you

443
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:51,150
a bottle of medicine.

444
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:54,550
Young Sir.

445
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:56,150
Young Sir!

446
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:02,520
You blacked out from the medicine.

447
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:05,390
Those people

448
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:07,030
also drugged him.

449
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:14,850
Then another group of people came...

450
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:17,350
and chased away the previous group.

451
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:39,780
The second group in official boots

452
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,840
took him away.

453
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:46,600
I thought you were dead,

454
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:49,360
so I ran away to save myself.

455
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,010
Heroine.

456
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:58,390
You're really lucky.

457
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,430
Did you just say

458
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:00,890
they wore official boots?

459
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:01,470
Yes.

460
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:04,050
In my line of business,

461
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:06,200
we're always chased by officials.

462
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:07,670
I still remember

463
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:09,240
the boots' pattern.

464
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:11,190
The pattern's quite special.

465
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:12,630
It looks like a dragon

466
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:14,310
but

467
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:15,510
also not.

468
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:19,190
They seem to be capital officials.

469
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:22,230
Local officials wouldn't dare wear these.

470
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:24,990
Capital officials?

471
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:35,710
Young Sir.

472
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:37,470
I've been seeking

473
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:38,630
your whereabouts,

474
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,470
praying you're still alive.

475
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:41,790
Could you've also been infected

476
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,650
with such a weird disease like me?

477
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:45,380
Why did all this happen?

478
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:48,820
Only by finding you can it be solved.

479
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:25,020
[Capital]

480
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,360
Your burger.

481
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:39,350
Thank you.

482
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:40,370
Take care.

483
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:41,030
My lord.

484
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:42,640
Come again!

485
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,700
He left so quickly.

486
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:49,870
Yummy.

487
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:51,830
This is the taste of home.

488
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:52,830
Mr. Yao.

489
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,270
Why haven't you been coming for drinks?

490
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:54,910
Ma San.

491
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:56,430
Any good wine?

492
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:57,320
Yes, we've plenty!

493
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,250
I'll visit soon!

494
00:26:58,270 --> 00:26:58,790
Okay.

495
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:08,110
My lord.

496
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:12,880
I knew you'd eat here first

497
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:14,200
back in the capital.

498
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:16,030
Have a burger too.

499
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:17,230
Freshly made.

500
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:20,250
My lord.

501
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:22,430
Since Princess sent me to be

502
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:23,910
your personal attendant,

503
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:25,070
this has been

504
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:26,330
the longest work trip.

505
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:28,110
It's been 3 years,

506
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,310
1,095 days,

507
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,400
since I've rested.

508
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:32,310
On my way back,

509
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,150
I did the calculations.

510
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:36,100
For the 159 off days

511
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:38,170
over the last three years,

512
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,780
I've been working overtime with you.

513
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:45,670
Those who've been

514
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:47,450
on this Heman work trip

515
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:49,190
will get triple the salary.

516
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:50,030
You know

517
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:51,470
that's not what I mean.

518
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:53,950
I'm honored to be able

519
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:55,350
to suffer with you.

520
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:58,010
I'm not doing this for myself,

521
00:27:58,150 --> 00:27:59,870
but requesting for leave

522
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:00,800
for my comrades.

523
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:02,070
Look.

524
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:03,670
Three years

525
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:05,750
means 159 off days.

526
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:07,750
Let's compromise.

527
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,470
How's nine days?

528
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:14,110
Are you bargaining with me?

529
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:16,760
This case

530
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:18,550
has just begun.

531
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,070
Before the case is solved,

532
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:22,230
all off days

533
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:23,670
will be canceled.

534
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,880
On behalf of my comrades,

535
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:31,190
I'll thank you for the tripled salary.

536
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:33,150
If you know of more great deals like this,

537
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:34,510
please think of us.

538
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:36,070
We'd love to do it.

539
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:37,270
We'd love to do it.

540
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:38,790
Yao Qianshu.

541
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:40,680
Do you think I can't tell

542
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:42,150
you're being sarcastic?

543
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:44,750
How dare I?

544
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:46,110
Catch the thief!

545
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,720
Catch the thief!

546
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:49,230
Over there! Catch him!

547
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:50,510
Get him!

548
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:51,870
What's wrong with you?

549
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:52,510
Watch it!

550
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:53,550
A thief!

551
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:00,830
Nice arrest!

552
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:02,140
My lord.

553
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:06,010
Constable Yao.

554
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:08,160
Chief Constable Jiang.

555
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:09,310
What?

556
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:11,040
Stealing credit again?

557
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:11,780
Mr. Yao.

558
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:13,520
Catching petty thieves

559
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:15,160
is Jinwu Guards' duty.

560
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:17,540
I don't dare trouble the Inspection Office.

561
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:18,910
Are you blind?

562
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:21,190
He stole other's things

563
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:22,670
and caused a ruckus.

564
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:25,830
The official punishment for theft is 50 flogs;

565
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:28,200
60 flogs for every penny stolen;

566
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:29,590
crime grade increases per note.

567
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:31,390
Daqi's Theft Act includes

568
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,190
being exiled beyond 1,000 miles

569
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:33,930
and three years of hard labor.

570
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:35,870
Isn't a sentence beyond three years

571
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:38,230
under our jurisdiction?

572
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:39,190
Well...

573
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,960
Rather than stealing credit,

574
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,910
why don't you check what was stolen

575
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:44,240
and comfort the people?

576
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:45,990
What are you waiting for?

577
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:48,520
What if he has an accomplice

578
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:50,640
who makes use of this chaos to rob the street?

579
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,430
You want Commander-in-chief Shang

580
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:53,590
to be fired?

581
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:55,750
Well...

582
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:57,580
Go on!

583
00:29:58,310 --> 00:29:58,910
Let's go.

584
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:08,550
My lord.

585
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,190
Jinwu Guards

586
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:12,350
are as inept as their leader.

587
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:13,650
Lock this man up

588
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:15,110
in the Inspection Office.

589
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:16,520
Convict him

590
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:17,750
after verifying

591
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:18,990
the victim's losses.

592
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:19,950
Yes.

593
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:21,600
It's been a long day.

594
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:23,190
Go back and rest early.

595
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:26,150
When can I rest?

596
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:27,860
Take him away.

597
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:28,390
Yes.

598
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:32,920
If you want to rest, eat your burger first.

599
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:17,510
It's still warm.

600
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:25,350
Wait!

601
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:31,510
Mother.

602
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:33,690
Messing with me again.

603
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:35,950
[Princess of Yuejiang, Jiang Zhiyi]

604
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:36,430
You're so boring.

605
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:38,640
Take it back.

606
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:43,030
Mother.

607
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:45,240
Don't wear a veil next time.

608
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,480
That's true.

609
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:50,280
My son is immensely smart.

610
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:51,890
He doesn't need his vision...

611
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:53,090
to recognize people.

612
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:55,130
Your son's clearly face-blind

613
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:55,850
and can't

614
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,070
recognize people.

615
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:58,350
How's that smart?

616
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:00,270
Who said that?

617
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:02,460
My son is the chief constable

618
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:04,030
who's solved countless cases.

619
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:05,390
Face blindness

620
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:06,870
is no big deal.

621
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:11,830
What happened to you

622
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:12,890
in just two months?

623
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:14,160
You're much thinner

624
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,030
and darker.

625
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:16,160
Where have you been?

626
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:19,070
Heman.

627
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:20,150
Heman?

628
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:24,830
Xinbai.

629
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:27,490
You know His Majesty's

630
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,220
most wary of non-blood related royals

631
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:30,350
going to the border,

632
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:32,150
in fear of treachery.

633
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:35,070
I know.

634
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:38,130
I went to Heman to investigate a case.

635
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:39,630
What case?

636
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:43,640
There's been a surge in the Zornia epidemic.

637
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:45,430
So I went to check the source.

638
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:49,110
Xinbai.

639
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:51,990
I know

640
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:53,270
what's been

641
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:54,730
weighing your heart down.

642
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:57,090
But you have to understand

643
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,210
you're not just your father's son

644
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:01,030
but also my son.

645
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,510
For my sake,

646
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:04,620
prioritize your safety.

647
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:05,640
Got it?

648
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:12,160
Alright.

649
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:13,530
Enough about this.

650
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:14,560
I came to you

651
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:15,450
for something.

652
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,760
Your grandfather’s 70th birthday

653
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:18,710
is in a few days.

654
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,080
Many

655
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:21,350
guests will come.

656
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:22,950
Since you're back,

657
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:24,670
please entertain the guests for your mother

658
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:25,580
and grandfather.

659
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:26,110
Okay?

660
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:28,350
Mother, you know I'm bad at

661
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:29,930
socializing with guests.

662
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:31,710
If I go,

663
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:33,590
I might ruin the atmosphere.

664
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:35,630

665
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:36,910

your absence

669
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:43,270

Promise me.

Morning,

Commander-in-chief Shang.

684
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,630
What's all this

685
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:02,430
first thing in the morning?

686
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:03,070
I heard

687
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:04,790
the petty thief

688

in the Inspection Office.

691
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:10,450
I don't want to bother you,

692
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:12,780
so I came to pick him up this morning.

693
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:13,660
Such a ruckus

694
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:14,990
to pick up a thief?

695
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:18,760
You've been on leave

I was afraid your men's skills

might be rusty.

699
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:25,440

700
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:27,750
to help them warm up.

701
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:31,340
In that case,

702
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:32,750

00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:38,800
Now that

706
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:40,160
your men have warmed up,

707
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:42,710
I'll personally

708
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:45,350
help you warm up.

709
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:00,430
Where have you been

710
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:02,760
the past two months?

711
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:04,630
The Inspection Office

712
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:05,630
works upon orders

713
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:07,910
and report to His Majesty directly.

714
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:09,950
We need not report to others.

715
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:11,550
I'm just concerned

716
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:12,920
if you had a good break.

717
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:15,030
Can't I?

718
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:18,440
Even His Majesty isn't concerned,

719
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:20,490
so don't you worry about it.

720
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:22,990
Don’t pressure me with His Majesty.

721
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:25,580
Does His Majesty know where you went

722
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:27,380
and what you did?

723
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:29,560
What do you mean?

724
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:31,000
You tried to frame

725
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:32,680
my sworn brother, Nan Jifeng.

726
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:34,510
When you failed,

727
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,910
you forced my sister-in-law to death!

728
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:37,700
Mr. Jiang.

729
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,030
Is this the so-called

730
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:41,180
acting upon orders?

731
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:44,510
Sworn brother?

732
00:37:56,530 --> 00:37:57,530
Commander Shang.

733
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,420
Although our departments

734
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:01,080
have always been on bad terms,

735
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:02,190
we've implicitly agreed

736
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:03,650
not to fight with weapons.

737
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:04,560
If you

738
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:05,950
attack us with weapons,

739
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:07,220
then we

740
00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:09,090
will be irreconcilable.
