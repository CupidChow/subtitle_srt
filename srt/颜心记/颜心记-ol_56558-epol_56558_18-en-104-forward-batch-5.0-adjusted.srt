Well...

00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:06,710
Since you'd decided

against the marriage,

11
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:09,480
why did you mock her?

to the capital.

154
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:12,790
Why didn’t you

come look for me?

156
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:16,710
Why should I trust

157
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:18,310
a man who can't keep his word?

158
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:20,240
What do you mean?

159
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:21,710
What do you think?

160
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,650
Explain my crime first

161

before convicting me.

162

You said

you'd keep investigating in the capital.

164

You should know they were

sent by the Ministry of Personnel.

176

00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,350
Are you suspecting me?

180
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:12,350
At first,

181
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:14,070
I did.

182
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:18,710
Then why are you

183
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:19,940
looking for me now?

184
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:25,150
I know you solved

185
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,950
the Ghost Market's Zornia case,

186
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,210
eliminating a Zornia cartel

187
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,400
in the capital.

188
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:43,430
Just because the magistrate and lieutenant

189
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:44,960
were recommended by Li Jun,

190
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,950
you suspect he

191
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:48,990
and even the entire Ministry of Personnel

192
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:51,010
are overseeing the Zornia business?

193
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:52,810
As those two started framing me,

194
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:54,190
Li Jun went to His Majesty

195
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:55,390
to complain about me.

196
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:58,480
Is that just a coincidence?

197
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:00,510
Over the years,

198
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:01,960
all officials were

199
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,710
sent to Heman

200
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,870
through the Ministry of Personnel.

201
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:07,130
They're sealing off

202
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:07,890
a path.

203
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:20,030
I want to meet His Majesty,

204
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,840
but I haven't found a chance.

205
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,110
You're now a guilty official

206
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:29,240
who's running away.

207
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:30,850
Without evidence,

208
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:32,240
it's just nonsense.

209
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:34,530
His Majesty will only punish you.

210
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:36,370
It's not the right time

211
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:37,790
to meet him.

212
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,930
I know you're also watching the Li family.

213
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:43,620
How did you know?

214
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,190
We met when I was undercover

215
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:46,210
in the Lis' casino

216
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:47,240
to get evidence.

217
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:49,170
You didn't expose me then.

218
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:50,550
I guess you hoped

219
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:51,680
I'd find something.

220
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:57,910
Somewhat.

221
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,030
Come on, I bet you

222
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:01,840
just didn't recognize him.

223
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:07,590
So...

224
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:09,850
what've you found out?

225
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,280
I'm only cleared of half

226
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:13,640
of my suspicions of you.

227
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,560
I'll tell you when they are

228
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:16,510
all cleared.

229
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:20,260
Fine.

230
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:23,750
I want to go

231
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,280
see Bieli first.

232
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:27,150
I know you two

233
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,270
had a misunderstanding,

234
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:29,400
so I didn't go to him,

235
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,680
in case I'd add fuel to the fire.

236
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:33,470
You can't see him now.

237
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:34,420
Why?

238
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:36,710
He might be

239
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:38,240
related to the Zornia case.

240
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:39,510
Some Jinwu Guards

241
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:40,910
are dealing with Zornia.

242
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:42,350
Impossible!

243
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:44,910
She saw it too.

244
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:51,070
He's too close to the Li family.

245
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:52,870
I've to be wary of him.

246
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:56,550
Evidence aside,

247
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:59,210
what you saw might not be true either.

248
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:00,950
Even if you put the evidence

249
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:01,830
in front of me,

250
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:04,170
I'd still believe him.

251
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:07,280
Why do you

252
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:08,550
trust him so much?

253
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:12,630
We have a deep brotherly bond.

254
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:15,470
We've experienced

255
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:18,440
near-death situations together.

256
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:20,910
But people change.

257
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,190
Sometimes, trust

258
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:24,950
can't be

259
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:26,550
explained.

260
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:29,870
But I only

261
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:31,910
believe in evidence.

262
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:43,240
General Nan.

263
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,400
You’re guilty now.

264
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:46,780
If Commander Shang

265
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:47,910
knows what happened to you

266
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,150
and wants to avenge you,

267
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:50,370
we can't stop him.

268
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:52,310
Right now,

269
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:54,670
you should hide for a while

270
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:56,390
before we make plans.

271
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:00,290
Then

272
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:03,390
I’ll have to disturb you for a while, Dr. Yan.

273
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:09,030
Y-You want to stay here?

274
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:12,950
My... My place is very shabby.

275
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:14,740
I don't mind.

276
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:15,620
I do.

277
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,540
Her home's too far away.

278
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:26,600
It inconveniences your investigation in the capital.

279
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,670
Then I'll stay at your place.

280
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:31,550
No way.

281
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:37,980
I'm not used to living with others.

282
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,080
Where should I live then?

283
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:44,990
How about...

284
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,310
he stays in Yuejiang's Residence?

285
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:50,430
Your mother won't betray you.

286
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:51,430
Besides,

287
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,790
no one would dare search Yuejiang's Residence.

288
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:54,230
Right?

289
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,020
But my mother and I

290
00:14:58,750 --> 00:14:59,710
just had a fight.

291
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:02,920
There's no grudge between mother and son.

292
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:03,870
Look.

293
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,130
It's a good chance to make up with her.

294
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,170
That's a good idea.

295
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:17,290
You sure accept help readily.

296
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,000
It's settled then.

297
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:27,740
[Yuejiang's Residence]

298
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:29,630
General Nan, don't worry.

299
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,780
I will protect you.

300
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:34,930
Thank you, Your Highness.

301
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:38,290
Thank you, Mother.

302
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:40,960
Don't thank me.

303
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,640
It's not for your sake.

304
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,280
But we're hiding

305
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:47,570
an imperial criminal.

306
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:48,550
General Nan.

307
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:51,070
I hope you won't go out

308
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:52,350
and

309
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,160
don't wander around inside.

310
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:55,940
Don't move unless necessary.

311
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:57,350
Yes.

312
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:00,750
Mother.

313
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:04,210
Try to keep this from Grandpa

314
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:05,120
and Suoluo.

315
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:06,940
Especially Suoluo.

316
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,720
She's friends with Shang Bieli.

317
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,840
If he knows about this,

318
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:13,590
with how impulsive he is,

319
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:15,760
he might cause trouble.

320
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,480
Yes, Your Highness.

321
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,380
The less trouble, the better.

322
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:21,000
It saves us trouble.

323
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:25,230
Okay, I'll listen to you.

324
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:26,560
I won't tell her.

325
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:30,120
How can family members...

326
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:33,230
keep secrets from each other?

327
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:35,520
Greetings, Mother.

328
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:37,030
Mother.

329
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,230
Even Dr. Yan, an outsider,

330
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:40,230
knows about it,

331
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:41,750
but you can't

332
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,080
tell me, your daughter?

333
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:46,630
Suoluo.

334
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:52,470
Be discerning about

335
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,150
what you say.

336
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,520
General Nan is Mr. Shang’s brother,

337
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,610
so he's my friend.

338
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:00,350
I won't betray him.

339
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:01,590
Also,

340
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:03,650
when it comes to my family's

341
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:04,910
safety and interests,

342
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,120
I've always been discerning.

343
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,910
Don't worry.

344
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:23,950
Your sister knows what to do.

345
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:28,200
It's all your fault.

346
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:30,150
If you didn't mess up the blind date,

347
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,109
Mr. Pei could've helped us

348
00:17:31,109 --> 00:17:31,950
think of a way

349
00:17:32,109 --> 00:17:32,790
to hide him.

350
00:17:32,869 --> 00:17:33,630
Mother.

351
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,070
I know

352
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:38,830
you worked hard to arrange it for me.

353
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:39,390
But

354
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,180
because I'm in danger,

355
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:42,310
I'd

356
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:44,630
rather risk my life

357
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:46,770
than get others involved.

358
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:47,950
Are you confused?

359
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:49,430
What do you mean?

360
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:50,630
I'm setting up

361
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:51,820
a shield for you.

362
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:58,270
Mother.

363
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:01,270
You are my shield.

364
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:03,470
For my mother,

365
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:06,150
I'll also protect myself.

366
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,240
In my heart,

367
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:10,630
you're always my shield

368
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:12,350
and my weakness.

369
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:16,820
Forget it.

370
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:19,320
Let's not mention that now.

371
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:21,070
Just for now.

372
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:23,370
Don't think I'm annoying.

373
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,300
In this world,

374
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:25,550
only I'd worry

375
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:26,770
about your marriage.

376
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:30,430
And Nanxing.

377
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:32,310
She's been

378
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,600
worried sick for you.

379
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:34,670
Thank her now.

380
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:37,350
I...

381
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:38,870
I will repay her.

382
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:41,350
Sure.

383
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:42,870
All right.

384
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:43,630
Go back now.

385
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:45,680
We'll leave now.

386
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:46,670
Leave it to me.

387
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:49,150
Go.

388
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:50,480
Let's go.

389
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:00,790
How do you want to repay me?

390
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:05,290
How do you want me to repay you?

391
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:09,280
I'll think about it.

392
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:34,350
Gaya.

393
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:37,870
Today is your birthday.

394
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:40,970
I'm here to talk to you.

395
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:43,820
I miss you so much.

396
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,900
What's General Nan doing?

397
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:57,990
Your Grace.

398
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,400
Today is Lady Gaya's birthday.

399
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,000
He asked us to set up an altar.

400
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:03,130
I'm on my way to report it to Princess.

401
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:03,790
Okay.

402
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:18,470
Gaya.

403
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:21,910
Why didn't you wait for me?

404
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,580
How are you doing over there?

405
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:31,050
-Wait for me...
-General Nan.

406
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:42,150
My condolences,

407
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:44,550
General.

408
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:50,790
Actually,

409
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:52,270
I'd often heard about you

410
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:53,070
from Shang.

411
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,550
I've admired you for a long time.

412
00:20:58,870 --> 00:20:59,470
By the way,

413
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:01,310
I should thank you.

414
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:02,150
Thank me?

415
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:04,590
For what?

416
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,890
You and your wife

417
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:09,350
officiated my brother's wedding in Heman.

418
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:09,960
They received

419
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,620
you and your wife's kindness.

420
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:13,960
Of course I should thank you.

421
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:15,430
You...

422
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:18,550
know about it?

423
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:20,680
Of course.

424
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,470
He's my brother.

425
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:23,640
How could I not know?

426
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:27,890
What's wrong with you?

427
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:29,670
You know he's a fugitive.

428
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:31,180
Why didn't you stop him?

429
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,360
How dare he set up an altar in my residence?

430
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,710
Summoning ghosts and gods?

431
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,110
If someone's summoned here,

432
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:37,040
who'd pay for it?

433
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:38,300
But

434
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:40,520
I feel sorry for Nanxing

435
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:42,830
for having to keep it a secret.

436
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:45,430
In the future,

437
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:47,350
our family must make it up to her.

438
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,800
Gaya once said

439
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:54,200
Yan Nanxing and Jiang Xinbai will

440
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:55,690
have three marriages.

441
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:57,030
We've held

442
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:58,850
the first one for them.

443
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:01,790
The second and third ones

444
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:04,190
depend on their fates.

445
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:07,440
What did you say?

446
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:10,430
Get up!

447
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,010
What did you say?

448
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:14,880
Who has three marriages with whom?

449
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:17,350
Xinbai's bride in Heman

450
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,470
is Yan Nanxing?

451
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:21,450
Is it Blossom Beauty's Yan Nanxing?

452
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:35,680
Say something!

453
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:38,290
You dare to get married

454
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:39,780
but not admit it?

455
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:44,990
No wonder...

456
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:47,440
You're always so indifferent,

457
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:49,190
but you treat her so well.

458
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:50,110
And you!

459
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:52,320
You're always so fussy,

460
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:54,640
but you can do anything for him.

461
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,720
You newlyweds

462
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,150
sure share a strong bond!

463
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:58,790
That's not it!

464
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:00,590
Back then,

465
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:01,800
we got married

466
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:02,830
to solve the case.

467
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:04,330
We just held a ceremony.

468
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:05,440
Nothing else!

469
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:09,510
W-W-What she s-said

470
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:10,680
is quite true.

471
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:11,270
Shut up!

472
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:14,070
Mother.

473
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:15,130
You shut up too!

474
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:18,280
Don't interfere

475
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,280
when I'm talking!

476
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:20,710
Get out!

477
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:22,880
All of you, get out!

478
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:23,800
Yan Nanxing.

479
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:25,300
Stay here.

480
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:30,160
I'll be outside.

481
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,150
If anything happens,

482
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:35,000
just call me at the door.

483
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:58,310
You went to great lengths to put on this show.

484
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:59,370
Are you satisfied?

485
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:04,150
You three

486
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:05,670
are already in costume.

487
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:08,190
Do you blame me for asking for a show?

488
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:08,910
Suoluo.

489
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,430
You two, stop arguing.

490
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:12,960
It's all my fault.

491
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:14,690
-Shut up!
-Shut up!

492
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:17,320
Yan Nanxing.

493
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:20,670
I order you to close down Blossom Beauty

494
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:22,330
and get out of the capital!

495
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:23,880
Why?

496
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:24,720
I didn't

497
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,990
come here for Jiang Xinbai

498
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:27,250
but for my own affairs.

499
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:28,790
I don't care.

500
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:31,170
I'm the Princess of Yuejiang.

501
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:33,480
Even if I abuse my power to punish you,

502
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:34,440
what can you do?

503
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:36,010
This is unfair.

504
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:37,150
Marriage

505
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:38,410
is between two people.

506
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:39,790
You've let your dear son off,

507
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:40,350
but

508
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:42,370
you're finding fault with me.

509
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:44,970
How dare you talk back?

510
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:46,270
Guards!

511
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,450
Kick her out!

512
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:56,950
Mother!

513
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:04,530
Be it the Heman wedding

514
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,080
or keeping it from you,

515
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:07,510
I did it all on my own.

516
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:10,480
It's unrelated to Yan Nanxing.

517
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:12,830
Jiang Xinbai.

518
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:14,450
Listen carefully.

519
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,470
Your marriage

520
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:17,400
concerns the whole family.

521
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:18,990
You can't be willful.

522
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:20,630
Tie her up!

523
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:20,940
Yes.

524
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,820
Don't you dare!

525
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:27,810
A country has its laws.

526
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:29,170
A family has its rules.

527
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:31,350
She didn't break the law.

528
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,300
She also divorced me long ago,

529
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:34,630
so she need not

530
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:36,250
abide by our family's rules.

531
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:40,590
Fine.

532
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:42,910
I'll show you

533
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,030
a 100 ways to make her

534
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:47,000
close down her shop

535
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:48,490
and get out of the capital!

536
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:53,310
What's wrong?

537
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:54,390
Do you not

538
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:55,790
receive male customers?

539
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:03,580
Who said that?

540
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:04,510
Today,

541
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,200
we'll only receive

542
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,410
male customers.

543
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:08,950
Sai'er, Ruoqian,

544
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,270
let's show these customers

545
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:12,470
our hospitality.

546
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,720
-Okay!
-Okay!

547
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:18,830
I'm really sorry, everyone.

548
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:19,400
Here.

549
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:21,240
This is a small token of appreciation.

550
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,440
Take it back to use it.

551
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:23,640
Thank you.

552
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,900
Sorry for the trouble.

553
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:25,790
Next time,

554
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:26,870
we'll serve you well.

555
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:27,630
Okay, thank you.

556
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:28,340
This is for you.

557
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:29,740
I'm really sorry.

558
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:30,760
Next time...

559
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:35,270
What's wrong?

560
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:37,620
Nothing.

561
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:39,550
See you next time.

562
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:41,170
I'll give you a 50% discount.

563
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:44,670
Be gentle!

564
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:45,590
Ouch!

565
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:46,210
Be gentle!

566
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,060
Is this how you serve

567
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:48,780
customers?

568
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,000
I'll report you!

569
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:51,190
If you

570
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:53,100
aren't satisfied with our service,

571
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,300
you don't have to pay.

572
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,710
If you're here to make a scene,

573
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:57,990
I’ll have to report you

574
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:59,450
to the Inspection Office.

575
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:00,870
I remember.

576
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:03,190
You smashed so many things

577
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,540
in my shop just now.

578
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:05,950
Ruoqian.

579
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:08,230
You're familiar with our dynasty's law.

580
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:09,070
Tell us.

581
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:10,970
How long will they be detained

582
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:12,310
for smashing things?

583
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:13,550
70 days.

584
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:15,500
70?

585
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:17,260
Still wanna make a scene?

586
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:23,390
Move!

587
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:25,950
Move aside!

588
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:28,680
What are you looking at? Stop looking.

589
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:31,620
Remember to return our basket!

590
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:44,510
I'm so mad!

591
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:45,750
My head's about to explode!

592
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:46,550
You know what?

593
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:48,040
She bullied my men!

594
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,380
Suoluo.

595
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:50,200
Listen.

596
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:51,830
Use whatever method

597
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:52,800
you can

598
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:53,610
so Yan Nanxing

599
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:54,790
can't gain a foothold in the capital

600
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:55,470
and gets out of here.

601
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:56,800
The sooner, the better.

602
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:58,710
I know you're resourceful.

603
00:27:58,710 --> 00:27:59,920
Don't tell me you can't.

604
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,760
You can, right?

605
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,590
Don't worry, Mother.

606
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:02,580
You must get it done.

607
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:03,230
Leave it to me.

608
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:03,380
Okay.

609
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,580
You'll be satisfied.

610
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:06,160
This fan's useless.

611
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:07,060
I'm so hot.

612
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:08,400
I'm so angry!

613
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:15,110
I've bought this house.

614
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:17,110
Please move out

615
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:18,670
in a day.

616
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:22,850
Here's the compensation fee.

617
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:25,390
Fine.

618
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:27,100
I still have Blossom Beauty.

619
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,960
I've also bought Blossom Beauty.

620
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:31,510
Please move out of it

621
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,950
in a day too.

622
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:34,880
You're Imperial Academy's chancellor,

623
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,710
yet you resort to such dirty tricks.

624
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:37,550
Ms. Yan.

625
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:39,040
I've already told you that

626
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:41,060
since you're my brother's friend,

627
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,340
you aren't my friend.

628
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:44,160
If you aren't my friend,

629
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:45,280
you're my enemy.

630
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:47,390
You chose it yourself.

631
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:50,480
Luckily,

632
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:52,430
I chose to be friends

633
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:53,510
with your brother.

634
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:54,450
He's stubborn,

635
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:55,310
but he isn't

636
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:57,910
indiscriminate and spiteful like you.

637
00:28:58,570 --> 00:28:59,750
As an outsider,

638
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,480
you have no right to compare us.

639
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:05,360
If I can't stay here,

640
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,370
I'll find someplace else.

641
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,440
With money,

642
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:10,510
I won't have trouble finding a place.

643
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:11,830
I'm afraid no one here

644
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:13,990
would dare be your landlord.

645
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:16,030
Ms. Yan.

646
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:17,390
The world is vast.

647
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:20,020
Why don't you go somewhere else?

648
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:22,310
Don’t you worry about me.

649
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:24,550
This is still my home today.

650
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:25,890
Your Grace,

651
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,290
I won't send you off.

652
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:31,670
Take your time to pack up.

653
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:35,150
I forgot.

654
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:38,710
There are many people in the capital lately.

655
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:40,110
The inns are all full.

656
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:42,520
It won't be easy to find a place.

657
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,190
Bullying with your power!

658
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:49,920
One bad apple spoils the bunch!

659
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:02,150
That's the situation.

660
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:04,070
We'll be closed

661
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:05,670
for the time being.

662
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:07,480
Not necessarily, Boss.

663
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:11,860
I've written three petitions.

664
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,260
Report this to the Ministry of Revenue.

665
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,100
[To: Ministry of Revenue
From: Liu Ruoqian]

666
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:17,070
Report this to the Ministry of Personnel.

667
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,140
[To: Ministry of Personnel
From: Liu Ruoqian]

668
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,550
And this one

669
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:20,140
[To: His Majesty
From: Liu Ruoqian]

670
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:20,630
can be presented to His Majesty.

671
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:23,230
Although I haven't figured out

672
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:24,870
how I'd get it to His Majesty,

673
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:27,120
we can't sit back and do nothing

674
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,470
and let these nobles

675
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:29,510
bully us.

676
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:31,430
Ruoqian.

677
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:33,640
This is too troublesome.

678
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:34,630
Boss.

679
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:35,470
Let's take

680
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:36,750
the efficient route.

681
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:37,950
Tonight,

682
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:39,750
I'll sneak into Duke's residence.

683
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:40,430
With

684
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:41,740
this blade

685
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,200
on the Princess' neck,

686
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,400
she'll stop messing with us.

687
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:53,150
Boss.

688
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:56,430
Sai'er, Ruoqian.

689
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:58,600
These are your salaries

690
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:00,190
for this and next month.

691
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:01,840
Keep it well.

692
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:03,750
It’s enough for a while.

693
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,660
Wait, Boss.

694
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:07,510
We haven't worked for it yet.

695
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:08,670
How can we accept it?

696
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:09,290
Take it back.

697
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:09,810
Yes.

698
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:11,600
We can't accept this money.

699
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:12,790
Take it.

700
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:17,510
Just take it.

701
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:19,350

She and Mother are in a fight.

878
00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:28,010
What if she

879
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:28,970
spouts nonsense

880
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:30,510
outside

881
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:31,430
about us hiding

882
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:32,710
an imperial criminal?

883
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:34,310
You keep everything from me.

884
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:35,610
Even Yan Nanxing knows

885
00:40:35,610 --> 00:40:36,340
more than me.

886
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:39,170
Yan Nanxing will never

887
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:40,290
hurt anyone

888
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:42,310
for her own selfish reasons.

889
00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:43,470
Why are you so sure

890
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:44,950
she won't betray us?

891
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:46,190
Just because

892
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:47,270
she was once your woman?

893
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:47,750
Yes.

894
00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:49,790
Because she's my woman.

895
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,080
I trust her.

896
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:56,390
I'm afraid you're blinded

897
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,220
by love.

898
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:00,650
Things only turned out like this

899
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:02,380
as you offended Mother for her.

900
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:05,850
So you couldn't tell right from wrong

901
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:07,210
and drove her away?

902
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:09,550
That was Mother's order.

903
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:10,570
As a child,

904
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:11,830
it's natural to share

905
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:13,030
their parents' burdens.

906
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:14,080
It's filial piety.

907
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,920
But if our parents are in the wrong,

908
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,720
we should point out the mistakes

909
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:19,390
instead of letting them be a laughingstock

910
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:20,230
by defending

911
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:21,850
their so-called dignity.

912
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:23,930
This is the real filial piety.

913
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,390
You have your reasons

914
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:27,150
and I have my reasons.

915
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:28,070
Your reasons?

916
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:31,910
Let's put aside Yan Nanxing.

917
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,970
You asked Shang Bieli to take away Nan Jifeng.

918
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:37,470
Ruling out your suspicion of Yan Nanxing,

919
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:38,930
what logic warrants that?

920
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:39,870
I told you.

921
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:42,260
This is the best-case scenario

922
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:43,050
for General Nan

923
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:44,170
and our family.

924
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:46,890
I have a clear conscience.

925
00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:48,480
A clear conscience?

926
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:51,310
Suoluo.

927
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:53,150
You always say

928
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:54,760
I'm the one endangering

929
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,910
our family.

930
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:58,670
But have you ever thought about

931
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:00,580
how your actions

932
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,630
are really trapping our family

933
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:03,430
in injustice?

934
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:09,800
Benevolence, justice, loyalty, bravery.

935
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:12,070
This is our ancestral motto.

936
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:16,950
The Jiangs have earned great military merits for generations.

937
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:18,030
It's not for honor

938
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:20,230
but for the country

939
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:21,790
and the people.

940
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:24,730
As a Jiang descendant,

941
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:26,870
if you only care about our family's

942
00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:28,130
safety and interests,

943
00:42:28,610 --> 00:42:29,670
you'll truly be

944
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:31,270
letting our ancestors down.

945
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:34,300
Be it investigating Zornia

946
00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:36,050
or saving Nan Jifeng,

947
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:37,990
I've lived up

948
00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:39,550
to our ancestral

949
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:40,270
motto.

950
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:42,530
But what about you?

951
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:44,810
What have you done?

952
00:42:49,810 --> 00:42:50,800
To think you're

953
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:52,810
Imperial Academy's chancellor.

954
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:54,190
Suoluo.

955
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:56,890
You've really let me down.

956
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,170
His Majesty conferred the title on me.

957
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:05,700
It's not up to you whether I deserve it or not.

958
00:43:10,990 --> 00:43:12,280
I have work to do.

959
00:43:12,670 --> 00:43:13,230
Goodbye.
