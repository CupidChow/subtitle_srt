Untie you

12

No!

16
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,390

I wouldn't dare kill you.

No.

37
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,840
Jiang Xinbai sent you here?

38

It's really not what you think.

Why did you go to Longxin Teahouse?

41

I had never been to a teahouse before.

42
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,860
I was just there

43

44

50

let alone the so-called punishment.

54

Li Jun, Vice Director of Personnel,

61
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,130
denounced Nan Jifeng,

62
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:10,050
accusing him of taking huge bribes,

63
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,860
eliminating dissidents,

64
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:15,270
killing loyal officials, and running away to avoid punishment.

65

It happened sooner

66
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,240

67
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:19,630

00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:29,330
Commander.

178
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:30,670
Mr. Jiang is here.

179
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:48,760
Yan Nanxing?

180
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:51,990
Why…

181
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:54,010
Why are you dressed like this?

182
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,630
I have heavy makeup on.

183
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:56,960
How did he recognize me?

184
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:00,800
I'm asking you.

185
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:02,390
Ask him.

186
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:13,640
Let's go.

187
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:18,740
Shang Bieli, are you crazy?

188
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,630
You caused my sister-in-law's death,

189
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,960
and now you want my brother dead too?

190
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:27,430
What are you talking about?

191
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:28,430
Stop pretending!

192
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:30,830
My brother just went missing in Heman,

193
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:31,950
and this morning,

194
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:33,870
you sent your right-hand man there.

195
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:36,070
You want to confirm if he's dead, right?

196
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,300
You're so biased against me.

197
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,830
I have nothing to say to you.

198
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:45,870
Watch out!

199
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:54,390
Shang Bieli,

200
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,080
I don't want to fight with you today.

201
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:57,920
Shang Bieli,

202
00:09:58,430 --> 00:09:59,070
if Jiang Xinbai

203
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,270
wanted to harm General Nan,

204
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:01,870
he would've done it in Heman.

205
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,470
You know my brother?

206
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:05,440
I know not only your brother

207
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,100
but also your sister-in-law.

208
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:09,870
Lady Gaya was my friend.

209
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,380
You have to trust us.

210
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,030
Mr. Shang.

211
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:16,920
Are you okay?

212
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,120
Take a close look.

213
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,430
Were these knives used to remove

214
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:22,630
your mask last night?

215
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,150
It was you?

216
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:24,950
Yes.

217
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:26,940
I just wanted to confirm

218
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:28,190
if you were my fiancé.

219
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:38,350
So to sum up,

220
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,650
when your mom was about to give birth,

221
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,280
she ran into bandits

222
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:43,860
and was saved

223
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,830
by a righteous teenager.

224
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:47,750
In order to thank him,

225
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:48,990
she promised to marry the unborn you

226
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:49,830
to him.

227
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,240
But she didn't know

228
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,390
his name.

229
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:55,070
She only knew he was from the capital

230
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:56,470
and had a scar on his face?

231
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:00,280
My mom passed away three months ago.

232
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,030
Before she died,

233
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,690
she told me about this matter.

234
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,380
She drew me

235
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:04,990
my fiancé's portrait

236
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:06,430
from memory

237
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:08,690
and asked me to fulfill that promise.

238
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,240
You have the portrait,

239
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,350
but the person your mother drew

240
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:15,430
from memory

241
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,430
was what that boy looked like

242
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:18,510
in his teens.

243
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:20,310
Why were you sure

244
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:22,270
that boy was Shang Bieli?

245
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,630
I wasn't sure of it.

246
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:27,720
But I can see that Mr. Shang

247
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,520
is about ten years older than me.

248
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:31,790
He always wears a mask.

249
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,670
I simply wanted to see

250
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:34,130
if he had a scar on his face.

251
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,150
I really didn't mean

252
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,410
to cause such trouble.

253
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,560
I'm very sorry.

254
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,050
Mr. Shang, I just need to know

255
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:42,080
if you are my fiancé.

256
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:43,430
Can you show me your face?

257
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:44,310
-Enough!
-I…

258
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,400
You're making my head hurt.

259
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:51,020
I'm not your fiancé.

260
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:53,710
Wait. Let me explain.

261
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:54,910
I just want to fulfill

262
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:55,970
my mom's last wish.

263
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:56,510
If…

264
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:57,230
If…

265
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:57,950
If you

266
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:58,860
really don't want me,

267
00:11:58,860 --> 00:11:59,830
write me a repudiation letter.

268
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:00,750
I'll burn it to let my mom know.

269
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:01,350
Otherwise,

270
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:02,910
my mom will be turning in her grave.

271
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,910
I'll be too ashamed to meet her in the afterlife.

272
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:05,600
And I…

273
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:11,750
Come with me.

274
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,080
What are you going to do?

275
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,150
She doesn't believe me.

276
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:16,830
I'll show her my face.

277
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:18,530
Come.

278
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:34,960
Give me your arm.

279
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:36,070
For what?

280
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:37,640
I'll bandage it for you.

281
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:52,190
♫Sit with you at night and listen to the wind♫

282
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:55,630
♫When the wind flutters, the heart does too♫

283
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:59,250
♫Step by step, no words are spoken♫

284
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,210
♫Barged into sight♫

285
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:06,680
♫When did your figure grow hazy?♫

286
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:10,340
♫And how clear is it?♫

287
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,090
♫I don't intend to break your heart♫

288
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:16,300
♫Silently fall into my arms♫

289
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:19,870
♫The world is ever-changing♫

290
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:21,490
♫We still remember♫

291
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:22,630
♫To be the stars♫

292
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,550
♫That light up each other's worlds♫

293
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:27,220
♫I invite you♫

♫To hold a place in my heart♫

♫Stay together forever♫

296
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:43,430
You don't have a scar.

297
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:48,960
So you're not my fiancé.

298
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,120
That's what happened.

299
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:56,710
She was looking for someone,

300
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:57,430
and so was I.

301
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:58,110
As a result,

302
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,730
we bumped into each other.

303
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:06,150
What are you thinking? Say something.

304
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:09,870
Mr. Jiang.

305
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:11,670
I want to know

306
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:13,050
why Mr. Shang

307
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,210
doesn't have a nose.

308
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,740
He doesn't have a nose?

309
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,340
So,

310
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:21,050
he wears a mask

311
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:23,020
to cover that?

312
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:26,210
Five years ago,

313
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,710
Shang Bieli followed Nan Jifeng

314
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,000
to fight enemies at the border.

315
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:33,030
Unluckily, he was captured.

316
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,390
Shang Bieli only came back to the capital

317
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:35,350
five years ago.

318
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:37,440
He had been in the army before that.

319
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,310
It seems that Shang Bieli

320
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,100
is really not my young sir.

321
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:42,630
The enemies were barbarians

322
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:43,950
and cut off his nose

323
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:45,940
according to their convention

324
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,320
to humiliate him.

325
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:49,150
Then,

326
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:50,830
by luck, Shang Bieli

327
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:52,430
escaped from the prison camp

328
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:53,870
and returned to the battlefield.

329
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,000
He fought fiercely,

330
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:56,520
wiped out the enemy,

331
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,620
and became a decorated warrior.

332
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:01,310
To be honest,

333
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:03,510
before Shang Bieli was injured,

334
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:05,310
he was quite handsome.

335
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:07,630
But that incident

336
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,970
made him a completely difficult man.

337
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:12,670
So what he wants to cover with the mask

338
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,350
is not just his nose.

339
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:17,750
I think

340
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:19,790
Mr. Shang is just a heartbroken man

341
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,470
who lost his nose.

342
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:26,330
I'm afraid in the whole capital,

343
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:27,590
you're the only person

344
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:29,140
who will say that about him.

345
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:30,270
Really?

346
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:33,630
By the way,

347
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:34,590
Boss,

348
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,110
I got the wrong guy.

349
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:37,070
How about you?

350
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:43,910
I think I got the wrong guy as well.

351
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,340
The guy I'm looking for

352
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:47,990
is handsome,

353
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:49,990
gentle, considerate,

354
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:52,110
brave, and righteous.

355
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:53,230
To protect me,

356
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:54,760
he even put his life at risk.

357
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:58,190
If he's such a good man,

358
00:15:58,310 --> 00:15:59,950
how come you lost him?

359
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:06,310
Well,

360
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:08,670
people come and go.

361
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,390
We parted ways

362
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,070
for a better reunion.

363
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:15,360
Tong Sai'er.

364
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,630
According to the rules here,

365
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:18,670
outsiders

366
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:20,530
who want to live in the capital

367
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:22,450
have to get formally registered.

368
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:23,790
Your paperwork is not done yet.

369
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:26,390
You have to go to the Inspection Office with me.

370
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:27,270
But I…

371
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,110
Go with him.

372
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:28,590
Go.

373
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:30,830
You must go to the Inspection Office.

374
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:32,290
But you can't go like this.

375
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:33,550
You need to

376
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:34,830
wash up and get changed

377
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:35,760
to show respect.

378
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:36,750
Don't bother.

379
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:38,190
No way.

380
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:39,680
It's not a bother at all.

381
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:41,290
It's a government office.

382
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:42,850
Take it seriously.

383
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:32,950
Bieli.

384
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,870
Everyone's waiting for you at the celebration.

385
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:37,400
Let's go.

386
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:44,190
I was once taken captive.

387
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:47,040
I don't deserve to celebrate.

388
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:49,810
Who said that?

389
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,700
You won this battle.

390
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,140
You're the greatest hero.

391
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,380
As a man,

392
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,510
you don't need

393
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:06,870
good looks to be accomplished.

394
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:07,540
What they cut off

395
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:08,470
was not my nose,

396
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:09,500
but my dignity!

397
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:10,390
My dignity!

398
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,330
If you're so upset about it,

399
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:22,350
fine,

400
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:25,330
I'll lose my nose with you.

401
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:27,750
Brother!

402
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:32,270
Brother,

403
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:35,890
that's not what I mean.

404
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:40,680
I failed to protect you.

405
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,480
If you've lost your dignity,

406
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:46,550
so have I.

407
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:51,830
Nan.

408
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:00,020
Nan.

409
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:01,530
I have a gift

410
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:03,020
for Shang.

411
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:15,910
Shang, in my eyes,

412
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:17,990
you've always been unique.

413
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,730
This mask

414
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:22,750
is made of seven kinds of ore.

415
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:24,910
Only the best warrior in my tribe

416
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:25,750
can wear it.

417
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,470
When you wear it,

418
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,560
the world will only remember

419
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:31,270
that you

420
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:33,350
are an invincible hero.

421
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:58,710
Gaya.

422
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:00,870
I promise you,

423
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:03,970
I'll find my brother.

424
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:14,710
Mother.

425
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:16,590
I went to the palace today

426
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,390
to catch up with the crown prince.

427
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:20,100
I heard that Li Jun, Vice Director of Personnel,

428
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,830
denounced General Nan Jifeng,

429
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,540
saying that countless valuables

430
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:25,670
were found in the General's Residence

431
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,790
and that General Nan might have fled

432
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:29,110
to escape punishment.

433
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:30,630
Really?

434
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,910
His Majesty has ordered

435
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:34,440
an investigation in Heman.

436
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:36,910
I'm afraid

437
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:38,550
Xinbai may be blamed too.

438
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:45,100
What does it have to do with Xinbai?

439
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,670
He just came back from Heman,

440
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:50,360
and something so serious happened there.

441
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:52,790
What if His Majesty blames him?

442
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,150
How do you know

443
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:56,550
Xinbai went to Heman?

444
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,790
Mr. Shang told me.

445
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:00,190
How did he know?

446
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,910
Mother, don't worry.

447
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:04,440
Mr. Shang intended no harm.

448
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:06,300
He told me this

449
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:08,350
just because he was worried that the Jiang family

450
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,550
might be implicated.

451
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,160
What else did he say?

452
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,430
He also said that after Xinbai came back,

453
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:16,070
the Inspection Office and Jinwu Guards

454
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:18,000
had a conflict at the Ghost Market.

455
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:20,560
A conflict at the Ghost Market?

456
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,590
Conflicts between two government departments

457
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:24,870
are quite normal,

458
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:27,070
but weirdly,

459
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,990
Xinbai was actually taken hostage

460
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:31,650
by a woman at the Ghost Market.

461
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:33,710
Taken hostage?

462
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:35,150
By a woman?

463
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,620
What's weirder is that

464
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,320
instead of

465
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:38,630
punishing that woman,

466
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:39,600
Xinbai

467
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:40,750
just let her go.

468
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:43,750
I'm worried

469
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:46,070
that woman may have something

470
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:47,580
on Xinbai.

471
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,950
How could that happen?

472
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:54,440
Mother.

473
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:56,830
I think Xinbai didn't tell you

474
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:58,990
because he didn't want you to worry.

475
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:01,470
How about

476
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:03,510
I talk to him?

477
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,000
No need.

478
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:07,590
You and he

479
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:08,860
never get along.

480
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,430
You fight whenever you meet.

481
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:11,360
I'll talk to him.

482
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,670
Mother.

483
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:14,970
It's not that I have an issue with him.

484
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:16,190
It's just that

485
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:17,520
he's never cared for me.

486
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,600
He does care for you. He just…

487
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:29,860
You'll understand one day.

488
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:44,910
[Inspection Office]

489
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,470
My lord.

490
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:50,850
Let her in for some paperwork.

491
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:51,670
Yes, my lord.

492
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:54,670
You can't recognize me, can you?

493
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:55,590
I knew what happened just now

494
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:57,770
at Shang Bieli's house was an accident.

495
00:22:57,770 --> 00:22:59,500
I'll give you a hard time later.

496
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:03,520
Let's go.

497
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:20,910
Have you brought Blossom Beauty's license with you?

498
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:22,590
Hold it. I can't speak.

499
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:24,110
To do the paperwork

500
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,150
for someone else, you need

501
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:27,190
to show your ID,

502
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:28,290
Ms. Yan.

503
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:32,050
Yes.

504
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:34,270
Stop trying to test me.

505
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,440
If you want

506
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:37,730
your sketchbook back,

507
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,270
you can beg me.

508
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,510
Dream on.

509
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:29,330
Why are you still here?

510
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:30,760
I'm waiting for you.

511
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,360
I saw

512
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:34,050
a lot of fruits

513
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:35,050
in the yard above.

514
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:36,510
Why didn't anyone pick them?

515
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:37,510
I just tasted one.

516
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:38,570
It was very sweet.

517
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,040
Try it.

518
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:46,590
You stayed here

519
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:48,230
just to pick fruit?

520
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:50,190
Of course not.

521
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:54,160
I want to ask you something.

522
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:56,910
At Shang Bieli's house during the day,

523
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,200
I was all dressed up.

524
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,380
And tonight,

525
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:00,340
I'm wearing

526
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,870
the same clothes as Sai'er.

527
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:04,000
How did you manage to recognize me?

528
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:07,110
To me,

529
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:09,470
no matter what clothes you wear,

530
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,840
whether your hair is different,

531
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,640
or whether you smell different,

532
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:15,390
it makes no difference.

533
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:16,550
You

534
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,370
are just you.

535
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:32,310
Well,

536
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:34,150
were you

537
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:34,950
born this way?

538
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:37,920
Or did you become like this afterward?

539
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:39,630
How can you work like this?

540
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:42,250
Maybe you can get help at work,

541
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:44,170
but how do you live after work?

542
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,230
I know.

543
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:52,630
You're like a cat.

544
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:55,150
Cats and dogs

545
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:57,600
usually can't recognize their owners.

546
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,440
But their keen sense of smell

547
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:00,710
and hearing

548
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:01,930
can help them do it.

549
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,510
Or,

550
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:05,990
you're like a cat

551
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:08,240
that loves cuddling up to its owner

552
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,110
to make marks.

553
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:12,190
Do you like making marks too?

554
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:15,010
Swear at me if you want.

555
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,200
Don't compare me to cats and dogs.

556
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:19,320
I'm right, aren't I?

557
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,760
Tell me about you.

558
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,600
What's the feeling that's guiding you

559
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:30,160
in your search for that man?

560
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,410
Tell me.

561
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:35,990
You cherish your life so much.

562
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:38,330
How good does he have to be

563
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:40,990
to be worth all your efforts to find him?

564
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:45,400
What does it have to do with you?

565
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:47,310
If you say it like that,

566
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:49,440
I'm very likely to get the wrong idea

567
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,640
that you're jealous.

568
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,390
I'm just sick of

569
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:56,720
running around for you.

570
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,030
I don't have time

571
00:26:58,190 --> 00:26:59,190
to save you again.

572
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:00,320
No need for that.

573
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:00,810
No need.

574
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,070
No matter what happens in the future,

575
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:04,600
I'll never ask you for help.

576
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:05,360
I'm leaving.

577
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,320
By the way,

578
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:11,980
I have something on you now.

579
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,630
My sketchbook;

580
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:15,830
I'll get it back sooner or later.

581
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:17,750
Take it.

582
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:28,630
Yan Nanxing.

583
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,000
At Shang Bieli's house,

584
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:32,910
why could I recognize her

585
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:34,990
without using any tricks?

586
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:01,550
[Blossom Beauty]

587
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:05,630
Sai'er.

588
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:07,830
You were so thoughtless.

589
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:08,630
You forced him

590
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:09,690
to pick at his scab.

591
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,220
I need to apologize to him.

592
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:16,510
What do you think

593
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,430
I should do

594
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:20,860
to compensate Mr. Shang?

595
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:22,960
Morning.

596
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:24,690
Morning, Boss.

597
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:25,970
Morning, Boss.

598
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:27,520
What are you talking about?

599
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,760
Sai'er just told me

600
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:31,050
what happened at Mr. Shang's yesterday.

601
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:34,070
You said you'd keep it a secret.

602
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:37,240
Ruoqian isn't an outsider.

603
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:38,730
Boss, don't worry.

604
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:40,250
I'll keep it a secret.

605
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:48,590
Sai'er.

606
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:56,150
What's wrong?

607
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:58,550
Here's the thing.

608
00:28:59,030 --> 00:28:59,590
Sai'er,

609
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:03,230
your portrait

610
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:06,110
is too blurry.

611
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:07,790
I…

612
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:09,530
It's fine, Boss.

613
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:13,990
I understand.

614
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:16,880
I…

615
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:19,680
I just need an excuse

616
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:21,110
to stay here for longer.

617
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:27,710
You don't need any excuses.

618
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,510
Stay if you want.

619
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:30,150
Stay forever.

620
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:30,630
Okay?

621
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:32,200
Both Ruoqian and I

622
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,390
welcome you, right?

623
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:39,710
Don't cry.

624
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,430
It's a joyful thing.

625
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:43,530
You should smile.

626
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:44,630
Smile.

627
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:49,350
Ruoqian.

628
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:50,990
Boss.

629
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:53,070
I promise

630
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:55,390
I won't hide anything from you anymore.

631
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,000
I trust you.

632
00:29:58,270 --> 00:29:59,350
I trust you too.

633
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:05,310
As for me,

634
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:06,930
I have nothing to hide.

635
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:07,950
I'm a slave.

636
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:09,210
A top student.

637
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:10,070
Very likeable.

638
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:11,730
You two already know that.

639
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:16,870
Boss.

640
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,070
How about you?

641
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:22,390
Me?

642
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,630
I…

643
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:27,880
I…

644
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:29,550
I…

645
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:30,760
I'm just kidding.

646
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:32,830
Boss,

647
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:35,400
you don't have to tell us your secrets.

648
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:36,590
You can tell us

649
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:37,670
when you're ready.

650
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:41,840
What matters is not what you think but what you do.

651
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,700
Even a saint has bad thoughts too.

652
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:50,950
Mr. Shang.

653
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:52,370
Oh my god.

654
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,830
Is he here for me?

655
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:57,860
He's here for me.

656
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:14,390
You're very efficient, Mr. Shang.

657
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:16,110
You came to me so soon.

658
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:17,590
You knew I'd come?

659
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:20,270
You want to ask me

660
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:22,050
about Gaya, right?

661
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:28,190
That day, in Twelve Music House,

662
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:31,270
I heard you call a dancer

663
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:33,470
Gaya.

664
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:45,310
You didn't do anything wrong

665
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:47,880
or disturb her and General Nan.

666
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:53,460
Were you really Gaya's friend?

667
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:42,410
She's still so beautiful.

668
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:55,230
Did she

669
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:57,810
ever mention me?

670
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:05,910
Yeah.

671
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:09,170
She didn't have any reason

672
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:11,370
to mention me.

673
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:13,120
She and I

674
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:14,590
weren't friends for long.

675
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:16,070
Maybe she just didn't have time

676
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:17,730
to talk about certain things.

677
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:22,390
No matter how many times I ask you

678
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,560
whether Gaya's death was caused

679
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,510
by Jiang Xinbai,

680
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,900
you won't answer me, will you?

681
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:32,130
I can only tell you that

682
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:34,960
Jiang Xinbai did nothing wrong.

683
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,400
So Gaya was wrong?

684
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:44,330
Do you really want to know the answer?

685
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:45,990
Have you ever thought that

686
00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:47,810
your brother kept it from you

687
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:49,030
because he wanted Gaya

688
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:50,830
to stay a good woman in your eyes?

689
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:52,950
Actually, deep down, you're afraid

690
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:53,960
to know the truth.

691
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:58,000
You stand against Jiang Xinbai

692
00:33:58,470 --> 00:33:59,910
because you're afraid.

693
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:06,280
You're on Jiang Xinbai's side.

694
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:08,429
Of course you'd say that.

695
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:13,449
I'm not on his side.

696
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:18,449
I'm not on his side.

697
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:19,870
Not now.

698
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:21,389
Not in the past.

699
00:34:22,469 --> 00:34:23,469
Not in the future.

700
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:27,389
I hope it's true.

701
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:30,110
I'm not done

702
00:34:30,699 --> 00:34:31,960
with Jiang Xinbai yet.

703
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:35,550
You were Gaya's friend.

704
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:39,210
I don't want to drag you in.

705
00:34:58,390 --> 00:34:59,030
Can you

706
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:02,170
give me this portrait?

707
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,400
Thank you.

708
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:31,670
Mother.

709
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,580
What brought you here?

710
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:34,380
I heard

711
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:36,790
Nan Jifeng, the general overseeing Heman,

712
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:37,750
was accused

713
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:40,270
of taking bribes,

714
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:43,560
and he's fled to the border to escape punishment.

715
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:44,590
Those bribes

716
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:46,030
were from the enemy.

717
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:47,890
They tried to buy off General Nan,

718
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:49,860
and he played along.

719
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,480
He didn't spend a penny of them

720
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:54,380
because he hoped that one day

721
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:56,040
he could prove his innocence.

722
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,270
I planned

723
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:00,000
to wait for an opportunity

724
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:01,720
to report it to His Majesty.

725
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:03,210
But unexpectedly,

726
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,020
the rumors spread so fast.

727
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:09,630
I'll go to the palace now.

728
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:10,470
Don't go.

729
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:13,090
His Majesty has sent people

730
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:14,690
to Heman for investigation.

731
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:16,630
Xinbai,

732
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:18,330
why hasn't His Majesty given this task

733
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:19,790
to the Inspection Office?

734
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:21,470
Can't you

735
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:23,790
read between the lines?

736
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:27,780
No matter how highly His Majesty thinks of you,

737
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:29,380
you're the Duke of Yuejiang.

738
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:31,040
More or less,

739
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:32,570
he sees you as a threat.

740
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:35,930
The fact that you went to Heman

741
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:36,990
should be kept a secret.

742
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:37,720
At this time,

743
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:39,750
you must not provoke him.

744
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:41,870
Moreover…

745
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:44,790
By the way,

746
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:47,070
at the Ghost Market, did you…

747
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:50,190
Suoluo told you

748
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:51,660
I had a conflict

749
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:53,970
with Shang Bieli at the Ghost Market?

750
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:56,800
Forget it.

751
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:59,000
Let's not talk about that.

752
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:01,190
Xinbai.

753
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:02,950
Can you promise me

754
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,630
to drop

755
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:07,020
the Zornia case for now?

756
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:08,990
Can you?

757
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:19,990
Mother,

758
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:22,620
have you talked to Xinbai?

759
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:28,070
I also found out

760
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,250
that the woman who took him hostage

761
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:32,480
opened a store in Ruyi District

762
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,550
instead of leaving the capital.

763
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:36,440
How about

764
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:37,760
I go meet her?

765
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:40,230
Suoluo.

766
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:43,750
The Imperial Academy will start giving classes soon.

767
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:45,080
As a female chancellor,

768
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,230
shouldn't you pay more attention

769
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:48,400
to your students?

770
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:53,670
Daughter,

771
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:56,590
you're the first

772
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,960
female chancellor in this dynasty.

773
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,380
I'm happy for you

774
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:01,670
and proud of you.

775
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:05,470
But women are at a disadvantage in this game.

776
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:06,590
That's exactly why

777
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:08,550
you can't give others ammunition.

778
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:11,140
To get everything I have now,

779
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:14,430
my cousins and I were once

780
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:16,110
at each other's throats.

781
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:18,910
So I hope

782
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:20,570
you can take the high road too.

783
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:26,030
I'll keep that in mind.

784
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:32,640
As for that woman…

785
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:39,980
I have a plan for her.

after you hired new staff,

789
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:04,370
your business is even better.

790
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:05,820
Hello.

791
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:07,310
How can I help you?

Where is Yan Nanxing?

You can tell me what you need.

I am Yan Nanxing.

797
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:21,660
What can I do for you?

798
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:26,550

Fairy Powder.

801

Good name.

802
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:34,770
But it's an exaggeration.

803
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:41,430
The main component is motherwort.

804
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:42,560
There's also poria,

pearl powder, and other herbs in it.

806
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:47,530
Most importantly,

807
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:49,310
there's jimsonweed in it.

808
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:52,360
Ladies,

809
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,660
jimsonweed is poisonous.

810
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,430
It has a great immediate effect,

811
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,970
but once you stop using it,

812
00:39:58,970 --> 00:40:00,970
your skin will age ten times faster.

813

Ten times faster?

00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:03,510
Besides,

815
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:05,470
if you use it for a long time,

816
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,080
you may faint or go into a coma

817

No way.

Talking about toxicity without considering dosage

00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:45,030
-Sai'er.
-Boss.

872
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:45,870
Listen to me, Sai'er.

873
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:46,270
Boss.

874
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:46,950
Sai'er, calm down.

875
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:48,610
-Boss.
-Sai'er, listen to me.

876
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:49,470
Calm down.

877
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:50,450
It may be a trap.

878
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:54,140
We need an explanation.

879
00:41:59,350 --> 00:41:59,950
Mrs. Bao.

880
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:00,660
Mrs. Bao.

881
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:02,230
What should we do?

882
00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:03,790
How would I know?

883
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:05,590
Ms. Yan should know better

884
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:06,290
than to antagonize

885
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:07,720
the Jiang family.

886
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:09,110
That's right.

887
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:12,660
Some time ago,

888
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:14,630
the Duke of Yuejiang came here, didn't he?

889
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:15,870
Aren't they friends?

890
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:16,630
Yes.

891
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:19,180
Jiang Xinbai is the Duke of Yuejiang.

892
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:20,190
Yes.

893
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:20,950
Right.

894
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:23,020
Thank you, Mrs. Bao.

895
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,400
What did I say?

896
00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:29,120
