4
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,200
In your opinion,

5
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:59,180
is there some truth

6
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:00,890
in what Li Jun said?

7
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:09,630
Your Majesty,

8
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,590
Li Jun was killed by Lu Dingzhao

9
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,650
before he could tell you everything.

10
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:16,070
I'm afraid

11
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,079
most of what he said is true.

12
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:22,030
Your Majesty.

13
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:25,090
They must still be hiding something.

14
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:28,870
Or

15
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,250
they're afraid of something.

Jiang Xinbai.

17
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:38,180
I allow you to go back to the Inspection Office

18
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,040
to be the deputy chief constable.

19
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,510
But you must

20
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:42,270
get to the bottom

21
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,630
of this matter for me!

22
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:51,310
Your Majesty,

23
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:53,200
I'm afraid it's not a good idea.

24
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:56,190
Your Majesty,

25
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:57,610
now,

26
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:59,440
the place I should go to

27
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:01,590
is not the Inspection Office

28
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,030
but Tingzhou.

29
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:06,790
Your Majesty,

30
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:10,230
the South and the West have different trade routes.

31
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:11,890
It's Daqi that connects them.

32
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:13,250
And Tingzhou

33
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,500
is a crucial hub on the western trade route.

34
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,510
My preliminary conclusion

35
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:19,810
is that Lu Dingzhao

36
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:21,600
wanted to transport Zornia

37
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:23,670
out of the country via Tingzhou.

38
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:25,710
Are you sure of it?

39
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,360
To confirm my guess,

40
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,030
I have to go to Tingzhou first.

41
00:03:33,829 --> 00:03:34,590
Besides,

42
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,420
I may also find the truth

43
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,280
that Lu Dingzhao would rather die

44
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,630
than reveal

45
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:42,290
in Tingzhou.

46
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:46,460
But if you go straight to Tingzhou,

47
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:50,070
it may alert them.

48
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,070
You're wise, Your Majesty.

49
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:55,060
You must already have a plan.

50
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:59,520
I appoint you as regional inspector

51
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:03,110
to inspect the Western Route on my behalf.

52
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,550
Thank you, Your Majesty.

53
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:15,910
Why didn't you discuss with me

54
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,440
your plan to go to Tingzhou?

55
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:21,269
No risk, no reward.

56
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,040
Tingzhou is so dangerous.

57
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,300
My brother died there.

58
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:26,000
Do you want to die there too?

59
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,350
So I have to go alone.

60
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:30,960
You should stay in the capital.

61
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:31,750
Stay here?

62
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:32,750
Why?

63
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:36,950
I have a feeling that

64
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:39,430
taking down Lu Dingzhao

65
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,110
will lure out

66
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,100
the mastermind that's hiding deep in the dark.

67
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:47,310
The capital

68
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:50,200
is more dangerous than before.

69
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,480
I also feel something is wrong.

70
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:55,510
So,

71
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,350
you need to stay in the capital

72
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:58,409
and keep an eye out.

73
00:04:58,940 --> 00:04:59,550
Besides,

74
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,440
you must be careful.

75
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:02,390
I know.

76
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:03,870
I'll keep

77
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,130
your Yan Nanxing safe.

78
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:09,750
And you.

79
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:14,390
You should stay safe too.

80
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:22,470
Stop nagging.

81
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:25,830

any useful information.

At this time,

95

How can I calm down?

telling women to calm down.

101
00:05:58,909 --> 00:05:59,770
If a woman can't calm down,

I won't get myself killed.

106

Your Highness, crying too long is bad for your health.

107

I'm not crying!

108
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:35,870
Do you know

109
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,070
what the places along the Western Route are like?

110
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,550
They're barren and remote,

111
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:40,370
full of bandits

112
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:41,940
and highwaymen.

113
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:43,470
Sorry, Mother,

114

for making you worry.

115
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:47,390
Actually,

116
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:52,550
I asked to be the regional inspector myself.

117
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,230
What?

118
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,560

Why did you do that?

121
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:00,660
Is it because of Zornia again?

122
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:01,510
Xinbai.

123
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,670
You can look into Zornia

124
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:04,270
whenever you want in the capital.

125
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,270
Why travel so far?

126
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:06,510
Even if you think it's fine

127
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:07,910
to not discuss it with us,

128
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:08,800
you should consider

129
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,060
your wife's feelings.

130
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,220
Can you bring yourself

131
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,350
to leave her behind?

132
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:14,310
Mother.

133
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:17,030
I have reason to believe that

134
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,760
the current scourge of Zornia

135
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:20,360
has persisted

136
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,380
for over 20 years.

137
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:24,190
The mastermind behind it

138
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:26,190
is the culprit

139
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:27,870
who caused my father's death.

140
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,080
The deaths of General Nan and my father

141
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,120
must not go in vain.

142
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:35,780
I

143
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,680
have to continue the investigation.

144
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,890
Now, I have to go to Tingzhou

145
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:44,940
to find new clues.

146
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:47,070
On the surface,

147
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,310
His Majesty is sending me to inspect the Western Route.

148
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:51,110
In fact,

149
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:53,390
he's given me a chance

150
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:55,420
to go to Tingzhou

151
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,150
to find out the truth.

152
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:00,150
But Xinbai,

153
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:02,870
I've already lost

154
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:03,910
your father.

155
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:07,830
Mother.

156
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,390
I'm not my father.

157
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:11,810
At least this time,

158
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:13,550
I won,

159
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:15,470
didn't I?

160
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,310
Xinbai.

161
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:19,790
Xinbai.

162
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:21,670
If you think

163
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,470
this is what you must do,

164
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,550
just do it.

165
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,870
I'm proud of you.

166
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:35,360
Thank you, Grandfather.

167
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:35,950
Xinbai.

168
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,080
When are you leaving?

169
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:43,370
Tomorrow morning.

170
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:48,390
Mother.

171
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:50,350
Mother!

172
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:52,230
Mother.

173
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:01,350
After I come back from Tingzhou,

174
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:02,690
I'll come up with a plan

175
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:05,400
to break your engagement with Yan Biqing.

176
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:09,870
I agreed to this engagement myself.

177
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:10,990
If I break it,

178
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:14,190
the Yan family will feel humiliated

179
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:16,780
and say we're throwing our weight around.

180
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:19,250
I mean to throw my weight around.

181
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:24,280
Alright.

182
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:26,710
Leave it.

183
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:27,880
I'll find a way.

184
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,820
Take care of yourself.

185
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:38,390
Xinbai.

186
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:41,750
I…

187
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,950
have something to tell you.

188
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:49,590
Suoluo.

189
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,670
Where are your servants?

190
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:55,710
I dismissed them.

191
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:57,590
Dismissed?

192
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:59,200
Why?

193
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:01,860
You've lived alone for years.

194
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,750
You have no servants either, do you?

195
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:04,670
So,

196
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:06,650
I want to follow your example.

197
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,500
Follow my example?

198
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:11,610
You never think of yourself as a duke.

199
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:12,670
Besides,

200
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,020
you treat

201
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:15,710
everyone equally.

202
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:20,030
On that point,

203
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:22,470
I think you're doing better than me.

204
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:25,870
So I want to improve myself

205
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:27,310
in this way.

206
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:33,150
Am I right in thinking

207
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:35,630
that the fight between us

208
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:37,760
is officially over?

209
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:40,630
Then,

210
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:45,230
shouldn't we

211
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,880
have a celebratory toast?

212
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:51,990
Sure.

213
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:53,600
Wait for me.

214
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:10,930
I'd like to drink to you

215
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:14,210
and wish you a smooth journey.

216
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:17,530
Looks like I have to

217
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,600
finish this cup of wine.

218
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:33,510
Xinbai, you once said

219
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,070
you won't compete with me

220
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:37,430
for the inheritance of Yuejiang's Residence.

221
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,830
Actually,

222
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:41,080
I've changed my mind recently.

223
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:45,510
A princess without royal blood

224
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:47,150
can neither protect her family

225
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:48,880
nor those loyal to our country.

226
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:50,890
You and your father

227
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:54,320
went through so much to eradicate Zornia.

228
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:55,800
But when you were

229
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:56,670
in danger,

230
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:58,990
who was there to protect you?

231
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:03,310
So?

232
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,110
So,

233
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:13,030
I'll be the first female grand councilor of this country.

234
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,630
Only when I become

235
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:16,430
the second most powerful person

236
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:18,350
will I be able to

237
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:19,990
protect loyal officials

238
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:22,120
and punish rebels and outlaws.

239
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:25,890
You're laughing at me?

240
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:31,230
Sit.

241
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:39,280
Are you drunk?

242
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,760
You can't hold your liquor at all.

243
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:44,550
Suoluo.

244
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:47,350
Listen to me.

245
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:51,790
You're intelligent

246
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:52,760
and capable.

247
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:56,670
It's true that you shouldn't stop here.

248
00:12:59,030 --> 00:12:59,980
You should

249
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:02,620
have greater ambitions.

250
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:04,670
However,

251
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,450
you may not like

252
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:11,090
what it takes to get to the top.

253
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,770
You have to say things you don't mean,

254
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,960
keep up appearances,

255
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:20,840
lie through your teeth,

256
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:24,310
and have a cold heart.

257
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:32,870
Can you

258
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,210
do all these things?

259
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:43,110
I've set sail.

260
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,420
I won't stop

261
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,120
before I reach the shore.

262
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,430
I trust you.

263
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:12,060
Xinbai.

264
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,450
You must come back safely.

265
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,880
I'll wait for you to cancel my engagement.

266
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:23,340
You also need to see how I'll become

267
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,270
the first female grand councilor.

268
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:29,790
Okay.

269
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:35,070
Of all the time I've spent with you,

270
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:35,780
I've never been

271
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:37,190
as happy as I am now.

272
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,310
Me neither.

273
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,260
I missed the original you.

274
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:40,190
You drank?

275
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:44,030
Blame Suoluo.

276
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:45,910
She made me drink.

277
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,590
How old are you?

278
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:51,090
Only kids tell on their siblings.

279
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,150
You're making medicine?

280
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,030
Are you sick?

281
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:05,750
The shapeshifting this time was so sudden.

282
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:07,180
I think

283
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:09,310
it might be due to a lack of Qi and blood.

284
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:11,640
So I'm making medicine to replenish them.

285
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:17,600
Yan Nanxing.

286
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:20,870
Come with me.

287
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:23,670
I need to give you something.

288
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:25,790
What's it?

289
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:27,510
A gift?

290
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:36,500
Divorce?

291
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,940
We've been married for just two days,

292
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,400
and you want to divorce me?

293
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:45,510
Yan Nanxing,

294
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,610
it's not what you think.

295
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,830
Then what is it?

296
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:52,880
This divorce agreement

297
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,500
was written

298
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:56,790
before we got married.

299
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:57,670
You'd planned

300
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:59,670
to divorce me before we got married?

301
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,290
I'm going to Tingzhou,

302
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:10,569
leaving tomorrow.

303
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:12,849
On the surface,

304
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:16,290
His Majesty has appointed me as regional inspector

305
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:18,329
to inspect the Western Route.

306
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,230
Actually,

307
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:22,569
he's allowed me to investigate in Tingzhou.

308
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,109
When

309
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:28,590
you set off fireworks for me on the gate tower

310
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,520
to encourage me,

311
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:31,390
I made up my mind

312
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,240
that if we could get it through,

313
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:36,760
I'd go to Tingzhou for investigation.

314
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:37,950
Then go.

315
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:39,830
Why must we get a divorce?

316
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:41,750
Hear me out.

317
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:44,470
Shang Bieli

318
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,350
said I married you

319
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:48,200
not just because I love you.

320
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,600
Actually, he was right.

321
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:53,950
Our marriage

322
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:56,670
is a lifeline I prepared for you.

323
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:59,070
What lifeline?

324
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,100
Before we got married,

325
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:03,420
I didn't know

326
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,750
Lu Dingzhao and Li Jun would die.

327
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:07,130
So I thought

328
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,800
being the duchess

329
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:09,960
could keep you safe.

330
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:13,410
I prepared the divorce agreement

331
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:14,750
because I was worried that

332
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:15,590
someone

333
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,670
might frame me again

334
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:20,410
and my family would be dragged in.

335
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:22,310
If that happened,

336
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,680
you could take out this divorce agreement

337
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,280
and sever relations with me.

338
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,230
This way,

339
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:29,950
you wouldn't be implicated.

340
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:31,790
Lu Dingzhao and Li Jun

341
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:32,750
are dead now.

342
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:35,110
But the capital is still not safe.

343
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:37,040
I don't care.

344
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:39,560
I'm going to Tingzhou with you.

345
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:43,910
No regional inspector before me

346
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:46,040
has done the inspection with his wife.

347
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:47,870
Then I'll sign

348
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:48,910
the divorce agreement now.

349
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:50,130
I won't be your wife.

350
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:51,590
I can be a servant of yours.

351
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:52,790
Can I go with you then?

352
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:57,080

During this inspection,

This is just an excuse.

You just want to leave me behind.

Fine.

362

To tell you the truth,

00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:21,630
I hope

[To my wife, Nanxing]

Nanxing, my dear,

384
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,880
I fell in love with you

385
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:26,670
when we met in Heman,

386
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:29,370
but I was too dense to realize it.

387
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:30,640
Later,

388
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,630
I had no choice

389
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,880
but to trick you into marrying me.

390
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,140
I used you and hurt you.

391
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:39,570
I can't tell you how sorry I am.

392
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:42,520
Then we met again in the capital.

393
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,720
You could still make my heart beat fast.

I'm fortunate to marry you again.

396
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:34,630
I only wish to grow old with you

397

398

00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:39,120
Lower your voice.

701
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:41,040
They're listening.

702
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:43,480
No more crap.

703
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:43,870
Go.

704
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:45,210
Get Jiang Xinbai here.

705
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:47,140
He's not around.

706
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:51,110
You're newlyweds,

707
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:52,980
yet he lets you go home alone.

708
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:54,790
How could you marry such a man?

709
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,390
He's not out fooling around.

710
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:58,240
He's doing something serious.

711
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,230
What is it?

712
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:00,310
What is the serious matter

713
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:02,070
that's more important than you?

714
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:02,780
Anyway,

715
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:04,190
I don't care if you

716
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:06,100
have married Jiang Xinbai.

717
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:07,810
Even if you had children,

718
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:09,520
you still must divorce him!

719
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,850
Why do I have to divorce him?

720
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:14,390
Because of the divorce agreement

721
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:15,190
he gave you.

722
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:17,310
This is private.

723
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,390
Private?

724
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:19,270
With me,

725
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,430
nothing about you is private.

726
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:21,020
Give it to me.

727
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:22,270
I know everything about you.

728
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:23,130
Let me tell you.

729
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:24,670
You can marry any man

730
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:25,910
in the world.

731
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:26,870
But Jiang Xinbai

732
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:27,990
is out of the question.

733
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:29,190
Why?

734
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:30,590
Have you forgotten

735
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:32,190
how he came after us in Heman?

736
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:33,440
That was a misunderstanding.

737
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,030
Besides,

738
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:35,030
we did look like

739
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:36,240
two thieves.

740
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:37,480
What did you say?

741
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:39,280
We looked like thieves.

742
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:41,990
You're driven by vanity.

743
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:43,440
I'm driven

744
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:44,190
by love.

745
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:45,490
Give it to me.

746
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:47,750
Should we help Boss out?

747
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:50,830
Her mom looks fierce.

748
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:51,980
We can't help her.

749
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:53,950
Fingers crossed for Boss.

750
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:54,870
Just sign

751
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:55,870
the divorce agreement.

752
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:57,030
-Sign it.
-Give it to me.

753
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:57,710
I'm driven

754
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,350
by love.

755
00:39:59,370 --> 00:40:00,100
Give it to me.

756
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:00,960
Be good. Sign it.

757
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,030
Pack your things and leave with me.

758
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:02,880
Give it to me.

759
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:03,590
No.

760
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:04,760
-No.
-Give it to me.

761
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:07,310
The best beauty salon in the capital.

762
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:10,890
The best technique in Daqi to stop aging.

763
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,820
The best beauty salon in the capital?

764
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:14,530
What?

765
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:18,030
Blossom Beauty is still here.

766
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:20,230
How dare they call themselves the best?

767
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:20,830
Exactly.

768
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:21,800
Let's go.

769
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:22,360
Let's go.

770
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:31,850
Beauty of the City is about to open.

771
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:35,130
Come and see if you need anything.

772
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:51,510
Great! Great!

773
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:53,620
Great! Amazing!

774
00:40:59,070 --> 00:40:59,950
Amazing!

775
00:41:01,350 --> 00:41:02,150
Look!

776
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:13,780
Great! Great!

777
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:22,510
Great!

778
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:31,750
Great!

779
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:46,590
Great!

780
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,150
