4
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:33,870
Where's Lady Gaya?

5
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:42,509
Let's split up.

6
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:43,950
Okay.

7
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,240
Did you find her?

8
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:08,900
No.

9
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,240
What should we do?

10
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:12,480
How about...

11
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:14,630
we go up ahead?

12
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:15,829
Okay.

13
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:18,150
I can't do it.

14
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:21,340
Wait...

15
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,579
That's Gaya's voice.

16
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:27,650
You can even hear that?

17
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,570
I think you should worry about

18
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:38,100
yourself and your husband.

19
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:40,420
If anything goes wrong,

20
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:42,450
you can only be a wedded couple

21
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:43,770
in the next life.

22
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:49,110
Gaya!

23
00:03:58,950 --> 00:03:59,510
Gaya.

24
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:00,900
Why are you here?

25
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,120
I wanted to take a walk around

26
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:05,030
but I got lost.

27
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,870
Many bridges in Heman City are similar.

28
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:09,270
If you don't go out often,

29
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:10,530
you'd get lost easily.

30
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:11,590
Madam.

31
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:13,630
Who was that?

32
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,750
I was going to ask her for the way.

33
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,870
She said the street was noisy,

34
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,360
so she took me to the alley.

35
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,990
I didn't get to ask anything

36
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:23,920
before you came.

37
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:26,610
Did she do anything to you?

38
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,460
What could she have done?

39
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,310
W-Well...

40
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,510
I've been out for a while.

41
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:33,670
I'm a little tired.

42
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:35,190
Why don't we go back first?

43
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:36,710
Sure.

44
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:37,520
Let's go.

45
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,810
Back then, when Gaya's tribe

46
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:54,700
was fighting against an enemy tribe,

47
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,840
she dressed like this

48
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,300
to cheer for the warriors.

49
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:58,250
I was attracted

50
00:04:59,070 --> 00:04:59,990
at a glance.

51
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:04,830
Well,

52
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:06,380
your taste

53
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,330
is indeed extraordinary.

54
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:11,080
Then...

55
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,010
what is it for today?

56
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,240
For you two.

57
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:17,040
-For us?
-For us?

58
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:23,800
Dr. Yan,

59
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,590
Mr. Xi.

60
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:25,670
We are unable to

61
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:27,200
repay you for your kindness

62
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,470
towards us.

63
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:30,240
The two of you look like

64
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:32,870
you've taken a liking to each other these days.

65
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,630
So,

66
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:35,710
I prayed to God

67
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,720
for your marriage.

68
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:39,270
No need!

69
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:40,750
No need.

70
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,560
Didn't we...

71
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:44,120
tell you last time?

72
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,740
There's nothing between us.

73
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,450
According to divination,

74
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:49,380
you two are destined to be married.

75
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:50,360
And it's

76
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:51,470
three marriages.

77
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,060
What does the three marriages mean?

78
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,930
It's not clear.

79
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:59,590
But your first marriage

80
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:01,270
is in the direction of "water."

81
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,730
Wouldn't that be in Heman?

82
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:04,350
Hubby.

83
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,880
Since it's God's will,

84
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,800
let's go with it

85
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:09,760
and hold their first wedding.

86
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:11,350
No!

87
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:15,990
I mean...

88
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,870
marriage is an important affair,

89
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,070
we shouldn't be so hasty about it.

90
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:20,590
Right?

91
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:22,310
She's right.

92
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:24,909
They have to set off to the capital too.

93
00:06:24,909 --> 00:06:25,870
Isn't it too late?

94
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:26,770
Yes.

95
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:27,710
No.

96
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:28,950
Let's go hold the water wedding

97
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:30,790
unique to Heman.

98
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:32,850
The last step of the wedding

99
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,550
is for the newlyweds to take a boat out of the city

100
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:36,010
to go around the river bay.

101
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:38,610
On the second day, after you consummate,

102
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:39,870
you return to the city.

103
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:40,530
But

104
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:41,770
we can modify it.

105
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,320
After the wedding,

106
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,690
the wedding boat can just leave the city

107
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:45,870
and there's no need for them to come back.

108
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:46,670
That's right.

109
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:50,110
That'd make it easy for them to leave the city and take a carriage afterwards

110
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,640
to go to the capital by land.

111
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,250
No need, no need!

112
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:54,710
We...

113
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:57,630
We are really not at that stage yet.

114
00:06:58,790 --> 00:06:59,350
Hubby.

115
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:00,580
It’s been a long time

116
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,070
since we've had a wedding in Heman.

117
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:02,930
Say something.

118
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:03,390
Okay.

119
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:06,000
I shall invite everyone in the town

120
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:08,320
and hold the wedding banquet.

121
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,270
Say something!

122
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:10,980
Just right.

123
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:15,950
Actually,

124
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,430
I have long

125
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,330
fallen for you.

126
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,270
Since it's God's will,

127
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:22,550
why don't we go with it?

128
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:41,830
I don't understand.

129
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,830
Why do you have to marry me?

130
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,760
I'm worried that it's not safe

131
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,620
if you go alone.

132
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,470
I can't rest assured.

133
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:57,740
How about

134
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:00,420
we go back to the capital together?

135
00:08:05,909 --> 00:08:06,790
Actually,

136
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:09,570
I'm afraid that things are not fully settled in Heman yet.

137
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:11,470
So I want to wait

138
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:12,100
for when things are settled–

139
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,190
Things are not fully settled?

140
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:14,470
What do you mean?

141
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:16,630
No.

142
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:17,920
I'm leaving.

143
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:18,760
Yan Nanxing!

144
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,500
Do you really think

145
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,360
you’ll be safe if you leave Heman?

146
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:28,480
What do you mean?

147
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,670
In the eyes of outsiders,

148
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:34,180
I'm on General Nan's side.

149
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:35,630
We are a couple.

150
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:38,150
If those people who haven't been dealt with

151
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,480
want to kill General Nan

152
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:40,110
and me,

153
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,310
they won't let you go.

154
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,390
After you leave Heman,

155
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,720
they will come after you

156
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:48,350
to murder you.

157
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:53,470
You...

158
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:56,190
Don't scare me.

159
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:57,940
Listen.

160
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:59,560
I don't believe.

161
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:03,150
Even if you're doing this to protect me,

162
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,230
why...

163
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:07,190
why must we get married?

164
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:13,150
Here.

165
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:14,909
Take a seat.

166
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:18,470
Listen to me.

167
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:24,870
I

168
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:28,530
have another plan.

169
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:33,600
This plan

170
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,670
can not only help General Nan

171
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:37,930
to catch all those we haven't dealt with,

172
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:39,000
but also protect

173
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:40,030
Lady Gaya and you

174
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:41,450
to leave Heman safely.

175
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:44,190
What kind of great plan

176
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:46,360
requires us to get married?

177
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:49,210
It concerns the safety of others.

178
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:51,550
I can't tell you the details for now.

179
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:57,350
If you really want to know the truth,

180
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:58,710
stay with me

181
00:09:58,820 --> 00:09:59,620
until the end.

182
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:03,870
Have you already discussed it

183
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:04,870
with General Nan?

184
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:06,670
Of course.

185
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:09,550
But this plan,

186
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:11,740
without your cooperation,

187
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,000
it can't be completed.

188
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:17,310
I can't cooperate.

189
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:19,670
Why?

190
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,630
You have a sense of justice, don't you?

191
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:22,790
Even so,

192
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:24,870
I should prioritize my own life.

193
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:26,640
Think about it yourself.

194
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,540
All the things you've done

195
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,150
in Heman

196
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:30,360
are all bloody.

197
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:32,650
Your plan will definitely be

198
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:33,950
very dangerous.

199
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,070
I'm not going.

200
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,150
I'll speak the truth.

201
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,090
I've been have been through a lot of

202
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:44,780
tragedies and disasters since childhood.

203
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,540
It's not easy for me to live till this day.

204
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,340
I'm no Buddha.

205
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:49,790
Please.

206
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:51,350
Please. Please.

207
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:52,100
I'm leaving.

208
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:53,440
Yan Nanxing!

209
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:54,950
Yan Nanxing!

210
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:00,870
So,

211
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,190
no matter what,

212
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:03,590
you won't help me, right?

213
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:06,190
I really can't.

214
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:27,330
Wh-What are you doing?

215
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:30,070
Why are you looking at me like that?

216
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:37,190
In Lanna Village,

217
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:40,450
when you burned the Zornia field,

218
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,920
though I said

219
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,030
you were being reckless,

220
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,630
I was actually really happy.

221
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,270
I thought

222
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,270
you were like another me.

223
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,590
One that is more passionate

224
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:52,710
and more brave.

225
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,630
You can help me see

226
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,150
many things I can't see.

227
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:58,150
And help me

228
00:11:58,850 --> 00:11:59,830
make decisions

229
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:00,990
I dare not make.

230
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:08,110
I've been cautious since I was young.

231
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:09,970
I seldom make promises to others.

232
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:12,200
But that day,

233
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,950
after you burned the Zornia field,

234
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,280
I told the villagers of Lanna Village that...

235
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,520
no one will plant Zornias

236
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:23,390
in your village anymore.

237
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:25,380
Do you know why?

238
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:32,320
Because I trust you.

239
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,840
I believe

240
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:36,200
no matter what happens,

241
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:38,510
you will always be on my side.

242
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,570
You started trusting me

243
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:43,840
since back then?

244
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:57,430
Everything I'm doing now

245
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,910
is to fulfill the promise

246
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,240
I made to Lanna Village.

247
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,100
Of course,

248
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:03,590
I told you

249
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,460
I will protect you too.

250
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:09,340
I brought you back to Heman.

251
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,120
I must bring you out

252
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:11,950
safely.

253
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:15,730
After everything is over,

254
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,830
I will tell you my real identity.

255
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:25,150
Actually,

256
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:28,470
I don't have many friends.

257
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:30,910
But in my heart,

258
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:35,150
I already take you

259
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:36,440
as my friend.

260
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:43,910
Really?

261
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:46,950
You treat me as a friend?

262
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:50,150
Really.

263
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:54,790
Although

264
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,950
we have different personalities,

265
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,520
deep down,

266
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:02,110
we are the same kind of people.

267
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:03,960
I remember

268
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:04,910
you told me

269
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:07,320
there are things you're more afraid of

270
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,390
than death.

271
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:12,650
There are things you want to do more than living.

272
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:15,750
Me too.

273
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:19,090
You want to save everyone in front of you,

274
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,280
and I want to save more people too.

275
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:23,510
Our goal

276
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:25,550
has always been the same.

277
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,150
So, Yan Nanxing,

278
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,750
my promise to Lanna Village

279
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:37,530
can't be fulfilled

280
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:39,920
without you.

281
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:01,950
You taught me this.

282
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:05,790
Trust me.

283
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:08,320
I will protect you.

284
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:13,790
Young man.

285
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,110
Thanks.

286
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:23,670
Fine, let's get married.

287
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:26,010
I'm not to be trifled with.

288
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:27,250
I would like to see

289
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:28,270
which stubborn bastard

290
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:29,390
refuse to

291
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:30,990
turn over a new leaf.

292
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,100
I trust you too.

293
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,150
It's him again.

294
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:18,320
Get him!

295
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:36,510
Young Sir!

296
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:56,220
Does it hurt?

297
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,040
Those people won't give us food,

298
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:05,110
but they dressed you

299
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:06,190
like a real bride.

300
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:07,710
I don't want to be

301
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:08,870
a bride.

302
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:11,190
I miss my mother.

303
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,870
I want to go home.

304
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:14,030
Trust me.

305
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:15,730
You can go home soon.

306
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:18,430
Then you can grow up happily

307
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,230
and get married then.

308
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:23,200
I don't want to get married.

309
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:25,110
Unless...

310
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:26,480
Unless what?

311
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:28,190
No.

312
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:30,200
You'll laugh at me if I tell you.

313
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:31,870
I won't.

314
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:33,350
I really want to know.

315
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:34,460
Tell me.

316
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:35,680
Unless what?

317
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:37,869
Unless...

318
00:17:38,829 --> 00:17:40,230
my groom knows magic

319
00:17:40,869 --> 00:17:42,069
and can bloom flowers

320
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,619
in winter,

321
00:17:44,069 --> 00:17:45,670
then I'll get married to him.

322
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,690
So you want to

323
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:47,910
marry a floral deity.

324
00:17:48,349 --> 00:17:49,310
I can’t do that.

325
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:49,950
You...

326
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:53,430
You're not my groom.

327
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:57,069
Although I'm not your groom,

328
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:59,210
I can't make all flowers bloom

329
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:00,109
for you...

330
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:01,350
Follow me.

331
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,930
What kind of flower is this?

332
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:30,550
I heard that

333
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,310
they came from the Netherworld.

334
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:34,600
So they are called the Netherworld Flower.

335
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,480
They like to grow

336
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:38,690
in dark, cold and humid environment.

337
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:40,710
It's hard to find them in day time.

338
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:41,950
They only appear

339
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:42,790
at night.

340
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:50,850
Are you cold?

341
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:52,320
Have my clothes.

342
00:18:58,590 --> 00:18:59,520
Young man,

343
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:01,930
will I see you again?

344
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:03,760
When you grow up,

345
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:05,310
and want to look for me,

346
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,390
just say, "Are you cold?

347
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:07,390
Have my clothes."

348
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,290
and I will know it's you.

349
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:22,380
Nanxing.

350
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:25,040
Why haven't you dressed up?

351
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:28,630
Leave it here.

352
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,920
In two hours,

353
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:33,950
you will be the star

354
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:35,270
of the whole Heman.

355
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:37,340
This is the best moment

356
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:38,750
in a woman's life.

357
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,200
What's wrong?

358
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,750
You're going to be a bride.

359
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:45,680
Are you unhappy?

360
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:48,950
No.

361
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:50,840
I just feel like now that I'm going to

362
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,300
marry into a noble family,

363
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:54,110
I'm going to become a sparrow

364
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:55,080
with no freedom.

365
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:58,970
So that's what you're worried about.

366
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:01,710
Actually,

367
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:04,070
there are cages everywhere in life.

368
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,200
There's no freedom.

369
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:06,430
But

370
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:08,650
if you have a lover in your heart,

371
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:09,970
and you cage yourself,

372
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:12,400
you're doing it willingly.

373
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:16,910
You're so mature.

374
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:18,690
Hearing you say that,

375
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,660
I don't find marriage a beautiful thing.

376
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:24,030
All right.

377
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:25,370
It's a happy day.

378
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:26,350
Let's not talk about this.

379
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:26,880
Let's go.

380
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,360
Let me show you a gift.

381
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:29,550
A gift?

382
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:37,990
This is...

383
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:40,750
A luminous jade cup?

384
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:41,310
Yes.

385
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,390
It's a luminous jade cross-cup.

386
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:44,910
I asked someone to look for this

387
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,370
as a gift for your wedding.

388
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:48,110
When you consummate,

389
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:49,060
use this to drink

390
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:50,480
the cross-cupped wine.

391
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,160
The wedding is not real.

392
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:53,550
How can I accept

393
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:54,750
such a precious gift?

394
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,860
This is too precious.

395
00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:59,430
I can't accept it.

396
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:01,150
No.

397
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,960
This is my sincerity.

398
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,230
Take it.

399
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:06,590
I really don't know

400
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:07,790
what else

401
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:08,910
I can give you.

402
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:10,890
You don't owe me anything.

403
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:14,670
I mean,

404
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,080
I wanted to invite your mother over,

405
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,880
but we don't have enough time.

406
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,550
I feel sorry for making you get married

407
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:23,290
without your family members.

408
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:25,030
It's okay.

409
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:26,810
I think these decorations

410
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:28,400
are done up really well.

411
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:31,870
Nanxing.

412
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:37,040
Nanxing,

413
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:38,950
if General and I

414
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:40,410
have a child in the future,

415
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:41,750
can we use your name?

416
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,950
No matter if they're a boy or a girl,

417
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:45,350
I will name them Nanxing.

418
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:48,430
Well...

419
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:50,620
Is it okay?

420
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,270
Sure.

421
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:56,230
Since you like me so much,

422
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:57,480
why not?

423
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,460
It's just a name.

424
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:00,530
Just use it.

425
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,320
That's great.

426
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:03,590
From now on,

427
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:05,130
I'll take the liberty

428
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:06,350
to be your family.

429
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:18,990
My lord,

430
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,470
they've loaded the goods.

431
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:22,130
It's among the wedding boats.

432
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:24,960
The city is under siege.

433
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,150
Only the wedding ship can get in and out.

434
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:28,790
What a plan.

435
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:30,190
I think we can

436
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:31,120
take action now.

437
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:32,880
You don't have to take the risk.

438
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,500
I want to catch them red-handed.

439
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:36,590
Yes.

440
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:41,770
Anything else?

441
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:43,170
Didn't you ask me to check on Ms. Yan

442
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:44,770
at the General's Residence?

443
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:46,510
What's wrong?

444
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:47,550
Ms. Yan is fine.

445
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,750
It's just that I saw

446
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:50,950
she and Lady Gaya

447
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:53,110
seem very close.

448
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:56,310
Yes.

449
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:58,100
Ms. Yan is usually sharp-tongued,

450
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,110
but she is kind

451
00:22:59,130 --> 00:22:59,860
and sincere.

452
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,270
I'm afraid

453
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:03,200
she would be hurt when she finds out

454
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:04,190
the truth.

455
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:53,340
♫I'll fetch you the moon in my heart♫

456
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:55,620
♫I dream of the courtyard♫

457
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:58,810
♫It knows my heart♫

458

♫I want to return triumphantly with you♫

459
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:03,840
♫We can listen to the rain♫

460
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,980
♫And watch the snowfall in the west hills♫

461
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:11,120
♫On the streets, the alleys, and the palace♫

00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:13,250
♫We shall always meet♫

463

♫I only hope you fall into my heart♫

464
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,580
♫The fire warms winter days♫

♫You're what I always think about♫

470
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:36,870
♫I'm willing to go to the sky for you♫

471
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:39,700
♫To pluck the moon above the clouds♫

472

♫I'll grow old for you♫

476
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:54,810
♫I want this flower to bloom and never wilt♫

477
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,390

478
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:01,430

479
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,750
♫And never break your promise♫

480
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:22,630
Ceremony music, get ready!

481
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,350
Welcome the bride!

482
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:47,330
Enter the ceremony, hand in hand.

483
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:55,570
You regret it?

484
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:56,830
Is it too late?

485
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:01,190
You're already wearing the wedding dress.

486
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:02,590
I'm afraid it's too late.

487
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:09,830
What a perfect match.

488
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:10,510
Yes.

489
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:12,650
They look great together.

490
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:13,520
Gaya.

491
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:14,830
We did a

492
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:15,610
great thing.

493
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:21,430
Embrace each other.

494
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:27,540
Why do we have to do that?

495
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:30,970
This is a wedding ritual.

496
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:37,850
-Good!
-Great!

497
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:39,690
You don't have to adhere to it.

498
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:41,540
Good!

499
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:47,590
The wedding ceremony begins.

500
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:48,750
Cross the saddle;

501
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:50,630
that symbolizes safety.

502
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:52,310
Rise.

503
00:26:57,910 --> 00:26:59,200
Sprinkle the five grains.

504
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,000
First, sprinkle the red beans to signify your everlasting longing.

505
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:10,110
Second, sprinkle the lotus for abundance of children.

506
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:16,660
Third, sprinkle the chestnuts for a prosperous family and offspring.

507
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:21,140
Fourth, sprinkle longan for a harmonious family.

508
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:29,210
Respect and love each other, for the good of your descendants.

509
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:33,150
Walk through the painting of a hundred children playing.

510
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:46,050
Are you really regretting it?

511
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,690
I just think

512
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:49,800
so many people are blessing us,

513
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:51,570
yet we are deceiving them.

514
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,800
I feel bad.

515
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,340
We are just putting up a show.

516
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,130
Don't be so serious.

517
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:04,780
Walk through the painting of a hundred children playing.

518
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,660
This is the most important part of

519
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:21,050
[Peace for the People]

520
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,000
the traditional wedding customs of Heman.

521
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,530
It's called the Ceremony of Joining Clothes.

522
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:24,500
The couple

523
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,210
walk towards each other in this ceremony,

524
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:29,230
symbolizing their love

525
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:31,650
and dedication towards each other,

526
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:34,310
keeping no secrets from each other.

527
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:34,910
Come on.

528
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:44,950
The Ceremony of Joining Clothes.

529
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:56,890
Why aren't you moving?

530
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:59,030
Stop fooling around.

531
00:28:59,030 --> 00:28:59,630
Come here.

532
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,870
I'm not.

533
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:03,390
In their custom,

534
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,950
the groom should be the one coming over.

535
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,590
There's no need to care about the details.

536
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:09,200
Come over.

537
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,430
What a coincidence.

538
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:11,370
I like it when the other party

539
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:12,650
takes the initiative.

540
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:15,120
What a coincidence.

541
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:16,590
I like that too.

542
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,750
Hey!

543
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:21,710
Why are you cheating?

544
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:24,590
I told you to come here.

545
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:31,530
The ceremony is complete!

546
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:48,170
♫Branches bare as flowers fall off♫

547
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:53,850
♫Like how I don't appear in your heart and dreams♫

548
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,830
♫When I pluck up the courage♫

549
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:01,350
♫To get a little closer♫

550
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:05,790
♫I'll hold your sleeves tightly and never push away♫

551
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,150
Yan Nanxing.

552
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:08,080
What does the wedding of your dreams

553
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,860
♫In my dream, the person in front of me looks the same♫

554
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:08,990
look like?

555
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:16,850
♫The wind blows through the building, leaving nothing♫

556
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:15,760
Unless my groom knows magic

557
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:17,550
and is able to make all flowers bloom

558
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,980
♫But I♫

559
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:19,270
in winter,

560
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:22,210
♫Left no trace♫

561
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:21,790
I'm not getting married.

562
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:23,340
So you want to marry

563
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:25,170
♫When can I stop?♫

564
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:24,310
A flower deity?

565
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:31,350
♫Stop thinking about you♫

566
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:29,350
They all say

567
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:31,730
you're very beautiful today.

568
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:34,960
♫I miss you so much♫

569
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:35,960
How beautiful are you?

570
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:37,190
♫Sadness fills my heart♫

571
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,520
♫No matter when it ends♫

572
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:43,190
♫I have no more tears that flow by themselves♫

573
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:47,080
♫I miss you, be it right or wrong♫

574
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,460
♫The past will last forever♫

575
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:54,640
♫I just want to give you as much time♫

576
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,980
♫As I can♫

577
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:01,330
♫Be it in the past or now♫

578
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:36,650
Be careful.

579
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:47,870
Are you okay?

580
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:49,630
I'm fine.

581
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:52,310
Interesting.

582
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,270
You're laughing?

583
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:56,000
They didn't follow the custom.

584
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:57,990
Only by not following the custom can we make new ones.

585
00:31:57,990 --> 00:31:58,800
Let's change

586
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:00,990
the wedding customs tomorrow.

587
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,540
We shall start burning red cloth

588
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:05,910
during the Ceremony of Joining Clothes from now on.

589
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:07,280
What does everyone think?

590
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,400
Good!

591
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:12,000
Singing and dancing for the guests!

592
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:15,510
Great!

593
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:17,840
Wishing you a lasting and happy marriage!

594
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:22,810
Have a harmonious family!

595
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:24,910
Have a baby soon!

596
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:27,830
Wishing you a lasting and happy marriage!

597
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:28,870
All the best!

598
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:30,410
Congratulations!

599
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,780
I know the groom can't drink much.

600
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:52,640
But tonight

601
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:54,230
is your wedding night.

602
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:55,680
You should drink

603
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:57,110
this cross-cupped wine.

604
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:01,150
Actually, we don't have to

605
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:02,750
follow all these etiquette.

606
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:10,190
Of course.

607
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,340
We must drink this.

608
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:18,250
My wife.

609
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:21,460
Please.

610
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,390
Yes.

611
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:43,990
All right.

612
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:46,350
Every moment of the night is precious.

613
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:47,510
I'll get going then.

614
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:08,310
I'm sure Gaya's pretending to be okay.

615
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,840
She must be very sad.

616
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:11,220
How about

617
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:12,540
I go to take a look at her?

618
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:13,110
Wait.

619
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:19,150
What's wrong?

620
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:20,830
I feel dizzy.

621
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:21,830
Dizzy?

622
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,570
Let me help you sit down.

623
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:41,250
He can really drink only a cup of wine.

624
00:34:41,469 --> 00:34:42,440
Look at him.

625
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:45,370
Get up.

626
00:34:45,429 --> 00:34:46,510
I can't move.

627
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:49,830
Lie down over there if you can't move.

628
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:50,630
My head hurts.

629
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:52,310
Get up!

630
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:53,830
Get up!

631
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:00,270
You...

632
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:02,350
You're not drunk?

633
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:05,710
Just stay here.

634
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:09,250
I...

635
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:10,280
Yan Nanxing.

636
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:13,650
After tonight,

637
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,950
I'll explain everything to you.

638
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:56,590
What's going on outside?

639
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:13,340
What...

640
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:16,520
What's wrong?

641
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:34,930
Be careful!

642
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:14,710
Speak.

643
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:16,390
Who sent you here?

644
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:19,230
Speak!

645
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:20,000
Mr. Xi.

646
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:32,240
Let that man and the boat go.

647
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:33,390
Or...

648
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:36,180
Or I’ll kill Yan Nanxing!

649
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,600
This has nothing to do with Yan Nanxing.

650
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:40,470
Let her go.

651
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:42,700
So...

652
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,590
So you knew

653
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:45,580
I set this up.

654
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:54,150
What?

655
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:58,460
What did you say?

656
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,010
You deceived me.

657
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:21,070
Hurry up!

658
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:22,610
Otherwise,

659
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,870
or I'll cut her throat!

660
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:38,230
Hurry up!
