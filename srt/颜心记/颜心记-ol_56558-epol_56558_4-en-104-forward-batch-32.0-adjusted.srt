4
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:24,670
My lord,

5
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,590
you worry me so much.

6
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:28,039
Why did you

7
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:29,270
drink with Nan Jifeng

8
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,330
when I wasn't here?

9
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,350
If anything happens to you,

10
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:33,550
I might lose my head

11
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:35,150
when I return to the capital.

12
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,180
I had no choice.

13
00:02:41,669 --> 00:02:42,669
If I didn't drink,

14
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:43,830
all our efforts

15
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,220
would have been in vain.

16
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:47,930
Even then, you still shouldn't drink.

17
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:48,990
Don't you know

18
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,460
about your situation?

19
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,190
Not only are you a lightweight,

20
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:54,860
but you also have face blindness.

21
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,400
If you expose yourself

22
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,670
and something happens to you,

23
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,600
how will I explain to the princess?

24
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,300
Yao Qianshu.

25
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:02,150
Yes.

26
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:04,550
Are you lecturing me?

27
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:06,630
I dare not.

28
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,390
I just feel bad for you.

29
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,990
You don't even socialize in the capital.

30
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:13,520
Why must you lower yourself

31
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,150
in a small place like this?

32
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:24,090
If you want to get things done,

33
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,230
you need to learn

34
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:27,329
to dance to the tune

35
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,070
of the people you meet.

36
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,570
It's not about lowering oneself.

37
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:35,430
While I was gone,

38
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,040
did Nan Jifeng send someone to keep an eye on you?

39
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:38,710
No.

40
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:40,270
Even if he did,

41
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,670
I could get rid of them.

42
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:47,920
What have you found?

43
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:55,230
There are three major clans in Heman City,

44
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:56,950
which are Tumen, Gongye and Moqi.

45
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,190
They're all rich clans

46
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:00,030
with century-old foundations in this area.

47
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,680
The Tumen clan has been county magistrates for five generations.

48
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,150
The Gongye clan occupies the county lieutenancy

49
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,590
and follows Tumen's orders.

50
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,050
The Moqi are quite mysterious.

51
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:07,870
They've been doing business in Heman for generations

52
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:08,950
and are outstanding,

53
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:10,460
but the head of this generation

54
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,670
has never appeared.

55
00:04:14,829 --> 00:04:16,510
Because Zornia has only entered the country

56
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,470
in recent years.

57
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:19,810
You can't be too brazen

58
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:21,700
when dabbling in such a business.

59
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:22,760
By the way, my lord,

60
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,150
I didn't find

61
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:25,470
the head of the Moqi clan,

62
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,030
but I've recorded

63
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:28,360
all of the Moqi clan's stores

64
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,150
in Heman.

65
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:30,290
Please take a look.

casino, tavern...

69
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:39,630
They do quite a lot.

70
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,630
I have a second piece of intel.

71
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:42,830
Do you want to hear it?

72
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,430
What?

73
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,320
My mother went into General Nan's study before.

74
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,250
She said there's something fishy in there.

75
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,779
There must be a secret room,

76
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:53,029
but she didn't know how to get in.

77
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,590
Why did your mother sneak into

78
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:56,010
the study of the General's Residence?

79
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:57,140
Ask what you should.

80
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:58,830
Don't ask what you shouldn't.

81
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,390
I didn't force you

82
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,920
to tell your secret either.

83
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:06,780
You're trying so hard to enter the General's Residence.

84
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,580
You must want to know something.

85
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:09,790
The thing you want

86
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:11,930
must be in the secret room.

87
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:14,590
There must be

88
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:17,030
what you're looking for too, right?

89
00:05:22,909 --> 00:05:24,260
Does Nan Jifeng interact with

90
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,470
the three major clans often?

91
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:26,510
Two years ago

92
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:27,990
when Nan Jifeng was transferred to Heman,

93
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:28,640
he interacted frequently

94
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,070
with the three major clans.

95
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:31,600
It's not as frequent now.

96
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:37,050
Nan Jifeng's position is stable now,

97
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,130
so he naturally

98
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:40,090
avoids suspicion on the surface.

99
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:41,860
My lord,

100
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,500
what should we do next?

101
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,030
Find the evidence

102
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:54,360
of Nan Jifeng and the three clans' crimes.

I'm not leaving.

105
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:04,440
You leave if you want.

106
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,840
Anyway, I'm not leaving.

107
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:10,870
The general asked Her Ladyship to go back to her maiden home

108
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,460
and irritated her again.

109
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,760
Mr. Xi.

110
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:22,620
Madam.

111
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:24,909
Mr. Xi,

112
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,770
are you here to see the general?

113
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,240
Iâ€™m afraid he...

114
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:32,790
It's fine.

115
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:35,430
Actually, I came here today

116
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:36,340
to

117
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:38,430
pay my respects to you.

118
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,240
To me?

119
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,860
I bet you must want to see Dr. Yan instead.

120
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:51,280
Your Ladyship, you must be joking.

121
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:56,150
You're just in time.

122
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:57,790
I've saved you a bowl of the herbal soup

123
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:59,120
I made for Her Ladyship.

124
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,120
Try it.

125
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,730
It's good for your health.

126
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:09,790
What?

127
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,650
Are you afraid I put strange things in this?

128
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,180
That's right.

129
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:21,380
Trust me.

130
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,240
Our cooperation

131
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,970
has been put on the agenda.

132
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:29,170
Are you sure?

133
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:31,870
To be precise,

134
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:32,940
this time,

135
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,600
you need to help me more.

136
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:35,690
However,

137
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:37,610
you don't need to pay

138
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:38,820
or use your looks.

139
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:40,330
When the deed is done,

140
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,590
name your price.

141
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:44,270
I don't have to pay

142
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,780
or use my looks,

143
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,810
and I can even name my price when it's done?

144
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,080
Why do I think

145
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:55,150
it sounds

146
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:57,290
even more dangerous?

147
00:07:59,150 --> 00:07:59,950
Listen to me.

148
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,110
Dr. Yan.

149
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,030
Madam.

150
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:15,070
Sorry to bother you again.

151
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,630
No, no, no. It's no bother.

152
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,880
I'm just here to deliver some fruits.

153
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,390
Madam.

154
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,750
I want to take Yan Nanxing

155
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:29,620
for a stroll.

156
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,750
Is that okay?

157
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:35,310
Yes,

158
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:37,000
but Dr. Yan,

159
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,150
you won't run away again, right?

160
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:41,350
Madam, you must be joking.

161
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:43,010
I will definitely return her.

162
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:45,390
Let's go.

163
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,040
Thank you, Madam.

164
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,830
This is not bad.

165
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,809
I didn't take a closer look last time.

166
00:09:07,789 --> 00:09:09,030
It's quite elegant.

167
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:11,590
Last time?

168
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,179
When were you here before?

169
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:21,790
I mean

170
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,720
when I passed by last time.

171
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:28,010
When I pass by the river,

172
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,120
I often see

173
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:32,080
many similar pleasure boats here,

174
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:34,240
but I never looked carefully.

175
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:45,090
Isn't it dizzying to sleep

176
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:46,070
on a boat?

177
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:48,000
Why don't you stay in an inn?

178
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,160
Heman is a waterfront city.

179
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:53,070
It's rare for me to come here.

180
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:53,730
Naturally,

181
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:56,360
I must live in a representative place.

182
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:57,990
Have some tea.

183
00:09:58,830 --> 00:09:59,590
Got it.

184
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:02,390
Pleasure boats are places to spend money

185
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,390
and get pleasure.

186
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:06,280
Here, you can drink some tea,

187
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:07,240
listen to music,

188
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,580
then drink some wine

189
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,660
and have some beauties in your lap.

190
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:13,190
You'll be as happy as a god.

191
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:18,840
How come

192
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:20,360
you sound like

193
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,900
a jealous wife?

194
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:24,150
Wife?

195
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:25,990
Are you willing to let your wife

196
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:27,120
work for you outside

197
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,030
and tell her

198
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,190
to name her price

199
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:30,770
after the deed's done?

200
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:36,310
Alright,

201
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:38,170
I'll stop joking with you.

202
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:40,270
I was afraid of eavesdroppers

203
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,450
at the General's Residence,

204
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:42,810
so I invited you here.

205
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:44,630
It's totally necessary.

206
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:45,470
You

207
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:46,530
lack awareness

208
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:48,120
and can't read the room.

209
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:51,770
It's because I don't care.

210
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:53,750
Tell me.

211
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:55,370
What's the matter?

212
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,190
Tonight,

213
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:58,590
I want to ask you

214
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:01,270
to keep General Nan away from the study.

215
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:02,400
Two hours is enough.

216
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,920
Distract General Nan.

217
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,630
After I find the secret room,

218
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,270
I'll exit and help guard for you.

219
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,060
Then you can go in

220
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,320
and find what you want.

221
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:12,240
Working together

222
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,310
and protecting each other.

223
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:15,380
It sounds

224
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,950
like a pretty good plan,

225
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,830
but why do I feel like...

226
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,290
I'm at a disadvantage?

227
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:26,200
For example?

228
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:27,330
For example...

229
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:30,350
Look.

230
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,470
Working alone,

231
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:36,110
if I fail and get caught,

232
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:38,000
I can make amends

233
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:38,910
due to my medical merits

234
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:39,860
and save myself.

235
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:42,170
But if you're added, with your mysterious background

236
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:43,890
and ulterior motives,

237
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:46,090
General Nan might get unhappy

238
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:46,790
and kill us.

239
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:49,510
It's not worth it for me.

240
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:52,480
Tell me.

241
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:54,270
How much money do you need

242
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,670
for you to take this risk?

243
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,780
Money is not a problem for you.

244
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:03,170
I don't want something that you don't value.

245
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:05,870
Then what do you want?

246
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:11,600
I want to know

247
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,150
if you have

248
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,270
relatives or friends

249
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,640
who were hurt by Zornia before.

250
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:28,550
Heman is where Zornia enters the country

251
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:31,310
and you came here to investigate it.

252
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:33,990
Are you suspecting

253
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:35,470
General Nan

254
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:37,460
has something to do with the bad guys

255
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:38,790
who killed your family?

256
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,030
Or

257
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:41,530
do you want to find them

258
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:42,730
through General Nan?

259
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:44,750
Or maybe...

260
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,290
Your enemy

261
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:51,670
includes General Nan?

262
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:57,830
Am I right?

263
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:08,850
Yan Nanxing,

264
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,590
itâ€™s a waste for you

265
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:12,990
to be a traveling doctor.

266
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:14,670
You should be a storyteller.

267
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:18,320
You're trying to gloss over things again.

268
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:21,380
Mr. Xi!

269
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:30,630
Mr. Xi,

270
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,380
we meet again.

271
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:35,670
Our girls earn

272
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:38,180
30 taels of silver a month here.

273
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:40,090
I only gave you a discount

274
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,600
because you pay monthly.

275
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,230
Madam,

276
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:49,530
are you here

277
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,730
to collect rent?

278
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:52,430
No.

279
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,720
It's just that

280
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,710
you rent my pleasure boat

281
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:59,290
and pay despite not wanting the girls.

282
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,420
I feel

283
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:04,350
so uncomfortable inside.

284
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:05,270
It seems

285
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:06,070
you

286
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:07,750
don't like our girls.

287
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,030
You must think they are not pretty enough.

288
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:12,150
We got two new girls today.

289
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:13,360
They're beautiful.

290
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,470
Greet Mr. Xi.

291
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:15,910
Hello, Mr. Xi.

292
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:18,790
No need.

293
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:21,350
Mr. Xi, don't hold back.

294
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:22,550
Let them

295
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,900
accompany you tonight.

296
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:26,480
It's really unnecessary.

297
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,150
Today,

298
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:28,920
I have something else to do.

299
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:33,710
You must know that a moment of love

300
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,470
is worth thousands.

301
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:36,070
Go!

302
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:38,310
Mr. Xi,

303
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,210
I missed you so much.

304
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:44,530
What are you doing?

305
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:46,270
Let go.

306
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:48,870
Let go! And that one too, let go!

307
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,730
Do you own this pleasure boat?

308
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,710
You think you can come in as you want?

309
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:56,430
Mr. Xi,

310
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,650
is she your maid?

311
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,910
You're dressed prettily.

312
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:03,670
Do you have bad eyesight?

313
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:05,170
Do I look like a maid to you?

314
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:05,950
No.

315
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:07,710
You look like a maid's mother.

316
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:09,640
You have bad eyesight.

317
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:12,750
I know you.

318
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:13,870
I know you.

319
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,030
You are that

320
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:17,710
volunteer female doctor?

321
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:19,000
Right.

322
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:21,230
I'm not only a female doctor,

323
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:23,480
but also

324
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:25,710
Mr. Xi's wife.

325
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:28,480
My husband

326
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,040
came to Heman for business.

327
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:30,990
I worried

328
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:32,750
some weird girls would pester him,

329
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,010
so I followed him here.

330
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:36,190
From what was said just now,

331
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,170
you've been a good boy.

332
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:38,960
Good job.

333
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:40,460
I'm relieved.

334
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,550
No wonder

335
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:44,430
Mr. Xi is so obedient.

336
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:46,430
He's married to a tigress.

337
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:50,830
You're so smart.

338
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,840
I really am a tigress.

339
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:54,310
Tigress!

340
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:55,070
I'll prick you to death.

341
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:56,250
I'll prick you to death!

342
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:56,910
Don't come over!

343
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:57,670
Yes, I'm so uncouth.

344
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:58,110
Go away!

345
00:15:58,110 --> 00:15:59,970
-Run! Are you scared?
-A tigress!

346
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:01,750
Don't prick me! Go away!

347
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:03,310
Tigress!

348
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:05,990
Gosh.

349
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:08,910
She has bad eyesight.

350
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:10,550
I don't look good?

351
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,020
What are you doing?

352
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:15,480
Can't you tell?

353
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:17,750
I'm helping you.

354
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:20,270
If I didn't help,

355
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:21,430
they would've

356
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:23,550
eaten you alive.

357
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:27,080
Look at the way they looked at you.

358
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,810
It was like wolves seeing meat.

359
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:31,600
That hand kept stroking

360
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:32,790
your body.

361
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:35,020
Be careful.

362
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,870
Don't get seduced.

363
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:38,790
Are you jealous?

364
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:43,580
I mean...

365
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:44,750
So,

366
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:46,950
you called yourself my wife

367
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:49,310
and even disregarded your reputation?

368
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:50,790
You really don't know me.

369
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:53,230
In this martial world,

370
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:54,910
I remain untainted

371
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,830
by the environment.

372
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,470
We just met by chance

373
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,710
and take what we need.

374
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:02,240
When we get out of Heman,

375
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:03,990
we will never meet again.

376
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:05,630
Why would I be jealous?

377
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:10,330
So,

378
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,390
you agree?

379
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:15,030
Yes,

380
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:16,840
but let's make it clear.

381
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:18,590
I want to enter the secret room

382
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:19,830
of the General's Residence too.

383
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,430
We'll take what we each need.

384
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:23,550
Okay.

385
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,310
Deal.

386
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:30,040
[General's Residence]

387
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:40,200
Dr. Yan.

388
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,109
Is this the general's hangover soup

389
00:17:42,109 --> 00:17:43,170
from Her Ladyship?

390
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:44,109
Yes.

391
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:45,680
You're alone today?

392
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:46,520
Where's Yue?

393
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:49,599
She should still be in the kitchen.

394
00:17:51,349 --> 00:17:51,829
Okay.

395
00:17:51,849 --> 00:17:53,010
Not bad. It's quite hot.

396
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:54,740
Quickly send it to the general.

397
00:17:55,589 --> 00:17:56,339
Go ahead.

398
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,270
What did you

399
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,690
sprinkle into that bowl?

400
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:06,310
You won't know even if I tell you.

401
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:08,400
It's medicine that you don't need.

402
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:11,520
Fine, I'll tell you.

403
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:12,890
When the general comes out later,

404
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:13,750
you have to hurry in.

405
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:14,750
You must be quick.

406
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:17,270
My medicine works well,

407
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:18,750
but they

408
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:20,750
are not young anymore.

409
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:22,670
It'll be

410
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:24,350
two hours at most.

411
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:26,990
You know.

412
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:28,830
Two hours.

413
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:31,270
Good job, Dr. Yan.

414
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:40,030
Madam,

415
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:41,300
the peonies

416
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,880
in the garden are blooming these days.

417
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:44,630
Yes.

418
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:46,430
Look.

419
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,150
You're almost healed

420
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,050
and it's a lovely night.

421
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:52,430
How about

422
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:54,770
you invite the general over tonight?

423
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:59,480
I haven't fully recovered.

424
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:01,230
So what?

425
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,310
The general loves you deeply.

426
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:05,550
He won't mind.

427
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:07,070
Plus, you said

428
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:09,510
he has been wronged these days.

429
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:13,710
Gaya.

430
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,230
General?

431
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:18,260
Gaya.

432
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:22,150
Gaya.

433
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:24,830
Gaya.

434
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,490
Gaya.

435
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,310
[Zhang Hui]

436
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:28,770
[Yuwen Wu]

437
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:37,410
The doors and windows are closed,

438
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:39,120
but there's a draft.

439
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:36,640
What are you doing?

440
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,870
Killing me after using me?

441
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:38,530
Put it down.

442
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:39,510
It's you?

443
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:42,450
You're pretending you don't know me?

444
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:44,500
Let's go.

445
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:45,880
Let's go back first.

446
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,070
Why?

447
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:48,670
Now it's your turn to guard.

448
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:49,930
I haven't entered yet.

449
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:51,880
Stop messing around.

450
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,910
I'm not.

451
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:54,550
I have to go inside.

452
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:55,550
Come back with me.

453
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:57,070
I haven't...

454
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,220
What are you doing?

455
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,110
Why can't I go in?

456
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:02,520
What are you doing?

457
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,920
Are you burning bridges?

458
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:08,390
Someone passed by the door of the study.

459
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:11,990
I think you're just wary of me.

460
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:14,090
What's in the secret room?

461
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:15,950
I think

462
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,440
Lady Gaya

463
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:18,730
has almost recovered.

464
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:19,500
How about

465
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,940
you leave tonight?

466
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:23,650
What's wrong with you?

467
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:25,430
Why should I leave tonight?

468
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:27,560
I haven't entered the secret room yet.

469
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:29,850
What exactly are you looking for?

470
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:32,230
You tell me first.

471
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:33,550
What's in the secret room?

472
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:34,070
Money.

473
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:35,230
What else?

474
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:36,790
Money,

475
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:37,830
money,

476
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,180
and more money.

477
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,140
Nothing else?

478
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,550
If you're not looking for money,

479
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:45,280
there's nothing in the room that you want.

480
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:46,610
No.

481
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:48,250
I have to check it out myself.

482
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:49,810
You don't trust me?

483
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:54,720
It's not that I don't trust you.

484
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:56,070
I have to see it myself

485
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,070
before I give up.

486
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,550
I'm not joking.

487
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:02,850
The secret room

488
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:04,980
doesn't have what you're looking for.

489
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:09,070
Things are about to change in Heman.

490
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:11,330
You shouldn't get involved in this mess.

491
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:14,070
It's a matter of life and death.

492
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:14,790
Tonight,

493
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,380
you must leave.

494
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:23,030
Yan Nanxing.

495
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:31,110
I don't want to get you involved.

496
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:38,780
You...

497
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:42,910
Are you

498
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:45,160
showing concern for me?

499
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:49,190
What do I have to say

500
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:50,170
for you to leave?

501
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:52,150
No, you don't understand.

502
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:54,070
I can't leave tonight.

503
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:55,310
Stubborn!

504
00:23:58,350 --> 00:23:59,370
You have to at least

505
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:00,570
promise me one thing.

506
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:02,590
Do not

507
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:04,830
leave your room tonight.

508
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:13,420
What?

509
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:15,750
Is he crazy?

510
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:22,520
Lieutenant General Li,

511
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:24,280
what are you doing?

512
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,070
General Nan,

513
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,990
even if the deal fails, the righteousness remains.

514
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:30,450
Why the murderous intent?

515
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:34,990
I don't understand what you're talking about.

516
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:36,440
What's going on?

517
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:39,290
Is there a misunderstanding?

518
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:41,510
How about we untie Lieutenant General Li first?

519
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:42,110
Untie him.

520
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:48,230
Tell me.

521
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:49,530
What happened?

522
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,470
General,

523
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:51,990
I saw this man

524
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:53,490
sneak into your study

525
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,240
and this woman helped him.

526
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:56,870
I was worried

527
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:57,990
he would harm you.

528
00:27:58,430 --> 00:27:59,910
That's why I acted on my own impulse

529
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:00,840
to get rid of him.

530
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:02,760
Your own impulse?

531
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:05,750
I'm curious

532
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:07,710
what horrible things

533
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:08,910
your general has done

534
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:10,150
that you need to hide for him

535
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:11,150
by killing me.

536
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,580
Follow me to the study.

537
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:29,630
I'm afraid there's a trap.

538
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:33,230
I've already searched the study.

539
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:34,290
There are no traps.

540
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:36,310
Nan Jifeng can't kill me anyway.

541
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:37,870
I'd like to see

542
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,520
how he wants to dispute this.

543
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:48,880
Watch over Yan Nanxing.

544
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:50,510
Donâ€™t let anything go wrong.

545
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:58,030
Stay with my people.

546
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:00,020
Don't trust anyone else.

547
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:07,190
Then you...

548
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:13,800
Don't worry.

549
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:15,670
Wait for me here.

550
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:19,270
It's fine.

551
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,480
Jifeng, be careful.

552
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:47,270
Jifeng!

553
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,070
Jifeng!

554
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:51,350
Jifeng!

555
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:53,030
Jifeng, are you alright?

556
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:54,600
Don't panic.

557
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:00,430
The knife is poisoned.

558
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:01,360
Take him inside.

559
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:01,800
Hurry!

560
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:03,070
Hurry!

561
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,270
Help the general in.

562
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:04,750
Hurry.

563
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:27,310
Madam.

564
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:28,790
Where is the magical medicine of your tribe?

565
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:30,050
Quickly take them out.

566
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:30,870
I can't.

567
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,190
The magical medicine is gendered.

568
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:33,030
Mine is feminine medicine.

569
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:34,490
The general can't take it.

570
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:49,210
What are you doing?

571
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:52,560
Yan Nanxing!

572
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:53,710
Countering poison with poison

573
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:54,670
can lure out some of the poison

574
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:55,530
in the general.

575
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:57,710
Your blood is poisonous?

576
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:00,950
I almost died when I was young.

577
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:02,550
I ate all kinds of weird herbs

578
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:04,720
and quite a lot of toxins built up in me.

579
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:07,160
So you're the Poison Girl?

580
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:11,270
Madam.

581
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:14,080
Do you have Zornia?

582
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:14,670
Zornia?

583
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:15,550
What?

584
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:18,390
Zornia?

585
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,660
Although it's poisonous when it's processed,

586
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:22,190
it's not an ordinary thing.

587
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:23,790
All poison is also medicine.

588
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:25,120
A small amount of Zornia

589
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,830
can also help detoxify his body.

590
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:27,690
I won't take it!

591
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:31,870
Even if I die by poisoning,

592
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:34,550
I will never touch that thing again.

593
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:35,480
Jifeng!

594
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:36,470
Jifeng!

595
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:37,350
Jifeng.

596
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:41,510
Madam, here.

597
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:43,250
Have the general drink this.

598
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:44,630
Jifeng,

599
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,070
come. Slowly.

600
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:49,190
Slowly.

601
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:52,680
Yan Nanxing,

602
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:54,660
must it be Zornia?

603
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,560
Is there no replacement?

604
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:00,440
There is.

605
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:02,150
There is another way.

606
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:05,630
We can use human blood as the guiding drug.

607
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:06,630
Then use my blood.

608
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:08,190
No, Madam.

609
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:09,700
Women's blood has yin energy.

610
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,360
It doesn't match men's blood.

611
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:12,930
Then what can we do?

612
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:14,070
You can't let me

613
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:15,400
watch him die like this.

614
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,230
Dr. Yan,

615
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:16,990
I beg you.

616
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:17,790
You must find a way

617
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:18,470
to save him.

618
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:19,590
Please.

619
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:23,430
Treatment with human blood?

620
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:25,310
I've never heard of this before.

621
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:28,160
This is a folk prescription.

622
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,100
First, I'll use my blood to counter poison with poison

623
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:31,440
and force out some toxins.

624
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,150
Then I'll use fresh human blood as the guiding drug

625
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:34,350
for detoxification.

626
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:38,160
How much do you need?

627
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:40,830
At least

628
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:42,270
one bowl.

629
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:46,710
What should we do?

630
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:47,970
Is there any other way?

631
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:49,830
Mr. Xi.

632
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:50,960
Yan Nanxing,

633
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:54,110
use my blood

634
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:56,480
and save Nan Jifeng.

635
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:20,830
Are you

636
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:22,640
really not afraid of death?

637
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:25,330
You've lost so much blood.

638
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,300
What if General Nan can't be saved

639
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:30,710
and you collapse too?

640
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,230
You said

641
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:42,200
there are things you fear more than death

642
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:44,280
and there are things

643
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:46,160
you want to do more than to live,

644
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:46,750
right?

645
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:52,710
In my life,

646
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,760
there's also a mission

647
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:57,190
that makes me not thirst for life

648
00:33:57,390 --> 00:33:59,270
nor fear death.

649
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:00,750
Mission?

650
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:03,640
Yes,

651
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:05,180
a mission.

652
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,110
Without General Nan,

653
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:12,590
the mission I came here for

654
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:14,280
won't be completed.

655
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:16,440
Besides,

656
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,120
I brought the murderer here.

657
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:21,830
It's my responsibility.

658
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:29,110
Do you know

659
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:31,640
why I won't

660
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:32,950
open an actual clinic

661
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:35,810
and instead wander around

662
00:34:36,430 --> 00:34:37,750
as a traveling doctor?

663
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:44,110
It's because I don't want to face

664
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:47,909
these life-or-death matters all the time.

665
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:50,560
I've been practicing medicine

666
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:52,630
with my mother since I was little

667
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:54,690
and traveled everywhere.

668
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:58,830
Actually, my mother saved many people.

669
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:01,719
But there were also many

670
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:04,090
who couldn't be saved.

671
00:35:06,909 --> 00:35:07,969
If one person died,

672
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,050
an entire family would fall apart.

673
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,179
I didn't understand.

674
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:19,630
My mother was doing good deeds,

675
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:22,630
but why did she feel burdened

676
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:25,719
like she was carrying people's lives?

677
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:28,750
From then on,

678
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:30,790
I made up my mind

679
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,510
that I wanted to be

680
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:36,710
a doctor who didn't deal with death.

681
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:40,590
Sometimes, I thought

682
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:43,290
healing skin diseases

683
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:45,910
or giving acupuncture for facial paralysis was nice.

684
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:47,510
Even if I couldn't cure them,

685
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:49,590
I wouldn't kill them,

686
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:51,110
right?

687
00:35:58,550 --> 00:35:59,400
But

688
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,590
you never gave up on

689
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:03,930
any patient.

690
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:06,150
Sometimes,

691
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:07,800
you seem like

692
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:09,670
you're running away,

693
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:12,260
but it's never true,

694
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:14,060
right?

695
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:21,350
I know.

696
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:23,190
You want to say that

697
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:25,190
I'm a benevolent doctor.

698
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:26,790
I am indeed

699
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:28,190
a good doctor,

700
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:29,620
both talented and pretty,

701
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:30,880
Hua Tuo reincarnated,

702
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:33,000
and I provide good service.

703
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:34,540
You envy me.

704
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:35,790
Have a rest.

705
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,180
Thank you.

706
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:48,430
Actually...

707
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:51,210
Actually, you don't have to thank me.

708
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:55,910
I didn't even tell my mother

709
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:59,480
what I said to you just now.

710
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:05,030
But I'm happy.

711
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:07,270
Telling you these things

712
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:08,910
feels like...

713
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:11,830
Feels like...

714
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:15,340
I made a friend.

715
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:26,380
Maybe...

716
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:27,920
Maybe weâ€™re not friends.

717
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,250
My name is Jiang Xinbai.

718
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:36,850
It's from the poem,

719
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:40,670
"the autumn moon in the heart of the river is pale."

720
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:42,430
My father's surname is Xi,

721
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:46,620
but I took my mother's surname.

722
00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:57,760
What exactly do you do?

723
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,200
You're quite greedy.

724
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:03,990
I told you all of my

725
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:05,050
inside thoughts.

726
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:07,840
Can't we have a heart-to-heart exchange?

727
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:10,070
What you said just now

728
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:11,910
was what you wanted to say.

729
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:13,750
I didn't ask you to say it.

730
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:15,870
You...

731
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:18,990
You only say that after you heard everything.

732
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:20,390
My hand is still injured.

733
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:22,070
Stop pretending.

734
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:24,140
You look fine.

735
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:25,920
It hurts so much.

736
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:26,950
Who...

737
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:28,250
I donâ€™t believe it.

738
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:45,910
Thank you, Dr. Yan,

739
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:47,440
for taking care of our boss.

740
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:51,830
Just call me Poison Girl.

741
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:54,390
I think you're very creative.

742
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:55,830
If I say that,

743
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:58,610
I'm afraid some people won't like it.

744
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:02,590
It doesn't matter if he likes it or not.

745
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:03,620
I accept it.

746
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:07,630
What a personality.

747
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:12,910
If you're done, let's get down to business.

748
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:13,430
My lord,

749
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,030
I've checked the supplement roster

750
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:16,710
of soldiers under Nan Jifeng.

751
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,290
In the two years

752
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,580
since Nan Jifeng was sent to Heman,

753
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:20,950
other than casualties

754
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:22,350
and discharged soldiers,

755
00:39:22,350 --> 00:39:24,550
there are five unidentified deaths.

756
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,660
Yuwen Wu, Zhao Li, Du Tong,

757
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:31,130
Zhang Hui, and Zhu Ziquan.

758
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:32,580
[Yuwen Wu]

759
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:32,940
[Zhao Li]

760
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:33,400
[Du Tong]

761
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:33,780
[Zhang Hui]

762
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:34,160
[Zhu Ziquan]

763
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:42,840
These five died in the first year

764
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:44,270
of Nan Jifeng's term.

765
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:46,730
Meanwhile, Nan Jifeng

766
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:48,070
only started pretending

767
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:49,440
to be alcoholic in the second year.
