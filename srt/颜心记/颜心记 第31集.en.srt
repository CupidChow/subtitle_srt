Who is he?

6
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:54,660
I'll kill him,

00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:56,550
so that you can be with me

Yes.

You're not a bad person.

Still lying, huh?

28

not just once.

32

this regional inspector?

105

It's okay.

106
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:14,830
I'll kill him,

107
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:16,540
so that

108
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,420
you'll only have one husband.

109
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:20,590

00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:21,630
Jiang Xinbai,

111
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:24,720
do you know whose territory you're on?

112
00:08:58,670 --> 00:08:59,470
Jiang Xinbai.

113
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,110
Why don't you

114
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:03,330
make friends with each other?

115
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:20,190
Chief Bai,

116
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:22,950
I trespassed into your mansion today,

117
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:24,350
and I apologize for that.

118
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:27,210
But it was because I heard that

119
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:28,910
my wife is in your mansion

120
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,310
as a guest,

121
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:32,680
so I had no choice but to do this.

122
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:34,670
Since you didn't know

123
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,570
that she's my wife,

124
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,750
I'll take it as a misunderstanding.

125
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:41,800
How about...

126
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:44,350
we sit down

127
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,280
and have a good talk?

128
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:48,040
Is that okay?

129
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:56,650
Let's talk.

130
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:00,910
I know

131
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:02,600
that Yi Yuanshan

132
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,910
is looking for trouble for Baiyuan Gang.

133
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:05,550
I believe,

134
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:07,670
Chief Bai,

135
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:10,330
you also want to get rid of him, right?

136
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:16,240
But you are a bandit.

137
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,910
If you take action against Yi Yuanshan,

138
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,470
the marshal,

139
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:21,970
you won't just be the most wanted criminal

140
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:23,570
in the Northwest.

141
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:27,220
You'll be the most wanted criminal in the entire Daqi.

142
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:31,070
And I am a regional inspector

143
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:33,510
with the authority to execute

144
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,390
corrupt and oppressive officials.

145
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:36,070
Perhaps...

146
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:39,070
we can cooperate.

147
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:42,280
You are also the most wanted criminal.

148
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:43,830
You can't even protect yourself.

149
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:46,160
Why do you think you can cooperate with me?

150
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,200
Once I return to the capital,

151
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:50,410
I won't just be a regional inspector.

152
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,220
I'll also be the Duke of Yuejiang.

153
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:54,910
What can I get?

154
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,500
After we get rid of Yi Yuanshan and the Heiao Gang,

155
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,910
I will only be responsible for taking Yi Yuanshan back to the capital.

156
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:04,070
From Tingzhou to the Western Route,

157
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:07,330
all the businesses the Baiyuan Gang desires

158
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:10,240
will be yours.

159
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,350
What if we can't get rid of them?

160
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:18,960
Will you just return to the capital

161
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:20,590
and leave me to face the mess?

162
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:25,500
If we can't make it,

163
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:26,990
you can take my head

164
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,360
and claim the bounty

165
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:31,470
to treat your brothers to drinks.

166
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:32,830
The Baiyuan Gang

167
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:35,560
will still be the Baiyuan Gang.

168
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:41,790
Sounds good.

169
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,410
But I have a condition.

170
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:49,390
Go ahead, Chief Bai.

171
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,020
I want her.

172
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:05,770
Are you kidding me?

173
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:06,710
Impossible.

174
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:09,280
Then there's no need to negotiate!

175
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:10,960
Wait.

176
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:15,590
Yan Nanxing.

177
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:17,450
Why is there no need to negotiate?

178
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,230
I even gave you one eye.

179
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,270
Didn't you say you wanted to repay the favor?

180
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:23,070
Why did you refuse to cooperate?

181
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:27,670
Fine.

182
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:31,240
Even if you don't want to repay my favor,

183
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,500
what about the families in Yuan Village?

184
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:36,010
If Yi Yuanshan really wants to get rid of you,

185
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:38,070
what about the women, old people, and children in Yuan Village?

186
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:39,670
Have you thought about them?

187
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:41,430
Aren't you afraid

188
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:43,030
he'll wipe out your village?

189
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:53,190
What are you planning to do next?

190
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,620
Get rid of Heiao Gang.

191
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:05,390
Chief,

192
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:08,560
are you really going to cooperate with Jiang Xinbai?

193
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,750
Yan Nanxing was right.

194
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:13,850
If we don't get rid of Yi Yuanshan,

195
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:17,010
he will sooner or later cause trouble for Yuan Village.

196
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:19,870
Keeping Heiao around will be even more of a disaster.

197
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,710
She's a woman you put a lot of effort into getting.

198
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:23,970
Are you going to let her go just like this?

199
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:26,350
Sooner or later, she'll be mine.

200
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:35,470
How did you find me?

201
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:40,460
Don't run around again.

202
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,080
You have no idea how worried I was.

203
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,160
It was because you

204
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:51,390
left me alone at home.

205
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:52,750
From now on,

206
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:54,560
take me wherever you go.

207
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:55,610
Do you hear me?

208
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:58,630
Alright.

209
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:01,110
You're always right.

210
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:07,710
That Bai Yuan...

211
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:10,950
I find him to be very weird.

212
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,150
And he's unpredictable.

213
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:15,050
You must be careful

214
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,530
when working with him.

215
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:19,560
Don't worry.

216
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:21,790
To remove the Zornia,

217
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:23,980
I must take this risk.

218
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:55,440
The official road is ahead.

219
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:59,070
They are planning to use the official road to transport the Zornia.

220
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:00,690
Yi Yuanshan is the boss of Tingzhou.

221
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:02,220
He can take any road he wants

222
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:03,910
to transport the Zornia.

223
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,080
They are coming.

224
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:17,170
Remember not to kill them all.

225
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,870
I have something to ask them.

226
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,100
I'll see what I can do.

227
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:26,590
Hurry. Keep up.

228
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:36,470
So it was Heiao

229
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:38,730
who stole my official document that day.

230
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:04,590
It's you again.

231
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:06,320
Bai Yuan,

232
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:07,750
it's the conflict

233
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:08,750
between our two gangs,

234
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,230
but you actually involved the authorities!

235
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:10,910
Aren't you a lackey

236
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:12,110
of Yi Yuanshan?

237
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:17,160
Since you know, how dare you rob me?

238
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:30,620
My lord,

239
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:31,710
she was the one who ambushed me

240
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:32,490
and General Nan.

241
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:33,990
I recognized the blade in her hand.

242
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:34,790
I'll kill her!

243
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:35,710
Wait.

244
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:43,550
Bai Yuan!

245
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:49,550
You killed her,

246
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:51,710
and now we've lost our witness.

247
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:54,320
Do you think she would testify for you if she were alive?

248
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:54,950
How do you know

249
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:56,350
I couldn't persuade her?

250
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:57,640
Set the fire!

251
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:58,390
Wait!

252
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:03,830
We have lost the witness.

253
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:05,060
I need this shipment

254
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:05,910
as evidence

255
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,960
to bring Yi Yuanshan to justice.

256
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:09,440
Chief Constable Jiang,

257
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:10,310
your naivety

258
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:11,829
does not match your position.

259
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:12,760
I'm not a bandit.

260
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,579
I am different from you.

261
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,230
Are you saying Bai Yuan killed Heiao

262
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:27,290
and took the goods?

263
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:28,260
Yes.

264
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:29,240
Baiyuan Gang

265
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:30,910
and that regional inspector

266
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:31,840
did it together.

267
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:36,020
[Admiring Heaven and the Saints]

268
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:39,950
Bai Yuan,

269
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,950
you want to do this the hard way.

270
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:45,670
I'll oblige you.

271
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:01,990
Ask him

272
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:03,150
where Yuan Village is.

273
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:03,720
Say it.

274
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,320
I don't know!

275
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,800
Since he doesn't know it,

276
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,150
kill him then.

277
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,780
Divide up the gold.

278
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:24,550
Chief!

279
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:26,490
What happened?

280
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:29,000
Yi Yuanshan took his men and surrounded Yuan Village,

281
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,130
taking away the elderly and children.

282
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:33,500
What else did

283
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:34,270
Yi Yuanshan's men say?

284
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:34,830
Nothing.

285
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,570
They just brought a letter.

286
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:39,380
Aren't you supposed to be watching at the casino?

287
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,550
How come you're back?

288
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:41,480
I deserve to die.

289
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:42,150
But I...

290
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:43,980
I couldn't hold it any longer!

291
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:44,620
Bastard!

292
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,830
What does Yi Yuanshan want?

293
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:53,470
He...

294
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:57,030
wants you.

295
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:10,270
Yi Yuanshan!

296
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:13,030
I've brought the person you wanted!

297
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:15,090
Where is my family?

298
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:22,230
As long as you kill Jiang Xinbai,

299
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:25,510
I'll release the people from your Yuan Village.

300
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:26,470
Marshal Yi,

301
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:28,910
if I die,

302
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:30,310
I'm afraid you won't be able to

303
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:31,640
explain to the capital.

304
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:35,040
The bandits in Tingzhou

305
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,310
are rampant.

306
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:39,370
And unfortunately, you passed away.

307
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:43,070
I've already prepared the commendation report.

308
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,670
Once you're dead,

309
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,550
I'll expedite its delivery

310
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:47,720
to the capital.

311
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:52,350
How thoughtful.

312
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:09,470
Chief and the others can't delay for too long.

313
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:11,070
We need to find them quickly.

314
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:12,050
Let's split up.

315
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:18,590
Let us out!

316
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:20,430
Let us out!

317
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:22,430
What happened?

318
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:23,750
Why did you arrest us?

319
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:24,510
Shut up!

320
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:25,630
Brat!

321
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:26,960
Stop crying!

322
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:27,590
No!

323
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:28,680
What are you doing?

324
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:29,990
Come here!

325
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:30,830
Don't scare the kid!

326
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:31,590
Let go!

327
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:34,290
She's just a kid! I'll soothe her.

328
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:35,110
I'll soothe her.

329
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,350
How dare you! I...

330
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:40,330
It's you.

331
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,800
What are you waiting for?

332
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:08,750
Didn't you say it would be just acting?

333
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,080
Why did you get injured?

334
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:13,770
Getting injured was the only way to make Yi Yuanshan

335
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:14,700
lower his guard.

336
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:18,070
It's okay. It's just a small injury.

337
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:27,290
I'll go take a look.

338
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,100
[Admiring Heaven and the Saints]

339
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:46,790
Thank you for protecting

340
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:48,320
the people of Yuan Village.

341
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:50,800
You're welcome.

342
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:51,870
I owe you one.

343
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:53,480
What do you want?

344
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:55,200
I'll fulfill it for you.

345
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:57,720
Why don't you...

346
00:21:58,430 --> 00:21:59,560
let my husband and me

347
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,200
leave Tingzhou safely

348
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:03,660
without causing any trouble for us?

349
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:05,320
Choose another one.

350
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:07,790
Even without his permission,

351
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:09,720
I can still get you to leave safely.

352
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:16,750
You're the boss of Tingzhou now.

353
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,870
You must keep your promise.

354
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:22,390
Alright.

355
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:23,880
I promise you.

356
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:34,950
What are you doing?

357
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:35,540
Sit down.

358
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:41,760
I'm the one

359
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,040
who injured Chief Bai.

360
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:43,950
It's my responsibility

361
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:45,790
to apply medicine to him myself.

362
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:46,710
No need.

363
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:48,080
Sit well.

364
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:51,540
Gently!

365
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,020
This wound is very serious.

366
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:55,020
How can you recover if I do it gently?

367
00:22:58,750 --> 00:22:59,510
Dr. Yan,

368
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:01,310
take a look. Is it enough?

369
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:16,310
Does the wound still hurt?

370
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:19,480
Now you

371
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,610
start caring about your husband?

372
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:23,630
I applied the medicine to him

373
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:25,760
just because I happened to be doing it.

374
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:27,230
Don't be jealous.

375
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:28,600
I'm not jealous.

376
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:31,710
Many things

377
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:34,200
have happened in the past few days.

378
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:36,350
First, I was captured by Bai Yuan,

379
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:38,070
and then you were wanted.

380
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:39,910
You have no idea

381
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:42,670
how worried I've been about you these days.

382
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:48,040
Yan Nanxing,

383
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:50,670
leaving you alone

384
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:52,850
at the Inspector's Residence

385
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:54,030
was my fault.

386
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:57,670
Silly.

387
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,220
I'm fine now, aren't I?

388
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,390
Besides,

389
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:01,990
I've been adventuring around the world with my mom

390
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:02,990
since I was young.

391
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:04,650
I can handle anything.

392
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:06,950
What if there's something you can't handle?

393
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:08,190
If there is,

394
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:10,480
you'll definitely come to save me.

395
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,250
I'm telling you,

396
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,110
whether it's a trap,

397
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:15,300
a dangerous place,

398
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:17,420
or a deadly one, I'm not afraid of any of them.

399
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:19,400
I'm just afraid of you abandoning me

400
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,710
and leaving me alone.

401
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:25,920
Yan Nanxing,

402
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:29,730
it won't happen again.

403
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:31,310
I promise.

404
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:40,200
Are you cold?

405
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:41,950
I'll get clothes for you.

406
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:48,190
When you grow up

407
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:49,470
and want to see me,

408
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:50,670
just say, "Are you cold?

409
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:51,670
Have my clothes."

410
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:53,450
and I'll know it's you.

411
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:56,750
What's wrong?

412
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:02,540
Nothing.

413
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,470
♫When the emotions are ignited♫

414
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:07,030
♫Taking turns to light up♫

415

let's never leave each other again,

417
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:08,430
okay?

418
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:09,400
♫I wait expectantly♫

Okay.

422

♫I want to keep an image of you♫

♫It's because of love♫

434
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:12,440
Gosh.

435
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:23,830
Chancellor,

436
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:24,560
morning.

437
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:26,980
Who allowed you to dress so lightly?

438
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,150
I'm sorry.

439
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,840
Usually when I do ironwork or such,

440
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,390
I dress lightly for convenience.

441
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:34,010
From now on, whenever you're in my residence,

442
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:36,010
you mustn't be improperly dressed.

443
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:37,040
Whenever?

444
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:40,190
Yes.

445
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,080
Whenever.

446
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:52,470
From now on, whenever you're in my residence,

447
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:54,470
you mustn't be improperly dressed.

448
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:18,160
Chancellor.

449
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:27,400
Chancellor.

450
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:28,910
It's not raining.

451
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:30,310
How did you get so wet?

452
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:31,840
I just finished my bath.

453
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:32,860
Why...

454
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:38,170
Why didn't you take off your clothes when you were bathing?

455
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,700
Chancellor, you told me

456
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:46,570
not to be improperly dressed

457
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:48,370
whenever I'm in your residence.

458
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,060
You don't have to be so obedient.

459
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:54,230
I only listen to you.

460
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:56,830
If Yan Nanxing heard

461
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:58,260
what you said,

462
00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:00,250
she would be upset, wouldn't she?

463
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:02,350
No, she's not even in the capital...

464
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:08,300
Then where did Yan Nanxing go?

465
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:12,630
Tell me.

466
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:14,110
I promised Xinbai

467
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:15,270
to keep an eye on her.

468
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:17,320
I can't let anything happen to her.

469
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:18,870
My boss...

470
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:20,770
She went to find Mr. Jiang.

471
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:23,790
Did Yan Nanxing think that I would

472
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:25,330
hold her responsible for the compensation

473
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:26,630
of Ruyi District

474
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:27,890
and Beauty of the City,

475
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,840
so she ran away overnight?

476
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:33,050
So that was the reason.

477
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:39,930
[Shang Residence]

478
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,350
Come, Shang.

479
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:42,730
Where are we going?

480
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:43,790
We're almost there.

481
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:44,550
Come with me.

482
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:46,310
Let's go.

483
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:49,420
I'll tell you when we get there.

484
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:51,290
Why did we come to the yard?

485
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:51,750
Wait.

486
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:54,490
Let's get down to business.

487
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:56,690
Yan Nanxing went to Tingzhou secretly?

488
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:01,750
Keep your voice down.

489
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:02,490
Boss said

490
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,180
we shouldn't let others know.

491
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:06,120
Then why did you tell me?

492
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:08,200
Shang, you're not just anyone.

493
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:12,730
However,

494
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,100
it was understandable

495
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,550
that she went to Tingzhou.

496
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:16,810
They just got married.

497
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,110
A day apart

498
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:20,110
must have felt like three years.

499
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:23,680
Before Boss left, she also said

500
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:24,850
that we should take good care of each other

501
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:25,990
in the capital.

502
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:28,050
Speaking of which,

503
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:29,370
can you refrain from

504
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:31,370
fighting with others in the future?

505
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:34,830
Breaking things and paying for damages is minor,

506
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:36,160
but what if you get hurt?

507
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,780
In the future, if anything happens,

508
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:42,840
come to me first.

509
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:48,670
It's not like you don't have someone to rely on.

510
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:50,230
Yes!

511
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:51,000
Yes, sir!

512
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:54,430
By the way,

513
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:56,960
why did you bring me to the yard?

514
00:29:58,430 --> 00:29:59,360
I almost forgot.

515
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:00,750
I brought you here

516
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:01,830
because I've found a new method

517
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:03,140
to treat your sense of smell.

518
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:03,670
Let's go.

519
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:04,970
Sai'er,

520
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:07,540
I don't want to see any snakes,

521
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:09,340
insects, rats, and ants for now.

522
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:10,070
Treating the sense of smell

523
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:12,400
isn't something that happens overnight.

524
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:13,480
Let's take a break first,

525
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:13,880
okay?

526
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:14,450
No rush.

527
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,630
Wait.

528
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:16,830
This is

529
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:17,730
a special therapy

530
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:18,490
from our village,

531
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:19,530
and it's very effective.

532
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:20,630
Come with me, come.

533
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:22,270
Right here.

534
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:24,070
It's very simple. Come and see.

535
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:30,110
What are you...

536
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:31,190
Look.

537
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:32,640
Just lie down like this,

538
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,860
letting the blood flow to your head.

539
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:36,600
It can enhance your senses.

540
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:38,150
I believe

541
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:40,630
it will definitely help in treating your sense of smell.

542
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,160
Come on. Come and have a try.

543
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,190
Get up first.

544
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:44,360
The stone is quite hot.

545
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:44,990
I'm telling you.

546
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:47,030
-It's very effective.
-Get up.

547
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:10,830
I'm sorry.

548
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:13,460
Did I hurt your nose?

549
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:15,950
Shang.

550
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:17,310
Shang?

551
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,990
Did that make you stupid?

552
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,180
Why is your heart beating so fast?

553
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:27,670
It's okay.

554
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:29,770
I'll go find you some calming pills.

555
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:05,830
You're quite enjoying yourself.

556
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:06,830
You're not afraid at all

557
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:09,230
of going back to the capital to face punishment?

558
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:11,890
A fortune-teller said I'll live to be a hundred.

559
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:13,940
That fortune-teller

560
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:15,870
has probably already died.

561
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:16,710
You,

562
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:17,880
come up here

563
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:19,150
and sing for me.

564
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:21,190
Your carriage is too luxurious.

565
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:22,990
Ordinary folks can't just hop on.

566
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:23,900
Why don't you come down

567
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,100
and spar with me a bit?

568
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:27,090
I'll kill you sooner or later.

569
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:28,440
I'm waiting for you!

570
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:31,950
Once we're prepared,

571
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,680
we'll head back to the capital.

572
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:37,200
Yan Nanxing!

573
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:41,550
Come.

574
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:44,110
Go.

575
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:55,000
Why are you here?

576
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:57,170
I'm here to see you off.

577
00:32:58,190 --> 00:32:59,470
You cured my eye

578
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,830
and protected the people of Yuan Village.

579
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:02,670
Can't I

580
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:03,570
see you off?

581
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:07,310
You know it well

582
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:08,150
that if I wanted to keep you,

583
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:09,150
I definitely can.

584
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:10,810
But I have promised you

585
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:12,720
to let you leave safely.

586
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:16,960
You are

587
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:18,110
so competitive.

588
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:19,900
If you don't get something you want,

589
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:20,840
you will definitely be unwilling to accept it.

590
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,440
Do you think I want to keep you

591
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,480
just because I'm competitive?

592
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:26,650
Is there any other reason?

593
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:32,450
Why do you like him?

594
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:36,990
He...

595
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:39,300
He's different.

596
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:41,150
We're both men.

597
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:42,680
What's the difference?

598
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:45,040
He is a truly good person.

599
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:47,470
A good person?

600
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:49,670
Is it that simple?

601
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:50,510
Yeah.

602
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:51,960
Liking someone

603
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:53,530
is supposed to be simple.

604
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,550
Chief Bai,

605
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:58,400
I helped you, didn't I?

606
00:33:58,630 --> 00:33:59,230
Of course.

607
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:01,220
Then in the future,

608
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:02,870
can you be a good bandit,

609
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,590
punishing the evil and helping the weak,

610
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:05,950
and stay away from the Zornia?

611
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:08,150
This way, my help to you won't be in vain.

612
00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:09,070
Alright.

613
00:34:10,469 --> 00:34:11,389
Then stay

614
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:13,070
and supervise me.

615
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:15,270
Stop kidding.

616
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:16,360
I'm leaving.

617
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:17,070
Wait.

618
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:22,400
If I quit being a bandit,

619
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:24,790
can I...

620
00:34:26,429 --> 00:34:28,830
go to the capital and seek shelter with you?

621
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:30,230
Sure.

622
00:34:30,949 --> 00:34:32,330
My Blossom Beauty's business in the capital

623
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:33,070
is booming.

624
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:34,580
I'll hire you

625
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:35,980
as a clerk,

626
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:36,880
alright?

627
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:37,469
Okay.

628
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:44,989
This is made of shark bones

629
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:46,469
and can keep you safe.

630
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:49,409
It's a gift for you.

631
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,960
He's a good man.

632
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:00,370
He won't mind a farewell gift.

633
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:06,410
My lord,

634
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,690
how can you tolerate it?

635
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:10,480
I couldn't if I were you.

636
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:12,110
Aren't you afraid Bai Yuan

637
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,110
might take Her Ladyship away again?

638
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,630
If Bai Yuan really wanted to take her away,

639
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:19,490
he wouldn't have made the promise in the first place.

640
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:21,020
So why are we watching here?

641
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:24,690
I'm worried about my wife.

642
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:25,880
Is that not allowed?

643
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:27,230
Do you have a wife?

644
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:28,510
What do you know?

645
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:33,470
Alright.

646
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:35,160
I'm leaving.

647
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:40,870
I'm getting in the carriage.

648
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:41,470
Go.

649
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:43,520
I'll take care of Her Ladyship.

650
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:57,270
Mr. Jiang,

651
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:58,840
see you.

652
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:03,060
Chief Bai,

653
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:04,590
we've

654
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:06,510
faced death together.

655
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:07,910
But...

656
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:11,180
I hope I won't see you again in the future.

657
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:12,870
Why?

658
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:16,780
You're a wanted criminal after all.

659
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:17,430
And I

660
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:19,120
hold an official position.

661
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:20,890
If we meet again in the future,

662
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:22,670
it wouldn't be appropriate.

663
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:25,020
Mr. Jiang, you are quite honest.

664
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:27,670
And you are a straightforward person.

665
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:28,270
Let's...

666
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,210
each take care of ourselves in the future.

667
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:46,340
[Yunmu Market]

668
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:37,960
What did Bai Yuan just give you?

669
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:39,960
A shark bone pendant.

670
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:41,390
He said

671
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:42,910
it's for keeping me safe.

672
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:44,250
We won't see each other again in the future,

673
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:46,380
so he wanted me to keep it as a souvenir.

674
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,280
Are you overthinking it?

675
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:50,590
Why am I?

676
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:53,670
For keeping you safe?

677
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:57,260
You need people to keep you safe.

678
00:37:57,690 --> 00:37:58,950
It's just a mere thing.

679
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:00,150
It's useless.

680
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:02,750
Yes, you're right.

681
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:03,950
You are always right.

682
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:18,610
Ambush!
