4
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:28,650
Madam.

5
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:31,390
What are you doing?

6
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,070
My tribe

7
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,930
is known for its snake legends.

8
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,030
So it's not wrong for people

9
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:39,880
to call me a snake demon.

10
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,350
So I prayed.

11
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:45,670
I prayed sincerely to God.

12
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:47,910
No matter what it takes,

13
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,420
I want to be with him forever.

14
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:53,070
I've cut ties with my family

15
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:56,230
and swore that I would never mention the tribe.

16
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:57,590
But I didn't expect

17
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,870
the price I had to pay

18
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:03,150
to be his life.

19
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,370
It was just an accident.

20
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:05,990
No.

21
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:07,940
I forced God to give me

22
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,430
something that didn't belong to me.

23
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:11,550
My husband is being punished for that.

24
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:12,070
Madam.

25
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,490
General loves you.

26
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:14,710
He has a strong will to survive.

27
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:16,070
He will wake up for sure.

28
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:17,829
Madam!

29
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,470
The general is awake.

30
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:20,790
Really?

31
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:22,940
I told you.

32
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:23,670
Go.

33
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:25,430
Thank you.

34
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,170
No need to thank me.

35
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:27,870
Go see him.

36
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:29,350
Go.

37
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:51,470
They bribed me with these.

38
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,650
I didn't touch them at all.

39
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,780
The Zornia crisis

40
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,400
is rising in several

41
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,760
prefectures recently.

42
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:04,550
The root of the cause

43
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,120
is in Heman.

44
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:07,990
I once thought

45
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:10,290
you colluded with them

46
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,750
and helped them

47
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,470
import the Zornia.

48
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:16,100
I came to Heman this time

49
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,980
to find evidence

50
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:19,870
and arrest you.

51
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:24,510
But that day,

52
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:27,470
you almost died.

53
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,920
It didn't seem like a trick.

54
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,110
That was when I suspected

55
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:34,510
there might be more to it.

56
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:42,080
When did you find out

57
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,140
about my identity?

58
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,110
I once had the fate of

59
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,310
meeting a great detective,

60
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:50,390
Xi Zhaoming.

61
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:53,520
You called yourself Xi

62
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:55,570
and you came from Yazhou.

63
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:58,390
Let me ask you.

64
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,090
Who do you think

65
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:03,630
attacked me previously?

66
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:05,090
Tumen,

67
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:06,060
Gongye,

68
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:07,260
and Moqi.

69
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:13,120
I underestimated them.

70
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,410
Maybe they already had

71
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,150
their eyes on me when I was

72
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:21,370
surveying the city a few days ago.

73
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:22,660
But I didn't expect them

74
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,220
to bribe my lieutenant.

75
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,920
They did to me

76
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:28,550
what I did to them.

77
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,460
I was careless.

78
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,900
What do you mean?

79
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,510
I once sent five of my trusted

80
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,440
subordinates to their territories

81
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,570
as my eyes and ears.

82
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,310
But they came back to me

83
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,550
as five cold bodies.

84
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,470
No wonder when Dr. Yan

85
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:48,740
wanted to treat you

86
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,750
with the Zornia,

87
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,440
you strongly refused.

88
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:54,070
They wanted to poison and

89
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:56,240
control me with the Zornia.

90
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,870
If my wife hadn't saved me,

91
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:01,950
I would have been ruined.

92
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:05,360
Why didn't you take the initiative to attack?

93
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:07,480
Were you scared?

94
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,070
No.

95
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:12,150
After I recovered,

96
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:13,940
I pretended

97
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:16,400
to be drunk and turned away guests.

98
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:17,980
Only this way

99
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:19,870
could I

100
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,530
investigate the clues

101
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,430
and collect evidence in peace.

102
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:24,240
Ridiculous!

103
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,130
If what you said is true

104
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:28,820
and the three big families call the shots here,

105
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,150
where were you planning

106
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,630
to submit your evidence?

107
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:34,120
If I hadn’t come to Heman,

108
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,670
how would the capital have known about this?

109
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:37,590
Nan Jifeng.

110
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:39,510
You've been a general for years.

111
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:40,870
You should be brave.

112
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,310
But now you allow the Zornia crisis to spread.

113
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,110
Do you know why

114
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,510
you've become like this?

115
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,590
First,

116
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,900
you have attachments.

117
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:50,740
You're worried that

118
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,150
your wife will be killed.

119
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,270
Second,

120
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:56,470
you were once harmed by the Zornia.

121
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:58,210
Although you've recovered now,

122
00:06:58,210 --> 00:06:59,740
they have something on you.

123
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:01,430
Once that is exposed,

124
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:03,390
your reputation

125
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,180
will be gone.

126
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:08,670
In the end,

127
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:11,130
you only care about your reputation.

128
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,550
I deserve

129
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,710
it.

130
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,190
Get up.

131
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:31,990
Let me ask you.

132
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:35,340
Have you seen the master of the Moqi family in person?

133
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,010
Yes

134
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:37,950
and no.

135
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,530
What do you mean?

136
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:42,350
I once met

137
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:43,950
Gongye

138
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:45,920
and Tumen alone.

139
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:47,909
But Moqi didn't come.

140
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,230
When they showed me

141
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:50,430
the five bodies,

142
00:07:50,909 --> 00:07:51,990
Moqi was there.

143
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,880
But he was sitting

144
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:55,050
behind the curtain

145
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:56,970
and didn't say a thing.

146
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,360
That means

147
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:02,790
Moqi is the master of the three major families.

148
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:13,030
Nan Jifeng.

149
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:17,430
Even if I believe

150
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,940
you are not their accomplice,

151
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,770
when you go to His Majesty,

152
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:24,160
you won't be able to explain yourself.

153
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:28,150
I hope you can

154
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:29,950
leave Heman as soon as possible.

155
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:31,360
If you can take my wife

156
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:32,230
with you,

157
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:34,909
I will do my best to...

158
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:35,419
No.

159
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,450
The only way for you

160
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:41,309
to turn the tide now

161
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:43,730
is to make a strong statement.

162
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:47,180
Nan Jifeng.

163
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:50,490
You must show the people of Heman that

164
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:52,630
you are the God of War sent by His Majesty

165
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:54,710
to protect this land.

166
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:56,030
You...

167
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:58,310
are fearless.

168
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,830
Those who make a profit from Zornia

169
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:05,140
will receive caning and be sentenced to physical labor

170
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,740
according to the law of Daqi.

171
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,880
If you know but don't report it,

172
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,510
according to the Law of Daqi,

173
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:11,990
you will be sentenced to ten days of labor

174
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:13,790
and a fine of 300 taels of silver.

175
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:17,470
Let go of me!

176
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,390
Bravo! Bravo!

177
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:23,460

The shrimp is very good.

Try the shrimp.

I think Dr. Yan

188

would like the meatballs.

want to eat these pork slices.

Don't go.

217
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:35,750
I really want to introduce

218
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,350
two friends to Mr. Xi.

219

We'll be back soon.

They're so welcoming.

I have no reason to refuse.

223

Carry this knife with you.

For self-defense.

225

I'm afraid this visit

226

is not that simple.

227
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:09,990
Sounds like you'd be in more danger.

228
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:10,830
Keep it.

229
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,150

you won't be able to fend off danger.

234
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:20,890
If you keep it with you,

235
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,220

238
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:33,670
I think it's better

239
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,830

240
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:35,260

Keep Yan Nanxing safe too.

I'm not afraid of a confrontation.

248
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:51,110
But I'm afraid it might be a trick to lure us away.

249

look so grand?

257

than your General's Residence.

Mr. Xi, right?

296
00:17:14,349 --> 00:17:16,280
You must be the county lieutenant,

the county magistrate, Tumen.

300
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:23,930
Mr. Xi, you have a good eye.

301
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:26,380
I'm a little older than Tumen.

302
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:27,490
Whenever we meet someone new,

303
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:29,560
most people would mistake me for the county magistrate.

304
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,540
I do business in Yazhou

305
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:34,430
and often come into contact with officials.

306
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:35,990
As such, I learned a trick or two

307
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:38,050
about observing and reading people.

308
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:39,230
It's nothing much.

309
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,110
Mr. Xi, you spoke your judgment

310
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:44,990
without hesitation.

311
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,900
Your thoughts and certainty

312
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,060
are different from ordinary people.

313
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:51,320
If I weren't brave enough,

314
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:52,970
I would not have come all the way

315
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:54,470
to do business in Heman.

316
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,040
Don't you agree?

317
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:08,510
She said she would

318
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:10,240
never mention the tribe again.

319
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:12,450
But isn't she always mentioning it?

320
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:17,300
Is it over?

321
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:20,650
Madam.

322
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:23,360
What did you do today?

323
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:25,690
This is a toxic oath.

324
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:28,400
A toxic oath?

325
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:31,510
I've vowed to live and die with my husband.

326
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:33,970
So I set up the altar to make the oath tonight.

327
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,960
Mr. Xi, so you're

328
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:47,950
General Nan's distant cousin.

329
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:51,390
You're here to do tea business?

330
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:53,230
Yes.

331
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:55,670
Yazhou is a place for the demoted.

332
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:57,590
Those old ex-officials

333
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,270
can't get used to a downgrade in lifestyle.

334
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,510
Good wine and tea

335
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:02,970
are essential to them.

336
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:05,180
All the flower tea businesses in the county

337
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,780
are under the Gongye family.

338
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:08,720
I'll let you in on the business.

339
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,210
Then I'll drink tea instead of wine

340
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:14,890
to thank you, Lord Gongye.

341
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:21,100
On the 13th of last month,

342
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:24,150
two people died accidentally in the city.

343
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,550
It seems to have implicated you.

344
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:28,830
What happened?

345
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:30,780
About that...

346
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:35,130
That was my first day in Heman.

347
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:36,470
I met two people

348
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,100
who claimed to be tea merchants.

349
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,710
They said they wanted to show me some tea leaves.

350
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:41,550
In the end,

351
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:43,950
they showed me Zornia.

352
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,370
There was a miscommunication between us

353
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:50,470
which resulted in a misunderstanding.

354
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:51,110
Later,

355
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:52,500
those two

356
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,230
mysteriously died.

357
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:55,750
It made me

358
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,070
really helpless.

359
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:02,510
I see.

360
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:03,510
Yes.

361
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:05,240
I was scared,

362
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,880
so I left the city to hide for a few days.

363
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:09,360
But I didn't know the way

364
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:11,930
and accidentally entered a village.

365
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:14,910
Somehow, I ended up

366
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:16,750
burning their field.

367
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,910
After that, I found out

368
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:21,030
that it was a Zornia field.

369
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:24,770
Don't you think

370
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:26,190
it's funny?

371
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,390
Is it that funny?

372
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:57,910
Dr. Yan,

373
00:20:58,470 --> 00:20:59,550
what are you doing?

374
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,860
I'm setting up a trap.

375
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:03,070
Madam.

376
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:04,760
Don't touch this powder.

377
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,690
It's poisonous.

378
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:06,910
Do you know what is

379
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:08,040
happening tonight?

380
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:11,230
I know.

381
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:13,800
They want to take us hostage

382
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:14,870
and use us to threaten Mr. Xi

383
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:15,800
and General Nan.

384
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:17,400
Madam, don't worry.

385
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,910
I won't let them succeed.

386
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:43,630
What a beautiful night

387
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:45,020
for murder.

388
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:21,040
Dr. Yan.

389
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:21,870
What’s going on outside?

390
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:22,670
Don't be afraid, Madam.

391
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:23,470
It'll be fine.

392
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,710
Everything will be fine.

393
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:25,390
I'll stay here.

394
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:26,230
You go in first.

395
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:26,830
Go.

396
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:27,710
Go.

397
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:41,630
Jiang Xinbai.

398
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,000
You must come back safely.

399
00:22:57,950 --> 00:22:59,210
Why did the music stop?

400
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:00,710
Keep playing.

401
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:01,780
Continue.

402
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:03,710
Dance.

403
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:09,490
Why are you serving tea for General Nan?

404
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:10,650
Where's the wine?

405
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:13,550
To be honest,

406
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:17,240
an assassin attacked me a few days ago.

407
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,990
I almost died.

408
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:22,440
Luckily, my cousin risked his life

409
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,950
to save me.

410
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:26,660
The wound has recovered recently.

411
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:28,350
I can't drink these days.

412
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:31,610
That happened?

413
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:33,300
Haven't you

414
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:34,830
heard about it?

415
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:37,950
I did not know.

416
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:40,390
Did you catch the assassin?

417
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:42,850
He committed suicide to escape punishment.

418
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,800
Did you

419
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:46,550
offend someone?

420
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:49,190
Do you remember?

421
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:51,310
One year ago,

422
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,670
I sent

423
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:55,800
five trusted subordinates

424
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,830
into the heart of danger.

425
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:00,750
They were all brutally killed.

426
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:02,590
It was thanks to you two

427
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:04,710
that my men's bodies were recovered.

428
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:06,920
This year,

429
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:09,170
I dreamed of them every night.

430
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:12,510
They asked me to avenge them.

431
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,790
The Zornia crisis is severe in Heman.

432
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:41,240
Who is the biggest force driving it?

433
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,040
Who is the mastermind behind it?

434
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:43,830
My lords,

435
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:45,630
don't you

436
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:47,030
want to know the truth?

437
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,180
General Nan.

438
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:52,190
You're drunk before you drink.

439
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:55,270
Today's party is for us old friends to meet.

440
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:57,070
The people of the past are gone.

441
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:59,230
General, please look ahead

442
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:02,360
and cherish the people around you.

443
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:05,670
Cousin.

444
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:10,320
Don't make things difficult for them.

445
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,150
Actually,

446
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:16,310
Lord Gongye and Lord Tumen

447
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:18,830
are also at their superior's disposal.

448
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:19,920
There are many things

449
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,520
they have no power to decide.

450
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,980
If we have important questions,

451
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:25,910
why don't we ask the real master?

452
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:29,870
Right?

453
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:32,990
Mr. Moqi?

454
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:43,270
Or should I call you

455
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,020
Ms. Moqi?

456
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,430
[Moqi]

457
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,400
You were very careful.

458
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:26,160
But you forgot to disguise your hands.

459
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:28,070
It's an important occasion,

460
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:29,390
but a woman managed to disguise

461
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:31,470
herself as a male musician and mix into the venue.

462
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:32,640
Apart from Ms. Moqi,

463
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:34,750
I can't think of anyone else.

464
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:37,790
Plus, my cousin once said

465
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:40,790
he had never seen the master of the Moqi family in person.

466
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:41,670
I wondered

467
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:43,650
if that was because

468
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:45,550
the master of the Moqi family

469
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:47,000
was a lady.

470
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:51,670
Mr. Xi.

471
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,230
You have sharp eyes.

472
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,630
It's been a few days.

473
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:58,910
You look better than before.

474
00:26:59,170 --> 00:26:59,920
Who is she?

475
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:01,910
When did she see me?

476
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:07,800
You know each other?

477
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:09,420
Not only does Mr. Xi

478
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,320
know Ms. Moqi,

479
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:13,070
they go way back.

480
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:20,190
What's wrong, Mr. Xi?

481
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:22,750
Don't you recognize me?

482
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,370
Who was she?

483
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:31,430
So you're the

484
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:33,660
female doctor giving free treatment.

485
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:36,070
It's her.

486
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:39,710
Mr. Xi, I've checked.

487
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:41,240
There's no ambush outside.

488
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:49,630
Whose side are you on?

489
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:53,270
Right back at you.

490
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:54,540
Nan Jifeng.

491
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,070
Aren't all the water transport in Heman

492
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:57,200
under your control?

493
00:27:58,150 --> 00:27:59,830
Why was the pleasure boat I rented

494
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:01,690
under the Moqi family's control?

495
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:04,230
Whose side are you on?

496
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:06,470
What do you mean?

497
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:11,950
Are you pretending or are you actually stupid?

498
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:13,160
Ms. Moqi

499
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:15,070
owns the pleasure boat I rented.

500
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:17,420
I think

501
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:19,800
all the pleasure boat businesses in Heman

502
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:21,510
should be under her name.

503
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,310
Just now,

504
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:28,410
you were silent for so long

505
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:30,030
because you were thinking about that?

506
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:30,750
What else?

507
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:34,230
So,

508
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,720
since my first day

509
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:37,510
in Heman,

510
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:38,880
Ms. Moqi

511
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:40,600
has had her eyes on me.

512
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:44,470
You're exaggerating.

513
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:47,140
A new guest is here in Heman.

514
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:50,020
As the host, I must do my part.

515
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:51,110
I just didn't expect

516
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:52,670
you to be so rude.

517
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:54,510
You killed two of my men

518
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:56,430
at the first sign of conflict

519
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:58,180
and burned my fields.

520
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:01,190
Sorry about that.

521
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,900
The ignorant is innocent.

522
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:06,390
From today onwards, as long as

523
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:08,270
General Nan

524
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:09,830
and Mr. Xi

525
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,110
are on the same side as us,

526
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:14,590
everything shall be forgotten.

527
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,430
Judging from the current situation,

528
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:23,510
it's hard

529
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:25,800
for us to choose otherwise.

530
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:28,510
Mr. Xi, you're a smart man.

531
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:30,640
Smart people should be sincere

532
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:32,710
when making friends.

533
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:36,310
I sent someone to watch your pleasure boat.

534
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:37,830
They said

535
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:39,230
your attendant

536
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,790
called you 'my lord'.

537
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:45,030
My lord.

538
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,790
What kind of lord are you?

539
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:54,630
If you don't reveal your identity,

540
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:57,520
things might look bad for you.

541
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,990
Those young people from Lanna Village

542
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:13,700
who were forced away by you.

543
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:15,630
Those poor children who died

544
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:18,970
and the elderly who have no one to rely on.

545
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:21,510
Do you dare to reveal your identity to them?

546
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:28,110
A bunch of low-life profiteers like you

547
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:30,130
have no right to ask me.

548
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:32,100
Since we're not friends,

549
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:33,590
today,

550
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:34,990
you'll die here!

551
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:06,150
My lords,

552
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:08,070
do you think

553
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:09,850
you can leave Heman?

554
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,500
We don't have to leave.

555
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:13,490
We just need to arrest you.

556
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:32,660
How dare you try to

557
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:34,870
assassinate an imperial official?

558
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:35,720
You...

559
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:37,790
You set me up!

560
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,760
Didn't you do the same before?

561
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,100
The Moqi family profited off Zornia.

562
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:57,230
I'll investigate according to the law.

563
00:32:58,150 --> 00:32:59,830
In order to protect herself,

564
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:02,430
Moqi confessed that the Heman county magistrate,

565
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:03,430
Tumen family, and

566
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:05,950
the county lieutenant, Gongye family,

567
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,470
received bribes

568
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:10,150
and had been secretly supporting the Moqi family.

569
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:11,630
Tumen and Gongye

570
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,400
refused to plead guilty.

571
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:15,730
Furious, Moqi personally

572
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:17,590
killed Tumen.

573
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:20,150
Under the order of the Emperor,

574
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:22,160
I've detained Moqi and Gongye.

575
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,150
The trial will be held on another day!

576
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:26,830
Bravo! Bravo!

577
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:31,190
Bravo!

578
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:35,070
Bravo!

579
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:39,620
They called the shots for so many years.

580
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:40,590
They must have never thought that

581
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:41,770
they would suffer defeat

582
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:43,100
in their own territory.

583
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:47,170
How was the General's Residence?

584
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:48,150
As you expected,

585
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:49,560
I've handled things there.

586
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,510
Madam and Miss Yan

587
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:51,630
are safe and sound.

588
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:52,390
My lord,

589
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:54,480
your plan of capturing the leader first

590
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,540
is really amazing.

591
00:33:57,790 --> 00:33:59,350
Unfortunately, this leader

592
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:00,790
is not the true leader.

593
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:22,630
Madam.

594
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:26,070
Madam.

595
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:29,070
This stall's tea

596
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:29,630
is very fragrant.

597
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:30,190
Try it.

598
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:33,179
Don't call me Madam anymore.

599
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:34,429
Just call me Gaya.

600
00:34:37,949 --> 00:34:38,469
Okay.

601
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:39,790
Gaya.

602
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:43,310
We finally got out of the General's Residence

603
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:44,510
to get some fresh air.

604
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:45,830
Cheer up.

605
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:50,070
General asked me to go to the capital

606
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:50,989
with Mr. Xi.

607
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:53,469
Dr. Yan,

608
00:34:54,139 --> 00:34:55,150
what is Mr. Xi's

609
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:56,400
real identity?

610
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,390
How can General be at ease

611
00:34:58,390 --> 00:34:59,520
leaving me with him?

612
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:01,440
I don't know.

613
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:02,580
But he must be someone

614
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:03,710
who can protect you.

615
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:06,050
You don't know?

616
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:10,110
Don't you love each other?

617
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:17,950
It's a brief thing.

618
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:19,150
I was just

619
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:20,990
passing by

620
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:22,950
without real attachment.

621
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:26,230
I'm different.

622
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:28,390
I swore to God

623
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:31,040
to never be apart from my husband.

624
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:32,630
Alright.

625
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:36,320
Madam.

626
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:39,090
Speaking of leaving,

627
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:41,510
I have a request.

628
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:43,600
Please go ahead.

629
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:44,870
We're friends.

630
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:45,830
I'll complete

631
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:46,910
your request.

632
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:49,080
I want to see your magical medicine.

633
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,340
Our tribe is known for its snake legends.

634
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:52,710
The magical medicine

635
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:54,390
is used to cure snake venom.

636
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,470
To cure snake venom only?

637
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:01,180
This medicine can cure all poisons,

638
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,800
but only for snake venom.

639
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:07,350
Dr. Yan.

640
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:09,430
Are you alright?

641
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:12,590
I'm fine.

642
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:23,350
What a special tune.

643
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:25,450
I can't tell if it's a flute

644
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:26,720
or a vertical flute.

645
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:27,630
Li flute.

646
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:31,070
It's a Li flute.

647
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:35,400
Jiang Xinbai's pleasure boat is right there.

648
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:37,350
Go ahead.

649
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:09,960
You came uninvited.

650
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:11,510
It's not a lady's doing.

651
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:13,750
You are not a gentleman to me

652
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:14,620
anyway.

653
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:19,390
Why are you here?

654
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:23,000
Why am I here?

655
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:25,810
I took Lady Gaya out

656
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:26,840
for a stroll.

657
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:34,180
Aren’t you

658
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,330
leaving Heman soon?

659
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:37,720
She's not happy with the thought of

660
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:39,290
parting with her husband.

661
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:40,770
What about you?

662
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:43,000
When are you leaving?

663
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:48,600
After the full moon.

664
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:51,330
You haven't entered

665
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:52,730
the general's study yet.

666
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:54,320
You're leaving so soon?

667
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:58,190
I'm not going there anymore.

668
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:00,620
Aren't you looking for your item anymore?

669
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:01,390
No.

670
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,250
Then why did you come back to Heman?

671
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:08,150
Yeah.

672
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:10,710
Why did I come back here?

673
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:16,110
Forget it.

674
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:18,750
At least I witnessed a good show

675
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,400
without dying.

676
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:22,590
By the way,

677
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:26,280
I'm giving this back to you.

678
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:30,160
You promised me

679
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:31,550
you'd tell me your real identity

680
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:32,390
before you leave

681
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:33,070
Heman.

682
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:38,940
Wait till when I'm sure

683
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:40,490
I can leave Heman safely.

684
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:41,640
Excuses.

685
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:42,880
Take it.

686
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:50,030
Don't leave without saying goodbye

687
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:51,360
and break your promise.

688
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:54,510
If I do,

689
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:56,970
you can come to the capital to find me.

690
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:07,670
I mean,

691
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:09,110
if

692
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:10,310
you're ever in trouble in the future

693
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:11,840
or need help with anything.

694
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:14,720
Don't make a promise so easily.

695
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:15,400
Be careful.

696
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,900
I might actually look for you in the capital.

697
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:45,200
This is the address.

698
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,840
[No. 4 Taiping Alley, Nanhua District]

699
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:48,470
Why is there only the district number

700
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:49,870
and no location name?

701
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:52,920
You'll know when you get there.

702
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,030
♫I'll fetch you the moon in my heart♫

703
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:16,950
Next,

704
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,300
♫I dream of the courtyard♫

705
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:18,550
where will you go?

706
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:21,490
♫It knows my heart♫

707
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:22,540
I...

708
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:24,420
♫I want to return triumphantly with you♫

709
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:26,210
I may go to my mother.

710
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:26,520
♫We can listen to the rain♫

711
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:27,780
Maybe

712
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:30,660
♫And watch the snowfall in the west hills♫

713
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:29,810
I'll go somewhere new.

714
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:33,800
♫On the streets, the alleys, and the palace♫

715
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:32,270
Maybe...

716
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,430
Maybe I'll really run into trouble.

717
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:35,930
♫We shall always meet♫

718
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:36,290
Then I'll go to the capital to find you.

719
00:40:36,290 --> 00:40:39,840
♫I only hope you fall into my heart♫

720
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:42,270
♫The fire warms winter days♫

721
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:44,890
♫Spring can take its time♫

722
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,750
♫Everything is as you wish♫

723
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,060
This batch of goods

724
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,600
must leave Heman within ten days.

725
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:03,000
The general has sealed all the water ports.

726
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,710
He's also investigating the remnants of the three families.

727
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:05,770
Within this month,

728
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:08,230
no ship is allowed to go in or out.

729
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:09,650
Within ten days

730
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:11,110
is impossible.

731
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:13,310
I'm just informing you,

732
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:15,600
not discussing it with you.

733
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:17,430
Don't push me too far.

734
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:20,030
This batch of cargo ships must leave

735
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:21,430
Heman within this month.

736
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:23,190
Do what you must.

737
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:26,110
If you can't deliver it,

738
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:28,470
you and your general

739
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:31,320
will both die.

740
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:37,220
That man named Xi

741
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:38,750
and that female traveling doctor named Yan

742
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:39,990
must both die as well.

743
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,630
Yan Nanxing has nothing

744
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:42,490
to do with this.

745
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:45,030
She has a special relationship with Xi.

746
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:46,670
Xi's identity is unknown.

747
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:48,190
Maybe Yan Nanxing also

748
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:50,390
approached you with ulterior motives.

749
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,270
We can't risk it.
