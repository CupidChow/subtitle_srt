4
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:00,310
It's him!

5
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:02,110
Oh no.

6
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:04,710
Why is he staring at me?

7
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,190
His clothes and hairstyle...

8
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,060
You are?

9
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:21,500
Why did he touch me?

10
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:22,950
What does he want?

11
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:28,079
This...

12
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,320
lady.

13
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,230
It's late.

14
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:33,240
What are you doing in the water?

15
00:02:35,579 --> 00:02:36,110
You...

16
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,400
Miss?

17
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:39,880
He's kidding me, right?

18
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:42,950
But I don't think

19
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:44,480
he's joking with me either.

20
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:47,030
Or is it because it's dark now,

21
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,400
and he can't see me clearly?

22
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,329
Do I have to pull you up?

23
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,610
No, I'll be exposed.

24
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:03,630
Search every ship!

25
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:04,270
Yes.

26
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,490
Hurry! Search carefully.

27
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,620
Some of you go over there!

28
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:49,470
Miss.

29
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:51,120
Are you okay?

30
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:55,950
You guys go over there.

31
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:56,440
Yes.

32
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:58,550
Get up.

33
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:00,010
Hurry! Search carefully.

34
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:01,550
Come on, get up.

35
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:02,800
This way.

36
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:04,460
Search carefully.

37
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:05,120
Over there.

38
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:08,800
Be careful!

39
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:21,950
Hey!

40
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:35,380
Miss.

41
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:38,280
Are you really okay?

42
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:42,930
Well...

43
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:44,830
Your hands,

44
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,530
and your feet...

45
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,310
Stop trying to hide.

46
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,440
The boat is rocking.

47
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,150
Stop.

48
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:14,600
It's a man's hands and feet.

49
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,850
Why did he disguise as a woman?

50
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,060
It's you again.

51
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,550
By the sound of his voice,

52
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:45,780
it's Lieutenant General Li,

53
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,580
who almost took me away from the theatre last time.

54
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:50,550
Officer.

55
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:51,990
How have you been?

56
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,230
Who's inside?

57
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:56,870
It's a lady in there.

58
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,310
Please excuse us.

59
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,150
A lady?

60
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,040
You mean a courtesan?

61
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,760
Have you seen a man?

62
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,470
They are looking for

63
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:06,190
the man who just came up

64
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,470
dressed as a woman?

65
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,210
Did this man have something to do with

66
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:11,070
the riot at the General's Residence?

67
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,400
He must know something.

68
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:13,510
A man?

69
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,530
What kind of man?

70
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,310
What's his age or height?

71
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:20,280
Any distinguishing features?

72
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:22,300
A man! That's it!

73
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:24,990
Officer.

74
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:26,590
It's already late.

75
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,750
Yet, you are disturbing everyone with your search.

76
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:29,870
Besides his gender,

77
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,160
you can't even tell me the characteristics

78
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,180
of the person you are looking for.

79
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:34,110
It's dark, and it happened all of a sudden.

80
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,510
I didn't see him clearly!

81
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,190
Who are you putting on airs with?

82
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,470
You've misunderstood.

83
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:40,470
I just want to say

84
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:42,260
there is no man here

85
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,590
that you're looking for.

86
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:45,390
That's not up to you to conclude.

87
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,390
We wouldn't know until we search.

88
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:47,980
Officer.

89
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,270
Without an official order,

90
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,070
it's not right to trespass

91
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,830
people's private property.

92
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,830
So what? I'll just break in.

93
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:02,470
Officer.

94
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:05,630
The General's Residence will be

95
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:06,110
held accountable

96
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:07,840
for your stubborn insistence.

97
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,920
Are you sure you want to do this?

98
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,290
That makes sense.

99
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:13,910
He's saving me?

100
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,320
He doesn't even know who I am now.

101
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,590
Why is he helping me?

102
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,510
No, I can't get him into trouble.

103
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:20,750
I will insist on

104
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,030
searching today.

105
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:22,650
Lieutenant General Li,

106
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:23,580
he's over there!

107
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:24,310
Go!

108
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:56,980
[Notice of arrest]

109
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:57,090
Isn't she the female doctor named Yan Nanxing?

110
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:58,730
Didn't she run a free clinic just a few days ago?

111
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:00,390
She looked like a good person.

112
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,190
When she was treating

113
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,100
Madam last night,

114
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,630
a man suddenly appeared.

115
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,470
General and Madam suspect that

116
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:08,070
they colluded

117
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,350
to murder Madam.

118
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:10,590
And I heard that

119
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:11,360
many strange things

120
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,240
have been happening in the nearby villages.

121
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:13,950
Maybe it's the work of

122
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,810
this mother-and-daughter gang.

123
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,320
If we go with what you said,

124
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:21,510
there should be one more man from last night

125
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:23,310
that the General's Residence is looking for.

126
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:24,470
Why is it just the two of them

127
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,910
on the wanted poster?

128
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:30,550
That means the mother and daughter are the key.

129
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:31,310
By the way,

130
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:32,750
Phantom Physician

131
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,750
is staying at a shabby temple 20 miles away from the city.

132
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,750
She seems to be waiting for someone.

133
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:39,110
She must be waiting for Yan Nanxing.

134
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,240
We must find Yan Nanxing

135
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,429
before Nan Jifeng does.

136
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:44,670
I want to know

137
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:45,960
what happened at

138
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,960
Nan Jifeng's residence that night.

139
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,750
It even drove Nan Jifeng

140
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,950
to issue an arrest warrant far and wide.

141
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,880
It must be something serious.

142
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:56,500
You suspect it's related to the Zornia plant?

143
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:59,150
Yao.

144
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,190
I'm heading out of town.

145
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:03,250
You stay in the town to look for clues.

146
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:05,520
At the same time,

147
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,170
get rid of our stalker.

148
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:10,510
But Sir, you don't recognize faces,

149
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,550
nor are you familiar with the place.

150
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:14,590
This isn't my first mission.

151
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,360
What are you worried about?

152
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,410
For some reason,

153
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,230
I feel that you've

154
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:21,110
met your opponent this time.

155
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:23,110
Just Yan Nanxing?

156
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,990
It's been four or five days.

157
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:47,670
Why haven't I changed back?

158
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,010
Oh dear moon.

159
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:53,370
You're really messing with me, aren't you?

160
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:54,460
When you have a full moon,

161
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,510
I'll get my period.

162
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:57,070
And when I get my period, I will shapeshift into someone else.

163
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:58,390
And I always get in trouble whenever I shapeshift.

164
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,270
And whenever I am in trouble, I will rant to you.

165
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:01,530
Aren't you tired of it?

166
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,060
Even if you aren't, I am.

167
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:16,720
That was a hard fall.

168
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,010
It hurts so much.

169
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,240
I've shapeshifted back!

170
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,220
When did it happen?

171
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:43,230
This weather

172
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,200
is more fickle than I am.

173
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,080
Forget it.

174
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:51,370
I can't afford to offend.

175
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:02,070
Did she become a snail

176
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:03,190
or a turtle?

177
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:04,810
Why hasn't she come back yet?

178
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:40,310
Why did the whistle suddenly stop?

179
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:43,320
The old lady is slacking off again.

180
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:46,000
Fortunately, I'm already nearby.

181
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:51,320
Where are you?

182
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,270
Sir, I'm sorry.

183
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:03,830
Madam.

184
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:07,530
Aren't you being

185
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:09,390
too accurate with the horse dung?

186
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:10,870
Oh, you're a girl.

187
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,310
I'm really sorry.

188
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,190
If you don't mind,

189
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,630
go in and get changed

190
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:16,600
before you continue.

191
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,230
Forget it.

192
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:19,080
I have something on.

193
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:21,430
See you.

194
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:38,870
Let go of me.

195
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:43,920
Handsome young man,

196
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,590
why are you tying me up here?

197
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,190
Don't worry.

198
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:50,670
I won't roast you.

199
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,200
Don't burn the house down.

200
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:55,390
Let go of me.

201
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:56,470
Tell me.

202
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:59,750
What did you and your daughter

203
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:00,590
do in Heman?

204
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:03,350
Why does General Nan want you arrested?

205
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:05,870
Why should I tell you?

206
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,700
Tell me everything you know.

207
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,270
If your daughter

208
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:11,730
has been wrongly accused,

209
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,360
I can guarantee her safety.

210
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:19,070
Why are you laughing?

211
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,390
You don't look like

212
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,400
someone sent by the General's Residence.

213
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:26,790
Are you here

214
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:28,290
to deal with that General?

215
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:56,920
What do you want?

216
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:01,670
Be quiet.

217
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,240
It's him again.

218
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:34,520
The smell of horse dung?

219
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:39,530
A horse dealer?

220
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:44,830
Young man,

221
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:46,270
please...

222
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,130
find somewhere else to rest.

223
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,320
He doesn't recognize me?

224
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:54,310
Or did he forget me so soon?

225
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:55,830
My face

226
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:57,650
might not be the most beautiful,

227
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:59,070
but at least

228
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:00,270
I'm pretty as a fairy.

229
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:01,910
How could he forget me

230
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:02,870
so quickly?

231
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,560
There's a teahouse nearby.

232
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:17,070
Go have some tea.

233
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,480
Consider it my treat.

234
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,390
Is he trying to warn me of danger?

235
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:36,510
Could it be an ambush by the authorities?

236
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:41,590
Go.

237
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:00,630
Thanks.

238
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,079
The older, the wiser.

239
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:20,550
I'm aging like fine wine.

240
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:22,910
Handsome young man, get some sleep.

241
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,580
I knew you were unreliable.

242
00:17:58,950 --> 00:17:59,990
What do you mean,

243
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:01,720
"Everything's fine with Mum?"

244
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:02,920
What now?

245
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:04,300
You can't even find him.

246
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:08,190
Let's get rid of your bad luck.

247
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,270
Do you know how many constables were there?

248
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,630
I've been dodging left and right,

249
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:13,760
trying to avoid them

250
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:15,150
like a wild monkey.

251
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,110
I'm exhausted.

252
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:18,350
Listen.

253
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,370
We're in trouble this time.

254
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:21,590
We're being blamed for all the bad things done by

255
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:22,630
female thieves in the neighboring provinces

256
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:24,160
who haven't been arrested.

257
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:25,030
Really?

258
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:28,400
Who can we blame?

259
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:29,760
It's all your fault.

260
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:32,170
You insisted on running away from home.

261
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:33,230
If you didn't,

262
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,230
how could you be poisoned by

263
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:35,680
some unbelievable shapeshifting poison?

264
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,830
If you weren't poisoned,

265
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:37,470
we wouldn't need to

266
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:38,370
go to the General's Residence

267
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:40,030
to steal the damned antidote.

268
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,230
How dare you blame me?

269
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:43,460
If you hadn't used me

270
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:44,790
as a guinea pig since young to test drugs,

271
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,830
would I run away from home?

272
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:46,550
If I hadn't,

273
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:47,950
would I even get poisoned?

274
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:48,950
If I hadn't,

275
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:49,910
would I shapeshift every month

276
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:50,910
when I'm on my period?

277
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:52,190
It's all your fault.

278
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:53,910
Forget it.

279
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:56,530
I told you, we don't get along.

280
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:57,550
As usual,

281
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:58,490
let's split up.

282
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:04,710
Fine, let's split.

283
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:07,150
We're definitely not compatible in our ba-zi.

284
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:09,180
We'll definitely be unlucky if we stay together.

285
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,110
You've got the nerve to dislike me?

286
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,030
So what?

287
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:15,430
You're all grown up now.

288
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:16,510
You can go to anywhere you want.

289
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:17,610
What am I supposed to do with you?

290
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:18,740
Then leave me alone.

291
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,880
What? You're missing me already?

292
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:33,110
Don't forget.

293
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,190
When you're traveling around,

294
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:36,910
remember to help me ask around about that matter.

295
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:37,710
What matter?

296
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:39,800
It's about that person.

297
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,070
Who?

298
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:42,710
That one.

299
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:46,990
That young man?

300
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:49,190
Okay, I got it.

301
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:50,430
I'll ask around

302
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:52,110
to see if he is still alive.

303
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:54,710
Of course he is.

304
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:56,110
I'm asking you to find out

305
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:57,510
where he is.

306
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:59,510
I got it, little girl.

307
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:01,690
I really owe you from my past life.

308
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,540
Be careful out there.

309
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:04,750
Take care.

310
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:05,750
Well...

311
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:10,710
You take care too.

312
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:15,720
So naggy.

313
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:28,830
It's you.

314
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:31,080
You helped me several times.

315
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:31,830
I was hoping to find you

316
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:32,630
and thank you.

317
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,780
What do you mean?

318
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,260
Tie yourself up first.

319
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:44,070
You want to arrest me?

320
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,700
I ask that you do it yourself.

321
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:47,310
I won't be gentle.

322
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:48,920
I don't want to hurt you.

323
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:55,270
Okay.

324
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,430
You don’t want to go back to Heman?

325
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:32,960
Judging from what you said,

326
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:35,190
there's still room for discussion?

327
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:36,270
Of course.

328
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,750
I could have captured

329
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:39,880
your mother as well.

330
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,550
But I had let her go.

331
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:43,190
So I have to thank you instead?

332
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:44,100
No need.

333
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:46,550
I already know

334
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:47,830
how you offended

335
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:48,550
Nan Jifeng.

336
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:50,970
I want to help you.

337
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:52,480
How did you know?

338
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,450
On the same night of your accident,

339
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:55,520
your accomplice

340
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,340
broke into my pleasure boat.

341
00:21:57,370 --> 00:21:58,770
He was the one who told me.

342
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:00,430
My accomplice?

343
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:04,030
It was a man.

344
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:07,390
He disguised himself as a woman that night,

345
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,180
didn't he?

346
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:10,870
Yes.

347
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:12,320
He's my accomplice.

348
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:14,240
What did he tell you?

349
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:17,800
He didn't make it clear either.

350
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:18,510
So,

351
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:19,670
if you could

352
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:20,930
explain more clearly,

353
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:22,470
I can also help you better.

354
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:26,990
Why are you laughing?

355
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:29,540
I laughed at how good you are at tying people up,

356
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:32,670
but you're not very good at getting words out of someone.

357
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:37,110
In that case,

358
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,680
when we first met

359
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:39,680
at the theater,

360
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:42,040
you had no intention to help me.

361
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:43,310
You approached me

362
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,860
with an ulterior motive.

363
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:48,710
But you got your grand plan

364
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:49,470
all wrong.

365
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,280
The reason why I'm wanted

366
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:52,830
has nothing to do with

367
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:54,250
what you're trying to do.

368
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,760
Let's not

369
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:56,720
waste time here.

370
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:57,960
Let me go.

371
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,470
Retreat.

372
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:58,890
What are you doing?

373
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:02,350
You already kissed me once, and you want a second time?

374
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:03,610
What are you thinking?

375
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:06,310
Yesterday, I was saving your life by giving you oxygen.

376
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:08,310
I was trying to save you just now too.

377
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:09,870
We've kissed anyway.

378
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:11,570
You can say whatever you want.

379
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,270
Don't bother trying.

380
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:21,750
You won't be able to untie

381
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:22,950
the knots that I tied.

382
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:24,770
Then help me untie it.

383
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,520
I won't run away.

384
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:30,370
Even if you want to run,

385
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:32,480
you have to treat your wound first.

386
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,760
Otherwise, you won't get far even if you run.

387
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:45,080
Are you feeling better?

388
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:46,470
Untie me.

389
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:07,980
Where are we?

390
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:12,110
We were swept here by the rapids.

391
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:17,670
Let's take a look over there.

392
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:47,420
Zornia.

393
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:55,950
It originates from Lanna.

394
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:56,990
It has a peculiar spiritual nature,

395
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:58,480
and it's beyond ordinary reach.

396
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,080
But this plant is poisonous.

397
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:02,910
Zornia?

398
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,490
Why is there

399
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:05,950
such a large Zornia field?

400
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,280
Be careful.

401
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:10,340
It's a really large Zornia field.

402
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,700
If you inhale the Zornia flower's pollen,

403
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,030
it can lead to hallucinogenic poisoning.

404
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,310
Since someone is planting Zornia here,

405
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:18,350
it means someone

406
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:19,350
lives nearby.

407
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:21,870
Let's find a place to stay

408
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:23,470
and find out what's going on.

409
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:24,750
Stay?

410
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:27,030
Those who grow Zornia are not good people.

411
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:28,290
How can we settle down?

412
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:32,710
It hurts.

413
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:37,350
It hurts.

414
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:43,950
She has a sickly pallor

415
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:44,950
She's injured.

416
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:49,090
Her pulse is also erratic.

417
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:50,070
This is clearly

418
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:51,800
the symptom of being poisoned.

419
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:52,550
What?

420
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:53,790
It's that serious?

421
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:55,030
We should find her family

422
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:55,630
first.

423
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:56,640
Little girl.

424
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:03,470
Yuda!

425
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:05,190
Yuda!

426
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:06,250
Yuda!

427
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:07,030
Granny!

428
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:07,910
Granny.

429
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:09,550
What happened?

430
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:10,370
What's going on?

431
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:11,210
Yuda is gone.

432
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,240
Yuda is gone?

433
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:13,070
What's going on?

434
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:13,630
Yuda!

435
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:14,860
Everyone, come here.

436
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:16,680
Please look for the kid.

437
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:18,790
Let's go.

438
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:19,870
Let's split up.

439
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:20,910
Let's go.

440
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:26,870
Where can we find her?

441
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:32,430
Over there.

442
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:33,270
Let's go.

443
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,390
Yuda!

444
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:35,550
Yuda!

445
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:36,590
Yuda!

446
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:37,910
Yuda!

447
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:40,470
Go away!

448
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:42,910
Yuda!

449
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:44,030
Yuda!

450
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:44,710
Granny,

451
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:46,050
is she your granddaughter?

452
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:47,910
We don't welcome outsiders here.

453
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:49,620
Leave now!

454
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:51,550
Leave now!

455
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:53,030
Judging from your accent,

456
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,220
you're from Lanna.

457
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:55,390
It's none of your business.

458
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:56,350
Go. Leave now.

459
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,180
Lanna?

460
00:29:57,910 --> 00:29:59,350
Stop talking to them.

461
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:01,810
Get lost!

462
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:02,450
Get lost!

463
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:03,000
Child.

464
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:04,570
What's wrong with her?

465
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:06,200
I don't feel good.

466
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:06,710
Yuda!

467
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:07,710
Let me take a look.

468
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,400
Granny,

469
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:09,760
the little girl is sick.

470
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:11,060
Let me treat her first.

471
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:11,860
I'm a doctor.

472
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,120
Can you do it?

473
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:13,910
Can you?

474
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:14,560
Can you?

475
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,790
I really am a doctor.

476
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:17,830
Granny, please trust me.

477
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:18,830
I'm a doctor.

478
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:20,150
Look.

479
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:22,370
I have an acupuncture bag.

480
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:23,150
Look,

481
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:24,430
I have an acupuncture bag.

482
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:25,560
I really am a doctor.

483
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:27,430
Granny.

484
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:28,990
Then please save her.

485
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:29,750
Save her.

486
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:32,560
I don't feel good.

487
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:35,750
I don't feel good.

488
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:43,410
♫Sit with you at night and listen to the wind♫

489
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,840
♫When the wind flutters, the heart does too♫

490
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:50,610
♫Step by step, no words are spoken♫

491
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:54,120
♫Barged into sight♫

492
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:58,030
♫When did your figure grow hazy?♫

493
00:30:58,050 --> 00:31:01,390
♫And how clear is it?♫

494
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:04,250
♫I don't intend to break your heart♫

495
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:07,030
♫Silently fall into my arms♫

496
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:09,670
How's the child?

497
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:12,230
I think she's better now.

498
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:15,510
Granny,

499
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:18,170
why didn't you take her to the doctor?

500
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:20,850
Because they would be driven out.

501
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:22,710
Within Daqi,

502
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:24,900
planting Zornia is a crime.

503
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,750
Once discovered,

504
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:28,270
all the villagers

505
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:29,870
will be expelled.

506
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:32,080
Lanna has been subjugated.

507
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,830
They don't dare to go out to find a doctor.

508
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:35,510
We didn't touch the Zornia.

509
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:39,000
Lanna was destroyed because of Zornia.

510
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:42,430
We hate it more than you do.

511
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:43,790
Then why

512
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:46,280
did the child become like this?

513
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,830
The kids don't know.

514
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,710
When the Zornia plant grows,

515
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:53,140
they always go to the fields.

516
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,150
After all, I can't

517
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:56,350
lock them up at home.

518
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:57,980
As time passed,

519
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,550
she fell sick.

520
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:04,270
This is why

521
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,100
she got this sickness.

522
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:11,580
Granny,

523
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:13,380
who planted

524
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,400
the Zornia field?

525
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,350
Is she really in pain?

526
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:34,230
Her pulse is unstable

527
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:35,400
and she's pale.

528
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:36,780
Is this not enough?

529
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:38,590
I just want to know

530
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:41,110
how serious it is.

531
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:43,240
Yuda!

532
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:44,110
She can barely

533
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:45,060
make a sound now.

534
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:48,010
When the illness attacks,

535
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:49,430
erythema

536
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:51,980
will grow all over.

537
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,870
One will be extremely itchy

538
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:55,720
and one's breathing will become unstable.

539
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,850
As time passes,

540
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:58,560
one's limbs will be cold

541
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,700
and go into shock,

542
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,700
until one dies untreated.

543
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,290
You must save us.

544
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:06,550
You must save my child.

545
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:07,990
Granny,

546
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:09,710
I will save her.

547
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:11,230
Really?

548
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:14,130
Please save her.

549
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:15,590
I’ll find a way now.

550
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,370
Yan Nanxing.

551
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:20,110
I'm sorry.

552
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:28,870
Aren't you just

553
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:29,790
a traveling doctor who can only

554
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:31,090
treat facial paralysis?

555
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:32,830
Why do you know how to cure this disease?

556
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:34,270
Don't underestimate traveling doctors.

557
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:35,400
We're very capable.

558
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:39,610
This is a matter of life and death.

559
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:40,510
I never

560
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:43,170
joke around with people's lives.

561
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:45,810
Don't get in the way if you can't help.

562
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:47,120
Yan Nanxing!

563
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:00,880
Yan Nanxing.

564
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:04,370
A terminal illness

565
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:05,850
can't be cured overnight.

566
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:08,290
If you don't explain yourself today,

567
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:10,050
I won't let you continue.

568
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,030
If you consume

569
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:14,219
processed Zornia for years,

570
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:15,880
the treatment will take time,

571
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:17,290
but Yuda

572
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,960
has only been in contact with Zornia powder

573
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:20,830
and got a toxic rash.

574
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:22,480
Inducing vomiting is sufficient

575
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,409
Do you understand what I'm saying?

576
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:44,960
Your arm is injured.

577
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:46,929
Let me do it.

578
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:49,960
You can wait on the side.

579
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:31,550
Yan Nanxing.

580
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:35,510
You brought me into the mountain

581
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:36,870
to pick these poisonous herbs

582
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:38,470
that even pests won't touch.

583
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:40,590
Plus this...

584
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:43,720
cow manure

585
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,810
and horse urine?

586
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:48,580
You call this medicine?

587
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:51,590
These things

588
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,350
are foul and poisonous

589
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:54,750
to you mundane people,

590
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:56,810
but after I give them my magical touch,

591
00:35:56,810 --> 00:35:58,010
they become quality items

592
00:35:58,010 --> 00:35:59,250
for detoxification.

593
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:05,410
That's easy for you to say.

594
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:08,110
That child is so weak.

595
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:09,150
If she

596
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:10,270
eats this stuff

597
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:11,870
and really vomits

598
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:12,930
everything in her—

599
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:14,870
Don't jinx her.

600
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:18,030
Listen.

601
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:20,490
I can definitely cure her.

602
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:25,030
You...

603
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:01,440
How is the child?

604
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:05,480
She's a bit better after taking the medicine.

605
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:10,830
By the way,

606
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,510
there's something

607
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:13,990
that I find strange.

608
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:15,710
Why are there no young people

609
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:16,750
in this village?

610
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:18,550
I'm afraid

611
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:19,950
they either died

612
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:21,550
or ran away

613
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:23,570
because of the Zornia.

614
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:00,270
You're awake!

615
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:01,430
Miss,

616
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:03,590
did you save me?

617
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:04,320
Yes.

618
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:06,270
It's nothing.

619
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:08,510
Are you feeling better?

620
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:09,470
Da.

621
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:11,330
-Grandma.
-Da.

622
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:12,900
You're awake.

623
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:16,150
Grandma.

624
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:21,640
Miss, thank you.

625
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,590
It's my pleasure.

626
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:23,190
Thank you.

627
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:35,230
Granny,

628
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:38,230
where's that guy?

629
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:40,500
He went to the Zornia field.

630
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:52,470
Father,

631
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:54,380
you devoted yourself to the country and the people,

632
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,990
[The former chief constable of the Inspection Office, Xi Zhaoming]

633
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:56,360
but you ended up

634
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:57,790
being criticized by all.

635
00:38:58,510 --> 00:38:59,710
Why aren't you angry?

636
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,040
Why?

637
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:04,890
The country asked everyone to obey me

638
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,450
because it believed

639
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:08,940
that I had some strengths

640
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:12,590
and could endure the humiliation and bear the heavy burden.

641
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:13,720
I don't understand.

642
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:15,590
Son,

643
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:18,920
you'll understand in the future.

644
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:25,030
Yuda is awake.

645
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:30,440
Are you unhappy?

646
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:32,990
We saved someone.

647
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:37,480
What's there to be happy about?

648
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:39,750
As long as there is still Zornia,

649
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:40,750
this kind of thing

650
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:42,210
will happen every day.

651
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:44,390
Can you save them all?

652
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:46,430
I'll save them one by one.

653
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:50,030
Granny.

654
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:51,970
Who forced you all

655
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,460
to grow the Zornia?

656
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:56,430
They wouldn't give their names.

657
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:58,830
They dress mysteriously too.

658
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:01,710
I really don't know.

659
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:03,550
If we foreigners

660
00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:05,480
want to stay here,

661
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:06,950
we

662
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:09,700
can only obey them.

663
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:15,840
Lanna Village won't be at peace

664
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,900
unless the Zornia is not eliminated.

665
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:21,590
Why don't we settle this once and for all

666
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:22,430
and burn it?

667
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,070
Hey!

668
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:47,880
You're too impulsive.

669
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:49,390
Stop pretending.

670
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:51,120
I know you wanted to burn it.

671
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,270
I just did

672
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:53,470
what you wanted to do.

673
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:54,880
You're welcome.

674
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:00,490
You burned

675
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,980
the Zornia field.

676
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:03,390
Those people...

677
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:06,150
won't forgive us.

678
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:07,830
Granny,

679
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:10,700
the perpetrator should be held accountable.

680
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,100
If they ask you anything,

681
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,760
just tell them the truth.

682
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:16,630
What truth?

683
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:18,690
You want them to come after me?

684
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:21,670
Don't worry. With me here,

685
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:23,190
they won't hurt you.

686
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:27,310
What should we do?

687
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:32,350
Granny.

688
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:35,910
I promise you

689
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,130
no one will force you

690
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:39,990
to plant Zornia anymore.
