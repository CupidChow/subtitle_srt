Everyone,

7
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,150
I'm Yan Nanxing,

8
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,730
a newcomer to the capital.

9
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:14,860
Thanks to all of you,

10
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:16,090
I'm opening a small shop

11
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:17,130
in Ruyi District.

12
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,110
It's called Blossom Beauty.

13
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,949
Great! Great!

14
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,120
Everyone's welcome in my shop.

15
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,590
Your advice is also welcome.

16
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,790
Hope my business will thrive,

please come in.

23
00:02:46,829 --> 00:02:47,490

Look at all that steam.

00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:54,910
Hello, beauties.

27
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,079
Mrs. Bao.

28
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:57,660
So beautiful.

29
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,860
There's another area over there.

30
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:04,240
Hello, Mrs. Bao.

31
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:05,550
How's it?

32
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:06,270
Great.

33
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,630
Really? I want one too.

Your salon is great!

38
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,510
There is also

39
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,560
a make-up area,

40
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:19,430
steam baths,

41

They're all over there.

43

How thoughtful of you!

44
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,210
Shouldn't we all

45
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:25,700
get a membership card?

46
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:27,680
Yes!

47
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,150
In my salon,

48
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:30,320
there are no membership cards,

49
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,210
no hard selling,

50
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,040
and no deception.

51
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,650
I just sell a variety of

52
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,950

53

Five jars make one session.

54

get one for free.

56
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:40,910

Me! Me!

58
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:43,270
Look. Look.

59
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:44,210
I want two sessions.

60
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:44,670
Boss,

61
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,110
I'll try it here

62
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:46,910
in the salon today.

63
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,910
I want to try, too!

64
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,280
Quiet. Quiet.

65
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:52,380
You have different skin types,

66
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,810
so you need different creams.

67
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,410
Let me introduce them to you.

68
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:55,930
This one

69
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:59,620
is called Jade Powder.

70
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:01,660
It can brighten your skin

71
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,420
and reduce wrinkles.

72
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,110
Who wants to try it?

73
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,350
Me! Me!

74
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:06,540
Don't grab.

75
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,280
And

76
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:08,750
this one

77
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:10,760
is called Seven White Cream.

78
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:11,850
Smell it. Smell it.

79
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:13,790
It smells great.

80
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:14,390
This one

81
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:16,070
can relieve dry skin

82
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,060
and brighten dull skin.

83
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:17,710
Who wants to try it?

84
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:18,790
Me! Me!

85
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:20,380
-Brighten dull skin.
-Okay.

86
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:20,970
This one

87
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,840
has an amazing name.

88
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:26,410
It's called Fairy Powder.

89
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,300
If you have acne

90
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,300
or pimples,

91
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,709
this cream

92
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:32,750
is a good treatment.

93
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,180
Using it for days

94
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:36,430
can make your skin smooth

95
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:37,150
and glowy.

96
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:38,230
Who wants to try it?

97
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,510
Me! Me!

98
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:40,670
Ms. Yan.

99
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:41,950
Is there a product

100
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,140
for hair loss?

101
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,490
After giving birth,

102
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,640
I've been suffering

103
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:47,150
from hair loss.

104
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:47,950
Madam,

105
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,080
you just came to the right place.

106
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:51,430
This

107
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:54,960
is specially formulated Hair Growth Cream.

108
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,390
It contains Milkvetch Root,

109
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:58,960
Taiwan Angelica Root,

110
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,220
and Chinese Angelica.

111
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:01,590
Bring it home

112
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,590
and apply it to your scalp for two hours every day.

113
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:04,740
After a few days,

114
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:06,630
you'll see a miracle.

115
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:08,790
-I want one!
-I want one!

116
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:10,990
Calm down. Calm down.

117
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:11,940
Listen.

118
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:13,620
Everyone, line up before me

119
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:15,030
for a purchase number.

120
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,520
You can all get a number.

121
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:17,950
My stock is adequate.

122
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,110
Take your time.

123
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:20,110
Take your time.

124
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:20,960
Here you are.

125
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,050
Here you are.

126
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:35,630
My lord.

127
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,390
The odds

128
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:38,390
are impossible,

129
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,630
but it's just happened.

130
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:40,750
Yong'an Teahouse

131
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,780
has been our observation post.

132
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:44,580
The scout

133
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,310
has been keeping an eye out

134
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:47,310
for Cao Wenquan.

135
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:48,930
Unexpectedly, he noticed that

136
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:50,350
Ms. Yan opened a store here.

137
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,800
The scout found it suspicious

138
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,840
and reported it.

139
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:54,840
What's suspicious?

140
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:55,670
How about

141
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:58,210
letting him report to you directly?

142
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,590
Come in.

143
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:02,670
My lord.

144
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,740
Tell Mr. Jiang

145
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,590
everything you've noticed.

146
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:07,510
Yes.

147
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:08,630
My lord.

148
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,520
The new beauty salon

149
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,790
is called Blossom Beauty.

150
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:13,390
Something's weird about it.

151
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:17,870
Just a beauty salon. What's weird?

152
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,710
The owner of Blossom Beauty

153
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:20,670
is Yan Nanxing.

154
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:21,510
My lord,

155
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:22,870
have you forgotten her?

156
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:23,730
She was the girl

157
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:24,740
who took you hostage

158
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,540
a few days ago.

159
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,930
Mr. Jiang definitely remembers her.

160
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:29,070
Go on.

161
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,050
We looked into that girl.

162
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,320
She used to be a traveling doctor

163
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:35,580
and came here from Heman not long ago.

164
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,750
She came from Heman,

165
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:37,620
went to the Ghost Market,

166
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:38,820
and held you hostage.

167
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:39,380
My lord,

168
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:41,080
that's already odd enough.

169
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,190
You did well.

170
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,140
Since we can't find out how Zornia came into the city,

171
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:57,100
we indeed should look into those

172
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,500
who are suspicious and new in town.

173
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,640
However,

174
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,270
she has nothing to do with Zornia.

175
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,330
Stop watching her.

176
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:07,300
Yes.

177
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,550
My lord,

178
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,510
you asked me to find out

179
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:18,640
where Ms. Yan lived.

180
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:20,210
Have you visited her?

181
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,670
How come you didn't even know

182
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:23,140
she opened a beauty salon?

183
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:25,000
Did you two fight again?

184
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:26,790
How about

185
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:28,190
I invite her out

186
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:30,350
for dinner

187
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,380
to extend our hospitality?

188
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:35,340
Yao Qianshu.

189
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,040
Don't you have

190
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,170
anything else to do?

191
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:40,380
In the future,

192
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,910
don't bother me with things

193
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:44,010
that are unrelated to Zornia again.

194
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:46,510
Take it.

195
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:47,190
Yes.

196
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:51,890
My lord,

197
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:53,230
stop pretending.

198
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,640
You actually really want

199
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,100
to make up with her.

200
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,570
Pat gently like this.

201
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,960
Tap and pat.

202
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,770
Then it's absorbed.

203
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:06,750
The difference is so big!

204
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:08,750
Look.

205
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,580
Let me see.

206
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,290
Whose hand is this?

207
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:12,710
So smooth.

208
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,370
Glad you like it.

209
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:16,120
Ms. Yan,

210
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:18,070
your aunt said you're a rookie.

211
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:19,950
She was definitely being modest.

212
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:21,800
Ms. Yan,

213
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,930
I'm sure your business

214
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:24,460
will get better and better.

215
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:25,750
You need to hire help.

216
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,060
I can introduce someone to you for free.

217
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:28,950
But can you

218
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:31,150
give me a discount on this?

219
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:33,470
Well, Mrs. Bao,

220
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:34,520
you didn't

221
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:35,970
give me a discount on the rent.

222
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:37,350
I'm selling creams like this

223
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,310
to pay you the rent.

224
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:40,300
Am I right?

225
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,030
As a businesswoman,

226
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,549
you excel in this trade.

227
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:46,030
Fine.

228
00:08:46,049 --> 00:08:46,980
I believe in you.

229
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:48,190
I'll buy it despite the price.

230
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:49,390
Here you are.

231
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,309
This one is for me.

232
00:08:50,309 --> 00:08:50,830
I want one too.

233
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:51,549
I want one too.

234
00:08:51,549 --> 00:08:52,190
Really?

235
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:53,090
Me too.

236
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,840
I'm out of stock here.

237
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,770
I'll get one for you from upstairs.

238
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:57,930
Wait a minute.

239
00:08:58,190 --> 00:08:58,790
Look.

240
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:22,630
There he is again.

241
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,200
He's everywhere.

242
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:36,380
How did Jiang Xinbai

243
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,570
recognize me?

244
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:41,200
Am I wrong?

245
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:43,440
Oh no.

246
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:46,090
No matter what,

247
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:47,340
I have to get back

248
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,880
my sketchbook immediately.

249
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,480
He can't discover my secret.

250
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:37,150
Luckily, at Heman, Jiang Xinbai wrote me

251
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,640
his address and I took a look at it

252
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,950
before tearing it up.

253
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,660
As the chief constable

00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,060
and the Duke of Yuejiang,

255
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:45,650
he actually doesn't have any servants.

256
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:47,570
Jiang Xinbai,

257
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:48,750
you must be hiding

258
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,830
some dark secrets.

259
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,040
Oh my,

260
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,250
his place is so tidy.

261
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:19,050
The guy

262
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:20,850
is either a neat freak

263
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,760
or a pervert.

Yan Nanxing.

265
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,740
Jiang Xinbai,

266

why didn't you

267
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:21,770
remove my mask?

268
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,360
Why didn't you blow my cover?

269
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:28,190
You knew if you removed my mask

270
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,920
but couldn't recognize me,

271
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,380
you'd prove me right.

272

Jiang Xinbai.

Mrs. Cheng.

You came too.

00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,240
I'm waiting in line.

280
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:03,530
Get a number for me.

00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:04,930
Tell me when it's my turn.

282
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:07,340
Jinwu Guards?

283
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,150
Yeah.

284
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:12,430
The Inspection Office and Jinwu Guards

285
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,270
have always been at odds.

286
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:15,790
I heard that a few days ago,

287
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:16,810
they even

288
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:19,270

I heard about that too.

291
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:26,540
So,

292
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:28,970
the Inspection Office doesn't want

293
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:30,270
Jinwu Guards to get anything on them,

294
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:30,930
right?

How can anyone

get anything on the Inspection Office?

297
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,180
If one is to dig up dirt,

298
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:37,350
it should be dirt on Jinwu Guards.

299
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:38,750
They

to Jinwu Guards

307

from you, right?

309
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,330
Go to Twelve Music House.

310

I heard that

when Jinwu Guards

312
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,300

he must've made acquaintances.

00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:08,270
Life is about

357
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:09,950
trying different things.

358
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:10,750
Fine.

359
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,290
You'll replace me later.

360
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:13,490
Can you play the pipa?

361
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:14,700
No.

362
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:15,710
It's okay.

363
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:16,610
Few people come here

364
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:17,890
to listen to music.

365
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:19,570
Just casually pluck the strings

366
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:20,900
to keep up appearances.

367
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,140
Go get changed.

368
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:22,970
Thank you.

369
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,030
Miss.

370
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:30,350
Your outfit

371
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,810
is so beautiful.

372
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:33,960
This is the traditional dress

373
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,510
girls from border tribes wear for prayer dances.

374
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:37,310
Prayer dance?

375
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:38,980
It's popular here?

376
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:39,870
No.

377
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:41,580
A customer likes that kind of dance.

378
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:42,860
I'm dancing especially for him.

379
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:43,540
Who's it?

380
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:46,790
Shang Bieli, the commander-in-chief of Jinwu Guards.

381
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:48,740
Every time he comes, he asks me to dress like this

382
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,310
and dance behind sheer curtains.

383
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:51,530
He never asks to meet me

384
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:52,990
but is generous with tips.

385
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,300
Sounds like a good job.

386
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:58,380
Mr. Shang is surly

387
00:16:58,920 --> 00:16:59,720
and scary.

388
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:01,510
I gotta go.

389
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,790
He'll be angry if I'm late.

390
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,030
Does Mr. Shang

391
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:12,070
have some special fetishes?

392
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:37,119
Before Gaya's tribe

393
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,790
fights with their enemies,

394
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:40,140
she also gets dressed like this

395
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,600
to cheer for the warriors.

396
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:42,910
I was attracted by her

397
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:44,150
at first sight.

398
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:53,470
Gaya.

399
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:55,110
Gaya?

400
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:01,950
Gaya?

401
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:14,270
Gaya.

402
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:17,960
So Shang Bieli

403
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:19,720
has a secret crush on Lady Gaya?

404
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,550
Does he know Gaya's death

405
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:29,310
was related to Jiang Xinbai?

406
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:31,890
Is that the reason why Shang Bieli

407
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:32,920
made things hard

408
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,980
for Jiang Xinbai at the Ghost Market?

409
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,490
Does he know

410
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:38,650
Gaya was involved in the Zornia case?

411
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:40,480
Seems that the Inspection Office

412
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,340
is on bad terms with Jinwu Guards,

413
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:44,720
and Shang Bieli has a personal feud

414
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:46,790
with Jiang Xinbai.

415
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,400
Miss, where have you been?

416
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:52,460
I've been looking for you.

417
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,160
Go get changed.

418
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,310
We're next.

419
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:17,390
[Twelve Music House]

420
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:44,210
This way, please.

421
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,040
I know you have a keen nose.

422
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,460
Fortunately, I'm prepared.

423
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,190
I used the same rouge and perfume

424
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:12,110
as the other dancers.

425
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:19,870
Yan Nanxing.

426
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:27,270
Recognizing me doesn't mean

427
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,310
you don't have face blindness.

428
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,820
It must be the herbal smell on me

429
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,150
that distinguishes me

430
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:34,480
from the other dancers.

431
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,670
I was surprised

432
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:39,540
to see you among those sultry dancers.

433
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,360
You admit it?

434
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:44,470
Admit what?

435
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:46,090
You didn't deny it,

436
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,500
so I'll take it as a "yes."

437
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:50,640
Yan Nanxing.

438
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:52,230
You shouldn't

439
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:53,350
be here.

440
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:55,220
You're reckless.

441
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:57,030
If something happens,

442
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:58,990
I can't guarantee

443
00:20:58,990 --> 00:20:59,790
I can save you.

444
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:02,170
I don't need you to save me.

445
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:06,910
Tell me.

446
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:08,880
You invited me

447
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:11,550
to the place where Jinwu Guards gather.

448
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:12,820
What do you want?

449
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:16,880
Return my sketchbook.

450
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:19,750
You went to my house that night?

451
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:20,300
Yes.

452
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:21,580
I did.

453
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,190
You didn't remove my mask,

454
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:25,420
which confirms that

455
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,580
you have face blindness.

456
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,050
Give it to me.

457
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:36,190
Or I'll reveal your secret

458
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:37,030
in front of

459
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:38,470
those Jinwu Guards.

460
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:39,930
You'll be in a tight spot.

461
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:42,440
Yan Nanxing.

462
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:44,260
I never planned

463
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:45,690
to keep your sketchbook.

464
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:47,610
That night,

465
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:49,320
after I left your place,

466
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,800
I thought it over.

467
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:54,870
I thought I was caring for you,

468
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:57,420
but it only led to misunderstandings.

469
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:03,790
So?

470
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:05,070
So,

471
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:06,430
tomorrow,

472
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,930
come to the Inspection Office to get it yourself.

473
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:11,950
No.

474
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:14,550
If it's a trap and I fall into it,

475
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,080
I'll be fish in a barrel.

476
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:17,790
I don't trust you.

477
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:21,710
Then I'll send it to Blossom Beauty.

478
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:22,440
Will that do?

479
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:23,670
That's even worse.

480
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:25,310
I run a business there.

481
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:26,750
You're the chief constable.

482
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,150
Your presence in my salon

483
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,460
will have a bad impact.

484
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:32,890
Then what is your advice?

485
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:35,110
My advice?

486
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:38,630
If you're sincere,

487
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,890
you should bring it to me tonight.

488
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:45,170
I don't want to

489
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:46,830
bring such an important thing

490
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,840
to Jinwu Guards' turf.

491
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,550
Zornia.

492
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,790
You smell like Zornia.

493
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:08,970
It's fine.

494
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:09,730
He's drunk.

495
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,480
Go. Go.

496
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:11,440
Go do your thing.

497
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:17,700
She smells like Zornia.

498
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,270
People who touch Zornia

499
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,050
will become lethargic.

500
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:25,470
She looks just fine.

501
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:29,510
She came down from the 2nd floor.

502
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:30,530
Could it be that

503
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:32,760
someone's hidden Zornia

504
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:34,430
in a room on the second floor?

505
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:35,510
She went there

506
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:37,720
and got its smell on her.

507
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:44,510
Someone actually dares

508
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:46,110
to hide Zornia under the nose

509
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:47,440
of the chief constable.

510
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,250
How audacious…

511
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,350
Who are you?

512
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:03,470
Sorry.

513
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,420
Wrong room.

514
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,320
Sorry.

515
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:30,600
How's it?

516
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:31,890
Find anything?

517
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:36,300
It surprises me

518
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,030
that they used such a secretive method

519
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:39,160
to avoid attention.

520
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:44,710
It seems that

521
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:47,390
the confiscation of the Zornia at Heman

522
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,740
led to a shortage of it in the capital.

523
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:50,760
So,

524
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:53,990
they used another way to transport Zornia.

525
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:55,730
It's more complicated,

526
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,150
but at least

527
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:59,320
the supply is maintained for now.

528
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:00,050
Besides,

529
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:02,510
it's more secretive.

530
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:09,290
I've long heard that Shang Bieli's got his hands dirty,

531
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:10,820
taking a cut of all business

532
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:11,790
and allowing

533
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:13,550
his subordinates

534
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,520
to get involved with Zornia.

535
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:19,230
Keep your voice down.

536
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:20,430
Shang Bieli

537
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:22,370
is on the second floor.

538
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,550
Mr. Jiang!

539
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:44,870
Mr. Jiang, you're abstinent from worldly pleasures.

540
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:45,590
You usually

541
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,510
don't come to places like this.

542
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,230
What brought you…

543
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:56,400
You're meeting with a pretty girl.

544
00:26:58,550 --> 00:26:59,610
It makes sense now.

545
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:10,030
She looks so familiar.

546
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:18,090
Is she the one who took you hostage

547
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:19,690
at the Ghost Market that day?

548
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:23,660
Mr. Jiang,

549
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:25,020
you don't mind dying

550
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:27,830
as long as it's for a pretty girl, right?

551
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:29,890
What can I do for you today?

552
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,720
Mr. Shang.

553
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:39,550
What's wrong?

554
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:41,470
Are you afraid of my coming?

555
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:44,580
I am afraid.

556
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:47,850
I'm afraid I can't help

557
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:49,740
but kill you.

558
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:54,780
Kill me?

559
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,850
Okay.

560
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,800
But I doubt

561
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,550
you're capable of that.

562
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,750
Then let's find out

563
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:14,250
if I'm capable of that or not.

564
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:48,640
You...

565
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:49,890
Shut up.

566
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:52,190
Only kids fight.

567
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,390
So impulsive.

568
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,790
This place is luxurious.

569
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:55,790
Everything here looks expensive.

570
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:56,440
What if you break something

571
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,270
and have to pay?

572
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:59,020
You're still in debt to me!

573
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,430
No fighting.

574
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:06,190
Mr. Shang.

575
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:07,110
Mr. Shang.

576
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:08,710
I'm really sorry.

577
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:09,670
Well,

578
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:11,110
I intervened

579
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:14,290
to save you from being bullied by him.

580
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,510
The thing

581
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:16,170
on his waist

582
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,390
may be a hidden weapon.

583
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:18,790
Don't fall into his trap.

584
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:24,750
Who on earth are you?

585
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:26,710
I

586
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,190
run Blossom Beauty.

587
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:29,320
I'm Yan Nanxing.

588
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:33,810
You're the owner of Blossom Beauty?

589
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:36,230
It's gained a lot of fame lately.

590
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:37,750
You flatter me.

591
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:40,730
It's all thanks to the help of Jinwu Guards.

592
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:42,900
My help?

593
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:46,160
Aren't you with him?

594
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:48,220
How is that possible?

595
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:49,890
We barely know each other.

596
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:51,530
I detest him.

597
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:53,950
By the way,

598
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:55,640
I've been thinking about

599
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,590
treating you to dinner.

600
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:57,830
But I'm busy today.

601
00:29:57,990 --> 00:29:58,790
Another time,

602
00:29:58,870 --> 00:29:59,670
another time,

603
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:01,530
I'll make a formal apology to you.

604
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:03,180
What?

605
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:04,610
Let go of me.

606
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:06,510
Shang Bieli.

607
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:08,040
I'm warning you.

608
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,970
The duty of Jinwu Guards

609
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:11,790
is to protect the capital

610
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:13,350
and keep the people safe.

611
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:15,550
Please show some self-discipline.

612
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:17,150
Don't disappoint His Majesty

613
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:18,230
and the people.

614
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,340
He's drunk.

615
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,270
Ignore him.

616
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,470
What are you talking about?

617
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:24,790
How could you be so rude to Mr. Shang?

618
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:25,470
Go home now.

619
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:25,950
I'm drunk?

620
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:27,310
Go home and reflect on yourself.

621
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:28,190
I'll treat you to dinner next time.

622
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:28,830
I'll treat you to dinner.

623
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:29,830
Drunk? Me?

624
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:30,750
Who's drunk?

625
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:31,390
You're drunk.

626
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:32,230
He's drunk.

627
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:33,570
Shut up. Let's go.

628
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:39,550
Wait for me.

629
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,010
I meant well.

630
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,420
I helped you a lot.

631
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:45,830
You should thank me.

632
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:46,890
Without me,

633
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:49,010
could you have gotten out so quickly?

634
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:50,590
Why are you silent?

635
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,150
Are you angry?

636
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:54,410
You feel embarrassed?

637
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:57,590
Are you really angry?

638
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:03,350
No.

639
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,780
Then why didn't you say anything?

640
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:07,550
I want to

641
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:09,070
thank you.

642
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,800
Thank me?

643
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:13,360
For what?

644
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,030
Today,

645
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:16,600
if you hadn't

646
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:18,690
invited me to Twelve Music House,

647
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:19,590
I wouldn't have found

648
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:20,920
such an important clue.

649
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:23,910
This time,

650
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:25,510
you did me a favor.

651
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:27,000
I owe you one.

652
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:28,290
I'll repay you.

653
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:28,870
Good.

654
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:30,430
I'll hold you to that.

655
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:32,060
You must

656
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,680
repay me properly.

657
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:36,980
Sure.

658
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:39,550
I want you…

659
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:42,810
to find someone for me.

660
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:45,700
No problem.

661
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:48,090
You agreed?

662
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:50,670
I'll tell you

663
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:52,510
about the details later.

664
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:53,870
But

665
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:55,310
you still have to

666
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:57,550
have my sketchbook delivered to me.

667
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,520
I'm leaving.

668
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:02,190
Wash your hair.

669
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,600
My hair?

670
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:32,410
That woman forced Jiang Xinbai

671
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:33,600
into that room,

672
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:37,360
but he escorted that woman out.

673
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:42,660
Who on earth is that woman?

674
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:44,680
What makes her special?

675
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:45,950
Be careful!

676
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:47,390
Be careful, Ruoqian.

677
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,220
Be careful, Ruoqian.

678
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:05,310
-It's you.
-It's you.

679
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:06,950
Miss,

680
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:08,420
we meet again.

681
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:14,810
Why did you fall from up there?

682
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:16,260
This kitten,

683
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:17,710
she went up the tree

684
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,170
and got stuck there.

685
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:20,990
I went up to save her,

686
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:22,800
but I slipped and fell down.

687
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:23,920
Are you okay?

688
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:25,630
Fortunately,

689
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:27,520
your carriage saved us.

690
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:29,250
I'm asking the kitten.

691
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:34,720
Looks like

692
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:36,500
I broke your carriage.

693
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:39,130
Your carriage must be expensive.

694
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,400
What do you think?

695
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:44,850
But for the sake of the kitten,

696
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:46,190
I'll let it slide.

697
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:48,770
Consider it as repaying your favor at the Ghost Market.

698
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:50,700
I have no money to pay for it anyway.

699
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,420
I'll just give you a flower

700
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:54,830
for the cat as compensation.

701
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:58,610
Why are you giving me a flower?

702
00:33:58,670 --> 00:33:59,480
Because women

703
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:02,050
are like flowers that will wither eventually?

704
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:02,890
Of course not.

705
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:04,590
This kind of flower

706
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:05,790
represents good luck.

707
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:07,230
I wish you all the best.

708
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:17,390
Brat.

709
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:18,510
How dare you!

710
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:19,670
Come out!

711
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:21,989
Miss,

712
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:23,080
I'll take my leave.

713
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:27,850
Ruoqian.

714
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:29,070
Here.

715
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:30,409
Here's the kitten.

716
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:32,469
Thank you, Ruoqian.

717
00:34:32,469 --> 00:34:33,150
Thank you.

718
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:35,190
Hold it. Don't let her run away.

719
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,429
Ruoqian, you're amazing.

720
00:34:39,429 --> 00:34:40,489
What a good kitten.

721
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:01,670
Dad.

722
00:35:01,989 --> 00:35:02,429
Mom.

723
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:03,389
I'm back.

724
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:04,469
Welcome home.

725
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:06,270
Why are you back so late?

726
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,030
I read in a bookstore

727
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:09,420
for the whole afternoon.

728
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:10,410
On my way back,

729
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:11,760
I played with some kids.

730
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,170
I'll heat up some food for you.

731
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,720
I'll help Dad finish the work

732
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,450
before I eat.

733
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:26,970
Qian.

734
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:28,780
We're slaves.

735
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,450
Smithing is our family trade.

736
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:32,110
You need to be down-to-earth.

737
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:34,500
Stop having dreams

738
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,960
that will never come true.

739
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,150
Yes.

740
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:39,390
Ruoqian,

741
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:40,910
your dad is right.

742
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:43,780
You've been admitted to the Imperial Academy,

743
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:45,630
[Mrs. Liu]

744
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:45,860
but we can't afford the tuition.

745
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,340
I'll work part-time

746
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:49,610
to pay my tuition.

747
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,390
Even if you go to the Imperial Academy,

748
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:55,210
we're still slaves.

749
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:57,070
[Mr. Liu]

750
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:56,970
You can't be an official.

751
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,420
Why waste your time?

752
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:01,210
Even if I can't be an official,

753
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:02,390
I can still be a scholar

754
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:03,720
and become respectful.

755
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:05,050
Even if I'm a slave,

756
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:06,610
I can still be successful.

757
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:08,440
Since I'm the first slave

758
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:10,220
to get into the Imperial Academy,

759
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:10,820
in the future,

760
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:12,080
I can be the first slave

761
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:14,210
to get out of slavery with knowledge.

762
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,780
Liu Ruoqian worked for Cao Wenquan

763
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:21,410
as his accountant for a year.

764
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:22,720
He's the first slave

765
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:25,120
to get into the Imperial Academy in this dynasty.

766
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,320
Why is he suspicious?

767
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:28,670
On the night we went to the Ghost Market,

768
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:30,570
Liu Ruoqian resigned.

769
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,760
Right before the lockdown,

770
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:34,520
he left the Ghost Market.

771
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:36,310
He happened to leave

772
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,510
when Cao Wenquan

773
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:38,670
got into trouble.

774
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:40,180
He was either

775
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:41,060
tipped off

776
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:42,540
or given instructions

777
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:43,780
by Cao Wenquan.

778
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:45,480
What do you think, my lord?

779
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,470
But Cao Wenquan

780
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:48,620
didn't know we'd lock down the Market.

781
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:49,500
Right.

782
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:51,690
Hope it's just a coincidence.

783
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:54,910
Look into him carefully.

784
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:56,100
Don't wrongly accuse

785
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:56,960
a talented man.

786
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:58,710
Yes, my lord.

787
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:02,990
My lord.

788
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,700
I heard Jinwu Guards on patrol

789
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:06,860
say mockingly that

790
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,290
you went

791
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:09,600
to Twelve Music House last night

792
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,680
and almost fought with Shang Bieli again.

793
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,190
Ms. Yan

794
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:14,120
stopped it with a basket of greens.

795
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:15,310
What happened?

796
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:17,280
Who did they mock?

797
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:18,460
Yan Nanxing?

798
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:20,550
My lord,

799
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,120
your first reaction

800
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:23,280
is to defend Ms. Yan.

801
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:24,950
They didn't mock her.

802
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:26,080
They mocked you.

803
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:29,150
Have you

804
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:30,720
made up with her?

805
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:32,120
Go investigate.

806
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:32,990
Yes,

807
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:34,320
my lord.

808
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:43,590
[Blossom Beauty needs a diligent salesgirl]

00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:51,990
Let me see.

811
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:54,350
Recruitment notice.

812
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:56,020
Blossom Beauty needs a salesgirl

813
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:57,450
who's smart, hardworking,

814
00:37:57,450 --> 00:37:58,580
and communicative.

815
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:00,350
You can do it.

816
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:02,230
We can do it too.

817
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:03,630
Me too.

818
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,630
She also needs to know medicine.

819
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:06,290
Do you know?

820
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:08,130
What about you?

821
00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:09,270
No.

822
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:11,390
This is hard.

823
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:14,540
Ms. Yan is out.

824
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:15,540
Ms. Yan!

825
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:16,870
When do you open?

826
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:18,470
Everything is ready.

827
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:19,150
Everyone,

828
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:20,050
please come in.

This recruitment notice…

831
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,430
Thanks to your love

832
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:26,540
for my salon,

833
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:27,630
business is booming.

834
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:28,490
I can't

835
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:29,500
do all the work alone.

836
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,150
So,

837
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,040
I want to hire someone to help me.

838
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:33,210
If you have anyone in mind,

839
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:34,340
introduce her to me.

840
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:35,830
The wages I offer

841
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:37,600
are higher than average.

842
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:39,690
Stop talking. Let's go in.

843
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:40,230
Let's go.

844
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:41,790
Welcome, everyone.

845
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:42,670
Be careful.

846
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:44,250
Make yourself at home.

847
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:45,920
Make yourself at home.

848
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:49,280
Mrs. Bao,

849
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:51,380
if you know someone qualified,

850
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:52,510
recommend her to me.

851
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:53,660
I do know someone.

852
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:54,150
Who?

853
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:55,090
Me.

854
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,960
I can't afford to hire you.

855
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:58,750
Besides,

856
00:38:58,830 --> 00:38:59,870
I don't dare let you work,

857
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:00,510
do I?

858
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,270
Ms. Yan,

859
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:04,290
Blossom Beauty is the first

860
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:06,070
beauty salon in the capital.

861
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:07,710
As the saying goes,

862
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:09,160
the first to try something new

863
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,710
is the bravest.

864
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:13,310
But inevitably,

865
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:14,150
some people

866
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:15,580
are prejudiced against you.

867
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:16,780
Look at those people.

868
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:18,190
They definitely think

869
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:19,790
this is not a legit business.

870
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:23,350
Moreover,

871
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:25,550
it's inappropriate for a girl

872
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:27,030
to leave home for work.

873
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:28,970
So if you want to hire help…

874
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:30,590
Mrs. Bao.

875
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:32,050
There's suddenly

876
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:33,710
a new wrinkle around your eye.

877
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:35,410
It came out again?

878
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:37,350
Why didn't anyone tell me?

879
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:38,040
Hurry.

880
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:40,470
Help her remove it.

881
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:42,070
Gosh. Poor you. A new wrinkle.

882
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:43,150
You deserve it.

883
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:56,550
Mr. Jiang.

884
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,260
Are you out early to catch criminals?

885
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:01,610
I'm here to see you.

886
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:03,370
Am I in trouble?

887
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:07,110
You helped me last night,

888
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:08,910
so I came to repay you.

889
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:12,130
You said you wanted to look for someone.

890
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:12,940
Who's it?

891
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:15,700
Mr. Jiang,

892
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:17,270
you're a man of your word.

893
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:19,890
You came all the way here to return the favor.

894
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:20,830
Tell me the name,

895
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:21,230
age,

896
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:22,630
and facial features.

897
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:23,560
I don't know.

898
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,140
You don't know?

899
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:27,250
I don't know his name

900
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:28,370
or his age.

901
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:30,580
Nor do I know

902
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,710
his address,

903
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:33,000
family, or friends.

904
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:35,950
My intuition says

905
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:37,260
he's still alive.

906
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,930
So I came to the capital to look for him.

907
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:41,670
A man?

908
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:42,750
A man.

909
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:46,600
To be precise,

910
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:49,490
a young man.

911
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:54,650
He's around your age.

912
00:40:56,950 --> 00:40:58,330
He's very important

913
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,320
to you?

914
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:02,420
Very important.

915
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:09,590
But you didn't give me any information.

916
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:10,910
I can't help you.

917
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,300
If you really want to find him,

918
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,330
you have to give me some clues.

919
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,290
The more detailed, the better.

920
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:19,940
But we were little back then.

921
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:22,420
I don't remember anything.

922
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:24,410
You have to remember something.

923
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:26,340
You want to find him,

924
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:28,240
so you have to think harder.

925
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:31,030
He…

926
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:32,950
He…

927
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,510
Forget it. I'll look for him myself.

928
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:36,020
Hello.

929
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,640
Are you the owner of Blossom Beauty?

930
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,310
You're the clerk from the Ghost Market?

931
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:43,840
Yes.

932
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:45,830
I want this job.

933
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,540
My name is Liu Ruoqian.

934
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:48,560
Nice to meet you.

935
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:51,010
Who's this?

936
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:52,160
He's not important.

937
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:54,050
You want this job?

938
00:41:55,570 --> 00:41:56,770
But sorry,

939
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,140
you're not qualified.

940
00:41:58,230 --> 00:41:59,030
Please leave.

941
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,240
I'll come to you if I think of something.

942
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:17,420
Liu Ruoqian?
