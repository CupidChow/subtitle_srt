176
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:28,270
He does?

177
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:30,990
He's just not wearing his uniform today

178
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,990
and is wearing his regular clothes.

179
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,310
But I haven't seen him

180
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:37,240
in regular clothes for a long time.

181
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:39,880
As long as you're willing,

182
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,210
you can see it every day.

183
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,910
Why are you here?

184
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:52,480
Take a guess.

185
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:14,210
Greetings,

186
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,070
Your Majesty.

187
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:17,650
Greetings, Commander Shang.

188
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,240
Greetings, Your Highness.

189
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,640
Today, it can be considered

190
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:22,390
that I invited you two young people,

191
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:24,000
who have mutual affection,

192
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,160
to have a gathering.

193
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:27,150
Commander Shang, don't stand on ceremony.

194
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,280
Please, take a seat.

195
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:29,950
Yes.

196
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:56,750
I'm tired.

197
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,650
I'm going back to take a nap.

198
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:00,710
Commander Shang,

199
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:03,810
County Princess Zhouyang is a master of the qin.

200
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:04,950
Don't let her kindness

201
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,230
go to waste.

202
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:08,390
Your Majesty,

203
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:09,270
I have something to discuss

204
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:10,070
about Suoluo.

205
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:11,060
Today, there's nothing

206
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,270
more important than accompanying

207
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:13,670
County Princess Zhouyang.

208
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:14,400
Other things

209
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:15,930
can wait for another time.

210
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:18,830
Yes.

211
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,210
Commander Shang, please.

212
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:49,480
Take care.

213
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:50,110
Thank you.

214
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:57,190
You're here.

215
00:13:58,870 --> 00:13:59,910
Where is Sai'er?

216
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:01,200
Sai'er?

217
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:03,800
You are looking for Sai'er?

218
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:05,830
I'm looking for her to talk about

219
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:07,760
something related to Shang Bieli.

220
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:09,070
Shang Bieli?

221
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:13,550
Mr. Jiang.

222
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:15,310
Boss.

223
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,780
You're looking for me?

224
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:20,590
Yes.

225
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,990
I'm looking for you.

226
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,990
Are you saying Shang Bieli is going on...

227
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:36,470
A blind date?

228
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:48,110
It turns out

229
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:49,570
he dressed so nicely today

230
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:51,070
for a blind date.

231
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:57,670
Mr. Jiang,

232
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:58,310
will...

233
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:00,670
Will Shang

234
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,540
be interested in County Princess Zhouyang?

235
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,430
I heard that County Princess Zhouyang

236
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:08,510
has been admiring Commander Shang for a long time.

237
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:09,150
Moreover,

238
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:11,560
the Empress intends to match them.

239
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:14,250
I really can't think of any reason

240
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:17,000
why Commander Shang would refuse her.

241
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:19,290
Well,

242
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:21,830
it's most likely that they'll be together.

243
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:24,200
Looks like he's getting married.

244
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:26,230
Wait.

245
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,910
Weren't we just talking about

246
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:28,950
a blind date?

247
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:31,250
How did it suddenly become a wedding?

248
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:32,510
Things have changed.

249
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:32,910
Right.

250
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:34,190
Since this is a blind date,

251
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:35,960
if it works, they will be together.

252
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,710
Yes.

253
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:40,110
And the Empress strongly supports the match.

254
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:42,370
It's difficult to defy imperial orders.

255
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:44,510
It's a tough nut to crack.

256
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:49,730
It's such a big matter,

257
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:50,820
and he didn't even tell me.

258
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:51,960
That's impossible.

259
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:52,990
He told me things.

260
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:55,140
He said he couldn't find you recently.

261
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:55,710
I...

262
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:01,030
I can't explain it to you guys.

263
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:02,320
If you can't explain it to us,

264
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,510
just explain it to him.

265
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:04,030
Yes.

266
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:05,390
If you don't explain,

267
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:06,630
he won't understand.

268
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,460
Go now.

269
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,360
Go find him.

270
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:13,450
It's too late.

271
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:15,590
It's all too late.

272
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:19,550
Sai'er.

273
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:20,500
Don't chase her.

274
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,810
Shang Bielie will find her.

275
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,350
No matter how it unfolds,

276
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:27,030
I believe in the end,

277
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:28,390
they will surely understand

278
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:29,790
each other's feelings.

279
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:32,310
However...

280
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:34,720
Given Commander Shang's personality,

281
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,270
if he doesn't like the girl,

282
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:38,190
he wouldn't have gone there, right?

283
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:39,470
I think Shang Bieli

284
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:41,720
planned to take this opportunity to enter the palace

285
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,550
to see if he can plead for Suoluo

286
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:45,290
and postpone the wedding.

287
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:48,590
What?

288
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:52,950
I see.

289
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:56,770
You guys continue.

290
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,350
I'll get back to work.

291
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:00,310
Okay.

292
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:01,260
Get back to work.

293
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:07,390
Why did you bring that up?

294
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:09,150
What's wrong?

295
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:10,430
What's wrong?

296
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,200
You are such a failure

297
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:14,480
as an older brother.

298
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:15,750
What?

299
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:16,390
How...

300
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:18,790
How am I a failure?

301
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:27,589
Commander Shang,

302
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:28,470
I…

303
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,340
Your Highness,

304
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:31,080
please listen to me.

305
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,470
You are beautiful and intelligent.

306
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:39,120
You will definitely find a good match.

307
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,870
Am I not good enough?

308
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:43,630
No.

309
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:46,640
It's my problem.

310
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:49,430
What problem?

311
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:53,040
I have already set my heart on someone.

312
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:55,990
But before,

313
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:57,710
I never heard

314
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:58,970
that you were engaged.

315
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,440
We're not engaged.

316
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:05,120
And there's no commitment between us.

317
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:06,030
Does she...

318
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,700
have feelings for you?

319
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:13,750
Does she know

320
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:16,420
that you have feelings for her?

321
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:21,720
Then why don't you tell her?

322
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:31,570
She calls herself a country girl.

323
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:34,040
She feels she doesn't deserve me.

324
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:38,500
But it's actually me who doesn't deserve her.

325
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,630
I often ask myself:

326
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,000
She's so pure and kind-hearted.

327
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:44,470
Will she accept the real me?

328
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:47,310
Will I hurt her?

329
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:50,510
So, are you just going to

330
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:52,040
give her up to someone else?

331
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:52,990
No.

332
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:56,340
In the days apart from her,

333
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,800
I have thought it through.

334
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:01,890
Although I have many shortcomings,

335
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,950
I still want to be good to her,

336
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:06,360
protect her,

337
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:08,360
take care of her,

338
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,460
become better for her,

339
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:13,070
and make her

340
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:16,320
the happiest girl in the world.

341
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:22,550
It seems

342
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:25,350
I really have no chance.

343
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,350
Commander Shang,

344
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:30,750
I have a request.

345
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,350
Can you let me

346
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,120
tell the Empress about this?

347
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:40,870
I will say

348
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:43,240
that it was me who rejected you.

349
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:45,590
After all,

350
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,450
it is very embarrassing

351
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:50,830
for a girl to be rejected by a man.

352
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:51,430
Of course.

353
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,610
Thank you, Your Highness.

354
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:57,430
Please tell that girl

355
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:58,990
that she

356
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,630
is very enviable.

357
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,780
What are you waiting for?

358
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:07,670
Go find her.

359
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:09,620
Go tell her.

360
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:11,480
Tell her your feelings.

361
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:13,510
Go.

362
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:18,150
Go now!

363
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:20,670
Thank you.

364
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:24,660
Take care.

365
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:26,010
Please come again.

366
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:30,880
Where is Sai'er?

367
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:32,310
I need to make it clear with her.

368
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:33,070
She's not here.

369
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:34,190
She heard from Mr. Jiang

370
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:35,640
that you were going to the palace for a blind date,

371
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,500
and she ran out.

372
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:39,150
What nonsense did Jiang Xinbai say?

373
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,090
Where did Sai'er go?

374
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:42,910
Sai'er...

375
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:44,750
Just now, she was

376
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,110
repeatedly mumbling

377
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:47,040
"Shang is gone."

378
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,140
And

379
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,960
I saw her crying very sadly.

380
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:51,230
She might

381
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:53,230
have gone back to Miaojiang.

382
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:55,430
Sai'er.

383
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:56,670
Sai'er!

384
00:21:59,430 --> 00:21:59,950
Sai'er!

385
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,950
Where are you going?

386
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,390
Why did you come to me?

387
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:03,870
Aren't you supposed to

388
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:05,270
go on a blind date with someone else?

389
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:06,130
Let me explain!

390
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:07,030
No!

391
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:10,590
Sai'er!

392
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:41,720
Are you alright?

393
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:42,640
I'm fine.

394
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:44,040
Did you get hurt?

395
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:58,360
Why are you avoiding me?

396
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:00,270
I'm not avoiding you.

397
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:07,550
Is it because

398
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:10,630
you don't want me to marry someone else?

399
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,350
Yes.

400
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:19,390
I don't.

401
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:24,390
Is it because you like me too?

402
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:27,070
But you are my brother.

403
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:27,630
I...

404
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:29,750
I've never wanted to be your brother.

405
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,670
From the day we became sworn brother and sister,

406
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:34,130
I've been very reluctant.

407
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,680
At first, I didn't understand why.

408
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,280
But later I realized

409
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:42,190
it was because I like you.

410
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,230
I want to be with you forever.

411
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:53,570
This is the third piece of peach wood.

412
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:22,590
It's a bit hot.

413
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:26,130
Would you like to try mine?

414
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:28,990
Is it good?

415
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,670
Try mine.

416
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,080
Pretty good.

417
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:42,870
By the way.

418
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:45,310
County Princess Zhouyang

419
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:48,070
asked me to deliver a message to you.

420
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:53,710
What?

421
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:55,640
Are you jealous?

422
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:00,230
I dare not.

423
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:02,490
She is County Princess Zhouyang.

424
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:03,950
So what?

425
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:05,600
Our Tong Sai'er

426
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:06,510
is one of the bosses

427
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:07,570
of Blossom Beauty.

428
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:09,670
You are not worse than anyone.

429
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:10,470
You're right.

430
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:11,950
But

431
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:14,270
I still don't want to hear what she said.

432
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:16,910
You don't want to hear it?

433
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:19,120
Fine, don't listen.

434
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:20,230
What a pity.

435
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:21,030
You...

436
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:25,990
Alright then.

437
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:27,240
Go ahead and tell me.

438
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:28,830
But I must warn you,

439
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:29,910
if I get upset

440
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:30,990
and say something unpleasant,

441
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:32,720
you must also relay that to her.

442
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:35,160
You still allow me to see her?

443
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:35,560
You...

444
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:37,530
Alright.

445
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:38,470
I won't see her.

446
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,620
I was just kidding.

447
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:43,630
She said

448
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:45,860
she envies you.

449
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,850
What does she envy about me?

450
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,080
Probably that you

451
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:54,370
have a brave and mighty

452
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:55,970
yet thoughtful and caring

453
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:57,950
commander-in-chief

454
00:25:58,270 --> 00:25:59,270
by your side.

455
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:03,950
Fine.

456
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:05,670
Let her envy then.

457
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:07,150
I've suffered a lot

458
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:08,960
because of her.

459
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:12,070
Letting her be a bit envious won't hurt.

460
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:14,470
But

461
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,570
I really should thank her.

462
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:19,510
If she hadn't made me realize it,

463
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:20,830
I probably wouldn't have confessed to you

464
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:21,590
so soon.

465
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:23,510
What...

466
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:25,870
did she say to you?

467
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:27,950
She told me

468
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:31,080
to express my feelings to you quickly.

469
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:34,590
Sai'er,

470
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:38,350
during the time without you,

471
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:41,760
I always felt like something was missing.

472
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:44,490
It seems that no one but you

473
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:46,830
can bring me that feeling

474
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:48,510
of happiness,

475
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:50,350
comfort,

476
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:53,190

00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:08,950
Besides,

697
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:11,350
you don't need to be jealous at all.

698
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:13,220
Whether it's now or in the future,

699
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:15,020
nothing will happen between us.

700
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:17,830
Xinbai?

701
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:19,960
Xinbai, what's wrong? Xinbai?

702
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:22,740
Nothing.

703
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:26,010
I suddenly remembered

704
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:27,270
the Inspection Office still has

705
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:29,870
some official business that needs me to deal with.

706
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:30,470
It's okay.

707
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:31,430
I can go home by myself later

708
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:32,350
when I'm done.

709
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:34,870
I'm worried about you being alone.

710
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:37,130
I need to find someone to take care of you.

711
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:38,750
Who are you going to find?

712
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:42,310
Xinbai, you want me to take care of a kid?

713
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:44,230
Suoluo,

714
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:47,310
he is the child of my subordinates.

715
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,710
Both of his parents have gone out of the capital

716
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:50,040
to handle things for me.

717
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,360
So I want to ask you

718
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:53,090
to help me take care of him.

719
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,870
It will be just for a day.

720
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:57,170
Just for tomorrow.

721
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:05,590
Could...

722
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:07,220
Could this child

723
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:08,060
be your...

724
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:11,870
illegitimate child?

725
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:16,330
She said...

726
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:19,150
She said you're my illegitimate child.

727
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:20,790
Do we...

728
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,630
Do we look alike?

729
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:28,580
Why do you think so?

730
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:33,030
Firstly,

731
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,350
you absolutely wouldn't be

732
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:35,390
concerned so much

733
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:37,120
about a subordinate's matter.

734
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:38,110
Secondly,

735
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,290
if you need someone to take care of a child,

736
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:41,890
you should go to Yan Nanxing.

737
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:42,790
Well,

738
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,790
she can be friends with anyone

739
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:44,430
from 8 years old

740
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:45,690
to 80 years old, right?

741
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:47,220
Why did you come to me?

742
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,310
Yan Nanxing has also gone

743
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:50,640
to handle things for me.

744
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:53,630
Are you willing to let her labor for you?

745
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:57,060
Please, Suoluo.

746
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:03,200
This kid must be related to you.

747
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:05,310
-Just stay here and don't leave.
-If Yan Nanxing finds out

748
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:06,550
that I'm hiding your illegitimate child,

749
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:07,190
she will tear down

750
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:08,390
this house of mine.

751
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:12,230
She might even tear down the entire Yuejiang's Residence...

752
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:14,410
Where is he?

753
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:16,150
Sister,

754
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:17,900
I'm not an illegitimate child.

755
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:18,830
Also,

756
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,870
your sister-in-law is beautiful and kind.

757
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:22,600
She won't tear your house down.

758
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:25,780
I haven't said yes.

759
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:52,150
Your Grace,

760
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:54,960
you suffered a head injury a few years ago.

761
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,140
It not only led to face blindness

762
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:57,900
but also to other symptoms.

763
00:38:59,230 --> 00:38:59,790
Yes.

764
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:02,030
You've mentioned this before.

765
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:02,750
Now,

766
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:04,250
it is being confirmed.

767
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:05,670
As time goes by,

768
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:06,440
these symptoms

769
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,900
will gradually manifest.

770
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:10,910
For instance?

771
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:13,190
For instance, your senses may decline,

772
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:15,270
especially hearing and vision.

773
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:16,650
There's also a possibility

774
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:18,600
of blindness and deafness.

775
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:22,030
Your Grace,

776
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:23,830
have you made a decision

777
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:24,450
on the treatment plan

778
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:25,690
I mentioned before?

779
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:30,030
No.

780
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:32,340
Absolutely not.

781
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:34,590
Your life would be in danger.

782
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:36,730
Your Grace, please think it through.

783
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:39,700
Doctor,

784
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:42,070
please

785
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,770
keep this confidential

786
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,450
from my mother for now.
