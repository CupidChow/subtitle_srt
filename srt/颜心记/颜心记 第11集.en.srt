Everyone,

7
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,150
I'm Yan Nanxing,

8
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,730
a newcomer to the capital.

9
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:04,860
Thanks to all of you,

10
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,090
I'm opening a small shop

11
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:07,130
in Ruyi District.

12
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,110
It's called Blossom Beauty.

13
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:10,949
Great! Great!

14
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,120
Everyone's welcome in my shop.

15
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,590
Your advice is also welcome.

Hope my business will thrive,

please come in.

Hello, beauties.

27
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,079
Mrs. Bao.

28
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:47,660
So beautiful.

29
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,860
There's another area over there.

30
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:54,240
Hello, Mrs. Bao.

31
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:55,550
How's it?

32
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,270
Great.

33
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,630
Really? I want one too.

Your salon is great!

38
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,510
There is also

39
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,560
a make-up area,

40

steam baths,

41

They're all over there.

How thoughtful of you!

44
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,210
Shouldn't we all

45
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:15,700
get a membership card?

46
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:17,680
Yes!

47
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,150
In my salon,

48
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:20,320
there are no membership cards,

49
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,210
no hard selling,

50
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:22,040
and no deception.

51
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,650
I just sell a variety of

52
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,950

Five jars make one session.

54

get one for free.

56
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:30,910

Me! Me!

58
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:33,270
Look. Look.

59
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,210
I want two sessions.

60
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:34,670
Boss,

61
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,110
I'll try it here

62
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:36,910
in the salon today.

63
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,910
I want to try, too!

64
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:40,280
Quiet. Quiet.

65
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:42,380
You have different skin types,

66
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,810
so you need different creams.

67
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:45,410
Let me introduce them to you.

68
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:45,930
This one

69
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:49,620
is called Jade Powder.

70
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,660
It can brighten your skin

71
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,420
and reduce wrinkles.

72
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,110
Who wants to try it?

73
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,350
Me! Me!

74
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:56,540
Don't grab.

75
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:57,280
And

76
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:58,750
this one

77
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:00,760
is called Seven White Cream.

78
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:01,850
Smell it. Smell it.

79
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:03,790
It smells great.

80
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:04,390
This one

81
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:06,070
can relieve dry skin

82
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:07,060
and brighten dull skin.

83
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:07,710
Who wants to try it?

84
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:08,790
Me! Me!

85
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:10,380
-Brighten dull skin.
-Okay.

86
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:10,970
This one

87
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,840
has an amazing name.

88
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,410
It's called Fairy Powder.

89
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,300
If you have acne

90
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,300
or pimples,

91
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,709
this cream

92
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:22,750
is a good treatment.

93
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,180
Using it for days

94
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:26,430
can make your skin smooth

95
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:27,150
and glowy.

96
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:28,230
Who wants to try it?

97
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,510
Me! Me!

98
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:30,670
Ms. Yan.

99
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,950
Is there a product

100
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,140
for hair loss?

101
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,490
After giving birth,

102
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,640
I've been suffering

103
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:37,150
from hair loss.

104
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:37,950
Madam,

105
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,080
you just came to the right place.

106
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:41,430
This

107
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:44,960
is specially formulated Hair Growth Cream.

108
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,390
It contains Milkvetch Root,

109
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:48,960
Taiwan Angelica Root,

110
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,220
and Chinese Angelica.

111
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,590
Bring it home

112
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,590
and apply it to your scalp for two hours every day.

113
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:54,740
After a few days,

114
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:56,630
you'll see a miracle.

115
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:58,790
-I want one!
-I want one!

116
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:00,990
Calm down. Calm down.

117
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:01,940
Listen.

118
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,620
Everyone, line up before me

119
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:05,030
for a purchase number.

120
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,520
You can all get a number.

121
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:07,950
My stock is adequate.

122
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,110
Take your time.

123
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:10,110
Take your time.

124
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:10,960
Here you are.

125
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,050
Here you are.

126
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:25,630
My lord.

127
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,390
The odds

128
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,390
are impossible,

129
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,630
but it's just happened.

130
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:30,750
Yong'an Teahouse

131
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,780
has been our observation post.

132
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:34,580
The scout

133
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,310
has been keeping an eye out

134
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,310
for Cao Wenquan.

135
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:38,930
Unexpectedly, he noticed that

136
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:40,350
Ms. Yan opened a store here.

137
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,800
The scout found it suspicious

138
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,840
and reported it.

139
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:44,840
What's suspicious?

140
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:45,670
How about

141
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:48,210
letting him report to you directly?

142
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,590
Come in.

143
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:52,670
My lord.

144
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,740
Tell Mr. Jiang

145
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:56,590
everything you've noticed.

146
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:57,510
Yes.

147
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:58,630
My lord.

148
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,520
The new beauty salon

149
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:01,790
is called Blossom Beauty.

150
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:03,390
Something's weird about it.

151
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:07,870
Just a beauty salon. What's weird?

152
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,710
The owner of Blossom Beauty

153
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:10,670
is Yan Nanxing.

154
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:11,510
My lord,

155
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:12,870
have you forgotten her?

156
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:13,730
She was the girl

157
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,740
who took you hostage

158
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:15,540
a few days ago.

159
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,930
Mr. Jiang definitely remembers her.

160
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:19,070
Go on.

161
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,050
We looked into that girl.

162
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,320
She used to be a traveling doctor

163
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,580
and came here from Heman not long ago.

164
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:26,750
She came from Heman,

165
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:27,620
went to the Ghost Market,

166
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,820
and held you hostage.

167
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:29,380
My lord,

168
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:31,080
that's already odd enough.

169
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:42,190
You did well.

170
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,140
Since we can't find out how Zornia came into the city,

171
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:47,100
we indeed should look into those

172
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:49,500
who are suspicious and new in town.

173
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,640
However,

174
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,270
she has nothing to do with Zornia.

175
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,330
Stop watching her.

176
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:57,300
Yes.

177
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,550
My lord,

178
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,510
you asked me to find out

179
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,640
where Ms. Yan lived.

180
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:10,210
Have you visited her?

181
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,670
How come you didn't even know

182
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:13,140
she opened a beauty salon?

183
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:15,000
Did you two fight again?

184
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:16,790
How about

185
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:18,190
I invite her out

186
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:20,350
for dinner

187
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:22,380
to extend our hospitality?

188
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:25,340
Yao Qianshu.

189
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:27,040
Don't you have

190
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,170
anything else to do?

191
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:30,380
In the future,

192
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,910
don't bother me with things

193
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:34,010
that are unrelated to Zornia again.

194
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:36,510
Take it.

195
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:37,190
Yes.

196
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:41,890
My lord,

197
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,230
stop pretending.

198
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,640
You actually really want

199
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,100
to make up with her.

200
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,570
Pat gently like this.

201
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,960
Tap and pat.

202
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,770
Then it's absorbed.

203
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:56,750
The difference is so big!

204
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:58,750
Look.

205
00:07:58,780 --> 00:07:59,580
Let me see.

206
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,290
Whose hand is this?

207
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:02,710
So smooth.

208
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,370
Glad you like it.

209
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,120
Ms. Yan,

210
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:08,070
your aunt said you're a rookie.

211
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:09,950
She was definitely being modest.

212
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:11,800
Ms. Yan,

213
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,930
I'm sure your business

214
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:14,460
will get better and better.

215
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:15,750
You need to hire help.

216
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:18,060
I can introduce someone to you for free.

217
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:18,950
But can you

218
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:21,150
give me a discount on this?

219
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:23,470
Well, Mrs. Bao,

220
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:24,520
you didn't

221
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,970
give me a discount on the rent.

222
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:27,350
I'm selling creams like this

223
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:29,310
to pay you the rent.

224
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:30,300
Am I right?

225
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,030
As a businesswoman,

226
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,549
you excel in this trade.

227
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:36,030
Fine.

228
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:36,980
I believe in you.

229
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:38,190
I'll buy it despite the price.

230
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:39,390
Here you are.

231
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,309
This one is for me.

232
00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:40,830
I want one too.

233
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:41,549
I want one too.

234
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:42,190
Really?

235
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:43,090
Me too.

236
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,840
I'm out of stock here.

237
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,770
I'll get one for you from upstairs.

238
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:47,930
Wait a minute.

239
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:48,790
Look.

240
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:12,630
There he is again.

241
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,200
He's everywhere.

242
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:26,380
How did Jiang Xinbai

243
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,570
recognize me?

244
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:31,200
Am I wrong?

245
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:33,440
Oh no.

246
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:36,090
No matter what,

247
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,340
I have to get back

248
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,880
my sketchbook immediately.

249
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,480
He can't discover my secret.

250
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:27,150
Luckily, at Heman, Jiang Xinbai wrote me

251
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,640
his address and I took a look at it

252
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,950
before tearing it up.

253
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,660
As the chief constable

00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,060
and the Duke of Yuejiang,

255
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:35,650
he actually doesn't have any servants.

256
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:37,570
Jiang Xinbai,

257
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:38,750
you must be hiding

258
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:39,830
some dark secrets.

259
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,040
Oh my,

260
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,250
his place is so tidy.

261
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:09,050
The guy

262
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:10,850
is either a neat freak

263
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,760
or a pervert.

Yan Nanxing.

265
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,740
Jiang Xinbai,

266
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:10,910
why didn't you

267
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:11,770
remove my mask?

268
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,360
Why didn't you blow my cover?

269
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:18,190
You knew if you removed my mask

270
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:19,920
but couldn't recognize me,

271
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,380
you'd prove me right.

272
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,340
Jiang Xinbai.

00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,870

Mrs. Cheng.

You came too.

279
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:52,240
I'm waiting in line.

280
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,530
Get a number for me.

281
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:54,930
Tell me when it's my turn.

282
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:57,340
Jinwu Guards?

283
00:12:58,270 --> 00:12:59,150
Yeah.

284
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:02,430
The Inspection Office and Jinwu Guards

285
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:04,270
have always been at odds.

286
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:05,790
I heard that a few days ago,

287
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:06,810
they even

288
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:09,270

Gently!

290
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:14,880
I heard about that too.

291
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:16,540
So,

292
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:18,970
the Inspection Office doesn't want

293
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:20,270
Jinwu Guards to get anything on them,

294
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:20,930
right?

00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:22,470
How can anyone

00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,790
get anything on the Inspection Office?

297
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:25,180
If one is to dig up dirt,

298
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:27,350
it should be dirt on Jinwu Guards.

299
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:28,750
They

to Jinwu Guards

307

from you, right?

309
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,330
Go to Twelve Music House.

310
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:51,310
I heard that

00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,410
when Jinwu Guards

312
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:53,300
are not on duty,

he must've made acquaintances.

00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:58,270
Life is about

357
00:15:58,490 --> 00:15:59,950
trying different things.

358
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:00,750
Fine.

359
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,290
You'll replace me later.

360
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:03,490
Can you play the pipa?

361
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:04,700
No.

362
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:05,710
It's okay.

363
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:06,610
Few people come here

364
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:07,890
to listen to music.

365
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:09,570
Just casually pluck the strings

366
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:10,900
to keep up appearances.

367
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,140
Go get changed.

368
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:12,970
Thank you.

369
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,030
Miss.

370
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:20,350
Your outfit

371
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,810
is so beautiful.

372
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,960
This is the traditional dress

373
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,510
girls from border tribes wear for prayer dances.

374
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:27,310
Prayer dance?

375
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:28,980
It's popular here?

376
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:29,870
No.

377
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:31,580
A customer likes that kind of dance.

378
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:32,860
I'm dancing especially for him.

379
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:33,540
Who's it?

380
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:36,790
Shang Bieli, the commander-in-chief of Jinwu Guards.

381
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:38,740
Every time he comes, he asks me to dress like this

382
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,310
and dance behind sheer curtains.

383
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:41,530
He never asks to meet me

384
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:42,990
but is generous with tips.

385
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,300
Sounds like a good job.

386
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:48,380
Mr. Shang is surly

387
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:49,720
and scary.

388
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:51,510
I gotta go.

389
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,790
He'll be angry if I'm late.

390
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,030
Does Mr. Shang

391
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,070
have some special fetishes?

392
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:27,119
Before Gaya's tribe

393
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,790
fights with their enemies,

394
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:30,140
she also gets dressed like this

395
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,600
to cheer for the warriors.

396
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:32,910
I was attracted by her

397
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:34,150
at first sight.

398
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:43,470
Gaya.

399
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:45,110
Gaya?

400
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:51,950
Gaya?

401
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:04,270
Gaya.

402
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:07,960
So Shang Bieli

403
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:09,720
has a secret crush on Lady Gaya?

404
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,550
Does he know Gaya's death

405
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:19,310
was related to Jiang Xinbai?

406
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:21,890
Is that the reason why Shang Bieli

407
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:22,920
made things hard

408
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,980
for Jiang Xinbai at the Ghost Market?

409
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,490
Does he know

410
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:28,650
Gaya was involved in the Zornia case?

411
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:30,480
Seems that the Inspection Office

412
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,340
is on bad terms with Jinwu Guards,

413
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:34,720
and Shang Bieli has a personal feud

414
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:36,790
with Jiang Xinbai.

415
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:41,400
Miss, where have you been?

416
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:42,460
I've been looking for you.

417
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:43,160
Go get changed.

418
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,310
We're next.

419
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:07,390
[Twelve Music House]

420
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:34,210
This way, please.

421
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,040
I know you have a keen nose.

422
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,460
Fortunately, I'm prepared.

423
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:00,190
I used the same rouge and perfume

424
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:02,110
as the other dancers.

425
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:09,870
Yan Nanxing.

426
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:17,270
Recognizing me doesn't mean

427
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,310
you don't have face blindness.

428
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,820
It must be the herbal smell on me

429
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,150
that distinguishes me

430
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:24,480
from the other dancers.

431
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,670
I was surprised

432
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:29,540
to see you among those sultry dancers.

433
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,360
You admit it?

434
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:34,470
Admit what?

435
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:36,090
You didn't deny it,

436
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,500
so I'll take it as a "yes."

437
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:40,640
Yan Nanxing.

438
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:42,230
You shouldn't

439
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:43,350
be here.

440
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:45,220
You're reckless.

441
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:47,030
If something happens,

442
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:48,990
I can't guarantee

443
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:49,790
I can save you.

444
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:52,170
I don't need you to save me.

445
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:56,910
Tell me.

446
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:58,880
You invited me

447
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:01,550
to the place where Jinwu Guards gather.

448
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:02,820
What do you want?

449
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:06,880
Return my sketchbook.

450
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:09,750
You went to my house that night?

451
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:10,300
Yes.

452
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:11,580
I did.

453
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,190
You didn't remove my mask,

454
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:15,420
which confirms that

455
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,580
you have face blindness.

456
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,050
Give it to me.

457
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:26,190
Or I'll reveal your secret

458
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:27,030
in front of

459
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,470
those Jinwu Guards.

460
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:29,930
You'll be in a tight spot.

461
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:32,440
Yan Nanxing.

462
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,260
I never planned

463
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:35,690
to keep your sketchbook.

464
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:37,610
That night,

465
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:39,320
after I left your place,

466
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,800
I thought it over.

467
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:44,870
I thought I was caring for you,

468
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:47,420
but it only led to misunderstandings.

469
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:53,790
So?

470
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,070
So,

471
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:56,430
tomorrow,

472
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,930
come to the Inspection Office to get it yourself.

473
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:01,950
No.

474
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:04,550
If it's a trap and I fall into it,

475
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,080
I'll be fish in a barrel.

476
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:07,790
I don't trust you.

477
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:11,710
Then I'll send it to Blossom Beauty.

478
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:12,440
Will that do?

479
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:13,670
That's even worse.

480
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:15,310
I run a business there.

481
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:16,750
You're the chief constable.

482
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,150
Your presence in my salon

483
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,460
will have a bad impact.

484
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:22,890
Then what is your advice?

485
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:25,110
My advice?

486
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:28,630
If you're sincere,

487
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:30,890
you should bring it to me tonight.

488
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:35,170
I don't want to

489
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:36,830
bring such an important thing

490
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:38,840
to Jinwu Guards' turf.

491
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,550
Zornia.

492
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,790
You smell like Zornia.

493
00:22:58,250 --> 00:22:58,970
It's fine.

494
00:22:59,070 --> 00:22:59,730
He's drunk.

495
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,480
Go. Go.

496
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:01,440
Go do your thing.

497
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:07,700
She smells like Zornia.

498
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,270
People who touch Zornia

499
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,050
will become lethargic.

500
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:15,470
She looks just fine.

501
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:19,510
She came down from the 2nd floor.

502
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:20,530
Could it be that

503
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:22,760
someone's hidden Zornia

504
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:24,430
in a room on the second floor?

505
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:25,510
She went there

506
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:27,720
and got its smell on her.

507
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:34,510
Someone actually dares

508
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:36,110
to hide Zornia under the nose

509
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:37,440
of the chief constable.

510
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,250
How audacious…

511
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,350
Who are you?

512
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:53,470
Sorry.

513
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,420
Wrong room.

514
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,320
Sorry.

515
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:20,600
How's it?

516
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:21,890
Find anything?

517
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:26,300
It surprises me

518
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,030
that they used such a secretive method

519
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:29,160
to avoid attention.

520
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:34,710
It seems that

521
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:37,390
the confiscation of the Zornia at Heman

522
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:39,740
led to a shortage of it in the capital.

523
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:40,760
So,

524
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:43,990
they used another way to transport Zornia.

525
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,730
It's more complicated,

526
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,150
but at least

527
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:49,320
the supply is maintained for now.

528
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:50,050
Besides,

529
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:52,510
it's more secretive.

530
00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:59,290
I've long heard that Shang Bieli's got his hands dirty,

531
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:00,820
taking a cut of all business

532
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:01,790
and allowing

533
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:03,550
his subordinates

534
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,520
to get involved with Zornia.

535
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:09,230
Keep your voice down.

536
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:10,430
Shang Bieli

537
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:12,370
is on the second floor.

538
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,550
Mr. Jiang!

539
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:34,870
Mr. Jiang, you're abstinent from worldly pleasures.

540
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:35,590
You usually

541
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:37,510
don't come to places like this.

542
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:40,230
What brought you…

543
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:46,400
You're meeting with a pretty girl.

544
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:49,610
It makes sense now.

545
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:00,030
She looks so familiar.

546
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:08,090
Is she the one who took you hostage

547
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:09,690
at the Ghost Market that day?

548
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:13,660
Mr. Jiang,

549
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,020
you don't mind dying

550
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:17,830
as long as it's for a pretty girl, right?

551
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:19,890
What can I do for you today?

552
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,720
Mr. Shang.

553
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:29,550
What's wrong?

554
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,470
Are you afraid of my coming?

555
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:34,580
I am afraid.

556
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:37,850
I'm afraid I can't help

557
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:39,740
but kill you.

558
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:44,780
Kill me?

559
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,850
Okay.

560
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,800
But I doubt

561
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:55,550
you're capable of that.

562
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,750
Then let's find out

563
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:04,250
if I'm capable of that or not.

564
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:38,640
You...

565
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:39,890
Shut up.

566
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:42,190
Only kids fight.

567
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:43,390
So impulsive.

568
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,790
This place is luxurious.

569
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:45,790
Everything here looks expensive.

570
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:46,440
What if you break something

571
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,270
and have to pay?

572
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:49,020
You're still in debt to me!

573
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,430
No fighting.

574
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:56,190
Mr. Shang.

575
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:57,110
Mr. Shang.

576
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:58,710
I'm really sorry.

577
00:28:59,070 --> 00:28:59,670
Well,

578
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:01,110
I intervened

579
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:04,290
to save you from being bullied by him.

580
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,510
The thing

581
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:06,170
on his waist

582
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,390
may be a hidden weapon.

583
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:08,790
Don't fall into his trap.

584
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:14,750
Who on earth are you?

585
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:16,710
I

586
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,190
run Blossom Beauty.

587
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:19,320
I'm Yan Nanxing.

588
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:23,810
You're the owner of Blossom Beauty?

589
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:26,230
It's gained a lot of fame lately.

590
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:27,750
You flatter me.

591
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:30,730
It's all thanks to the help of Jinwu Guards.

592
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:32,900
My help?

593
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:36,160
Aren't you with him?

594
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,220
How is that possible?

595
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:39,890
We barely know each other.

596
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:41,530
I detest him.

597
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:43,950
By the way,

598
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:45,640
I've been thinking about

599
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,590
treating you to dinner.

600
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:47,830
But I'm busy today.

601
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:48,790
Another time,

602
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:49,670
another time,

603
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:51,530
I'll make a formal apology to you.

604
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:53,180
What?

605
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:54,610
Let go of me.

606
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:56,510
Shang Bieli.

607
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:58,040
I'm warning you.

608
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,970
The duty of Jinwu Guards

609
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:01,790
is to protect the capital

610
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:03,350
and keep the people safe.

611
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:05,550
Please show some self-discipline.

612
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:07,150
Don't disappoint His Majesty

613
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:08,230
and the people.

614
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,340
He's drunk.

615
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,270
Ignore him.

616
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,470
What are you talking about?

617
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:14,790
How could you be so rude to Mr. Shang?

618
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:15,470
Go home now.

619
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:15,950
I'm drunk?

620
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:17,310
Go home and reflect on yourself.

621
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:18,190
I'll treat you to dinner next time.

622
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:18,830
I'll treat you to dinner.

623
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:19,830
Drunk? Me?

624
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:20,750
Who's drunk?

625
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:21,390
You're drunk.

626
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:22,230
He's drunk.

627
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:23,570
Shut up. Let's go.

628
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:29,550
Wait for me.

629
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,010
I meant well.

630
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,420
I helped you a lot.

631
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:35,830
You should thank me.

632
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:36,890
Without me,

633
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:39,010
could you have gotten out so quickly?

634
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:40,590
Why are you silent?

635
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:42,150
Are you angry?

636
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:44,410
You feel embarrassed?

637
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:47,590
Are you really angry?

638
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:53,350
No.

639
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,780
Then why didn't you say anything?

640
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:57,550
I want to

641
00:30:58,390 --> 00:30:59,070
thank you.

642
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:00,800
Thank me?

643
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:03,360
For what?

644
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,030
Today,

645
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:06,600
if you hadn't

646
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:08,690
invited me to Twelve Music House,

647
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:09,590
I wouldn't have found

648
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:10,920
such an important clue.

649
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:13,910
This time,

650
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:15,510
you did me a favor.

651
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,000
I owe you one.

652
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:18,290
I'll repay you.

653
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:18,870
Good.

654
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:20,430
I'll hold you to that.

655
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:22,060
You must

656
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,680
repay me properly.

657
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:26,980
Sure.

658
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:29,550
I want you…

659
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:32,810
to find someone for me.

660
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:35,700
No problem.

661
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:38,090
You agreed?

662
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:40,670
I'll tell you

663
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:42,510
about the details later.

664
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:43,870
But

665
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:45,310
you still have to

666
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:47,550
have my sketchbook delivered to me.

667
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,520
I'm leaving.

668
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:52,190
Wash your hair.

669
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,600
My hair?

670
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:22,410
That woman forced Jiang Xinbai

671
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:23,600
into that room,

672
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:27,360
but he escorted that woman out.

673
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:32,660
Who on earth is that woman?

674
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:34,680
What makes her special?

675
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:35,950
Be careful!

676
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:37,390
Be careful, Ruoqian.

677
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,220
Be careful, Ruoqian.

678
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:55,310
-It's you.
-It's you.

679
00:32:56,390 --> 00:32:56,950
Miss,

680
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,420
we meet again.

681
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:04,810
Why did you fall from up there?

682
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:06,260
This kitten,

683
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:07,710
she went up the tree

684
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,170
and got stuck there.

685
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:10,990
I went up to save her,

686
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:12,800
but I slipped and fell down.

687
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:13,920
Are you okay?

688
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:15,630
Fortunately,

689
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:17,520
your carriage saved us.

690
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:19,250
I'm asking the kitten.

691
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:24,720
Looks like

692
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,500
I broke your carriage.

693
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:29,130
Your carriage must be expensive.

694
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,400
What do you think?

695
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:34,850
But for the sake of the kitten,

696
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:36,190
I'll let it slide.

697
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:38,770
Consider it as repaying your favor at the Ghost Market.

698
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:40,700
I have no money to pay for it anyway.

699
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,420
I'll just give you a flower

700
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:44,830
for the cat as compensation.

701
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:48,610
Why are you giving me a flower?

702
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:49,480
Because women

703
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:52,050
are like flowers that will wither eventually?

704
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:52,890
Of course not.

705
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:54,590
This kind of flower

706
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:55,790
represents good luck.

707
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:57,230
I wish you all the best.

708
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:07,390
Brat.

709
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:08,510
How dare you!

710
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:09,670
Come out!

711
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:11,989
Miss,

712
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:13,080
I'll take my leave.

713
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:17,850
Ruoqian.

714
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:19,070
Here.

715
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:20,409
Here's the kitten.

716
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:22,469
Thank you, Ruoqian.

717
00:34:22,469 --> 00:34:23,150
Thank you.

718
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,190
Hold it. Don't let her run away.

719
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,429
Ruoqian, you're amazing.

720
00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:30,489
What a good kitten.

721
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:51,670
Dad.

722
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:52,429
Mom.

723
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:53,389
I'm back.

724
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:54,469
Welcome home.

725
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:56,270
Why are you back so late?

726
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,030
I read in a bookstore

727
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:59,420
for the whole afternoon.

728
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:00,410
On my way back,

729
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:01,760
I played with some kids.

730
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:04,170
I'll heat up some food for you.

731
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,720
I'll help Dad finish the work

732
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,450
before I eat.

733
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:16,970
Qian.

734
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:18,780
We're slaves.

735
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:20,450
Smithing is our family trade.

736
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:22,110
You need to be down-to-earth.

737
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,500
Stop having dreams

738
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,960
that will never come true.

739
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,150
Yes.

740
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:29,390
Ruoqian,

741
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:30,910
your dad is right.

742
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:33,780
You've been admitted to the Imperial Academy,

743
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:35,630
[Mrs. Liu]

744
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:35,860
but we can't afford the tuition.

745
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,340
I'll work part-time

746
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:39,610
to pay my tuition.

747
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,390
Even if you go to the Imperial Academy,

748
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:45,210
we're still slaves.

749
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:47,070
[Mr. Liu]

750
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:46,970
You can't be an official.

751
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,420
Why waste your time?

752
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:51,210
Even if I can't be an official,

753
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:52,390
I can still be a scholar

754
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:53,720
and become respectful.

755
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:55,050
Even if I'm a slave,

756
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:56,610
I can still be successful.

757
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,440
Since I'm the first slave

758
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:00,220
to get into the Imperial Academy,

759
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:00,820
in the future,

760
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,080
I can be the first slave

761
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:04,210
to get out of slavery with knowledge.

762
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,780
Liu Ruoqian worked for Cao Wenquan

763
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:11,410
as his accountant for a year.

764
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:12,720
He's the first slave

765
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:15,120
to get into the Imperial Academy in this dynasty.

766
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,320
Why is he suspicious?

767
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:18,670
On the night we went to the Ghost Market,

768
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,570
Liu Ruoqian resigned.

769
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,760
Right before the lockdown,

770
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:24,520
he left the Ghost Market.

771
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:26,310
He happened to leave

772
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,510
when Cao Wenquan

773
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:28,670
got into trouble.

774
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:30,180
He was either

775
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:31,060
tipped off

776
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:32,540
or given instructions

777
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:33,780
by Cao Wenquan.

778
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:35,480
What do you think, my lord?

779
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,470
But Cao Wenquan

780
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:38,620
didn't know we'd lock down the Market.

781
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:39,500
Right.

782
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:41,690
Hope it's just a coincidence.

783
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:44,910
Look into him carefully.

784
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:46,100
Don't wrongly accuse

785
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:46,960
a talented man.

786
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:48,710
Yes, my lord.

787
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:52,990
My lord.

788
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,700
I heard Jinwu Guards on patrol

789
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:56,860
say mockingly that

790
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,290
you went

791
00:36:58,310 --> 00:36:59,600
to Twelve Music House last night

792
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,680
and almost fought with Shang Bieli again.

793
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,190
Ms. Yan

794
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:04,120
stopped it with a basket of greens.

795
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:05,310
What happened?

796
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:07,280
Who did they mock?

797
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:08,460
Yan Nanxing?

798
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:10,550
My lord,

799
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,120
your first reaction

800
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:13,280
is to defend Ms. Yan.

801
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:14,950
They didn't mock her.

802
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:16,080
They mocked you.

803
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:19,150
Have you

804
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:20,720
made up with her?

805
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:22,120
Go investigate.

806
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:22,990
Yes,

807
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:24,320
my lord.

808
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:33,590
[Blossom Beauty needs a diligent salesgirl]

[Blossom Beauty]

810
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:41,990
Let me see.

811
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:44,350
Recruitment notice.

812
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:46,020
Blossom Beauty needs a salesgirl

813
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:47,450
who's smart, hardworking,

814
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:48,580
and communicative.

815
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:50,350
You can do it.

816
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:52,230
We can do it too.

817
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:53,630
Me too.

818
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,630
She also needs to know medicine.

819
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:56,290
Do you know?

820
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:58,130
What about you?

821
00:37:58,270 --> 00:37:59,270
No.

822
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:01,390
This is hard.

823
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:04,540
Ms. Yan is out.

824
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:05,540
Ms. Yan!

825
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:06,870
When do you open?

826
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:08,470
Everything is ready.

827
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:09,150
Everyone,

828
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:10,050
please come in.

Ms. Yan.

00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:13,050
This recruitment notice…

831
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,430
Thanks to your love

832
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:16,540
for my salon,

833
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:17,630
business is booming.

834
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:18,490
I can't

835
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:19,500
do all the work alone.

836
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,150
So,

837
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,040
I want to hire someone to help me.

838
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:23,210
If you have anyone in mind,

839
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:24,340
introduce her to me.

840
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:25,830
The wages I offer

841
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:27,600
are higher than average.

842
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:29,690
Stop talking. Let's go in.

843
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:30,230
Let's go.

844
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:31,790
Welcome, everyone.

845
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:32,670
Be careful.

846
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:34,250
Make yourself at home.

847
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:35,920
Make yourself at home.

848
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:39,280
Mrs. Bao,

849
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:41,380
if you know someone qualified,

850
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:42,510
recommend her to me.

851
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:43,660
I do know someone.

852
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:44,150
Who?

853
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:45,090
Me.

854
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:47,960
I can't afford to hire you.

855
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:48,750
Besides,

856
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:49,870
I don't dare let you work,

857
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:50,510
do I?

858
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,270
Ms. Yan,

859
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:54,290
Blossom Beauty is the first

860
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:56,070
beauty salon in the capital.

861
00:38:56,530 --> 00:38:57,710
As the saying goes,

862
00:38:57,870 --> 00:38:59,160
the first to try something new

863
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,710
is the bravest.

864
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:03,310
But inevitably,

865
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:04,150
some people

866
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:05,580
are prejudiced against you.

867
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:06,780
Look at those people.

868
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:08,190
They definitely think

869
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:09,790
this is not a legit business.

870
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:13,350
Moreover,

871
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:15,550
it's inappropriate for a girl

872
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:17,030
to leave home for work.

873
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:18,970
So if you want to hire help…

874
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:20,590
Mrs. Bao.

875
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:22,050
There's suddenly

876
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:23,710
a new wrinkle around your eye.

877
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:25,410
It came out again?

878
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:27,350
Why didn't anyone tell me?

879
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:28,040
Hurry.

880
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:30,470
Help her remove it.

881
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:32,070
Gosh. Poor you. A new wrinkle.

882
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:33,150
You deserve it.

883
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:46,550
Mr. Jiang.

884
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,260
Are you out early to catch criminals?

885
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:51,610
I'm here to see you.

886
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:53,370
Am I in trouble?

887
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:57,110
You helped me last night,

888
00:39:57,710 --> 00:39:58,910
so I came to repay you.

889
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:02,130
You said you wanted to look for someone.

890
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:02,940
Who's it?

891
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:05,700
Mr. Jiang,

892
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:07,270
you're a man of your word.

893
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:09,890
You came all the way here to return the favor.

894
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:10,830
Tell me the name,

895
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:11,230
age,

896
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:12,630
and facial features.

897
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:13,560
I don't know.

898
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,140
You don't know?

899
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:17,250
I don't know his name

900
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:18,370
or his age.

901
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:20,580
Nor do I know

902
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,710
his address,

903
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:23,000
family, or friends.

904
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:25,950
My intuition says

905
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:27,260
he's still alive.

906
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,930
So I came to the capital to look for him.

907
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:31,670
A man?

908
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:32,750
A man.

909
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:36,600
To be precise,

910
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:39,490
a young man.

911
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:44,650
He's around your age.

912
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:48,330
He's very important

913
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,320
to you?

914
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:52,420
Very important.

915
00:40:57,390 --> 00:40:59,590
But you didn't give me any information.

916
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:00,910
I can't help you.

917
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,300
If you really want to find him,

918
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,330
you have to give me some clues.

919
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:07,290
The more detailed, the better.

920
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:09,940
But we were little back then.

921
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:12,420
I don't remember anything.

922
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:14,410
You have to remember something.

923
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:16,340
You want to find him,

924
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:18,240
so you have to think harder.

925
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:21,030
He…

926
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:22,950
He…

927
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:25,510
Forget it. I'll look for him myself.

928
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:26,020
Hello.

929
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,640
Are you the owner of Blossom Beauty?

930
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,310
You're the clerk from the Ghost Market?

931
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:33,840
Yes.

932
00:41:34,970 --> 00:41:35,830
I want this job.

933
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,540
My name is Liu Ruoqian.

934
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:38,560
Nice to meet you.

935
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:41,010
Who's this?

936
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:42,160
He's not important.

937
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:44,050
You want this job?

938
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:46,770
But sorry,

939
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,140
you're not qualified.

940
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:49,030
Please leave.

941
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,240
I'll come to you if I think of something.

942
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:07,420
Liu Ruoqian?
