4
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:52,670
My lord,

5
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:54,590
you worry me so much.

6
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:56,039
Why did you

7
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,270
drink with Nan Jifeng

8
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:58,330
when I wasn't here?

9
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,350
If anything happens to you,

10
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:01,550
I might lose my head

11
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:03,150
when I return to the capital.

12
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:09,180
I had no choice.

13
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:10,669
If I didn't drink,

14
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:11,830
all our efforts

15
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,220
would have been in vain.

16
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:15,930
Even then, you still shouldn't drink.

17
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:16,990
Don't you know

18
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,460
about your situation?

19
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,190
Not only are you a lightweight,

20
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:22,860
but you also have face blindness.

21
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,400
If you expose yourself

22
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,670
and something happens to you,

23
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:27,600
how will I explain to the princess?

24
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:29,300
Yao Qianshu.

25
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:30,150
Yes.

26
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,550
Are you lecturing me?

27
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:34,630
I dare not.

28
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,390
I just feel bad for you.

29
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:39,990
You don't even socialize in the capital.

30
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:41,520
Why must you lower yourself

31
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,150
in a small place like this?

32
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,090
If you want to get things done,

33
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,230
you need to learn

34
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:55,329
to dance to the tune

35
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:58,070
of the people you meet.

36
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:01,570
It's not about lowering oneself.

37
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:03,430
While I was gone,

38
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,040
did Nan Jifeng send someone to keep an eye on you?

39
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:06,710
No.

40
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:08,270
Even if he did,

41
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:09,670
I could get rid of them.

42
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:15,920
What have you found?

43
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:23,230
There are three major clans in Heman City,

44
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:24,950
which are Tumen, Gongye and Moqi.

45
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:26,190
They're all rich clans

46
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:28,030
with century-old foundations in this area.

47
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,680
The Tumen clan has been county magistrates for five generations.

48
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,150
The Gongye clan occupies the county lieutenancy

49
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,590
and follows Tumen's orders.

50
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,050
The Moqi are quite mysterious.

51
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:35,870
They've been doing business in Heman for generations

52
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:36,950
and are outstanding,

53
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,460
but the head of this generation

54
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,670
has never appeared.

55
00:03:42,829 --> 00:03:44,510
Because Zornia has only entered the country

56
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:45,470
in recent years.

57
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:47,810
You can't be too brazen

58
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:49,700
when dabbling in such a business.

59
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:50,760
By the way, my lord,

60
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,150
I didn't find

61
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,470
the head of the Moqi clan,

62
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,030
but I've recorded

63
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:56,360
all of the Moqi clan's stores

64
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,150
in Heman.

65
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:58,290
Please take a look.

casino, tavern...

69
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,630
They do quite a lot.

70
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,630
I have a second piece of intel.

71
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:10,830
Do you want to hear it?

72
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:12,430
What?

73
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:15,320
My mother went into General Nan's study before.

74
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,250
She said there's something fishy in there.

75
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,779
There must be a secret room,

76
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:21,029
but she didn't know how to get in.

77
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,590
Why did your mother sneak into

78
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,010
the study of the General's Residence?

79
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:25,140
Ask what you should.

80
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:26,830
Don't ask what you shouldn't.

81
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,390
I didn't force you

82
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:28,920
to tell your secret either.

83
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:34,780
You're trying so hard to enter the General's Residence.

84
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,580
You must want to know something.

85
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:37,790
The thing you want

86
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:39,930
must be in the secret room.

87
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:42,590
There must be

88
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:45,030
what you're looking for too, right?

89
00:04:50,909 --> 00:04:52,260
Does Nan Jifeng interact with

90
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,470
the three major clans often?

91
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:54,510
Two years ago

92
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:55,990
when Nan Jifeng was transferred to Heman,

93
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:56,640
he interacted frequently

94
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,070
with the three major clans.

95
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,600
It's not as frequent now.

96
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:05,050
Nan Jifeng's position is stable now,

97
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,130
so he naturally

98
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:08,090
avoids suspicion on the surface.

99
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:09,860
My lord,

100
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,500
what should we do next?

101
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,030
Find the evidence

102
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:22,360
of Nan Jifeng and the three clans' crimes.

I'm not leaving.

105
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:32,440
You leave if you want.

106
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,840
Anyway, I'm not leaving.

107
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:38,870
The general asked Her Ladyship to go back to her maiden home

108
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:40,460
and irritated her again.

109
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,760
Mr. Xi.

110
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:50,620
Madam.

111
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:52,909
Mr. Xi,

112
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,770
are you here to see the general?

113
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,240
I’m afraid he...

114
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:00,790
It's fine.

115
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,430
Actually, I came here today

116
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:04,340
to

117
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:06,430
pay my respects to you.

118
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:07,240
To me?

119
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,860
I bet you must want to see Dr. Yan instead.

120
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:19,280
Your Ladyship, you must be joking.

121
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,150
You're just in time.

122
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,790
I've saved you a bowl of the herbal soup

123
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:27,120
I made for Her Ladyship.

124
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,120
Try it.

125
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,730
It's good for your health.

126
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:37,790
What?

127
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,650
Are you afraid I put strange things in this?

128
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,180
That's right.

129
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,380
Trust me.

130
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,240
Our cooperation

131
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:55,970
has been put on the agenda.

132
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,170
Are you sure?

133
00:06:58,890 --> 00:06:59,870
To be precise,

134
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:00,940
this time,

135
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,600
you need to help me more.

136
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:03,690
However,

137
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:05,610
you don't need to pay

138
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:06,820
or use your looks.

139
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:08,330
When the deed is done,

140
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,590
name your price.

141
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,270
I don't have to pay

142
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,780
or use my looks,

143
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,810
and I can even name my price when it's done?

144
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,080
Why do I think

145
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:23,150
it sounds

146
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:25,290
even more dangerous?

147
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:27,950
Listen to me.

148
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,110
Dr. Yan.

149
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:40,030
Madam.

150
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,070
Sorry to bother you again.

151
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:44,630
No, no, no. It's no bother.

152
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,880
I'm just here to deliver some fruits.

153
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:49,390
Madam.

154
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:56,750
I want to take Yan Nanxing

155
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,620
for a stroll.

156
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,750
Is that okay?

157
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:03,310
Yes,

158
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:05,000
but Dr. Yan,

159
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:07,150
you won't run away again, right?

160
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:09,350
Madam, you must be joking.

161
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:11,010
I will definitely return her.

162
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:13,390
Let's go.

163
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,040
Thank you, Madam.

164
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:30,830
This is not bad.

165
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,809
I didn't take a closer look last time.

166
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:37,030
It's quite elegant.

167
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:39,590
Last time?

168
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,179
When were you here before?

169
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:49,790
I mean

170
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,720
when I passed by last time.

171
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:56,010
When I pass by the river,

172
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,120
I often see

173
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:00,080
many similar pleasure boats here,

174
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:02,240
but I never looked carefully.

175
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,090
Isn't it dizzying to sleep

176
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:14,070
on a boat?

177
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,000
Why don't you stay in an inn?

178
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,160
Heman is a waterfront city.

179
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:21,070
It's rare for me to come here.

180
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:21,730
Naturally,

181
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:24,360
I must live in a representative place.

182
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:25,990
Have some tea.

183
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:27,590
Got it.

184
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:30,390
Pleasure boats are places to spend money

185
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,390
and get pleasure.

186
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:34,280
Here, you can drink some tea,

187
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:35,240
listen to music,

188
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,580
then drink some wine

189
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,660
and have some beauties in your lap.

190
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:41,190
You'll be as happy as a god.

191
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:46,840
How come

192
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:48,360
you sound like

193
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,900
a jealous wife?

194
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:52,150
Wife?

195
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:53,990
Are you willing to let your wife

196
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:55,120
work for you outside

197
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,030
and tell her

198
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,190
to name her price

199
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:58,770
after the deed's done?

200
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:04,310
Alright,

201
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:06,170
I'll stop joking with you.

202
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:08,270
I was afraid of eavesdroppers

203
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:09,450
at the General's Residence,

204
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:10,810
so I invited you here.

205
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:12,630
It's totally necessary.

206
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:13,470
You

207
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:14,530
lack awareness

208
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:16,120
and can't read the room.

209
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:19,770
It's because I don't care.

210
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:21,750
Tell me.

211
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:23,370
What's the matter?

212
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,190
Tonight,

213
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:26,590
I want to ask you

214
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:29,270
to keep General Nan away from the study.

215
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:30,400
Two hours is enough.

216
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:31,920
Distract General Nan.

217
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,630
After I find the secret room,

218
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,270
I'll exit and help guard for you.

219
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,060
Then you can go in

220
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,320
and find what you want.

221
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,240
Working together

222
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,310
and protecting each other.

223
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:43,380
It sounds

224
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:44,950
like a pretty good plan,

225
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,830
but why do I feel like...

226
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:50,290
I'm at a disadvantage?

227
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:54,200
For example?

228
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:55,330
For example...

229
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:58,350
Look.

230
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:01,470
Working alone,

231
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:04,110
if I fail and get caught,

232
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:06,000
I can make amends

233
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:06,910
due to my medical merits

234
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:07,860
and save myself.

235
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:10,170
But if you're added, with your mysterious background

236
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,890
and ulterior motives,

237
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,090
General Nan might get unhappy

238
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:14,790
and kill us.

239
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:17,510
It's not worth it for me.

240
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:20,480
Tell me.

241
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:22,270
How much money do you need

242
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:23,670
for you to take this risk?

243
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,780
Money is not a problem for you.

244
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:31,170
I don't want something that you don't value.

245
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:33,870
Then what do you want?

246
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:39,600
I want to know

247
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:41,150
if you have

248
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,270
relatives or friends

249
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,640
who were hurt by Zornia before.

250
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:56,550
Heman is where Zornia enters the country

251
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:59,310
and you came here to investigate it.

252
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:01,990
Are you suspecting

253
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:03,470
General Nan

254
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:05,460
has something to do with the bad guys

255
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:06,790
who killed your family?

256
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,030
Or

257
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:09,530
do you want to find them

258
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:10,730
through General Nan?

259
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:12,750
Or maybe...

260
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,290
Your enemy

261
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:19,670
includes General Nan?

262
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:25,830
Am I right?

263
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:36,850
Yan Nanxing,

264
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:39,590
it’s a waste for you

265
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:40,990
to be a traveling doctor.

266
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:42,670
You should be a storyteller.

267
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:46,320
You're trying to gloss over things again.

268
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:49,380
Mr. Xi!

269
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:58,630
Mr. Xi,

270
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:01,380
we meet again.

271
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:03,670
Our girls earn

272
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:06,180
30 taels of silver a month here.

273
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:08,090
I only gave you a discount

274
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,600
because you pay monthly.

275
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:15,230
Madam,

276
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:17,530
are you here

277
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,730
to collect rent?

278
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,430
No.

279
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,720
It's just that

280
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,710
you rent my pleasure boat

281
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:27,290
and pay despite not wanting the girls.

282
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,420
I feel

283
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:32,350
so uncomfortable inside.

284
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:33,270
It seems

285
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:34,070
you

286
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:35,750
don't like our girls.

287
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,030
You must think they are not pretty enough.

288
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:40,150
We got two new girls today.

289
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:41,360
They're beautiful.

290
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,470
Greet Mr. Xi.

291
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:43,910
Hello, Mr. Xi.

292
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:46,790
No need.

293
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:49,350
Mr. Xi, don't hold back.

294
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:50,550
Let them

295
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:51,900
accompany you tonight.

296
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:54,480
It's really unnecessary.

297
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,150
Today,

298
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:56,920
I have something else to do.

299
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:01,710
You must know that a moment of love

300
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,470
is worth thousands.

301
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:04,070
Go!

302
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:06,310
Mr. Xi,

303
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,210
I missed you so much.

304
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:12,530
What are you doing?

305
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:14,270
Let go.

306
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,870
Let go! And that one too, let go!

307
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,730
Do you own this pleasure boat?

308
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,710
You think you can come in as you want?

309
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:24,430
Mr. Xi,

310
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,650
is she your maid?

311
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,910
You're dressed prettily.

312
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:31,670
Do you have bad eyesight?

313
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:33,170
Do I look like a maid to you?

314
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:33,950
No.

315
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:35,710
You look like a maid's mother.

316
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,640
You have bad eyesight.

317
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:40,750
I know you.

318
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:41,870
I know you.

319
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,030
You are that

320
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:45,710
volunteer female doctor?

321
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:47,000
Right.

322
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:49,230
I'm not only a female doctor,

323
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:51,480
but also

324
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:53,710
Mr. Xi's wife.

325
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:56,480
My husband

326
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:58,040
came to Heman for business.

327
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:58,990
I worried

328
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:00,750
some weird girls would pester him,

329
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,010
so I followed him here.

330
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:04,190
From what was said just now,

331
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:06,170
you've been a good boy.

332
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:06,960
Good job.

333
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:08,460
I'm relieved.

334
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:11,550
No wonder

335
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:12,430
Mr. Xi is so obedient.

336
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:14,430
He's married to a tigress.

337
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,830
You're so smart.

338
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,840
I really am a tigress.

339
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:22,310
Tigress!

340
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:23,070
I'll prick you to death.

341
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:24,250
I'll prick you to death!

342
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:24,910
Don't come over!

343
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:25,670
Yes, I'm so uncouth.

344
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:26,110
Go away!

345
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:27,970
-Run! Are you scared?
-A tigress!

346
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:29,750
Don't prick me! Go away!

347
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:31,310
Tigress!

348
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:33,990
Gosh.

349
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:36,910
She has bad eyesight.

350
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:38,550
I don't look good?

351
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,020
What are you doing?

352
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:43,480
Can't you tell?

353
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:45,750
I'm helping you.

354
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:48,270
If I didn't help,

355
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:49,430
they would've

356
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:51,550
eaten you alive.

357
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:55,080
Look at the way they looked at you.

358
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,810
It was like wolves seeing meat.

359
00:15:58,270 --> 00:15:59,600
That hand kept stroking

360
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:00,790
your body.

361
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:03,020
Be careful.

362
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,870
Don't get seduced.

363
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:06,790
Are you jealous?

364
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:11,580
I mean...

365
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:12,750
So,

366
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,950
you called yourself my wife

367
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:17,310
and even disregarded your reputation?

368
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:18,790
You really don't know me.

369
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:21,230
In this martial world,

370
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:22,910
I remain untainted

371
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,830
by the environment.

372
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,470
We just met by chance

373
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:28,710
and take what we need.

374
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:30,240
When we get out of Heman,

375
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:31,990
we will never meet again.

376
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:33,630
Why would I be jealous?

377
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:38,330
So,

378
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,390
you agree?

379
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:43,030
Yes,

380
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:44,840
but let's make it clear.

381
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:46,590
I want to enter the secret room

382
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:47,830
of the General's Residence too.

383
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:49,430
We'll take what we each need.

384
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:51,550
Okay.

385
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:53,310
Deal.

386
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:58,040
[General's Residence]

387
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:08,200
Dr. Yan.

388
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,109
Is this the general's hangover soup

389
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:11,170
from Her Ladyship?

390
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:12,109
Yes.

391
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:13,680
You're alone today?

392
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:14,520
Where's Yue?

393
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:17,599
She should still be in the kitchen.

394
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:19,829
Okay.

395
00:17:19,849 --> 00:17:21,010
Not bad. It's quite hot.

396
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:22,740
Quickly send it to the general.

397
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:24,339
Go ahead.

398
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,270
What did you

399
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:31,690
sprinkle into that bowl?

400
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,310
You won't know even if I tell you.

401
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,400
It's medicine that you don't need.

402
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,520
Fine, I'll tell you.

403
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:40,890
When the general comes out later,

404
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:41,750
you have to hurry in.

405
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:42,750
You must be quick.

406
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:45,270
My medicine works well,

407
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:46,750
but they

408
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:48,750
are not young anymore.

409
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:50,670
It'll be

410
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:52,350
two hours at most.

411
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:54,990
You know.

412
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:56,830
Two hours.

413
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,270
Good job, Dr. Yan.

414
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:08,030
Madam,

415
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:09,300
the peonies

416
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,880
in the garden are blooming these days.

417
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:12,630
Yes.

418
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:14,430
Look.

419
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,150
You're almost healed

420
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,050
and it's a lovely night.

421
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:20,430
How about

422
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:22,770
you invite the general over tonight?

423
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,480
I haven't fully recovered.

424
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,230
So what?

425
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,310
The general loves you deeply.

426
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:33,550
He won't mind.

427
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,070
Plus, you said

428
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:37,510
he has been wronged these days.

429
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:41,710
Gaya.

430
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,230
General?

431
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:46,260
Gaya.

432
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:50,150
Gaya.

433
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:52,830
Gaya.

434
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,490
Gaya.

435
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:54,310
[Zhang Hui]

436
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:56,770
[Yuwen Wu]

437
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:05,410
The doors and windows are closed,

438
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:07,120
but there's a draft.

439
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:04,640
What are you doing?

440
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,870
Killing me after using me?

441
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:06,530
Put it down.

442
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:07,510
It's you?

443
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:10,450
You're pretending you don't know me?

444
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:12,500
Let's go.

445
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:13,880
Let's go back first.

446
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:15,070
Why?

447
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:16,670
Now it's your turn to guard.

448
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:17,930
I haven't entered yet.

449
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:19,880
Stop messing around.

450
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,910
I'm not.

451
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:22,550
I have to go inside.

452
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:23,550
Come back with me.

453
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,070
I haven't...

454
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,220
What are you doing?

455
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:28,110
Why can't I go in?

456
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:30,520
What are you doing?

457
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,920
Are you burning bridges?

458
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:36,390
Someone passed by the door of the study.

459
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:39,990
I think you're just wary of me.

460
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:42,090
What's in the secret room?

461
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:43,950
I think

462
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:45,440
Lady Gaya

463
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,730
has almost recovered.

464
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:47,500
How about

465
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,940
you leave tonight?

466
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:51,650
What's wrong with you?

467
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,430
Why should I leave tonight?

468
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:55,560
I haven't entered the secret room yet.

469
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:57,850
What exactly are you looking for?

470
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:00,230
You tell me first.

471
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:01,550
What's in the secret room?

472
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:02,070
Money.

473
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:03,230
What else?

474
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:04,790
Money,

475
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:05,830
money,

476
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,180
and more money.

477
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,140
Nothing else?

478
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,550
If you're not looking for money,

479
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:13,280
there's nothing in the room that you want.

480
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:14,610
No.

481
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:16,250
I have to check it out myself.

482
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:17,810
You don't trust me?

483
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:22,720
It's not that I don't trust you.

484
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:24,070
I have to see it myself

485
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:25,070
before I give up.

486
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:28,550
I'm not joking.

487
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:30,850
The secret room

488
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,980
doesn't have what you're looking for.

489
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:37,070
Things are about to change in Heman.

490
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:39,330
You shouldn't get involved in this mess.

491
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:42,070
It's a matter of life and death.

492
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:42,790
Tonight,

493
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:44,380
you must leave.

494
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:51,030
Yan Nanxing.

495
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:59,110
I don't want to get you involved.

496
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:06,780
You...

497
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:10,910
Are you

498
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:13,160
showing concern for me?

499
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:17,190
What do I have to say

500
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:18,170
for you to leave?

501
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:20,150
No, you don't understand.

502
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:22,070
I can't leave tonight.

503
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:23,310
Stubborn!

504
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:27,370
You have to at least

505
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:28,570
promise me one thing.

506
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:30,590
Do not

507
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:32,830
leave your room tonight.

508
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:41,420
What?

509
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:43,750
Is he crazy?

510
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:50,520
Lieutenant General Li,

511
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:52,280
what are you doing?

512
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:54,070
General Nan,

513
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:56,990
even if the deal fails, the righteousness remains.

514
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,450
Why the murderous intent?

515
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:02,990
I don't understand what you're talking about.

516
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:04,440
What's going on?

517
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:07,290
Is there a misunderstanding?

518
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:09,510
How about we untie Lieutenant General Li first?

519
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:10,110
Untie him.

520
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:16,230
Tell me.

521
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:17,530
What happened?

522
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,470
General,

523
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:19,990
I saw this man

524
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:21,490
sneak into your study

525
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,240
and this woman helped him.

526
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:24,870
I was worried

527
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:25,990
he would harm you.

528
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:27,910
That's why I acted on my own impulse

529
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:28,840
to get rid of him.

530
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:30,760
Your own impulse?

531
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:33,750
I'm curious

532
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:35,710
what horrible things

533
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:36,910
your general has done

534
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:38,150
that you need to hide for him

535
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:39,150
by killing me.

536
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,580
Follow me to the study.

537
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:57,630
I'm afraid there's a trap.

538
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:01,230
I've already searched the study.

539
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:02,290
There are no traps.

540
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:04,310
Nan Jifeng can't kill me anyway.

541
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:05,870
I'd like to see

542
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,520
how he wants to dispute this.

543
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:16,880
Watch over Yan Nanxing.

544
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:18,510
Don’t let anything go wrong.

545
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:26,030
Stay with my people.

546
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:28,020
Don't trust anyone else.

547
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:35,190
Then you...

548
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:41,800
Don't worry.

549
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:43,670
Wait for me here.

550
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:47,270
It's fine.

551
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:57,480
Jifeng, be careful.

552
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:15,270
Jifeng!

553
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:18,070
Jifeng!

554
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:19,350
Jifeng!

555
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:21,030
Jifeng, are you alright?

556
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:22,600
Don't panic.

557
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:28,430
The knife is poisoned.

558
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:29,360
Take him inside.

559
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:29,800
Hurry!

560
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:31,070
Hurry!

561
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,270
Help the general in.

562
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:32,750
Hurry.

563
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:55,310
Madam.

564
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:56,790
Where is the magical medicine of your tribe?

565
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:58,050
Quickly take them out.

566
00:29:58,390 --> 00:29:58,870
I can't.

567
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,190
The magical medicine is gendered.

568
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:01,030
Mine is feminine medicine.

569
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:02,490
The general can't take it.

570
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:17,210
What are you doing?

571
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:20,560
Yan Nanxing!

572
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:21,710
Countering poison with poison

573
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:22,670
can lure out some of the poison

574
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:23,530
in the general.

575
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:25,710
Your blood is poisonous?

576
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:28,950
I almost died when I was young.

577
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:30,550
I ate all kinds of weird herbs

578
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:32,720
and quite a lot of toxins built up in me.

579
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:35,160
So you're the Poison Girl?

580
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:39,270
Madam.

581
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:42,080
Do you have Zornia?

582
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:42,670
Zornia?

583
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,550
What?

584
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:46,390
Zornia?

585
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,660
Although it's poisonous when it's processed,

586
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:50,190
it's not an ordinary thing.

587
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:51,790
All poison is also medicine.

588
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:53,120
A small amount of Zornia

589
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,830
can also help detoxify his body.

590
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:55,690
I won't take it!

591
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:59,870
Even if I die by poisoning,

592
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:02,550
I will never touch that thing again.

593
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:03,480
Jifeng!

594
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:04,470
Jifeng!

595
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:05,350
Jifeng.

596
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:09,510
Madam, here.

597
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:11,250
Have the general drink this.

598
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:12,630
Jifeng,

599
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:14,070
come. Slowly.

600
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:17,190
Slowly.

601
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:20,680
Yan Nanxing,

602
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:22,660
must it be Zornia?

603
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,560
Is there no replacement?

604
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:28,440
There is.

605
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:30,150
There is another way.

606
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:33,630
We can use human blood as the guiding drug.

607
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:34,630
Then use my blood.

608
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,190
No, Madam.

609
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:37,700
Women's blood has yin energy.

610
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,360
It doesn't match men's blood.

611
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:40,930
Then what can we do?

612
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:42,070
You can't let me

613
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:43,400
watch him die like this.

614
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,230
Dr. Yan,

615
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:44,990
I beg you.

616
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:45,790
You must find a way

617
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:46,470
to save him.

618
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:47,590
Please.

619
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:51,430
Treatment with human blood?

620
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:53,310
I've never heard of this before.

621
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:56,160
This is a folk prescription.

622
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,100
First, I'll use my blood to counter poison with poison

623
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,440
and force out some toxins.

624
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,150
Then I'll use fresh human blood as the guiding drug

625
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:02,350
for detoxification.

626
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:06,160
How much do you need?

627
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:08,830
At least

628
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:10,270
one bowl.

629
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:14,710
What should we do?

630
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:15,970
Is there any other way?

631
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:17,830
Mr. Xi.

632
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:18,960
Yan Nanxing,

633
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:22,110
use my blood

634
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:24,480
and save Nan Jifeng.

635
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:48,830
Are you

636
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:50,640
really not afraid of death?

637
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:53,330
You've lost so much blood.

638
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,300
What if General Nan can't be saved

639
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:58,710
and you collapse too?

640
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:05,230
You said

641
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:10,200
there are things you fear more than death

642
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:12,280
and there are things

643
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:14,160
you want to do more than to live,

644
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:14,750
right?

645
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:20,710
In my life,

646
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,760
there's also a mission

647
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:25,190
that makes me not thirst for life

648
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:27,270
nor fear death.

649
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:28,750
Mission?

650
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:31,640
Yes,

651
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:33,180
a mission.

652
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,110
Without General Nan,

653
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:40,590
the mission I came here for

654
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:42,280
won't be completed.

655
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:44,440
Besides,

656
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,120
I brought the murderer here.

657
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:49,830
It's my responsibility.

658
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:57,110
Do you know

659
00:33:58,870 --> 00:33:59,640
why I won't

660
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:00,950
open an actual clinic

661
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:03,810
and instead wander around

662
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:05,750
as a traveling doctor?

663
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:12,110
It's because I don't want to face

664
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:15,909
these life-or-death matters all the time.

665
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:18,560
I've been practicing medicine

666
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:20,630
with my mother since I was little

667
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:22,690
and traveled everywhere.

668
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:26,830
Actually, my mother saved many people.

669
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:29,719
But there were also many

670
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:32,090
who couldn't be saved.

671
00:34:34,909 --> 00:34:35,969
If one person died,

672
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,050
an entire family would fall apart.

673
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,179
I didn't understand.

674
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:47,630
My mother was doing good deeds,

675
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:50,630
but why did she feel burdened

676
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,719
like she was carrying people's lives?

677
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:56,750
From then on,

678
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:58,790
I made up my mind

679
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,510
that I wanted to be

680
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:04,710
a doctor who didn't deal with death.

681
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:08,590
Sometimes, I thought

682
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:11,290
healing skin diseases

683
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:13,910
or giving acupuncture for facial paralysis was nice.

684
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:15,510
Even if I couldn't cure them,

685
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:17,590
I wouldn't kill them,

686
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:19,110
right?

687
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:27,400
But

688
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,590
you never gave up on

689
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:31,930
any patient.

690
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:34,150
Sometimes,

691
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:35,800
you seem like

692
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:37,670
you're running away,

693
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:40,260
but it's never true,

694
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:42,060
right?

695
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:49,350
I know.

696
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:51,190
You want to say that

697
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:53,190
I'm a benevolent doctor.

698
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:54,790
I am indeed

699
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,190
a good doctor,

700
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:57,620
both talented and pretty,

701
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:58,880
Hua Tuo reincarnated,

702
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:01,000
and I provide good service.

703
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:02,540
You envy me.

704
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:03,790
Have a rest.

705
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,180
Thank you.

706
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:16,430
Actually...

707
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:19,210
Actually, you don't have to thank me.

708
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:23,910
I didn't even tell my mother

709
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:27,480
what I said to you just now.

710
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:33,030
But I'm happy.

711
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:35,270
Telling you these things

712
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:36,910
feels like...

713
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:39,830
Feels like...

714
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:43,340
I made a friend.

715
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:54,380
Maybe...

716
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:55,920
Maybe we’re not friends.

717
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,250
My name is Jiang Xinbai.

718
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:04,850
It's from the poem,

719
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:08,670
"the autumn moon in the heart of the river is pale."

720
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:10,430
My father's surname is Xi,

721
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:14,620
but I took my mother's surname.

722
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:25,760
What exactly do you do?

723
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,200
You're quite greedy.

724
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:31,990
I told you all of my

725
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:33,050
inside thoughts.

726
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:35,840
Can't we have a heart-to-heart exchange?

727
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:38,070
What you said just now

728
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:39,910
was what you wanted to say.

729
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:41,750
I didn't ask you to say it.

730
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:43,870
You...

731
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:46,990
You only say that after you heard everything.

732
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:48,390
My hand is still injured.

733
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:50,070
Stop pretending.

734
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:52,140
You look fine.

735
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:53,920
It hurts so much.

736
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:54,950
Who...

737
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:56,250
I don’t believe it.

738
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:13,910
Thank you, Dr. Yan,

739
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:15,440
for taking care of our boss.

740
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:19,830
Just call me Poison Girl.

741
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:22,390
I think you're very creative.

742
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:23,830
If I say that,

743
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:26,610
I'm afraid some people won't like it.

744
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:30,590
It doesn't matter if he likes it or not.

745
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:31,620
I accept it.

746
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,630
What a personality.

747
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:40,910
If you're done, let's get down to business.

748
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:41,430
My lord,

749
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,030
I've checked the supplement roster

750
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:44,710
of soldiers under Nan Jifeng.

751
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,290
In the two years

752
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,580
since Nan Jifeng was sent to Heman,

753
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:48,950
other than casualties

754
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:50,350
and discharged soldiers,

755
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:52,550
there are five unidentified deaths.

756
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,660
Yuwen Wu, Zhao Li, Du Tong,

757
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:59,130
Zhang Hui, and Zhu Ziquan.

758
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:00,580
[Yuwen Wu]

759
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:00,940
[Zhao Li]

760
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:01,400
[Du Tong]

761
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:01,780
[Zhang Hui]

762
00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:02,160
[Zhu Ziquan]

763
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:10,840
These five died in the first year

764
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:12,270
of Nan Jifeng's term.

765
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:14,730
Meanwhile, Nan Jifeng

766
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:16,070
only started pretending

767
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:17,440
to be alcoholic in the second year.
