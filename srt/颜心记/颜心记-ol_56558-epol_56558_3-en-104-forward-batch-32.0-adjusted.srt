[Episode 3]

4
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:27,070
We've worked together

5
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:28,590
in Lanna Village.

6
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:31,330
Why are you still doing this to me?

7
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,480
Do you have some

8
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,790
special fetish?

9
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,290
Do you need treatment?

10
00:02:41,229 --> 00:02:42,740
Why did you tie me up?

11
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:45,790
I'm talking to you.

12
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:46,950
Where are we going?

13
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:52,150
Back to Heman.

14
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,310
Heman?

15
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,190
Again?

16
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:57,930
You're so eager to meet General Nan.

17
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,910
Are you gonna use me as a pawn?

18
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:11,070
You know a lot about Zornia,

19
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,030
want to meet General Nan,

20
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:14,910
and even let me burn

21
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,110
the Zornia field.

22
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,230
Are you...

23
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,770
from another faction

24
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:20,850
smuggling Zornia?

25
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,110
Shut up.

26
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:24,230
Don't associate me

27
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,160
with that thing.

28
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,579
I'm relieved then.

Zornia's rampant despite multiple bans.

30
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:32,150
Even His Majesty sent a general

31
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,270
to guard Heman

32
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,820
to prevent its import.

33
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:37,970
Unfortunately, His Majesty sent the wrong person.

34
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:39,910
Do you think

35
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:42,060
General Nan owns that Zornia field

36
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,500
in Lanna Village?

37
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,350
If we go back to Heman,

38
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,830
we'll be caught!

39
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:47,990
Don't worry.

40
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,300
I'll keep you safe.

41
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:52,710
Easier said than done.

42
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,900
I don't believe it.

43
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:04,950
It's untied.

44
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:07,140
Did he untie me on purpose?

45
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,430
Should I run away or not?

46
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:13,250
I have to go back to find the antidote.

47
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:15,290
Instead of taking the risk alone,

48
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:16,550
it's safer to be

Is it wise to just

54

walk back like this?

55
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:42,010

Don't you drink?

67
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,980
I rarely see men who don't drink.

68
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:50,300
That means you haven't seen

69

enough men.

70
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,680
Why are you looking at me?

71
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,730
I'm taking

72
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:08,940
your advice

73
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:10,510
to look at men.

74
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,950
You were so worried,

75
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:17,760
yet you can joke with me now.

76
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:20,750
I can't escape anyway.

77
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,600
Might as well take it easy.

Besides,

79
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:25,320
didn't you say

80
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,580
you'll keep me safe?

81
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,610
You trust everything I say?

82
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,520
How can a martial artist

83
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:33,630
be so careless?

84
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:36,650
You don't understand.

87
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:42,800

89
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:45,770

we'll see.

Are you really not going to tell me?

Tell you what?

97
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:02,690
Since you wanted to arrest me,

98
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:04,810
why did you let me go

99
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:06,830
at the shabby temple?

100
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:15,080
Why do you think I let you go?

101
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:17,909
Is it because...

102
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:21,920
you can't recognize me?

103
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:36,430

Xinbai!

110
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,650
Don't come over.

111
00:08:04,909 --> 00:08:05,790
What's wrong?

112
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:07,710
I'm your mother.

113
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:11,010
Xinbai!

Duke hit his head

115
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,990
and blood stasis pressured his brain,

116
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:20,510
damaging the area

117
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:22,550
for facial recognition.

118
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:25,350
He's now face-blind.

119
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,750
You haven't told me yet.

120
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,870
Sometimes, there's no logic

behind one's actions.

122
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:54,100

on a whim.

124

You can't even lie.

125
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,390
Forget it.

126

Yan Nanxing.

127
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:06,350
Why don't you tell me

128
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:08,000
how you offended

129
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,030
General Nan?

130
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:16,470
The dishes are here.

131
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:21,180
The dishes are all here.

132
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:21,980
Please enjoy.

133
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:24,710
I have to explain it sooner or later.

134
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,550
Let's test this excuse

135
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:27,990
on him first.

136
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:32,470
Here's the thing.

137
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,540
The person in Her Ladyship's room that day

138
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:36,910
wasn't a man,

139
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:38,810
but a woman.

140
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:40,550
She's my senior.

141
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:44,710
I was missing

142
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:46,120
some herbs,

143
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:46,810
so I asked

144
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,230
my senior to help me.

145
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,510
As I went to prepare

146
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:50,630
the medicine,

147
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:51,830
only my senior

148
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:52,590
and Lady Gaya

149
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:53,790
were left in the room,

150
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:55,470
causing a misunderstanding.

151
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,800
General's Residence is heavily guarded.

152
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,990
You think all the guards are blind?

153
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:03,110
This is a secret that can't be told.

154
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:05,570
Don't you know?

155
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:06,930
My senior was born

156
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:08,220
with a masculine face

157
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:09,560
and sturdy physique.

158
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:11,790
She doesn't like being seen.

159
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:14,120
We are a trio of traveling doctors,

160
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,460
but outsiders only know about

161
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,080
my mother

162
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:19,470
and I.

163
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:23,640
While

164
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:25,670
being chased by soldiers, she fell into the water.

165
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:26,990
She told me all about

166
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:28,450
how you protected her.

167
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:29,830
Yan Nanxing.

168
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,390
You're full of nonsense

169
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:33,710
and so absurd.

170
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:35,930
It was clearly a man

171
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,490
who fell into the water.

172
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:39,410
Why insist it's a woman?

173
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:41,990
Burning the Zornia field

174
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,490
seems satisfying

175
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,240
but is in fact troublesome.

176
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:48,350
Impulsive, reckless, and cunning.

177
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:49,870
You are

178
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,030
really untrustworthy.

179
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,830
I didn't know

180
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,350
I'm so likeable.

181
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:57,950
What?

182
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:01,000
We've only spent a few days together

183
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:02,960
but you've described me

184
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:03,950
so precisely.

185
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:05,750
You must fancy me.

186
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:07,870
You're hopeless.

187
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,300
Don't deny it.

188
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:14,480
Please come in.

189
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:15,770
Bring me good wine and dishes!

190
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:16,170
Sure.

191
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:17,860
It’s so lively in Heman City.

192
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,440
What's the gossip?

193
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:20,830
Tell us now!

194
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:22,170
Didn't you see

195
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,020
the wanted posters

196
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,360
throughout the city?

197
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,330
I did!

198
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:28,750
I've met the mother and daughter

199
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:30,910
on the wanted poster.

200
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:34,150
I heard her daughter's pretty.

201
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,390
Yes, she is.

202
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:38,150
A loose woman too. Unusual!

203
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:39,560
Loose?

204
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:40,520
Has she no shame?

205
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:41,840
Tell us

206
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:42,800
what's going on.

207
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,420
I heard

208
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:47,190
the mother and daughter rented a house,

209
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:48,790
where

210
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,680
different men

211
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,790
come and go daily.

212
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:55,030
Old, middle-aged, and young;

213
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,380
all sorts!

214
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,850
Just super messy!

215
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:02,030
Are you serious?

216
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,500
Not only that,

217
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:09,790
some even saw a child.

218
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:10,990
A child?

219
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:11,950
Even a child?

220
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,300
There's no father,

221
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:14,400
so it must be

222
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:16,420
a bastard!

223
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:18,070
Bastard!

224
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,190
Yummy!

225
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:20,830
That's nothing.

226
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:22,190
To be wanted,

227
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:24,150
they must've committed many sins.

228
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:26,190
It could be deception

229
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:29,190
or even murder and robbery!

230
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:31,820
It's so complicated?

231
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:36,660
Why didn't that loose woman

232
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:37,900
come to us?

233
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,000
Who is it?

234
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:49,160
Who attacked me?

235
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:51,130
What a foul mouth.

236
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:53,100
A disgrace to mankind.

237
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:55,840
Is it your business?

238
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,420
You must be one of

239
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,670
her clients.

240
00:12:58,690 --> 00:12:59,440
Cut the crap!

241
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,030
Attack!

242
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:21,790
I was wrong. I'm sorry.

243
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:23,520
Go!

244
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:24,150
Hurry!

245
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:25,510
Hurry and go!

246
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:31,990
Eat up.

247
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:37,760
[Posthouse]

248
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,190
Here.

249
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,640
What's wrong?

250
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,210
Are you down too?

251
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:48,590
It's just nonsense.

252
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:51,070
Nonsense.

253
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:53,950
Is gossiping fun?

254
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:55,630
Spreading nonsense!

255
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:58,470
They even

256
00:14:58,910 --> 00:14:59,550
said they

257
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:00,800
saw me with many men.

258
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,280
Are they

259
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:03,440
blind?

260
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:08,030
I have a bastard kid?

261
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:10,430
You're the bastards!

262
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:13,510
Slandering others behind

263
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:14,240
their backs.

264
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,230
Why don't you write a novel?

265
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:18,880
Jerks.

266
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:22,180
Bastards!

267
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:25,050
Do you think I want this life?

268
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,540
Do you think I want

269
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:29,190
to change every day?

270
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:32,750
Who doesn't want

271
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:33,910
a stable life?

272
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,640
Who doesn't want to

273
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,640
hide at home with family

274
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:42,020
and make friends happily?

275
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:47,430
I want to make friends too.

276
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:51,960
What did I do wrong?

277
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:53,440
I clearly

278
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,110
did nothing wrong.

279
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,900
Why are the Heavens doing this to me?

280
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,430
I'm trying my best.

281
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:06,090
I'm doing so much to help others.

282
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,240
Why can't you

283
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:09,990
be nicer to me?

284
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,150
Why?

285
00:17:52,069 --> 00:17:52,790
Leave.

286
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,630
Go find your mother and senior.

287
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:57,470
Leave?

288
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:59,670
You're letting me go?

289
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:01,230
You believe me?

290
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:03,190
No.

291
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:04,710
Then why?

292
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,080
I don't believe your words,

293
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:08,210
but I believe

294
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:09,340
you're not a villain

295
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:10,430
and have

296
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:11,760
your own difficulties.

297
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,230
But I've changed my mind.

298
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,030
Anyway,

299
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:21,800
you said you can protect me.

300
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,910
I'll go back to Heman with you

301
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,000
and explain things

302
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:27,160
to that General Nan.

303
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:28,390
Being wanted isn't fun

304
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:29,270
anyway.

305
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:32,590
Risking it to go to Heman

306
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:34,340
just to explain things?

307
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,330
Like I'd believe that.

308
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:38,990
Let me ask you.

309
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:42,110
Why did you insist on entering his residence

310
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:43,670
that day?

311
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,550
Let's not pry into

312
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:46,960
each other's business.

313
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,820
Let's just be work partners.

314
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,560
That General Nan

315
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:53,660
is so strange.

316
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:56,120
Even if it's to find your antidote,

317
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,050
don't risk it

318
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:57,990
by going

319
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:58,750
to Heman.

320
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:00,720
What do you mean?

321
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,570
His wine

322
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:02,880
doesn't get you drunk!

323
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,280
Isn't he an alcoholic?

324
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,200
That's why something's off.

325
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:14,870
I know what you want.

326
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:16,470
I can help you.

327
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,630
Do you suspect

328
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:22,280
the Zornia field in Lanna Village

329
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:23,830
belonged to General Nan?

330
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:25,560
I have two pieces

331
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:26,530
of info

332
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,930
about him.

333
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:30,790
If you

334
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:32,070
promise to take me back

335
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:32,930
and protect me,

336
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:34,150
I'll tell you.

337
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:35,790
To show my sincerity,

338
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:36,990
I'll tell you one now.

339
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,790
Everyone knows

340
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:40,600
Nan Jifeng's an alcoholic.

341
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:43,770
Actually, he's never been drunk.

342
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:46,730
Something's off with his wine.

343
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:49,950
Isn't that

344
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,990
some valuable info?

345
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:54,370
The other's even more important.

346
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,190
If you send me back,

347
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:57,390
I'll tell you.

348
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,270
Yan Nanxing.

349
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,520
Are you afraid of death

350
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:02,890
or not?

351
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:05,270
I am.

352
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:08,170
But there are things I find

353
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:09,710
scarier than death

354
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:12,010

Since we're

both headed to General's Residence,

358

let's cooperate.

I don't trust you.

When you see the general,

just explain things.

If they don't believe you,

383
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:32,950
I'll vouch for you.

384
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,700
You have to protect me.

385
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:37,450
It doesn't matter.

386

You're lucky anyway.

You agreed to cooperate.

390
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:45,950
You can't ignore me.

391

It's you again!

Give me this wanted criminal.

for interrogation by the general.

406

You want to arrest her

407
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:33,530
without any evidence.

408
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:35,870

00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:22,480
I have no respect for the law?

412
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:26,910
I dare not.

don't you think?

Then I have to thank you.

Imprisoning someone is

421

illegal.

422

then it does.

532
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,350
Where are you going? Keep drinking!

533
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:57,270
Remember our deal.

534
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:57,940
Careful.

535
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:58,800
Keep drinking.

536
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:01,970
Practice and come back tomorrow.

537
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:03,720
I haven't had enough!

538
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:05,050
Why did you drink so much?

539
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:05,780
Yan Nanxing.

540
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:07,250
Don't fall into the river!

541
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,110
Careful.

542
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:08,950
Yan Nanxing.

543
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:11,950
Yan Nanxing.

544
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:12,870
I'm here.

545
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:14,680
Yan Nanxing.

546
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:15,970
What's wrong with you?

547
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:17,110
Yan Nanxing.

548
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:17,770
What is it?

549
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:18,630
Yan Nanxing!

550
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:22,510
What are you doing?

551
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,920
Are you trying to

552
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:25,150
take advantage of me?

553
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:26,680
I don't trust you,

554
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,660
as I can't see you clearly.

555
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:34,550
I really can't.

556
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:45,350
What?

557
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:52,070
These are... your eyebrows.

558
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:55,790
Your eyes.

559
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:01,190
Your nose.

560
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,840
Your mouth.

561
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:14,310
Yan Nanxing.

562
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:17,870
What do you look like?

563
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:21,840
I really can't see clearly.

564
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:23,510
I...

565
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:25,030
So I...

566
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:28,660
I don't dare believe you.

567
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:42,350
Forget it.

568
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:44,010
It's not my first kiss.

569
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:45,800
Just think of it as a dog's bite.

570
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:52,690
You're bleeding.

571
00:31:58,190 --> 00:32:00,270
I-I'm... I'm fine.

572
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:02,790
You're bleeding so much.

573
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:05,190
It must hurt.

574
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:08,100
Why are you so careless?

575
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,150
Look at you.

576
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:12,550
Dr. Yan.

577
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:16,430
Excuse me.

578
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:17,810
Carry on.

579
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:18,750
I...

580
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,170
Yan Nanxing.

581
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:22,470
Here.

582
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:23,390
Sit down.

583
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:25,960
Slowly.

584
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:30,190
Don't move.

585
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:33,190
It's loose.

586
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:35,590
Let me wrap it for you.

587
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:40,070
Does it hurt?

588
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:45,550
No.

589
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:53,950
Really?

590
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:03,630
That's good.

591
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:05,670
Remember,

592
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:08,420
I wrapped this for you.

593
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:17,310
My head hurts.

594
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:28,230
Yan Nanxing.

595
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:31,770
I want to watch fireworks.

596
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:36,110
Watch fireworks.

597
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:38,870
The beautiful ones

598
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:40,850
that are big...

599
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:43,070
and dazzling.

600
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:48,550
Look.

601
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:50,910
Those

602
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:52,870
big

603
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:55,290
and beautiful ones...

604
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:58,910
Filling the entire sky.

605
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:25,920
♫I'll fetch you the moon in my heart♫

606
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:28,200
♫I dream of the courtyard♫

607
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:31,390
♫It knows my heart♫

608
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:34,320
♫I want to return triumphantly with you♫

609
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:33,750
So beautiful.

610
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:36,420
♫We can listen to the rain♫

611
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,440
Of course it's beautiful.

612
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:37,630
It's so expensive.

613
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:40,560
♫And watch the snowfall in the west hills♫

614
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:39,110
I paid so much for them.

615
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:41,989
Haven't you seen fireworks before?

616
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,699
♫On the streets, the alleys, and the palace♫

617
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:43,639
Must you watch it today?

618
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,830
♫We shall always meet♫

619
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:45,949
Are you done?

620
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:49,739
♫I only hope you fall into my heart♫

621
00:34:46,469 --> 00:34:47,800
Bro, I want to go back...

622
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:52,159
♫The fire warms winter days♫

623
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,790
♫Spring can take its time♫

624
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:58,650
♫Everything is as you wish♫

625
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,630
♫We meet with our hearts♫

626
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:03,090
♫Let's not miss each other♫

627
00:35:03,239 --> 00:35:07,270
♫You're what I always think about♫

628
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:09,449
♫I'm willing to go to the sky for you♫

629
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:12,270
♫To pluck the moon above the clouds♫

630
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:16,480
♫I'd knit a whole galaxy for you♫

631

♫We meet with our hearts♫

632

♫I'll grow old for you♫

634
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:27,389
♫I want this flower to bloom and never wilt♫

635

637
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:36,330

650
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:58,730
Mr. Xi.

651
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:00,510
Can you recognize me?

652
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:04,400
What are you talking about? I don't get it.

653
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:07,190
Now you're playing dumb?

654
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:10,190
Are you going to lose your memory later?

655
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:12,630
Can you recognize me?

656
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:13,630
Recognize her?

657
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:16,010
Why's she asking that?

658
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,430
What happened?

659
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:20,690
Yes, even if you turn into ashes.

660
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:23,590
Am I that unforgettable?

661
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:55,670
Where am I?

662
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:57,440
You're in

663
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,280
the General's Residence...

664
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:00,830
My guest room.

665
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:05,050
Why am I here?

666
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:06,690
Why are you here?

667
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:07,900
Ask yourself.

668
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:10,510
You were drunk and refused to leave.

669
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,580
I had to bring you back.

670
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:15,150
I was drunk?

671
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,400
What else did I do?

672
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:23,870
What did you do?

673
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:25,550
Ask yourself.

674
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,480
You

675
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:29,830
touched me from head to toe.

676
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:36,220
You even

677
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,150
told me many, many things.

678
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:42,750
What did I say?

679
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,420
You said...

680
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:49,290
your surname is Xi.

681
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:51,290
You're a tea merchant.

682
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:53,310
You came to Heman

683
00:38:53,370 --> 00:38:54,230
to do business.

684
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:55,710
You also said

685
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:58,270
you feel an affinity with me

686
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,000
and want to give me

687
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:01,290
all your earnings.

688
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,210
You're lying again.

689
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:05,440
I couldn't have told you all that.

690
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:08,430
Drunk words are sober thoughts.

691
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:10,880
Since you said I lied,

692
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:12,950
it can only prove...

693
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:15,910
your surname isn't Xi

694
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,410
and you aren't

695
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:19,770
a tea merchant here for business.

696
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:23,140
You're lying.

697
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:29,450
You don't scare me.

698
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,800
Stare all you want!

699
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:33,460
But don't worry.

700
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:35,260
I won't foil your plans.

701
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:36,390
I can tell

702
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,710
you're also a good man

703
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:39,170
with ulterior motives.

704
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:43,670
A good man?

705
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:46,950
How can you be so sure?

706
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:49,730
You've been protecting me all the way

707
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:51,020
and saved

708
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:52,440
Lanna villagers with me.

709
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,750
I have

710
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:55,430
a sense of loyalty.

711
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:58,310
Since you protected me,

712
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,190
if you need anything,

713
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:01,010
I'll help you.

714
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,550
As long as it

715
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:03,750
doesn't cost money

716
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:04,410
or my life.

717
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:10,270
It can't cost money or your life.

718
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:12,450
Then what can you do for me?

719
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,160
Isn't it obvious?

720
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:16,930
I can put my beauty to good use.

721
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,320
As a girl,

722
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:23,230
can you not be so...

723
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:23,710
So...

724
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:25,170
So... So...

725
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:26,870
shameless, right?

726
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:29,020
I really

727
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:30,270
don't have

728
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:32,020
the slightest sense of shame.

729
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:32,830
You...

730
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,260
Are you really angry?

731
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:35,830
That makes me

732
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,750
so happy.

733
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:43,290
What are you doing?

734
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:45,480
What do you want?

735
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:48,040
Are you really this kind of person?

736
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:49,260
It's broad daylight.

737
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:50,510
Can't you

738
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:51,870
take a joke?

739
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:53,070
I never

740
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:54,330
joke around.

741
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:56,190
Yan Nanxing.

742
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,300
I don't care about your past.

743
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:00,130
Now, remember this.

744
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:02,110
From the moment we came back

745
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:02,990
to Heman,

746
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:04,840
every moment

747
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:06,750
is no longer a joke.
