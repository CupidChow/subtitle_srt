5
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,389
Yi Yuanshan, the Marshal of Tingzhou,

6
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:10,050
went to Lin County yesterday.

7
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,400
What a coincidence.

8
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,040
He left on the day

9
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:13,790
you arrived.

10
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,300
Isn't he deliberately avoiding you?

11
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:19,150
He can run, but he can't hide.

12
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,690
Since Yi Yuanshan is not here,

13
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,750
we have time to do private business.

14
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:26,800
Among the bandits in Tingzhou,

15
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,030
the two most powerful gangs

16
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:30,030
are the Baiyuan Gang and Heiao Gang.

17
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,430
The Baiyuan Gang

18
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,450
opened a gambling house

19
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:33,490
in Yunmu Market.

20
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:34,710
My lord,

21
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:37,030
why do you want to investigate the Baiyuan Gang first?

22
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,560
Compared to the Heiao Gang,

23
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,310
are they more likely to have

24
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,860
killed General Nan?

25
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:45,790
Not necessarily.

26
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:48,150
Haven't you conducted

27
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,810
a round of inquiries already?

28
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,130
As long as it's profitable, the Heiao Gang

29
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:54,450
never hesitates to

30
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,730
kill and snatch goods.

31
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,840
But the Baiyuan Gang is different.

32
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,140
They never kill people easily.

33
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,070
They even saved merchants

34
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:03,130
from the Heiao Gang

35
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:04,190
to receive large sums of

36
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:06,250
protection fees from the merchants.

37
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:09,830
This Bai Yuan

38
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:11,870
is a bandit with principles.

39
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:14,510
Maybe

40
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,820
I can borrow Bai Yuan's power

41
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,420
to deal with Yi Yuanshan.

42
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,420
You're right, my lord.

43

Chief Bai.

When it comes to dealing with bandits,

91
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,810
there are two more ways

92

other than eradicating them.

93
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:12,950
One is to recruit,

94
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,090
the other is to pacify.

95
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:18,590
Which method

96
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:20,920
are you planning to use?

97

The previous regional inspectors

98

Recruit us?

100
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,070
That's right.

I'll try pacifying you instead.

105
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:42,690

How arrogant.

No.

Bai Yuan

148

Bai Yuan is the person

153

Not necessarily.

154

But this person

155

has a backbone.

156
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:56,970
I think he isn't the kind to accept

157
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:58,030
a deal as lowly

158
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:59,510
as killing for money.

159
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:03,210

160

gone in with you.

163
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:09,630
they would have recognized me immediately.

from their reactions.

166

went in with me just now,

171

00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,550
Not only was he not mad,

179
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:45,110
but he said he would consider it.

180
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:48,870
So,

181
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:50,390
is he really

182
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:51,790
involved with Zornia?

183
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:55,470
Maybe

184
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:58,440
he already knows my intention.

185
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:00,350
He wants to stabilize me.

186
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,830
Even if he isn't involved in

187

Zornia trade,

188
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:08,010
he should know that

189
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,070
there must be Zornia

190
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:11,840
in Tingzhou.

Alternatively,

192
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:18,190
he may know who

193
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:20,200
is behind the Zornia trade.

194
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,320
Chief, I don't get it.

195

Why did you let him go?

196
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,710
Don't act rashly.

197
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:30,910
Are we really giving him the 70% cut?

198
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,370
That's daylight robbery!

199
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:35,200
And are you not a robber?

get another gang to do it?

he wanted to do business.

One year ago,

279
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:50,470
Ms. Yan went to Heman to practice medicine.

280
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,280
She stole my

281
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,570
pharmacy's business.

282
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:54,350
If she were just

283
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:55,830
practicing medicine,

284
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:56,990
it would have been fine.

285
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:58,550
But I couldn't stand

00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:00,710
the little tricks she was using.

287
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:02,600
So I had a

match with her.

289
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,440
But she played a dirty trick

290
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:07,010
and made me lose in public.

291
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:08,800
It was humiliating.

292
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:12,270
But she doesn't seem to know you.

00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:24,550
Tell me.

300
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:26,319
Shouldn't I redeem myself?

301
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:28,550
I see.

302
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:31,390

00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:00,490
you lost sleep last night too?

309
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:03,800
I'm so angry.

310
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:07,270
What should we do?

311
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:13,970

she doesn't agree to the competition,

325
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:42,150
or

326
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,390
what if we lose?

327
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,110
I'll propose it to them.

328
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:46,790
They can't

329
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:47,390
possibly reject a proposal

I have faith in you.

333
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:58,750
That move might not work.

334
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:02,990
I don't think

335
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,200
they are here

336

I don't even know her.

341
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,150
Then why

342
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:18,480

00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:19,830
How would I know?

344
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,190
Think about it.

00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:45,870
beauty cream from Beauty of the City,

353
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:47,530
and your skin acted up, right?

354
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:49,600
What did you buy?

355
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,460
This one.

356
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,690
Fragrance powder and fragrance cream.

357
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,280
My shop's creams and ointments

358
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:21,470
[Special discount]

359
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,010
are all made from valuable herbs.

360
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:19,610
How could there be a problem?

361
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:21,220
In my opinion,

362
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:23,270
the ointment you used before

363
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:24,030
was too cheap.

364
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,810
It clashed with my quality goods

365
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:27,430
and caused the skin breakout.

366
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:28,150
Nonsense.

367
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:30,080
These ladies

368
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,190
have been patronizing

369
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:32,920
Blossom Beauty for a while now.

370
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,060
Their faces had always been fine.

371
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,800
How did they get a breakout

372
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:38,750
one day after using your products?

373
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:41,000
There must be something wrong with your products!

374
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,680
That's right!

375
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,710
That means...

376
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:46,820
The toxins in your ointments

377
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,190
are slow-acting.

378
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:49,470
That's right.

379
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,510
Ms. Yen,

380
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,980
you're talented at inverting the truth.

381
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,150
We have witnesses and evidence.

382
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:59,390
Dare you go for an examination with me?

383
00:20:59,390 --> 00:20:59,830
Boss.

384
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:01,550
Don't bother reasoning with her.

385
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:02,880
I'll teach her a lesson.

386
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:05,310
Don't mess up our formation.

387
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:07,870
Looks like you're determined

388
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:09,150
to extort me today.

389
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:10,750
Tell me what you want.

390
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:12,850
Compensation, right?

391
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:15,510
That's not enough.

392
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:17,850
Not only do you need to compensate them,

393
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:19,850
but I also want you to put up apology posters

394
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:21,050
all over the capital.

395
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:22,070
Lastly,

396
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:24,160
I want you to close the shop.

397
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:25,120
Close down!

398
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:25,800
Close down!

399
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:26,590
Close down!

400
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,080
Ms. Yan,

401
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:31,030
you can't bully us civilians

402
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:31,830
just because you are married

403
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,380
to the Duke of Yuejiang.

404
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,720
Where's the justice?

405
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:36,780
Justice!

406
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,530
Justice!

407
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,330
Justice!

408
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:39,990
You want justice?

409
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:41,230
Sure.

410
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:44,750
Make a report at the Inspection Office.

411
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:49,840
I'm sure

412
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,740
you are the Duchess of Yuejiang.

413
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:53,590
That's right.

414
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:55,830
How...

415
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,190
Elegant and graceful.

416
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:04,870
It's my honor

417
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:06,610
to have you here at my shop.

418
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:10,040
Don't try to get close to me.

419
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:12,710
Ms. Yen.

420
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:14,540
If you want to fight me,

421
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:16,220
do it fair and square.

422
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,350
Don't play these

423
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,350
dirty tricks.

424
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:22,270
Who's playing dirty tricks?

425
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:23,640
A few days ago,

426
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:25,630
you watered my fortune plant to death!

427
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:26,270
Nonsense!

428
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:28,070
Did you see

429
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:29,270
us do it?

430
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:32,590
So?

431
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:35,510
Can I have a word with you?

432
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:41,350
Ms. Yan,

433
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:42,870
what can I do for you?

434
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,360
You're not here to steal my business.

435
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,870
You're targeting me.

436
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,070
You're dragging me down regardless of cost

437
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:51,000
and imitating my beauty products.

438
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,130
We have Jade Powder,

439
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,620
you have Jadeite Powder.

440
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:54,870
I have Seven White Cream,

441
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:56,270
and you made the Six White Cream.

442
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:57,590
Our product is called the Fairy Powder,

443
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:59,450
and yours is called Farie Powder.

444
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:00,060
Tell me.

445
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,880
Why are you

446
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:03,600
mindlessly copying me?

447
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:05,610
Cang Jie invented the Chinese characters,

448
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:06,770
not Blossom Beauty.

449
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,030
Is it illegal to use them however I want?

450
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:11,200
You're so shameless.

451
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,530
You think I wouldn't...

452
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:16,430
Ms. Yan...

453
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:17,710
First you argue with me,

454
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:18,770
and now you slap me?

455
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,720
You slapped me again!

456
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:25,590
[Beauty of the City]

457
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:26,570
Ms. Yan, how could you slap me?

458
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,400
You're accusing me!

459
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:30,190
She slapped herself

460
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:30,920
and accused me!

461
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,550
You didn't slap her?

462
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:32,030
I didn't.

463
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:33,110
Why would I slap her?

464
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:34,370
She's picking a fight.

465
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:35,670
If you keep talking,

466
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:37,070
I'll tear your mouth off.

467
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:38,510
Your Grace,

468
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:39,870
you have to uphold justice for me.

469
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:41,070
Ms. Yan slapped me!

470
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:42,640
I'm her in-law.

471
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:44,030
Why would I uphold

472
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:45,110
justice for you?

473
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:48,930
Since there's no space for reasoning,

474
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:50,190
I'll be unreasonable!

475
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:51,120
Sisters,

476
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:52,550
we can't be bullied.

477
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:54,310
Tear Blossom Beauty

478
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:55,600
apart!

479
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:56,910
Who dares?

480
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:59,510
I'm here today.

481
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:02,640
Don't you dare mess with Blossom Beauty.

482
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:16,760
Sai'er, be careful!

483
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:24,320
Yan Nanxing!

484
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:25,390
Stop!

485
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:32,710
Officer!

486
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:39,070
Officer!

487
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:44,980
Sai'er, are you okay?

488
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:45,630
I'm fine.

489
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:46,400
Are you hurt?

490
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:46,950
No.

491
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:48,430
Shang, hear me out.

492
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:50,130
She wants to tear Blossom Beauty down.

493
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:51,320
Her. It's her.

494
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:52,630
Ridiculous!

495
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:55,580
But Blossom Beauty is completely fine.

496
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:57,910
My Beauty of the City is ruined.

497
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:00,030
What nonsense are you talking about?

498
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:01,150
I'm not talking nonsense!

499
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:02,430
Look at my shop!

500
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:03,210
What should I do?

501
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:04,230
My Beauty of the City!

502
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,360
Why are you here too?

503
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:07,550
It's a long story.

504
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:09,710
Enough of that!

505
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:11,150
My shop!

506
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:11,960
What should I do?

507
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:12,680
Wait.

508
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:17,770
Where is my mother?

509
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:19,530
Where is my mother?

510
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:22,390
Where is my mother?

511
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:23,030
Mother?

512
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:25,110
Mother...

513
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:28,310
Mother!

514
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,700
Why do you still look so pale?

515
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,770
Mother, let me take a look.

516
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:49,390
For what?

517
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,280
I...

518
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:54,550
I'm fine.

519
00:26:58,190 --> 00:26:58,990
Maybe

520
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:02,030
it's been too long since I last fought,

521
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,480
and my stamina couldn't keep up.

522
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:05,870
Enough of that.

523
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:07,430
Let me take a rest.

524
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:09,670
Leave me alone.

525
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:11,370
How can I leave you alone?

526
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:12,630
Auntie.

527
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,390
Have some water.

528
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:17,330
Do you feel better?

529
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:18,870
I'm completely fine.

530
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:20,990
You don't have to take care of me.

531
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:22,040
Give it to me.

532
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:26,430
Alright.

533
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,530
If you're free,

534
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:30,950
go to the Chinese medicine shop and get me some medicine.

535
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:31,470
Okay.

536
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:39,040
Are you really fine?

537
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,150
Really.

538
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:42,920
When you saw

539
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:43,820
Ms. Yen today,

540
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:44,790
you looked pale.

541
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:45,750
What's wrong?

542
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:50,950
I think this Ms. Yen

543
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:52,920
is on the same side as the people

544
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,320
who drugged me back then.

545
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:56,830
Really?

546
00:27:58,030 --> 00:27:58,760
Are you sure?

547
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:01,030
I'm not sure.

548
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:04,710
Was she acting strange?

549
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:06,190
I don't think she was.

550
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:08,440
But I don't think Ms. Yen

551
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:10,000
knows any martial arts.

552
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:11,950
Are you stupid?

553
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:13,770
It's easy for masters

554
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:14,990
to pretend not to know

555
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:15,900
martial arts.

556
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:19,030
By the way,

557
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:19,870
Mother,

558
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:23,120
the last time I transformed

559
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:24,880
wasn't before or after the full moon.

560
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,040
So you mean

561
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:29,750
the time is not accurate anymore?

562
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:30,550
Yes.

563
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:33,070
When was the last time

564
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:34,070
you transformed?

565
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:37,640
The night

566
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:40,470
we got married.

567
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:44,130
Then...

568
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:45,750
Is it because

569
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:46,550
of the skinship?

570
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:47,240
No, no, no.

571
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,230
It's not what you think.

572
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:49,910
Doesn't that mean Jiang Xinbai

573
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:51,640
knows that you can shapeshift?

574
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,230
Forget it.

575
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,230
Forget about him.

576
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:55,070
I have a plan.

577
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:56,790
My priority right now

578
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:57,870
is to confirm if

579
00:28:57,950 --> 00:28:58,610
that Ms. Yen

580
00:28:58,740 --> 00:28:59,550
is really allies with those

581
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:00,410
who drugged me.

582
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:01,950
Okay, let's go together.

583
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,600
I can go by myself.

584
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:04,630
I'll go by myself.

585
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:05,430
You rest here.

586
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:06,910
Listen to me.

587
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:07,920
Half an hour.

588
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:09,430
Just wait for half an hour.

589
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:10,200
If I don't come back,

590
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,710
you can go and save me, okay?

591
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:13,070
It's settled. Half an hour.

592
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:14,120
Wait for me. Don't run off on your own!

593
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:14,790
Half an hour!

594
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:15,190
Okay!

595
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:30,680
I told you to run the shop,

596
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,350
and you really took yourself

597
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,080
for the boss?

598
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,740
Our people drugged her back then,

599
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:40,770
but she's still alive to this day.

600
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:41,920
Aren't you curious?

601
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:51,850
For our drug to succeed,

602
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,190
the key

603
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:54,910
is Yan Nanxing.

604
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:57,190
So...

605
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:01,880
Work hard.

606
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:15,700
Let me see.

607
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:23,810
It won't hurt anymore.

608
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:50,570
I wanted to

609
00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:52,390
play with you for a few more months.

610
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:53,390
I didn't expect

611
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:55,030
you to be so eager to die.

612
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:57,430
You can't blame me for this.

613
00:30:58,350 --> 00:30:59,390
Back in Yazhou,

614
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:01,790
you guys poisoned me.

615
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:04,310
What's the rush?

616
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:06,320
We have plenty of time

617
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:08,320
to talk about it.

618
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:18,510
God

619
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:20,950
is so kind to beauties.

620
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:22,510
Everyone we tested the drug on

621
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:23,600
died.

622
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,590
Only you survived.

623
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:28,230
Drug testing?

624
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:31,270
How many people have you killed?

625
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:33,640
Who would bother to keep count?

626
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:40,470
Aren't you capable?

627
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,740
Come, smell it.

628
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:45,350
Does it smell familiar?

629
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:50,790
Zornia.

630
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:53,470
The poison you gave me back then

631
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:54,730
was processed Zornia!

632
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:01,750
It’s late.

633
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:03,650
Why hasn’t Boss returned?

634
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:05,230
Will she

635
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:06,960
disappear for a few days again?

636
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:12,870
Don't go.

637
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:14,630
You brat!

638
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:19,430
Auntie, are you alright?

639
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:23,330
Where is your boss?

640
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:25,710
I don't know where she is.

641
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:27,110
She hasn't come back yet.

642
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:30,070
What time is it already?

643
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:35,050
It's already dark?

644
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:38,830
Take your weapons

645
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,040
and follow me.

646
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:51,370
[Blossom Beauty]

647
00:32:58,630 --> 00:32:59,350
Since you know

648
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:00,670
everything now,

649
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:02,270
isn't it time for you

650
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:03,750
to tell me the truth?

651
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:06,710
How did you survive back then?

652
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:09,010
I was tough!

653
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:12,010
You are tough

654
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,180
and stubborn too.

655
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:17,350
You can't escape anyway.

656
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:19,550
I don't mind telling you

657
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:20,350
more secrets.

658
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:23,870
Back then, we originally

659
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:25,190
made this drug

660
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:26,920
to control people's minds.

661
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:30,110
Unfortunately, everyone who tested

662
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:31,190
the drug died.

663
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:33,870
They bled from their orifices and died.

664
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:36,590
So miserable.

665
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:40,170
You approached me on purpose.

666
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,110
You're smart.

667
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:44,750
As expected from the boss of Blossom Beauty.

668
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:45,880
You're quite smart.

669
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:48,070
Just because I'm the only

670
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:48,710
survivor?

671
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,830
You're also our breakthrough

672
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:52,230
for this drug.

673
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:54,610
Were you looking for me

674
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:56,150
to cultivate poison?

675
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:00,440
If you don't want to suffer,

676
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:02,350
just tell me.

677
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,430
How did your body react

678
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:06,030
after taking this medicine?

679
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:08,949
Why should I tell you?

680
00:34:09,469 --> 00:34:10,670
What benefit do I get?

681
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,449
After we improve this drug,

682
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:15,199
no one will die from it anymore.

683
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:17,429
If no one dies from it,

684
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:19,190
you'll earn great merits

685
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:21,650
and live a good life in your next life.

686
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:34,239
You're so stubborn.

687
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,280
Don't blame me

688
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:36,429
for being cruel.

689
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:38,590
You can't even get

690
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:40,350
a happy death.

691
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:43,560
What are you going to do?

692
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:12,630
Zornia?

693
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:14,550
Auntie, Ruoqian.

694
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:17,310
There is Zornia here.

695
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:17,750
Also,

696
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:19,280
there's Boss's scent here.

697
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:20,450
Indeed.

698
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,340
You have a sharp nose.

699
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:21,870
Let's go.

700
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:22,510
Hurry!

701
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:58,990
I see!

702
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:04,830
You're amazing.

703
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:06,700
You can shapeshift?

704
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:10,580
And you became so fat.

705
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:12,750
What's wrong with being fat? Did I eat your food?

706
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:13,590
Hands off!

707
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:18,600
You got fatter and more hot-tempered.

708
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,700
Let me tell you,

709
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:21,040
it's all just bloating.

710
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:23,190
I will

711
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:25,310
let your blood out later

712
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,210
and you'll look thin again.

713
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:28,700
No, no, no!

714
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:30,030
Don't touch my face.

715
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:31,530
I have to rely on my face.

716
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:33,990
To be honest, it really is bloating.

717
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,230
I'm also short of blood and energy.

718
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:36,110
My liver is stagnant with blood stasis.

719
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,150
I have a weak kidney and recurring headache.

720
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:38,550
Basically, I'm very sick.

721
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:40,610
It's useless for you to take my blood.

722
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:43,810
Really?

723
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:45,300
Besides,

724
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,920
I've shapeshifted into a lot of people.

725
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:49,210
Men, women, old, and young,

726
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,470
with all kinds of diseases.

727
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:52,330
Heart disease, tuberculosis, dementia,

728
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:53,130
all of them.

729
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:53,870
Think about it.

730
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:55,150
Everyone's blood is different.

731
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:56,350
Right? It's useless.

732
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:01,390
Don't play tricks with me.

733
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:03,110
All changes are variations of the original form.

734
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:05,500
As long as it's your blood,

735
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:06,590
it'll work.

736
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:07,580
No, no.

737
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,750
Fatty beauty, goodbye.

738
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,570
No...

739
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,030
Boss!

740
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:16,760
Boss!

741
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:17,870
Not you.

742
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:20,230
Boss!

743
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:21,430
Ruoqian.

744
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:22,130
Boss?

745
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:29,370
I really like your appearance

746
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:30,670
this time.

747
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:32,620
It's so lovely and chubby.

748
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:33,830
Alright, Mother!

749
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:36,310
Stop it. Untie me.

750
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:38,520
Stop looking.

751
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:39,590
Your boss is here.

752
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:46,870
Look at her chin and lips.

753
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:47,550
So chubby.

754
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:49,550
-Boss?
-Boss?

755
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,320
Auntie...

756
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:56,900
-Is there something wrong with your eyes?
-Is there something wrong with your eyes?

757
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,700
-Are you sure she’s Boss?
-Are you sure she’s Boss?

758
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:01,350
Are you blind?

759
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:03,230
You can't recognize her looks,

760
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:04,510
but can't you smell her scent?

761
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:05,390
Untie her.

762
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:12,440
Boss?

763
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:12,910
Yes.

764
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:15,030
Boss?

765
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:15,670
It’s me.

766
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:17,690
-Boss...
-Boss...

767
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:18,550
That's enough.

768
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:19,630
Enough.

769
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:20,350
Boss.

770
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,540
That’s enough.

771
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:22,930
I said that's enough!

772
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:25,310
I'll explain to you later.

773
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:26,240
Tie her up first.

774
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:27,230
Here.

775
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:28,740
Okay, let's go.

776
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:39,110
Stop struggling.

777
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:41,090
Our boss has something to ask you.

778
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:44,550
Speak.

779
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:46,110
Who is your boss?

780
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,470
How does the drug

781
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:48,790
control people's minds?

782
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:50,030
He won't let you go.

783
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,110
Tell me who he is!

784
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:56,870
Whoever he wants to kill must die.

785
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:00,270
You all have to die.

786
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,550
Jiang Xinbai must die too.

787
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:06,500
How dare you target Jiang Xinbai too?

788
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:07,830
Tell me who your boss is!

789
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:08,710
What's his name?

790
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:09,590
Or I'll turn your long face

791
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:10,520
into a round one!

792
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:12,750
Don't bite your tongue off!

793
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:14,350
I won’t let you die! Tell me!

794
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:17,710
Boss, Boss!

795
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:17,990
Say it!

796
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:18,320
Boss.

797
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:19,510
Boss, I'm here.

798
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:19,950
Say it!

799
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:20,630
Say it!

800
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,270
Sai'er!

801
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:25,030
What are you doing?

802
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,390
This can control people's minds, right?

803
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:27,450
We can try it on her.

804
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:29,070
This drug is lethal!

805
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,870
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

806
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,110
I didn't know.

807
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:39,710
Yan...

808
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:41,690
Wake up.

809
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:42,510
Wake up!

810
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:44,510
Wake up!

811
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:58,390
She died so quickly.

812
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:02,110
You're so cruel.

813
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:03,710
I...

814
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:06,430
We didn't get a single word from her.
