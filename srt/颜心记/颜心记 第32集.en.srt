Chief,

6
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,220
I've done what you asked me to do.

7
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:57,610
Other than Yi Yuanshan,

8
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:59,470
how were the others taken care of?

9
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:01,240
You only asked me to kill Yi Yuanshan,

10
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,440
so I did what was told.

11
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:06,780
But Chief,

12
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,470
I think we should also eliminate

00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:11,180
Jiang Xinbai and his wife

14
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:12,810

15
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,230
They're useful.

16

You want to keep Yan Nanxing, right?

I'm full.

20
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,079
No need anymore.

No, I'm fine too.

That's good.

look.

38
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:45,780
Zornia.

39
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:08,930
The Zornia here

40
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,030
smells different

41
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:11,870
from before.

42
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:14,340
Maybe it's because it's grown

43
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:17,200
in a different place.

44
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,620
What's wrong, Xinbai?

45
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,690
Do you have a headache?

Yes.

49

Don't worry.

50
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:39,610
I didn't expect

51
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,150
something so evil

52
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:44,550
to grow even in a desert.

53
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:47,420
Desert?

54
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,190
The weather here is warm.

55

The land is moist.

56
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:19,010
It's quite similar to the South.

57
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:21,790
However, no Zornia field

58

Actually,

145
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,440
I wanted to tell you that day

146
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,710
that I was the one you were looking for.

147

the fireworks interrupted me.

Then,

150

I wanted to wait

151
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,340

152
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,470

I know. I know.

154
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,020

Yan Nanxing,

the people who drugged you

158
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,160
are the same as the people

159
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,470
who killed my father.

160
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:39,670
I will

161
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,400
make them pay sooner or later.

162
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,180
But

163
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:46,630
I...

164
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,510
I don't want to get you involved again.

165

But you have to promise me

170
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,280
that you won't hide anything

171
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,990
from me in the future.

172

As long as you are here,

I won't be afraid of anything.

174
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,190
Okay.

175
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:33,710
I promise you.

00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:50,060
[Shanli Hall]

177
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,270
Chancellor, are you hungry?

178
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:52,710
I'll cook for you.

179
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:55,440
Prepare some tea for me.

180
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:56,900
Sure.

181
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:02,440
Chancellor,

182
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:03,750
tea for you.

183
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:19,680
I always

184
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,380
turn this place into a mess.

185
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:22,910
You just tidied up

186
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,240
and I messed it up again.

187
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:25,600
Would you

188
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,030
feel annoyed?

189
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:28,590
No.

190
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:30,500
My Boss used to be like this.

191
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:32,180
I'd tidy up the product shelves

192
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,840
and she'd make it messy again.

193
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:35,020
I'd try to scold her,

194
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,470
but she'd even argue with me.

195
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:37,880
She'd say

196
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,920
there's a method to the madness.

197
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:43,090
You really

198
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:44,220
care for your Boss.

199
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:46,070
Instead of caring,

200
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:47,870
it's more like worrying.

201
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:50,070
My Boss and Sai'er

202
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:52,340
both have careless personalities.

203
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,380
Let me shamelessly say

204
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,620
that without me, Blossom Beauty

205
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:57,870
would fall apart.

206
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:01,720
Liu Ruoqian.

207
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:05,110
Didn't you say you're mine?

208
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:07,920
Why do you care so much about everyone?

209
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,270
I married Boss off.

210
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,050
Sai'er and I are her maiden family.

211
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,540
I must care for them.

212
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:18,960
But

213
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,140
it's different with you.

214
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,950
I treat you as a good teacher and friend.

215
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:25,110
Let me ask you.

216
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:27,920
If Yan Nanxing and I

217
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:29,280
were on opposing sides,

218
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:31,700
who would you help?

219
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,260
Why would you be on opposing sides?

220
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,190
I'm just asking.

221
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:35,950
If I

222
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,470
had conflicts with your family,

223
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:38,530
who would you help?

224
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:39,140
You.

225
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:41,950
Really?

226
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:47,790
Why?

227
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:49,710
Because if I help you,

228
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:50,860
Boss won’t blame me.

229
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:58,470
I shouldn't have asked.

230
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:01,680
You always say I'm your friend,

231
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:03,870
but my definition of friends

232
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,780
is different from yours.

233
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:06,850
You said before

234
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,360
that the people who stay by your side

235
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:11,000
no matter when, where, or what

236
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,910
are your friends.

237
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:13,990
That's right.

238
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:15,850
I'm just an unreasonable person.

239
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,020
My definition

240
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,280
is not much different.

241
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,430
Friends should tolerate,

242
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:21,500
support,

243
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,720
and trust each other.

244
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:24,860
Tolerate what's hard to tolerate,

245
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,490
support those who are incapable,

246
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,220
and trust what's hard to trust.

247
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:31,760
Tolerate what's hard to tolerate,

248
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:33,810
support those who are incapable,

249
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:36,960
and trust what's hard to trust.

250
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:38,810
Is there really

251
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:40,150
such a relationship in this world?

252
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:40,750
Yes.

253
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,750
That's how I feel about you.

254
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:02,030
What?

255
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:06,190
You're staring.

256
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:09,640
Chancellor,

257
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,660
you look gorgeous today.

258
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:13,360
I'm sorry.

259
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,560
You're such a sweet talker.

260
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:17,800
Chancellor,

261
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:20,250
why are you dressed so glamorously today?

262
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,400
What's the matter?

263
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,760
Her Majesty

264
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,820
is holding an event in the Imperial Garden.

265
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,150
She invited the unmarried members

266
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,880
of the aristocratic families.

267
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:30,480
It's a chance

268
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:32,190
for us to meet each other

269
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,500
and see if we are fated for each other.

270
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:37,300
Isn't that a blind date?

271
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:39,470
You can say that.

272
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:42,510
Then...

273
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:44,830
I wish you

274
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:47,000
can find a good match today.

275
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:03,790
Of course.

276
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,880
I was busy these past few days,

277
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,080
so I didn't have time.

278
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:08,890
We can go together next time.

279
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:10,830
It can be eaten

280
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:11,630
after a while.

281
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:12,940
Suoluo!

282
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,430
Wait a moment.

283
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:17,150
Shang!

284
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:19,510
Suoluo?

285
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:20,440
Come with me.

286
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:22,350
Mr. Yan, long time no see.

287
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:23,150
Mr. Wang, Mr. Li.

288
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,080
Long time no see.

289
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:25,700
I'm...

290
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:27,350
Let's go drink.

291
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:36,310
Shang,

292
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:39,360
I heard that many girls

293
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:41,110
in the capital admire you.

294
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:43,670
Look, it’s Commander Shang.

295
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:49,430
I haven't heard of that.

296
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,830
Maybe they are just curious about

297
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:53,260
how I look without a mask.

298
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:55,430
Well,

299
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:58,180
there are so many beauties here today.

300
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:00,670
Do you have someone you've taken a liking to?

301
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:02,060
Don’t make fun of me.

302
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,440
I'm not.

303
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:09,790
Her Majesty is here.

304
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,470
[Empress]

305
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:22,510
-Greetings, Your Majesty.
-Greetings, Your Majesty.

306
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:24,170
[County Princess Zhouyang]

307
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:27,740
Rise.

308
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:33,080
-Thank you, Your Majesty.
-Thank you, Your Majesty.

309
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:13,590
Alright.

310
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,230
Your Majesty,

311
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:21,630
why don't you name this music piece?

312
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:25,870
Very well.

313
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:28,230
How about

314
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:31,120
we call it Spring Garden?

315
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,140
Thank you, Your Majesty.

316
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,320
Commander Shang.

317
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:44,790
Yes.

318
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:47,590
Today,

319
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:49,130
I invited you to the garden

320
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,420
to help you with your marriage.

321
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:56,390
Really?

322
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:01,630
I

323
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,080
am not in a hurry to get married.

324
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:06,670
They say you are impatient.

325
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:08,280
I think it's because

326
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:10,830
you don't have a wife watching over you.

327
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:14,820
Prince Guangping had a daughter at an old age.

328
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:15,910
His only daughter,

329
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:17,870
County Princess Zhouyang,

330
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:19,030
is beautiful

331
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:20,670
and gentle.

332
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:22,380
Did you

333
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,940
see her just now?

334
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:31,670
Forgive me

335
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:32,990
for not recognizing

336
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:34,920
who County Princess Zhouyang was.

337
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,960
She must've run away out of shyness.

338
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,160
She told me privately

339
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:42,930
that she is fond of you.

340
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:44,150
Why don't I

341
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,690
request His Majesty

342
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:47,190
to betroth her to you?

343
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:49,210
I...

344
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:53,470
Your Majesty,

345
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:55,200
there are so many girls

346
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:55,950
here today,

347
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,830
but you only give County Princess Zhouyang special treatment.

348
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,310
Won't this make the others

349
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:01,670
feel jealous?

350
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,090
You're right.

351
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:07,330
How about

352
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:08,940
we choose another good time

353
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:11,790
for Commander Shang to meet County Princess Zhouyang

354
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:12,590
in private

355
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:14,480
and let fate decide things?

356
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:17,910
That'll be great.

357
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:26,990
Your Majesty,

358
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:29,460
I have a request.

359
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,130
Mr. Yan, go ahead.

360
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:34,750
Your Majesty,

361
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:37,490
the Duchess of Yuejiang and I

362
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:39,120
have feelings for each other.

363
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,890
We were engaged under the witness of the king

364
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:42,090
of the State of Miluo.

365
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:44,530
It's time to fulfill the engagement now.

366
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:45,690
Therefore,

367
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:47,990
I beg Your Majesty to grant me a marriage.

368
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:51,380
What great news!

369
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:52,710
Suoluo,

370
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:55,080
why have you never told me about it?

371
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,200
I wanted you

372
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:58,760
to marry you into my family.

373
00:20:58,870 --> 00:20:59,730
I didn't expect

374
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:01,990
you already have someone in your heart.

375
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:04,750
Your Majesty, please forgive me.

376
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,350
I didn't mean to hide it.

377
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:08,270
I don't mean to

378
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,140
blame you two.

379
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,240
Since you love each other

380
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:13,790
and you have an engagement agreement,

381
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:14,550
how about

382
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:16,240
I let you

383
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,590
get married next month?

384
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:20,590
No.

385
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:25,570
Commander Shang, why not?

386
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:27,150
Why?

387
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:31,860
You say it.

388
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:41,310
Your Majesty,

389
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,820
marriage is the most important matter.

390
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,880
I want more time to prepare.

391
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,060
A month

392
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:48,980
is too hasty.

393
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:49,950
Yes.

394
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,750
Suoluo is still young.

395
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,780
Getting married next year won't be too late either.

396
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,140
My father is old.

397
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,820
He has been waiting for me to get married.

398
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:00,400
One year

399
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:01,960
is too long.

400
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,640
It seems that

401
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:06,130
Mr. Yan is anxious to get married.

402
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:08,230
But what Suoluo said is right.

403
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:11,160
Let’s have the marriage after two months.

404
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:17,870
-Congratulations, Duchess and Mr. Yan.
-Congratulations, Duchess and Mr. Yan.

405
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:20,520
I don’t have a daughter.

406
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:23,430
I've always treated Suoluo as my own daughter.

407
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:24,200
Don't worry.

408
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:25,880
I will make sure

409
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,380
you have a grand wedding.

410
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,750
Thank you, Your Majesty.

411
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:37,320
Let's stand.

412
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:44,340
He doesn't have an official position

413
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,550
or a good education,

414
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,020
yet he wants to marry you.

415
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:47,700
No way!

416
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:50,110
Hurry and tell the princess.

417
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,870
Our whole family already knows.

418
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:54,700
Everyone knows,

419
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,960
but no one stopped you?

420
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:58,350
Lower your voice.

421
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:01,840
What is Jiang Xinbai doing?

422
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:03,360
After all,

423
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:05,880
I agreed to the engagement myself.

424
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:07,590
I caused the trouble myself.

425
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:08,930
Don't worry.

426
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:09,770
I'll find a way.

427
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:10,920
Don't act tough now.

428
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:15,310
You are a duchess.

429
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:17,520
You can't submit to others.

430
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:20,310
We still have two months.

431
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:22,310
Let’s find a way together.

432
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,100
Thank you, Shang.

433
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:26,470
No need.

434
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:29,030
But

435
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:31,370
if it weren't for you,

436
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,510
I would've been in danger just now.

437
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:38,270
How about

438
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:40,080
you learn from Jiang Xinbai

439
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:42,590
and get married without permission?

440
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:44,850
You won't have to get married after that.

441
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:46,670
Her Majesty loves you so much.

442
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:48,220
She’ll just scold you at most.

443
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,020
Shang,

444
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:50,390
can't you think of

445
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:51,630
some useful ideas?

446
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:52,710
I...

447
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:54,460
Who can I marry at this time?

448
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:57,630
Anyone works,

449
00:23:58,030 --> 00:23:59,690
as long as it's not Yan Biqing.

450
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:00,240
You...

451
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:01,970
That's useless advice.

452
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:03,630
Shang!

453
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:06,810
Big news.

454
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:09,710
The chancellor and dean are getting married.

455
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:11,150
The chancellor is getting married.

456
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:11,870
Where did you hear that

457
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:13,670
the chancellor and dean are getting married?

458
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:15,710
You're a slave. Of course you don't know.

459
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:16,510
Her Majesty

460
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:19,030
personally granted marriage to the chancellor and dean.

461
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:20,040
They'll get married

462
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,320
in two months.

463
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:22,500
Yes.

464
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:23,990
Does that mean

465
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,270
we can do wedding pranks?

466
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:25,790
Yes.

467
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:27,150
We must go together.

468
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,230
The chancellor is here.

469
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,870
Hurry up. Sit down.

470
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:56,810
Suoluo.

471
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,210
Dean Yan, how can I help you?

472
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:04,930
I'm here to accompany you.

473
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:05,590
You...

474
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:08,350
Congratulations, Chancellor and Dean.

475
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:10,150
May you live happily ever after.

476
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:14,270
-Congratulations, Chancellor and Dean.
-Congratulations, Chancellor and Dean.

477
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:16,380
-May you live happily ever after.
-May you live happily ever after.

478
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:17,110
Thank you.

479
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:18,310
Sit.

480
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:19,400
Sit.

481
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:50,760
Previously, we learned

482
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:53,220
that politics and nobility are constant.

483
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:56,350
It means the law and political order of the country

484
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:58,150
should be consistent

485
00:25:58,510 --> 00:25:59,440
and persistent.

486
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:01,750
If it's too short,

487
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,320
it will be hard to see its effect.

488
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,780
If the court decrees change day by day,

489
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:08,860
the people will be confused

490
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:10,350
and be at a loss.

491
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:38,950
Liu Ruoqian,

492
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:40,710
are you inside?

493
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:44,070
Chancellor,

494
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,820
I'm a little tired today.

495
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:57,390
You...

496
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:00,850
don't have anything to say to me?

497
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:07,150
Ruoqian,

498
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:10,150
come out and let's talk.

499
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:51,630
Ruoqian,

500
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:53,830
I bought so many spices this time.

501
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:54,550
I'm sure I can heal

502
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:55,470
Shang's nose.

503
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:56,590
Right?

504
00:27:59,070 --> 00:27:59,670
Ruoqian,

505
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:02,920
are you still unhappy?

506
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:04,780
No.

507
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:09,290
Sai'er,

508
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,660
that's your Shang.

509
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:14,670
Well,

510
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:16,290
I'll take my leave.

511
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:17,410
Wait.

512
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,580
I shall take my leave.

513
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,910
We've met each other for so many days in a row.

514
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:45,220
Change the patrol route tomorrow.

515
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:46,090
Yes.

516
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:56,310
Sai'er.

517
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:04,820
Sai'er?

518
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:14,790
These are all to treat my sense of smell with?

519
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,790
Your nose is so pretty.

520
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:21,270
It doesn't matter if you have a sense of smell or not.

521
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:22,930
I'm not treating you anymore.

522
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:30,910
What's wrong?

523
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,340
Who made you angry?

524
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:37,630
I'm not angry.

525
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,130
I just don't want to talk to you.

526
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:47,960
Is it because my nose still hasn't been cured,

527
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,230
so you're unhappy?

528
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:50,790
Yes.

529
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,740
Just because of your nose.

530
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,760
My stupid nose always upsets you.

531
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,740
I don't need it.

532
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:00,330
What are you doing?

533
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:03,050
Don't hurt yourself.

534
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:05,110
Give me the scissors.

535
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:15,630
I don't want you to be unhappy.

536
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,980
If you're unhappy,

537
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,780
I'll be sad too.

538
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:25,640
I'm exchanging for my second wish.

539
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,780
Even if my nose

540
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,510
is cured,

541
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:34,090
you still can't leave me.

542
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:38,570
Is this

543
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:40,900
worth a piece of peach wood?

544
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:42,490
If this isn't worth it,

545
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:43,660
then what is?

546
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,780
[Closed]

547
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:41,780
Do you have something on your mind?

548
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,300
You have something on your mind too?

549
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:00,250
Why does he always ask me

550
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:01,090
to be with him?

551
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:02,640
Why can't I

552
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,210
stay with her all the time?

553
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,670
But when I think of him saying

554
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:08,410
he won't allow me to leave him,

555
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:10,360
I'm a little happy.

556
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:12,760
Why am I so sad

557
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:14,720
when I think of leaving her?

558
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,440
But he's like my big brother.

559
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,790
She's my chancellor.

[Blossom Beauty]

561
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:22,100
Sai'er,

562
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:25,940
have you ever loved anyone?

563
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:27,820
Love?

564
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:30,830
What is love?

565
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,310
It means...

566
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,150
if you don't see him,

567
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:39,380
you'll miss him.

568
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:41,070
When you see him,

569
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:43,270
you'll blush and your heart will race.

570
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:44,530
You'll want to escape.

571
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:49,440
Blushing, racing heart, and wanting to escape?

572
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,890
I've never had that.

573
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:56,210
Are you talking about the past?

574
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:58,610
I'm asking about the present or the future.

575
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,130
The present?

576
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:01,850
The future?

577
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:04,350
I...

578
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:07,950
I don't know.

579
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:15,190
There's another feeling.

580
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,350
If you see him

581
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:18,830
with someone else,

582
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:20,790
you feel

583
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,520
that there's a boulder

584
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:24,240
stuck in your chest.

585
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:30,950
Ruoqian,

586
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,470
do you love the chancellor?

587
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:35,630
Am I right?

Sai'er,

589
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:39,010
I'm talking about you.

590
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:40,340
I'm not like you.

591
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:42,420
You should be brave.

592
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:44,790
Since you have an opportunity to pursue him,

593
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:45,830
don't give up.

594
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:47,630
Ruoqian,

595
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:49,320
can't you fight for her?

596
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:54,870
I can't.

597
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:56,870
In this world,

598
00:33:57,150 --> 00:33:57,890
how can there be a relationship

00:33:57,890 --> 00:33:59,290
that you can't fight for?

600

Can I?

601
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:05,030
Of course.

602
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:07,710
You're the smartest person I've ever met.

603

Everyone likes you,

00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:35,590
Well...

Wait, you...

607
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:39,540
Why are you taking off your clothes?

608
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:42,190
Am I supposed to bathe with my clothes on?

609
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:43,600
Well...

610
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:44,750
Take care

611
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:45,630
and wash up.

612
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,370
It's not my first time

613
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:02,270
seeing Shang take a bath.

Don't race.

616
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:10,420
Don't race.

617
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,630
I must be sick.

618
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:15,740
I'm sick.

619
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:19,820
I love you.

620
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:27,950
I don't think I love you.

00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:36,910
Sai'er?

Sai'er?

627
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:41,550
Sai'er?

628
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:42,820
I'm here.

629
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,610
What are you doing here?

630
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:51,160
Oh no, Ruoqian.

631
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,440
You're right.

632
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,770
What is it?

633
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,030
Blushing

634
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,460
and a racing heart.

635
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:57,410
I think I really

636
00:36:57,410 --> 00:36:58,610
am in love with Shang.

637
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:00,070
Then tell him

638
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:01,020
you love him.

639
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:04,030
No.

640
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:05,280
I dare not.

641
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:06,750
Why not?

642
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:12,440
I don't know why,

643
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:14,220
but I dare not.

644
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:16,580
I get nervous when I see Shang.

645
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:20,480
What should I do?

646
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:41,910
Chief,

647
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:44,940
it seems Jiang Xinbai and Yan Nanxing

648
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:46,030
have left safely.

649
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:53,610
Greetings, Chief.

650
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:55,710
Chief.

651
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:58,650
Both Hei'ao and Yi Yuanshan have died.

652
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:00,180
Jiang Xinbai has also left.

653
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:01,810
Let’s go back to Yuan Village

654
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:03,140
and celebrate tonight.

655
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:06,160
Chief.

656
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,700
Tingzhou

657
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:09,310
is our territory from now on.

658
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:11,270
Chief?

659
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:12,390
Chief!

660
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:16,850
No matter how strong the we are in Tingzhou,

661
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:18,050
we're still bandits.

662
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,030
Any official from the capital can come

663
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:21,560
and we'll be at their mercy.

664
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:23,450
Just kill them as they come.

665
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:24,380
Isn't that easy?

666
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:26,150
No.

667
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:26,800
Chief,

668
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,520
do you have a new plan?

669
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:35,470
Ask everyone to get ready.

670
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,810
I'm ready.

671
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:43,360
Is five jars of wine enough?

672
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,930
I'm happy. Maybe not enough.

673
00:38:45,930 --> 00:38:46,650
Ten jars!

674
00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:52,360
Yi Yuanshan was assassinated

675
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:54,170
on his way back to the capital.

676
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:55,070
What?

677
00:38:56,790 --> 00:38:59,150
[Yi Yuanshan is dead. Master can rest assured.]

678
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:00,910
Who did it?

679
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:02,120
I don't know yet,

680
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:05,270
but this person

681
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,310
helped us resolve a problem.

682
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,580
He did us a favor

683
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:17,140
because he wants to join us.

684
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:18,360
Killing Yi Yuanshan

685
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:20,060
is his pledge of loyalty.

686
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:21,840
With Jiang Xinbai's

687
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:23,400
interference in Tingzhou,

688
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,790
Yi Yuanshan's clue

689
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:26,340
is now completely useless.

690
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:30,070
We need new partners.

691
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:31,310
Father.

692
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:33,070
I'll send someone to Tingzhou

693
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:34,200
to meet this person.

694
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:36,970
In other words,

695
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:38,790
Jiang Xinbai and Yan Nanxing

696
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:40,630
will return to the capital soon.

697
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:41,590
Father,

698
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:42,790
keeping these two alive

699
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:44,250
will always pose a threat.

700
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:45,670
Yan Nanxing

701
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,200
is the only medicine tester alive.

702
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:51,360
For us,

703
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:52,550
she's still useful.

704
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:55,230
What about Jiang Xinbai?

705
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:56,550
Jiang Xinbai

706
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:58,650
will fail sooner or later.

707
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:00,790
If he dies outside,

708
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:03,920
His Majesty will be suspicious.

709
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:08,400
Sooner or later,

710
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,640
His Majesty will—

711
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:11,300
Shut up!

712
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:14,640
You can't say these things.

713
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,010
Yes.

714
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:24,370
[Taiji Gate]

715
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:24,470
Your Majesty.

716
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:26,230
Yi Yuanshan's death

717
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:27,510
clearly shows that someone

718
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:28,910
didn't want him to return to the capital.

719
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:30,310
He was silenced by death.

720
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:32,840
I dare to guess

721
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:35,710
that the mastermind behind this

722
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:37,510
is still in the capital.

723
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:39,510
Bastard!

724
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:41,670
I'd like to see

725
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,640
who had the audacity to do this!

726
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:47,950
Since he could hide until now,

727
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:50,560
it shows that he's dangerous and cunning.

728
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:52,150
Your Majesty,

729
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:55,530
the capital's protection need to be strengthened.

730
00:40:55,770 --> 00:40:56,570
Jiang Xinbai.

731
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:58,150
Yes, Your Majesty.

732
00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:00,680
I order you to return to the Inspection Office

733
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:02,450
as the deputy chief constable

734
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:05,180
and focus your investigation on the Zornia case.

735
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:06,070
I

736
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,110
accept the order.
