00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:04,840
Why are you here?

6
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,240
I came to congratulate you.

7
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,080
I heard Jiang Xinbai was dismissed.

8
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:17,230
The Head of Yuejiang title

9
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,829
must go to you now.

10
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,490
It's not up to an outsider like you

11
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:23,630
to interfere

12
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,880
in my family affairs.

13
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:26,910
Outsider?

14
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,870
We'll be a family sooner or later.

15
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:34,950
How about we

16
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,570
pick an auspicious day

17
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:39,430
for my father to visit to propose marriage?

18
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:41,870
I don't want to talk about this with you.

20

There's a limit to refusing.

Let go of me!

22

00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:00,230
I'm fine.

31

You're not married yet.

33

this is the Imperial Academy.

37
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:17,570
She's the chancellor.

38
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,390
Respect her.

39
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:32,520
Are you really okay?

40
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:33,630
Yes.

41

to watch Lu Bo'an for me.

00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:08,470
Okay.

you've been looking for it.

Why are you here?

85
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:55,310
Isn't this

86
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,010
a gift from Xinbai

87
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,050
for your first birthday

88
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,630
since he returned

89
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:02,580
from Yazhou?

90
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:05,670
He made this brush himself.

91
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,450
You hated it

92
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:08,670
and wanted to toss it.

93
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:11,190
So you've been keeping it.

94
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,170
I was thinking

95
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:18,380
of how to persuade you

96
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,590
to help Xinbai.

97
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:21,630
Now it seems

98
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,190
I don't have to.

99
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,670
How do you want me to help Xinbai?

100
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:34,850
By meeting the empress

101
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:36,510
and crown prince in the palace

102
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:39,270
to get them to persuade His Majesty

103
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,420
to reinstate Xinbai.

104
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,640
But we've to be cautious now.

105
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,620
If we advise them rashly,

106
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:50,870
it might backfire.

107
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:53,750
Yes.

108
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:56,390
I know

109
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:58,390
it's dangerous

110
00:06:58,710 --> 00:06:59,870
to act rashly now.

111
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:01,340
But doing

112
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,240
nothing

113
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:04,450
makes me uneasy.

114
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,090
There's someone

115
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:10,060
who's more suitable

116
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,990
than the empress and crown prince.

117
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:14,570
He's also more willing to help us.

118
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:31,690
It's not that I don't want to beg His Majesty,

119
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,440
but it's unclear

120
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,350
how he wants to

121
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,690
deal with Xinbai.

122
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:41,350
If we bring this up now,

123
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:42,640
His Majesty

124
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:43,909
will blame us

125
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,200
for swaying his judgment.

126
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:48,430
In this way,

127
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:50,580
it'll be even more

128
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,150
unfavorable for Xinbai.

129
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:53,790
Is there no way

130
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,050
to turn things around?

131
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:58,150
This is the first time His Majesty's been so enraged

132
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:59,810
since he ascended the throne.

133
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:01,830
Moreover,

134
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:03,790
Xinbai

135
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,040
voluntarily

136
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,400
took all the blame.

137
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:09,110
That's not good.

138
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:12,600
What do you think

139
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,530
the worst-case scenario would be?

140
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,850
If this broken branch

141
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,590
is not cut in time,

142
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:20,710
the whole plant

143
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,070
will be destroyed.

144
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,310
Is it that serious?

145
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:28,090
That I've to

146
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,610
abandon my brother?

147
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,820
If His Majesty

148
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:37,789
decides to punish him severely,

149
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:40,470
I'm afraid your family

150
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,679
has to

151
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,120
draw the line with him.

152
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,430
Right now,

153
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,190
I think

154
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:52,950
Xinbai himself

155
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:55,190
has the same plan.

156
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:01,510
To be honest,

157
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:04,630
I thought Xinbai was

158
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,190
the most likely to become

159
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,280
the head

160
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,650
of Yuejiang Residence.

161
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:12,790
But I never thought

162
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,160
he'd be so impatient.

163
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:17,610
Suoluo.

164
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,170
The future of Yuejiang Residence

165
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,470
will now

166
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,420
depend on you.

167
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:38,870
But General Nan

168
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,160
died because of me after all.

169
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,270
Maybe

170
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,260
when Yan Zhizhong died,

171
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:51,110
my father

172
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,470
felt the same way as I do now.

173
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,870
What happened these days

174
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,030
were a huge blow to Jiang Xinbai.

175
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:01,430
What should I do

176
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,510
to cheer him up?

177
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,070
Yan Nanxing.

178
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:07,650
I want to watch fireworks.

179
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:12,190
Watch fireworks.

180
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:14,950
The beautiful ones

181
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:16,930
that are big...

182
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:19,350
and dazzling.

183
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:21,310
Look.

184
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:25,430
Those

185
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:27,230
big

186
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:29,630
and beautiful ones.

187
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:36,470
Please fill it up for me.

188
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:44,550
Sorry.

189
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:46,470
It's okay.

190
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:01,390
Besides the royal relatives,

191
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:04,470
only Xi Zhaoming

192
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,420
can set off fireworks in the capital.

193
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:14,270
At this critical period,

194
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,220
if His Majesty sees

195
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:20,270
someone setting off fireworks in the capital,

196
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:24,010
that means Jiang Xinbai's provoking him

197
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,430
with fireworks.

198
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:28,770
The whole Jiang family

199
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:32,590
might even be held accountable.

200
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:34,980
In that case,

201
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:37,480
let's give them

202
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,760
a nudge.

203
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,500
Mr. Jiang's been

204
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:03,660
working in Blossom Beauty these days.

205
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:04,920
Is he really

206
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,590
planning to freeload off Boss?

207
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:08,720
Freeloaders are those who don't work.

208
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,930
Those who work should be called...

209
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,950
It's called stealing your job.

210
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:15,480
Get back to work.

211
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:27,030
Look.

212
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,490
Is it pretty?

213
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:32,320
Yes.

214
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,190
This is...

215
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,990
the dress I gave you?

216
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:38,200
Yes.

217
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,870
Today is an important day,

218
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:42,370
so I should dress up.

219
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:44,320
What important day?

220
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:46,320
I have a gift for you.

221
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,640
Just follow me.

222
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:53,030
Fireworks?

223
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:55,840
Once when you were

224
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:57,270
drunk in Heman,

225
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:59,650
you insisted on watching fireworks.

226
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:00,790
You even cried

227
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:02,070
watching them.

228
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:04,370
That's when I realized

229
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:05,450
fireworks must

230
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,790
mean something special to you.

231
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,100
I don't remember it at all.

232
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:21,110
I know

233
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:23,590
it's dark in the capital now.

234
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,930
But there will always be dawn.

235
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:26,990
From now on,

236
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:28,560
I'll be with you.

237
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:30,760
No matter what happens,

238
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:32,400
I'll be with you.

239
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:35,470
Now,

240
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,030
don't think about anything.

241
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:37,710
Let's

242
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:39,800
watch fireworks together.

243
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:53,650
Yan Nanxing.

244
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,010
Thank you for

245
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:58,960
preparing these fireworks for me.

246
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:00,380
But

247
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,440
we can't set them off tonight.

248
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:04,990
Why?

249
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,360
Fireworks in the capital

250
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:18,010
is a privilege

251
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:20,200
His Majesty bestowed to my father.

252
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:22,720
When I was young,

253
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,410
my father would take me to watch fireworks

254
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:27,970
on his birthday.

255
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,500
It was also here.

256
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:33,960
But later,

257
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,070
my father

258
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:37,980
became a sinner.

259
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:40,020
Now,

260
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:42,920
I was dismissed by His Majesty.

261
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:47,350
If we

262
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:48,670
set off fireworks now,

263
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:49,710
it might

264
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:51,550
anger His Majesty.

265
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:03,730
It doesn't matter.

266
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:05,920
Unhappy moments in life are inevitable.

267
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,120
Take me as an example.

268
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,470
I was miserable before.

269
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:10,100
I was abducted by a human trafficker

270
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:10,800
and almost

271
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:12,600
died in his hands.

272
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,620
Luckily, a young sir saved me.

273
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,180
Later, we ran away

274
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,410
and met a bad guy.

275
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:20,790
That young sir was taken away.

276
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:22,900
And I was poisoned by them.

277
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:24,220
That's why

278
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,180
I got this shapeshifting ailment.

279
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,260

384
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:29,440
Actually...

385
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:43,330
I didn't set off these fireworks.

386
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:45,680
What's going on?

387
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:06,000
Ruoqian!

388
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:06,740
Hurry up.

389
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,400
Come watch the fireworks!

390
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,820
Why are there fireworks today?

391
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,520
Why are there fireworks?

392
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,260
What's going on?

393
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:31,790
There is no event in the capital today.

394
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:33,450
Why'd they set off fireworks?

395
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:35,240
Grandfather.

396
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:35,700
Father!

397
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:36,740
Where is Xinbai?

398
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:37,990
Xinbai.

399
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:50,600
Father-in-law.

400
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:53,390
The fireworks tonight...

401
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:56,940
are really beautiful.

402
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:05,750
Oh no.

403
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:08,430
Let's go.

404
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,560
The people reported

405
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:27,150
that someone set off fireworks here.

406
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:28,870
It's you two.

407
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:31,230
We didn't set off the fireworks.

408
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:33,070
My lord.

409
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,740
The evidence is here.

410
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:38,440
Do you still want to deny it?

411
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:44,090
Arrest him.

412
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,140
Yes!

413
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,240
Xinbai.

414
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:18,950
Mother.

415
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:20,710
Suoluo.

416
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:24,240
Mr. Pei.

417
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:26,190
Xinbai.

418
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:29,510
Why are you so calm?

419
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:32,120
His Majesty dismissed you

420
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:33,830
for Nan Jifeng's matter.

421
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:36,750
Even if this matter's over,

422
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:38,640
His Majesty was

423
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:40,190
being lenient to you.

424
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:41,190
But you?

425
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,200
You had to set off fireworks

426
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:45,030
to protest against His Majesty.

427
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:46,720
Now,

428
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:49,240
His Majesty is furious

429
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:52,550
and decided to punish you severely.

430
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,590
Mr. Pei.

431
00:21:58,230 --> 00:21:58,830
How does

432
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,200
His Majesty plan to punish me?

433
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:03,910
He'll demote you to Yazhou.

434
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,100
Is there no turning back?

435
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:23,750
Commander Shang!

436
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:25,960
Let me explain.

437
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:29,230
I bought the fireworks

438
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:30,190
from Ghost Market.

439
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:30,870
I didn't

440
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:31,620
set them off.

441
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:32,520
Jiang Xinbai

442
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,480
has nothing to do

443
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:34,110
with this.

444
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:36,780
Why should I

445
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:38,880
trust you?

446
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,440
I know you dislike him.

447
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,270
But now's not the time to be spiteful.

448
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:43,380
Someone's

449
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,130
obviously trying to frame him.

450
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,240
I don't believe you can't tell.

451
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,320
He led himself

452
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:50,390
to this plight.

453
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:53,510
It’s all his fault.

454
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:54,790
Commander Shang.

455
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:56,660
Please.

456
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:57,880
I’m begging you.

457
00:22:58,270 --> 00:22:59,430
Let me see him.

458
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:01,470
I will give you a reasonable

459
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:02,350
explanation.

460
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:09,920
Guards!

461
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:15,830
In that case,

462
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,230
someone planned

463
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:20,030
to frame you.

464
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:23,270
Mr. Pei.

465
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:25,650
It must be thoroughly investigated.

466
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:27,540
Xinbai.

467
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:28,990
Do you...

468
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,310
have any inkling?

469
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,390
Without evidence,

470
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:38,270
I dare not speculate.

471
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:39,590
Son.

472
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:40,960
At this point,

473
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:41,900
just say it.

474
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:46,590
Maybe

475
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:48,560
it's Lu Dingzhao

476
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:49,790
and Li Jun.

477
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:53,630
Because of Li Wufang?

478
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:57,230
But Jinwu Guards scoured the city

479
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:57,930
and couldn't find

480
00:23:57,930 --> 00:23:59,210
who set off fireworks.

481
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:03,720
Since they dared to set off the fireworks,

482
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,530
they wouldn't leave any trace.

483
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:07,670
It'd be foolproof.

484
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:15,050
I'll leave the capital

485
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:16,620
in a few days

486
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:17,590
to Yazhou.

487
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:19,010
Leave the capital?

488
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,880
Why?

489
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:22,570
If you leave the capital,

490
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:23,900
you'll never come back.

491
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,650
Have you forgotten about your father?

492
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:28,510
Mr. Pei.

493
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:29,830
I beg you.

494
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:32,190
Please help Xinbai.

495
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:34,750
I really can't bear

496
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:37,360
to lose another family member.

497
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:38,870
You know that.

498
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:40,680
Please.

499
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,920
I'll go beg Her Majesty

500
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,140
and the crown prince.

501
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:47,400
I'll never let my brother

502
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,130
go to Yazhou.

503
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:50,300
Yes, yes.

504
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:51,230
Go on now.

505
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:52,270
Suoluo.

506
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:53,700
Calm down.

507
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,580
Do you want me to

508
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,800
watch you get framed?

509
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:58,270
Be strong.

510
00:24:59,230 --> 00:24:59,910
Now,

511
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:01,030
Mother

512
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:02,550
and Grandfather

513
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:04,290
both need you.

514
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:05,590
I...

515
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:14,640
I set off the fireworks alone.

516
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,840
Punish me if you want.

517
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:18,560
Yan Nanxing.

518
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:20,890
Who are you?

519
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:22,160
I am Yan Nanxing.

520
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,080
I'm Blossom Beauty's owner.

521
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:25,430
I bought the fireworks

522
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:26,360
at Ghost Market.

523
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:29,200
Then I invited Jiang Xinbai to the city tower.

524
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:29,930
I've already

525
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:31,720
told Jinwu Guards this.

526
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:33,450
Jiang Xinbai's innocent.

527
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:34,770
You told Jinwu Guards?

528
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,030
Xinbai.

529
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:40,600
Didn't you just say...

530
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:41,310
Mr. Pei.

531
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:42,640
If I say

532
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:44,510
Yan Nanxing

533
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,940
set off the fireworks for me

534
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:49,210
as a marriage proposal...

535
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:54,140
Can you

536
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:56,790
accept this testimony?

537
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:58,760
-Proposal?
-Proposal?

538
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:06,070
Xinbai.

539
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:06,990
You...

540
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:08,390
You promised her?

541
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:09,710
Mother.

542
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:12,180
Is that still important?

543
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:13,160
Yes.

544
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:17,880
I love her.

545
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:23,260
She loves me too.

546
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:40,090
I agreed to her proposal.

547
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:45,350
So

548
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:48,090
the fireworks were a small accident

549
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:49,580
due to Xinbai and Ms. Yan's

550
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:50,540
love.

551
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:52,730
He didn't offend His Majesty.

552
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,700
Mr. Pei,

553
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,700
please plead for mercy with His Majesty.

554
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:58,750
In that case,

555
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:01,870
if it was really an accident,

556
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:02,730
there

557
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:05,270
might be a turning point.

558
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:06,530
His Majesty

559
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:09,270
understands love too.

560
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,310
That's great.

561
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:14,750
That's great.

562
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:17,120
I'll go to the palace

563
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:18,870
to plead for mercy now.

564
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:20,830
Suoluo.

565
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:22,750
Go to the palace tomorrow

566
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:24,430
and beg Her Majesty for mercy too.

567
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:24,910
Okay.

568
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:27,750
But

569
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:28,990
Xinbai,

570
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:32,350
since His Majesty has made his promise,

571
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:33,590
the demotion

572
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,630
is inevitable.

573
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,400
The difference is

574
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:38,900
where you are demoted to

575
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:40,630
and when you can come back.

576
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:41,710
So...

577
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:43,070
you

578
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:46,870
have to be mentally prepared.

579
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:51,000
As long as I can be with Yan Nanxing,

580
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,500
I'm fine anywhere.

581
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:54,870
But...

582
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:56,910
Mr. Pei.

583
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:59,140
I have just one request.

584
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:00,310
Go ahead.

585
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:02,070
I wonder

586
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:04,510
if I can marry Yan Nanxing

587
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,740
before

588
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,760
leaving the capital.

589
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:15,110
It'd be too

590
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:16,590
unreasonable

591
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:18,430
to reject it.

592
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:19,830
Fine.

593
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,010
Then

594
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:24,280
I'll compromise my dignity

595
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:25,710
to beg His Majesty.

596
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:27,270
However,

597
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:28,760
you two

598
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:31,070
must remember

599
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:34,670
not to leave the capital without permission.

600
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:36,970
Thank you, Mr. Pei.

601
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:37,880
Okay.

602
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,660
Your Highness.

603
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:41,640
Let's get going.

604
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:42,480
Okay.

605
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:43,130
Please.

606
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:43,650
Okay.

607
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:53,510
Xinbai.

608
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:56,110
We're getting married?

609
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:01,850
This time...

610
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:04,790
It's real?

611
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:07,660
Of course.

612
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,010
But this time,

613
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:14,070
I really have nothing.

614
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:17,440
I can't even compare to a tea merchant.

615
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:20,600
Will you still marry me?

616
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,240
Yes!

617
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:45,390
Xinbai.

618
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:48,040
You suddenly want to get married.

619
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:49,390
What can I do?

620
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:00,230
Mother.

621
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:02,990
Pardon me for being unfilial.

622
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:03,670
From now on,

623
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:06,350
I'm going to draw the line

624
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:08,090
with Yuejiang Residence.

625
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,030
The fireworks crime...

626
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:14,110
will be borne by me and my wife.

627
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:18,190
Yuejiang Residence's innocent.

628
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:36,310
Nanxing.

629
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:39,930
The Jiang family has wronged you.

630
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:41,120
For both marriages,

631
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:42,610
we couldn't give you

632
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:43,700
a decent wedding.

633
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:45,590
It's fine.

634
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:47,030
I want to marry

635
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:48,470
Jiang Xinbai,

636
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,070
not his family.

637
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:55,090
We'll still be close friends,

638
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:55,850
right?

639
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:05,960
Suoluo.

640
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:09,120
Xinbai, say no more.

641
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:12,430
I'll hold down the fort in Yuejiang Residence.

642
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:14,350
As for you,

643
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:16,680
I believe you've come up with

644
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,880
a thorough solution.

645
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:19,960
Since you won't say it,

646
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:21,400
I won't ask anymore.

647
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:24,110
I will always remember

648
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,880
the things you asked me to do.

649
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:29,550
Good.

650
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:56,190
If I didn't ask you

651
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:57,590
to take General Nan away,

652
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:00,090
he might...

653
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:00,890
Suoluo.

654
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:04,680
It's not your fault.

655
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:08,710
I failed to protect General Nan.

656
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:10,710
Shang.

657
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,120
I’d rather you

658
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:14,880
blame me than see you like this.

659
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:16,800
I trust General Nan

660
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:18,270
wouldn't want to

661
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,230
see you

662
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:21,350
like this.

663
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:24,630
You're right.

664
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:28,390
He was killed by a villain.

665
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,490
I haven't avenged him yet.

666
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:33,690
Instead of complaining here,

667
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:36,410
I'd rather go find them

668
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:38,530
and kill them.

669
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:40,920
Shang.

670
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,070
Shang.

671
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:45,830
Talk to Xinbai.

672
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:46,830
He might have

673
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:47,830
figured out a way.

674
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:50,130
I have nothing to talk about with him.

675
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,670
You really misunderstood Xinbai.

676
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:54,330
He didn't mean to stand you up.

677
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:55,430
He...

678
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:57,350
He did it to...

679
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,750
To go for broke.

680
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,960
The fireworks all over the city that night

681
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:11,780
were strange.

682
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,070
You know that.

683
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:14,750
Your men have been

684
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:16,310
searching inside and outside the city

685
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:17,820
for the person who set off the fireworks,

686
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:18,490
right?

687
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:26,230
It's Jinwu Guards' duty

688
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:27,670
to catch the arsonist.

689
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:29,390
I'm not helping you.

690
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:30,960
Although I was demoted,

691
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:32,670
your two-month agreement

692
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:33,830
with His Majesty

693
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:34,750
still stands.

694
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:36,150
But

695
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:38,040
it's almost expiring.

696
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,720
Thanks for reminding me.

697
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:43,790
If I can't find any evidence,

698
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:46,110
I'll behead them two

699
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:47,790
along with me

700
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:49,870
to face His Majesty.

701
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:51,550
Shang Bieli.

702
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:53,870
Don't you want to know

703
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:55,920
what my go-for-broke plan

704
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:57,350
is?

705
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:05,910
In the morning, the magnolia stands tall; in the evening,

706
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:08,050
[Great Virtue]

707
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,070
it embraces the continent.

708
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,130
[Respect and Uphold Justice]

709
00:34:08,489 --> 00:34:09,550
What are you doing?

710
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:14,429
Who are you?

711
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:17,000
Where are you taking me?

712
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,150
Help me!

713
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:19,350
What are you looking at?

714
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:20,150
Keep writing!

715
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:21,230
Help!

716
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,440
Dean Yan.

717
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:23,639
Help me, Dean Yan.

718
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:24,389
Dean Yan!

719
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:25,350
Help me!

720
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:26,550
Dean Yan!

721
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:28,570
Help me, Dean Yan.

722
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:33,040
Father-in-law.

723
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:35,460
It's a huge victory for us this time.

724
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,030
His Majesty

725
00:34:37,389 --> 00:34:39,389
agreed to Jiang Xinbai's marriage,

726
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:41,909
but he's ordered

727
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:43,909
for him to be

728
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:45,630
demoted to Yazhou after.

729
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:47,989
Even Yuejiang Residence

730
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:49,989
can't protect him.

731
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:55,340
But

732
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:57,650
don’t drop your guard.

733
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,760
Jiang Xinbai

734
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:03,670
won’t give up easily.

735
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:05,630
What can he do

736
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:07,270
in such a short time?

737
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:11,350
Bo’an.

738
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:11,870
Shang Bieli.

739
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:13,070
In broad daylight...

740
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:19,490
I've been itching to hit you.

741
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:20,410
Let me tell you.

742
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,460
If I find the evidence

743
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:24,750
and prove that you killed my brother,

744
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:26,310
I'll skin you alive!

745
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:27,350
Stop!

746
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:28,860
Shang Bieli.

747
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,520
Are you crazy?

748
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,350
Yes.

749
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:41,550
Everyone in the capital knows I'm crazy.

750
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:44,920
Is this your first day in the capital?

751
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:48,150
I'm afraid you don't know

752
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,590
how crazy I am.

753
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,310
If you have evidence,

754
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,880
get the Inspection Office to arrest us.

755
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,030
I don’t care if you're really

756
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:05,890
crazy or not.

757
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:09,260
Trying to trick me?

758
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,920
It's not that easy.

759
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:14,960
Commander Shang.

760
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,040
Your grandsons joined hands

761
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,390
to sell fake calligraphy and paintings

762
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:22,510
to make money.

763
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:25,190
I won't let you off.

764
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,080
The person who killed my brother

765
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,260
must pay with their blood!

766
00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:37,390
No one can escape!

767
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:41,670
Are you involved?

768
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:45,020
No.

769
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:46,130
Grandfather.

770
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:46,930
Grandfather.

771
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,040
Uncle asked me to do it.

772
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:51,800
And you just obeyed him?

773
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:52,920
Grandfather, I...

774
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:53,580
I was wrong.

775
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:55,300
I was wrong, Grandfather.

776
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:55,870
I was wrong.

777
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:57,790
Can't you be smarter?

778
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:00,130
Go back now.

779
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:01,410
I'll send someone

780
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:03,070
to send you the State of Miluo.

781
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:05,360
Don't drop out of school

782
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:07,090
and don't let anyone know.

783
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:08,510
Leave now!

784
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:10,230
Thank you, Grandfather.

785
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:11,630
Thank you, Grandfather.

786
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:22,930
What do you want?

787
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,890
How dare you get Bo’an involved?

788
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:25,710
Are you crazy?

789
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:27,750
Go report ill health to the Ministry of Personnel

790
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:28,800
and return to your hometown!

791
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,530
Lu Dingzhao!

792
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:31,110
I’ve been slogging for you

793
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:31,640
and obeying

794
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:32,770
your every order!

795
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:33,950
I did all

796
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:35,000
the dirty work.

797
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,800
Don't I get some credit?

798
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,000
What do you want then?

799
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,700
I paved the path to Tingzhou.

800
00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:40,630
I want to continue

801
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:41,890
my business in Tingzhou.

802
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:43,170
Then go to Tingzhou

803
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,840
and stay there!

804
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:46,250
Don't ever come back!

805
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:55,580
How's it with Li Jun?

806
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:57,040
As you expected,

807
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:59,920
he reported ill health and returned home.

808
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:04,870
I've thought about it these days.

809
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:07,090
Tingzhou connects the Western states.

810
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:09,150
They paved the path to Tingzhou

811
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,380
to deliver Zornia out.

812
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,240
Since they can't sell it in Daqi,

813
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:17,680
they want to harm other states.

814
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,040
They have no conscience.

815
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:23,810
Be gentle.

816
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:28,520
Currently,

817
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,030
our first step

818
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,100
has worked.

819
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:32,630
We're just

820
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:35,870
lacking a revolutionary gust of wind.

821
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:37,110
And when will you

822
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:38,610
make that happen?

823
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:40,630
Relax.

824
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,640
Let me get married first.

825
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:45,030
Jiang Xinbai.

826
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:46,630
I believe

827
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:48,230
you love Yan Nanxing.

828
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,720
But

829
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:51,490
I don't believe

830
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:53,650
you're marrying her now

831
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:55,190
out of love.

832
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:58,270
Shang Bieli.

833
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:02,390
If I tell you

834
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:03,990
you got it wrong,

835
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,250
and I'm the Young Sir

836
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:07,800
Yan Nanxing is looking for,

837
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:08,840
will you believe

838
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:10,490
I'm sincere about

839
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:11,290
this wedding?

840
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:16,750
I'm not lying.

841
00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:17,950
It's true.

842
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:23,030
In Yazhou,

843
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:26,790
I went through fire and water with Yan Nanxing.

844
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:27,750
To think

845
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:30,520
our fates are as such.

846
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,150
This time,

847
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:35,390
I'll never miss it again.

848
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:42,280
Does Yan Nanxing

849
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:43,470
know about this?

850
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:45,470
I warn you.

851
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:47,360
Don't shoot your mouth off.

852
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:48,590
This is between

853
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:49,350
me and her.

854
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:50,830
I want to wait

855
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:52,710
for everything to be settled

856
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:53,910
before telling her.

857
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,000
Who cares?

858
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,760
You ate them all.

859
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:05,330
Peel them properly.
