00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:20,840
Why are you here?

6
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,240
I came to congratulate you.

7
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,080
I heard Jiang Xinbai was dismissed.

8
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,230
The Head of Yuejiang title

9
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,829
must go to you now.

10
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,490
It's not up to an outsider like you

11
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:39,630
to interfere

12
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,880
in my family affairs.

13
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:42,910
Outsider?

14
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,870
We'll be a family sooner or later.

15
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:50,950
How about we

16
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,570
pick an auspicious day

17
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:55,430
for my father to visit to propose marriage?

18
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:57,870
I don't want to talk about this with you.

20

There's a limit to refusing.

00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:04,390
Let go of me!

22

Are you okay?

26
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:16,230
I'm fine.

Your Grace.

28
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,590
Suoluo and I are engaged.

31

You're not married yet.

33

00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:32,050
this is the Imperial Academy.

37
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,570
She's the chancellor.

38
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,390
Respect her.

39
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:48,520
Are you really okay?

40
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:49,630
Yes.

41

to watch Lu Bo'an for me.

inform me immediately.

53
00:04:12,829 --> 00:04:13,690
Lu Bo'an is also

00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:24,470
Okay.

you've been looking for it.

Why are you here?

85
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:11,310
Isn't this

86
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:14,010
a gift from Xinbai

87
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,050
for your first birthday

88
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,630
since he returned

89
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:18,580
from Yazhou?

90
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:21,670
He made this brush himself.

91
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,450
You hated it

92
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:24,670
and wanted to toss it.

93
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:27,190
So you've been keeping it.

94
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:32,170
I was thinking

95
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:34,380
of how to persuade you

96
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,590
to help Xinbai.

97
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:37,630
Now it seems

98
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,190
I don't have to.

99
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,670
How do you want me to help Xinbai?

100
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:50,850
By meeting the empress

101
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:52,510
and crown prince in the palace

102
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,270
to get them to persuade His Majesty

103
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,420
to reinstate Xinbai.

104
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,640
But we've to be cautious now.

105
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,620
If we advise them rashly,

106
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:06,870
it might backfire.

107
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:09,750
Yes.

108
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,390
I know

109
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:14,390
it's dangerous

110
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:15,870
to act rashly now.

111
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:17,340
But doing

112
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,240
nothing

113
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:20,450
makes me uneasy.

114
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:25,090
There's someone

115
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:26,060
who's more suitable

116
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,990
than the empress and crown prince.

117
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:30,570
He's also more willing to help us.

118
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:47,690
It's not that I don't want to beg His Majesty,

119
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,440
but it's unclear

120
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,350
how he wants to

121
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,690
deal with Xinbai.

122
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:57,350
If we bring this up now,

123
00:07:57,909 --> 00:07:58,640
His Majesty

124
00:07:58,670 --> 00:07:59,909
will blame us

125
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,200
for swaying his judgment.

126
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:04,430
In this way,

127
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:06,580
it'll be even more

128
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,150
unfavorable for Xinbai.

129
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:09,790
Is there no way

130
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,050
to turn things around?

131
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:14,150
This is the first time His Majesty's been so enraged

132
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:15,810
since he ascended the throne.

133
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:17,830
Moreover,

134
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:19,790
Xinbai

135
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,040
voluntarily

136
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,400
took all the blame.

137
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,110
That's not good.

138
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:28,600
What do you think

139
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,530
the worst-case scenario would be?

140
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:32,850
If this broken branch

141
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,590
is not cut in time,

142
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:36,710
the whole plant

143
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:39,070
will be destroyed.

144
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,310
Is it that serious?

145
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:44,090
That I've to

146
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,610
abandon my brother?

147
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,820
If His Majesty

148
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:53,789
decides to punish him severely,

149
00:08:55,059 --> 00:08:56,470
I'm afraid your family

150
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,679
has to

151
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,120
draw the line with him.

152
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,430
Right now,

153
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,190
I think

154
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:08,950
Xinbai himself

155
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,190
has the same plan.

156
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:17,510
To be honest,

157
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:20,630
I thought Xinbai was

158
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,190
the most likely to become

159
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,280
the head

160
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,650
of Yuejiang Residence.

161
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:28,790
But I never thought

162
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,160
he'd be so impatient.

163
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:33,610
Suoluo.

164
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:38,170
The future of Yuejiang Residence

165
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,470
will now

166
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,420
depend on you.

167
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:54,870
But General Nan

168
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,160
died because of me after all.

169
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:02,270
Maybe

170
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,260
when Yan Zhizhong died,

171
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:07,110
my father

172
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,470
felt the same way as I do now.

173
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:12,870
What happened these days

174
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:15,030
were a huge blow to Jiang Xinbai.

175
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:17,430
What should I do

176
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,510
to cheer him up?

177
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,070
Yan Nanxing.

178
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:23,650
I want to watch fireworks.

179
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,190
Watch fireworks.

180
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:30,950
The beautiful ones

181
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:32,930
that are big...

182
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:35,350
and dazzling.

183
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:37,310
Look.

184
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:41,430
Those

185
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:43,230
big

186
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:45,630
and beautiful ones.

187
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:52,470
Please fill it up for me.

188
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:00,550
Sorry.

189
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:02,470
It's okay.

190
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:17,390
Besides the royal relatives,

191
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:20,470
only Xi Zhaoming

192
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,420
can set off fireworks in the capital.

193
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:30,270
At this critical period,

194
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,220
if His Majesty sees

195
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:36,270
someone setting off fireworks in the capital,

196
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,010
that means Jiang Xinbai's provoking him

197
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:42,430
with fireworks.

198
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:44,770
The whole Jiang family

199
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,590
might even be held accountable.

200
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:50,980
In that case,

201
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:53,480
let's give them

202
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,760
a nudge.

203
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,500
Mr. Jiang's been

204
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:19,660
working in Blossom Beauty these days.

205
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:20,920
Is he really

206
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,590
planning to freeload off Boss?

207
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:24,720
Freeloaders are those who don't work.

208
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,930
Those who work should be called...

209
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,950
It's called stealing your job.

210
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:31,480
Get back to work.

211
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:43,030
Look.

212
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,490
Is it pretty?

213
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:48,320
Yes.

214
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,190
This is...

215
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:52,990
the dress I gave you?

216
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:54,200
Yes.

217
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:56,870
Today is an important day,

218
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:58,370
so I should dress up.

219
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:00,320
What important day?

220
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:02,320
I have a gift for you.

221
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,640
Just follow me.

222
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:09,030
Fireworks?

223
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:11,840
Once when you were

224
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:13,270
drunk in Heman,

225
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:15,650
you insisted on watching fireworks.

226
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:16,790
You even cried

227
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:18,070
watching them.

228
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,370
That's when I realized

229
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:21,450
fireworks must

230
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,790
mean something special to you.

231
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,100
I don't remember it at all.

232
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:37,110
I know

233
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:39,590
it's dark in the capital now.

234
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:41,930
But there will always be dawn.

235
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:42,990
From now on,

236
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:44,560
I'll be with you.

237
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:46,760
No matter what happens,

238
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:48,400
I'll be with you.

239
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:51,470
Now,

240
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:53,030
don't think about anything.

241
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:53,710
Let's

242
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:55,800
watch fireworks together.

243
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,650
Yan Nanxing.

244
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,010
Thank you for

245
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,960
preparing these fireworks for me.

246
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:16,380
But

247
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:19,440
we can't set them off tonight.

248
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:20,990
Why?

249
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,360
Fireworks in the capital

250
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:34,010
is a privilege

251
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:36,200
His Majesty bestowed to my father.

252
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:38,720
When I was young,

253
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,410
my father would take me to watch fireworks

254
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,970
on his birthday.

255
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,500
It was also here.

256
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:49,960
But later,

257
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:52,070
my father

258
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:53,980
became a sinner.

259
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:56,020
Now,

260
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:58,920
I was dismissed by His Majesty.

261
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:03,350
If we

262
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:04,670
set off fireworks now,

263
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:05,710
it might

264
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:07,550
anger His Majesty.

265
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:19,730
It doesn't matter.

266
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:21,920
Unhappy moments in life are inevitable.

267
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,120
Take me as an example.

268
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,470
I was miserable before.

269
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,100
I was abducted by a human trafficker

270
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:26,800
and almost

271
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:28,600
died in his hands.

272
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,620
Luckily, a young sir saved me.

273
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,180
Later, we ran away

274
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,410
and met a bad guy.

275
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,790
That young sir was taken away.

276
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,900
And I was poisoned by them.

277
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:40,220
That's why

278
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,180
I got this shapeshifting ailment.

279
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,260

384
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:45,440
Actually...

385
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,330
I didn't set off these fireworks.

386
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:01,680
What's going on?

387
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:22,000
Ruoqian!

388
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:22,740
Hurry up.

389
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,400
Come watch the fireworks!

390
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,820
Why are there fireworks today?

391
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,520
Why are there fireworks?

392
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,260
What's going on?

393
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,790
There is no event in the capital today.

394
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,450
Why'd they set off fireworks?

395
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:51,240
Grandfather.

396
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:51,700
Father!

397
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:52,740
Where is Xinbai?

398
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:53,990
Xinbai.

399
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:06,600
Father-in-law.

400
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:09,390
The fireworks tonight...

401
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:12,940
are really beautiful.

402
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:21,750
Oh no.

403
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:24,430
Let's go.

404
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:40,560
The people reported

405
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:43,150
that someone set off fireworks here.

406
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:44,870
It's you two.

407
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:47,230
We didn't set off the fireworks.

408
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:49,070
My lord.

409
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,740
The evidence is here.

410
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:54,440
Do you still want to deny it?

411
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:00,090
Arrest him.

412
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,140
Yes!

413
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,240
Xinbai.

414
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:34,950
Mother.

415
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:36,710
Suoluo.

416
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:40,240
Mr. Pei.

417
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:42,190
Xinbai.

418
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,510
Why are you so calm?

419
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,120
His Majesty dismissed you

420
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:49,830
for Nan Jifeng's matter.

421
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:52,750
Even if this matter's over,

422
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:54,640
His Majesty was

423
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:56,190
being lenient to you.

424
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:57,190
But you?

425
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,200
You had to set off fireworks

426
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:01,030
to protest against His Majesty.

427
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:02,720
Now,

428
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:05,240
His Majesty is furious

429
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:08,550
and decided to punish you severely.

430
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:12,590
Mr. Pei.

431
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:14,830
How does

432
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:17,200
His Majesty plan to punish me?

433
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:19,910
He'll demote you to Yazhou.

434
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,100
Is there no turning back?

435
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:39,750
Commander Shang!

436
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:41,960
Let me explain.

437
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:45,230
I bought the fireworks

438
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:46,190
from Ghost Market.

439
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:46,870
I didn't

440
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:47,620
set them off.

441
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:48,520
Jiang Xinbai

442
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,480
has nothing to do

443
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:50,110
with this.

444
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:52,780
Why should I

445
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:54,880
trust you?

446
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,440
I know you dislike him.

447
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,270
But now's not the time to be spiteful.

448
00:22:58,270 --> 00:22:59,380
Someone's

449
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,130
obviously trying to frame him.

450
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:03,240
I don't believe you can't tell.

451
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,320
He led himself

452
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:06,390
to this plight.

453
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:09,510
It’s all his fault.

454
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:10,790
Commander Shang.

455
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:12,660
Please.

456
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:13,880
I’m begging you.

457
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:15,430
Let me see him.

458
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:17,470
I will give you a reasonable

459
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:18,350
explanation.

460
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:25,920
Guards!

461
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:31,830
In that case,

462
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,230
someone planned

463
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:36,030
to frame you.

464
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,270
Mr. Pei.

465
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:41,650
It must be thoroughly investigated.

466
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:43,540
Xinbai.

467
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:44,990
Do you...

468
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:47,310
have any inkling?

469
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,390
Without evidence,

470
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:54,270
I dare not speculate.

471
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:55,590
Son.

472
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:56,960
At this point,

473
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:57,900
just say it.

474
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:02,590
Maybe

475
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:04,560
it's Lu Dingzhao

476
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:05,790
and Li Jun.

477
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:09,630
Because of Li Wufang?

478
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:13,230
But Jinwu Guards scoured the city

479
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:13,930
and couldn't find

480
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:15,210
who set off fireworks.

481
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:19,720
Since they dared to set off the fireworks,

482
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,530
they wouldn't leave any trace.

483
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:23,670
It'd be foolproof.

484
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:31,050
I'll leave the capital

485
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:32,620
in a few days

486
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:33,590
to Yazhou.

487
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:35,010
Leave the capital?

488
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,880
Why?

489
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:38,570
If you leave the capital,

490
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:39,900
you'll never come back.

491
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,650
Have you forgotten about your father?

492
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:44,510
Mr. Pei.

493
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:45,830
I beg you.

494
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:48,190
Please help Xinbai.

495
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:50,750
I really can't bear

496
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:53,360
to lose another family member.

497
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:54,870
You know that.

498
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:56,680
Please.

499
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,920
I'll go beg Her Majesty

500
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,140
and the crown prince.

501
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:03,400
I'll never let my brother

502
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,130
go to Yazhou.

503
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:06,300
Yes, yes.

504
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,230
Go on now.

505
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:08,270
Suoluo.

506
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:09,700
Calm down.

507
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,580
Do you want me to

508
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,800
watch you get framed?

509
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:14,270
Be strong.

510
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:15,910
Now,

511
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:17,030
Mother

512
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:18,550
and Grandfather

513
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:20,290
both need you.

514
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:21,590
I...

515
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,640
I set off the fireworks alone.

516
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,840
Punish me if you want.

517
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:34,560
Yan Nanxing.

518
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:36,890
Who are you?

519
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:38,160
I am Yan Nanxing.

520
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,080
I'm Blossom Beauty's owner.

521
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:41,430
I bought the fireworks

522
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:42,360
at Ghost Market.

523
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:45,200
Then I invited Jiang Xinbai to the city tower.

524
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:45,930
I've already

525
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:47,720
told Jinwu Guards this.

526
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:49,450
Jiang Xinbai's innocent.

527
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:50,770
You told Jinwu Guards?

528
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,030
Xinbai.

529
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:56,600
Didn't you just say...

530
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:57,310
Mr. Pei.

531
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:58,640
If I say

532
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:00,510
Yan Nanxing

533
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,940
set off the fireworks for me

534
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:05,210
as a marriage proposal...

535
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:10,140
Can you

536
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:12,790
accept this testimony?

537
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:14,760
-Proposal?
-Proposal?

538
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:22,070
Xinbai.

539
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:22,990
You...

540
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:24,390
You promised her?

541
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:25,710
Mother.

542
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:28,180
Is that still important?

543
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:29,160
Yes.

544
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:33,880
I love her.

545
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:39,260
She loves me too.

546
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:56,090
I agreed to her proposal.

547
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:01,350
So

548
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,090
the fireworks were a small accident

549
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:05,580
due to Xinbai and Ms. Yan's

550
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:06,540
love.

551
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:08,730
He didn't offend His Majesty.

552
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,700
Mr. Pei,

553
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,700
please plead for mercy with His Majesty.

554
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:14,750
In that case,

555
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:17,870
if it was really an accident,

556
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:18,730
there

557
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:21,270
might be a turning point.

558
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:22,530
His Majesty

559
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:25,270
understands love too.

560
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,310
That's great.

561
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,750
That's great.

562
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:33,120
I'll go to the palace

563
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:34,870
to plead for mercy now.

564
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:36,830
Suoluo.

565
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:38,750
Go to the palace tomorrow

566
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:40,430
and beg Her Majesty for mercy too.

567
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:40,910
Okay.

568
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:43,750
But

569
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:44,990
Xinbai,

570
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:48,350
since His Majesty has made his promise,

571
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:49,590
the demotion

572
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:51,630
is inevitable.

573
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,400
The difference is

574
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:54,900
where you are demoted to

575
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:56,630
and when you can come back.

576
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:57,710
So...

577
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:59,070
you

578
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:02,870
have to be mentally prepared.

579
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:07,000
As long as I can be with Yan Nanxing,

580
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,500
I'm fine anywhere.

581
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,870
But...

582
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:12,910
Mr. Pei.

583
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:15,140
I have just one request.

584
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:16,310
Go ahead.

585
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:18,070
I wonder

586
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:20,510
if I can marry Yan Nanxing

587
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:22,740
before

588
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,760
leaving the capital.

589
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:31,110
It'd be too

590
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:32,590
unreasonable

591
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:34,430
to reject it.

592
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:35,830
Fine.

593
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:37,010
Then

594
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:40,280
I'll compromise my dignity

595
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:41,710
to beg His Majesty.

596
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:43,270
However,

597
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:44,760
you two

598
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:47,070
must remember

599
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:50,670
not to leave the capital without permission.

600
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:52,970
Thank you, Mr. Pei.

601
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:53,880
Okay.

602
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,660
Your Highness.

603
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:57,640
Let's get going.

604
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:58,480
Okay.

605
00:28:58,670 --> 00:28:59,130
Please.

606
00:28:59,130 --> 00:28:59,650
Okay.

607
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:09,510
Xinbai.

608
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:12,110
We're getting married?

609
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:17,850
This time...

610
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:20,790
It's real?

611
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:23,660
Of course.

612
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:27,010
But this time,

613
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:30,070
I really have nothing.

614
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:33,440
I can't even compare to a tea merchant.

615
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:36,600
Will you still marry me?

616
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,240
Yes!

617
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:01,390
Xinbai.

618
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:04,040
You suddenly want to get married.

619
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:05,390
What can I do?

620
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:16,230
Mother.

621
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:18,990
Pardon me for being unfilial.

622
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:19,670
From now on,

623
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:22,350
I'm going to draw the line

624
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:24,090
with Yuejiang Residence.

625
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,030
The fireworks crime...

626
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:30,110
will be borne by me and my wife.

627
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:34,190
Yuejiang Residence's innocent.

628
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:52,310
Nanxing.

629
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:55,930
The Jiang family has wronged you.

630
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:57,120
For both marriages,

631
00:30:57,670 --> 00:30:58,610
we couldn't give you

632
00:30:58,610 --> 00:30:59,700
a decent wedding.

633
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:01,590
It's fine.

634
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:03,030
I want to marry

635
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:04,470
Jiang Xinbai,

636
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,070
not his family.

637
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:11,090
We'll still be close friends,

638
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:11,850
right?

639
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:21,960
Suoluo.

640
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:25,120
Xinbai, say no more.

641
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:28,430
I'll hold down the fort in Yuejiang Residence.

642
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:30,350
As for you,

643
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:32,680
I believe you've come up with

644
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,880
a thorough solution.

645
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:35,960
Since you won't say it,

646
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:37,400
I won't ask anymore.

647
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:40,110
I will always remember

648
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,880
the things you asked me to do.

649
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:45,550
Good.

650
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:12,190
If I didn't ask you

651
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:13,590
to take General Nan away,

652
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:16,090
he might...

653
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:16,890
Suoluo.

654
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:20,680
It's not your fault.

655
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:24,710
I failed to protect General Nan.

656
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:26,710
Shang.

657
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,120
I’d rather you

658
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:30,880
blame me than see you like this.

659
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:32,800
I trust General Nan

660
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:34,270
wouldn't want to

661
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,230
see you

662
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:37,350
like this.

663
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:40,630
You're right.

664
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:44,390
He was killed by a villain.

665
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:46,490
I haven't avenged him yet.

666
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:49,690
Instead of complaining here,

667
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:52,410
I'd rather go find them

668
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:54,530
and kill them.

669
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:56,920
Shang.

670
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,070
Shang.

671
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:01,830
Talk to Xinbai.

672
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:02,830
He might have

673
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:03,830
figured out a way.

674
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:06,130
I have nothing to talk about with him.

675
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:08,670
You really misunderstood Xinbai.

676
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:10,330
He didn't mean to stand you up.

677
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:11,430
He...

678
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:13,350
He did it to...

679
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:14,750
To go for broke.

680
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:26,960
The fireworks all over the city that night

681
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:27,780
were strange.

682
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:29,070
You know that.

683
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:30,750
Your men have been

684
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:32,310
searching inside and outside the city

685
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,820
for the person who set off the fireworks,

686
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:34,490
right?

687
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:42,230
It's Jinwu Guards' duty

688
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:43,670
to catch the arsonist.

689
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:45,390
I'm not helping you.

690
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:46,960
Although I was demoted,

691
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:48,670
your two-month agreement

692
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:49,830
with His Majesty

693
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:50,750
still stands.

694
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:52,150
But

695
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,040
it's almost expiring.

696
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,720
Thanks for reminding me.

697
00:33:58,190 --> 00:33:59,790
If I can't find any evidence,

698
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:02,110
I'll behead them two

699
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:03,790
along with me

700
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:05,870
to face His Majesty.

701
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:07,550
Shang Bieli.

702
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:09,870
Don't you want to know

703
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:11,920
what my go-for-broke plan

704
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:13,350
is?

705
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:21,910
In the morning, the magnolia stands tall; in the evening,

706
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:24,050
[Great Virtue]

707
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:24,070
it embraces the continent.

708
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,130
[Respect and Uphold Justice]

709
00:34:24,489 --> 00:34:25,550
What are you doing?

710
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:30,429
Who are you?

711
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:33,000
Where are you taking me?

712
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,150
Help me!

713
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:35,350
What are you looking at?

714
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:36,150
Keep writing!

715
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:37,230
Help!

716
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,440
Dean Yan.

717
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:39,639
Help me, Dean Yan.

718
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:40,389
Dean Yan!

719
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:41,350
Help me!

720
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:42,550
Dean Yan!

721
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:44,570
Help me, Dean Yan.

722
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:49,040
Father-in-law.

723
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:51,460
It's a huge victory for us this time.

724
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:53,030
His Majesty

725
00:34:53,389 --> 00:34:55,389
agreed to Jiang Xinbai's marriage,

726
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:57,909
but he's ordered

727
00:34:58,860 --> 00:34:59,909
for him to be

728
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:01,630
demoted to Yazhou after.

729
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:03,989
Even Yuejiang Residence

730
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:05,989
can't protect him.

731
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:11,340
But

732
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:13,650
don’t drop your guard.

733
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:16,760
Jiang Xinbai

734
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:19,670
won’t give up easily.

735
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:21,630
What can he do

736
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:23,270
in such a short time?

737
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:27,350
Bo’an.

738
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:27,870
Shang Bieli.

739
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:29,070
In broad daylight...

740
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:35,490
I've been itching to hit you.

741
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:36,410
Let me tell you.

742
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,460
If I find the evidence

743
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:40,750
and prove that you killed my brother,

744
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:42,310
I'll skin you alive!

745
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:43,350
Stop!

746
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:44,860
Shang Bieli.

747
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,520
Are you crazy?

748
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,350
Yes.

749
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:57,550
Everyone in the capital knows I'm crazy.

750
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,920
Is this your first day in the capital?

751
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:04,150
I'm afraid you don't know

752
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,590
how crazy I am.

753
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:13,310
If you have evidence,

754
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,880
get the Inspection Office to arrest us.

755
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,030
I don’t care if you're really

756
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:21,890
crazy or not.

757
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:25,260
Trying to trick me?

758
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,920
It's not that easy.

759
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:30,960
Commander Shang.

760
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,040
Your grandsons joined hands

761
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,390
to sell fake calligraphy and paintings

762
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:38,510
to make money.

763
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:41,190
I won't let you off.

764
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,080
The person who killed my brother

765
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,260
must pay with their blood!

766
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:53,390
No one can escape!

767
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:57,670
Are you involved?

768
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:01,020
No.

769
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:02,130
Grandfather.

770
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:02,930
Grandfather.

771
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,040
Uncle asked me to do it.

772
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:07,800
And you just obeyed him?

773
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:08,920
Grandfather, I...

774
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:09,580
I was wrong.

775
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:11,300
I was wrong, Grandfather.

776
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:11,870
I was wrong.

777
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:13,790
Can't you be smarter?

778
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:16,130
Go back now.

779
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:17,410
I'll send someone

780
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:19,070
to send you the State of Miluo.

781
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:21,360
Don't drop out of school

782
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:23,090
and don't let anyone know.

783
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:24,510
Leave now!

784
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:26,230
Thank you, Grandfather.

785
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:27,630
Thank you, Grandfather.

786
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:38,930
What do you want?

787
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,890
How dare you get Bo’an involved?

788
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:41,710
Are you crazy?

789
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:43,750
Go report ill health to the Ministry of Personnel

790
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:44,800
and return to your hometown!

791
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,530
Lu Dingzhao!

792
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:47,110
I’ve been slogging for you

793
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:47,640
and obeying

794
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,770
your every order!

795
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:49,950
I did all

796
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:51,000
the dirty work.

797
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,800
Don't I get some credit?

798
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,000
What do you want then?

799
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,700
I paved the path to Tingzhou.

800
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:56,630
I want to continue

801
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:57,890
my business in Tingzhou.

802
00:37:57,890 --> 00:37:59,170
Then go to Tingzhou

803
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,840
and stay there!

804
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:02,250
Don't ever come back!

805
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:11,580
How's it with Li Jun?

806
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:13,040
As you expected,

807
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:15,920
he reported ill health and returned home.

808
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:20,870
I've thought about it these days.

809
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:23,090
Tingzhou connects the Western states.

810
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:25,150
They paved the path to Tingzhou

811
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,380
to deliver Zornia out.

812
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,240
Since they can't sell it in Daqi,

813
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:33,680
they want to harm other states.

814
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,040
They have no conscience.

815
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:39,810
Be gentle.

816
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:44,520
Currently,

817
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:46,030
our first step

818
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:47,100
has worked.

819
00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:48,630
We're just

820
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:51,870
lacking a revolutionary gust of wind.

821
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:53,110
And when will you

822
00:38:53,610 --> 00:38:54,610
make that happen?

823
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:56,630
Relax.

824
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,640
Let me get married first.

825
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:01,030
Jiang Xinbai.

826
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:02,630
I believe

827
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:04,230
you love Yan Nanxing.

828
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,720
But

829
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:07,490
I don't believe

830
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:09,650
you're marrying her now

831
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:11,190
out of love.

832
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:14,270
Shang Bieli.

833
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:18,390
If I tell you

834
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:19,990
you got it wrong,

835
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,250
and I'm the Young Sir

836
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:23,800
Yan Nanxing is looking for,

837
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:24,840
will you believe

838
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:26,490
I'm sincere about

839
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:27,290
this wedding?

840
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:32,750
I'm not lying.

841
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:33,950
It's true.

842
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:39,030
In Yazhou,

843
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:42,790
I went through fire and water with Yan Nanxing.

844
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:43,750
To think

845
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:46,520
our fates are as such.

846
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,150
This time,

847
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:51,390
I'll never miss it again.

848
00:39:57,350 --> 00:39:58,280
Does Yan Nanxing

849
00:39:58,430 --> 00:39:59,470
know about this?

850
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:01,470
I warn you.

851
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:03,360
Don't shoot your mouth off.

852
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:04,590
This is between

853
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:05,350
me and her.

854
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:06,830
I want to wait

855
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:08,710
for everything to be settled

856
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:09,910
before telling her.

857
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,000
Who cares?

858
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,760
You ate them all.

859
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:21,330
Peel them properly.
