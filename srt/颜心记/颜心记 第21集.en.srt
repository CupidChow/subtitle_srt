73

Since you knew my name,

74
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,350
you could find out

I took you home to let you rest.

00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:01,200
nor did I think too much.

94

What kind of friends do you need?

105
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:26,790
Only those who can

106
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,160
always stay by my side

So,

stop saying

and disturb the chancellor?

122
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:14,110
You asked him to clean this place up?

Yes.

124

His name is Liu Ruoqian.

125
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:21,470
He's the slave student the Imperial Academy

126
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:23,000
made an exception to admit.

127
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:23,980
He told us

128
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:25,830
he wanted to work in order to earn tuition.

129
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:26,690
So, we asked him

to do some physical labor.

131
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:32,270
However,

132
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:34,750
as a slave,

133
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,660
you're not qualified to take the imperial exams

134
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,260
and can never be an official.

135

What's the use of studying

136
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:42,870
at the Imperial Academy?

137
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:46,030
Why are you still standing here?

138
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:46,670
Go away.

139
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:50,190
Is becoming an official the only purpose of study?

140
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:52,270

Dean Yan, as a teacher,

144
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,600
how can you judge your student

145
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,260
based on traditional values?

146
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:06,230
I didn't mean to humiliate him.

147
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:07,030

to teach him some rules.

Please don't argue about me.

152

Since I was a child,

153
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:17,020
I've heard many humiliating words

like this.

155
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,780
If I cared about these words,

156
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,590
I wouldn't be studying at the Imperial Academy.

157

Although I'm a slave,

158
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:27,350
I'm not ashamed of it.

159

No matter what others say,

160
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:30,880
it can't hurt me.

161

Don't tell him it's from me.

00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:33,250
Although your nose has grown back,

179
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:35,120
it will take some time

180
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,870
to get your sense of smell back.

181
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:41,030
It's okay.

182
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:42,190
I got this.

183
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:43,230
I will get

184
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:45,030
Mr. Shang's sense of smell back.

185
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:46,610
I never owe anyone.

186
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:48,430
If there's anything you want me to do,

187
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:49,360
just let me know.

188
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:53,550
Don't mind if I do.

189
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,390
Actually,

190
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,190
I want you

191
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,530
to find someone for me.

192
00:12:58,590 --> 00:12:59,990
I know who you want to find.

193
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:00,390
Boss,

194
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:00,950
you want to find

195
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:02,550
the boy who saved you, right?

196
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:05,770
The Inspection Office

197
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:06,590
is better

198
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:08,590
at finding people than the Jinwu Guards.

199
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:10,920
Why don't you ask Jiang Xinbai to help you?

200
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:12,590
I don't want him

201
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:14,710
to worry about this anymore.

202
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:15,910
So,

203
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,400
I can only ask you for help.

204
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:19,070
Okay.

205
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:21,470
Thank you.

206
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:44,800
Bravo!

207
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:57,640
Chancellor.

208
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:00,440
Chancellor.

209
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:03,200
We meet by chance this time.

210
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:04,620
I didn't follow you.

211
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:05,470
I know.

212
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,220
I misjudged you

213
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:09,070
at the Imperial Academy today.

214
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,260
Don't worry about it.

215
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:12,800
I really don't mind it.

216
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:15,870
Chancellor.

217
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:16,870
Let me take these.

218
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:18,070
Thank you.

219
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,000
Chancellor.

220
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,100
Someone from the academy told me

221
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,300
you gave me a pay rise.

222
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:28,790
Thank you.

223
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:30,640
You deserve it.

224
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,780
Are you going this way too?

225
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,390
I'm carrying these books for you.

226
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:40,520
Let me walk with you.

227
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:41,950
Where are you going?

228
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,870
I'm going to the bookstore.

229
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,370
Then I'll go to the bookstore with you.

230
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,630
It's late.

231
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,350
Why isn't he back yet?

232
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:19,410
Even if he doesn't want to come home for dinner, he should change his dressing.

233
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,080
Ms. Yan.

234
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:53,690
Where is your lord?

235
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,380
He's been reading the file

236
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,290
on Li Wufang's case

237
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:57,750
in the file room since noon.

238
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:58,510
You can go in.

239
00:15:58,830 --> 00:15:59,630
I'll stay out.

240
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:00,430
Thank you.

241
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:09,240
You only care

242
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,180
about the case.

243
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:13,560
Why didn't you go home early to change your dressing?

244
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,910
Sit still.

245
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:23,250
Let's do it.

246
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:25,550
What's wrong?

247
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,290
What are you doing?

248
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,760
Taking off your clothes.

249
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:34,710
How can I change your dressing with your clothes on?

250
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,390
I don't think it's appropriate.

251
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:37,830
What are you shy about?

252
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:38,830
I also

253
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,510
changed your dressing at home.

254
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:42,150
We're not at home after all.

255
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:44,450
We're at the Inspection Office.

256
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,310
What are you afraid of?

257
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:47,710
There's no one else here.

258
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:49,670
Anyway...

259
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:50,680
Anyway...

260
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,280
This feels strange.

261
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,830
You're so troublesome.

262
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:03,510
Okay.

263
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:05,410
Let's get started.

264
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,000
What now?

265
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:11,990
Actually,

266
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:15,000
my wound

267
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,060
has almost healed.

268
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:17,720
I knew it.

269
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:21,430
If you don't want to change your dressing,

270
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:23,960
you should at least take the oral medication.

271
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:25,430
Luckily,

272
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:26,250
I was smart.

273
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:29,230
See? I've prepared it.

274
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:33,480
Alright.

275
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,730
It hasn't turned cold.

276
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:36,430
Here.

277
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:37,440
Let me feed you.

278
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,060
It's not hot anymore.

279
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,760
I'll blow on it for you.

280
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:50,150
Okay.

281
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:51,680
It's cooler now.

282
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:52,750
Wait.

283
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:04,630
I see.

284
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,950
Is Chief Constable Jiang

285
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:08,150
afraid

286
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,590
of bitterness?

287
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:18,060
Who said I'm afraid of bitterness?

288
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:18,860
Then drink it.

289
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:27,920
Drink it.

290
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:40,470
Here.

291
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,300
The bitter taste is gone, right?

292
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,720
♫Sit with you at night and listen to the wind♫

293
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,020
Yes.

294
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:01,150
♫When the wind flutters, the heart does too♫

295
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:04,770
♫Step by step, no words are spoken♫

296
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,740
♫Barged into sight♫

297
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:12,210
♫When did your figure grow hazy?♫

298
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,860
♫And how clear is it?♫

299
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,610
♫I don't intend to break your heart♫

300
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,820
♫Silently fall into my arms♫

301
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:28,390
Mr. Yao.

302
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:29,790
Are you going home?

303
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:30,310
Yes.

304
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:30,950
Well,

305
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:32,110
has Mr. Jiang gone home?

306
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:32,990
It's very late.

307
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:34,310
I think he has gone home.

308
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:35,870
Take a look around and lock the door.

309
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:36,390
Okay.

310
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,030
You were so stupid.

311
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:46,880
You went there

312
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,230
just because Li Wufang asked you to?

313
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:52,560
What else could I do?

314
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:55,270
I couldn't just watch you get hurt

315
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,300
and do nothing.

316
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:59,330
What if he was trying to scare you?

317
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:00,990
What if I was fine?

318
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,860
I couldn't take the risk.

319
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:16,230
Back then,

320
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:19,460
when my father was investigating

321
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,620
the Zornia case,

322
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:22,860
he found

323
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,350
a very important witness.

324
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,800
As long as the witness testified,

325
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,310
he could have removed

326
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:31,250
the force behind the Zornia.

327
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:34,790
However,

328
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:37,550
the night before the witness testified

329
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:39,150
against the Zornia gang,

330
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:41,750
the witness died.

331
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,780
His whole family was killed.

332
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,160
Was the murderer found?

333
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:55,180
This matter

334
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:58,070
became my father's lifelong pain.

335
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:00,030
That witness

336
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:02,340
had the same surname as you.

337
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:03,920
His surname was Yan too.

338
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:06,090
His name was Yan Zhizhong.

339
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,190
Actually...

340
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,260
Actually, my surname is not Yan.

341
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:14,710
My mother said

342
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,230
she named me

343
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:17,180
after my savior.

344
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:18,520
His surname was Yan.

345
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:28,230
Yan Nanxing.

346
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:30,070
Although

347
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,080
you're not related to Yan Zhizhong,

348
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,650
and although you are not my witness...

349
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:36,550
Whenever I

350
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:38,990
think of how

351
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:40,880
Li Wufang kidnapped you

352
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,210
and forced me to submit,

353
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:43,370
whenever I think of

354
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:46,910
how you almost got hurt

355
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:48,270
because of me,

356
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:51,860
whenever I think of...

357
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:52,860
But I trust you.

358
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,410
I believe

359
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,050
you are no longer

360
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:59,710
the Jiang Xinbai from before.

361
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:00,820
Now,

362
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:03,360
you can save the people from danger

363
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,990
and rescue every person in front of you.

364
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,280
You can also protect me.

365
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:23,420
I will.

366
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,180
Are you hungry?

367
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:38,670
Let's go home and eat.

368
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:40,270
I feel so hungry.

369
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:47,550
Why is the door locked?

370
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:51,520
Is anyone here?

371
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:54,990
Is anyone here?

372
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:58,480
I think it was locked from the outside.

373
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,220
What should we do?

374
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:06,830
Don't worry.

375
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,870
Tomorrow is the Doors Open Day.

376
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:09,710
It will open

377
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:10,980
two hours earlier than usual.

378
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,440
What is the Doors Open Day?

379
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,460
The Inspection Office

380
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,990
has a Doors Open Day

381
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:22,590
on the 1st and 15th of each month.

382
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:23,520
We open our doors

383
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:25,550
and if the common people

384
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:26,580
have any injustices,

385
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,230
they can come and complain.

386
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:31,090
Let's make do with it tonight.

387
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:32,190
Tomorrow,

388
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:33,470
as soon as

389
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:34,490
the door opens,

390
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,910
I'll take you to eat something delicious.

391
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:42,350
Okay.

392
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:48,510
But

393
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:50,550
we...

394
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:19,030
I know

395
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,020
you want to protect me,

396
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:23,830
but I still hope

397
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,890
that if you face any difficulties

398
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,700
you can face it with me in the future.

399
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:32,510
Don't bear everything

400
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:35,430
or make decisions

401
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,430
all by yourself.

402
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:40,360
You should at least tell me.

403
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:43,150
Okay?

404
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:48,070
Okay?

405
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:50,390
I'm talking to you.

406
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:54,200
Are you asleep?

407
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:56,650
Don't pretend to be asleep.

408
00:24:56,650 --> 00:24:58,010
I'm not gullible.

409
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:04,770
Are you really asleep?

410
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:26,990
You're injured

411
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:30,110
and you still worked so hard.

412
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:34,860
You must be tired.

413
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,440
Why are you so pretty?

414
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:01,710
[Guangyu Hall]

415
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:04,790
Zhiyi,

416
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,440
you can't sleep at all

417
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,110
for so many nights.

418
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:07,910
This can't do.

419
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,570
It breaks my heart to see it.

420
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:10,100
How about

421
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,390
we call an imperial physician for a checkup?

422
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:13,470
What for?

423
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:15,320
When I entered the palace yesterday,

424
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,380
Her Majesty told me

425
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,670
that half a month ago,

426
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:18,930
Xinbai and Shang Bieli

427
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,670
were both called by His Majesty.

428
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:22,530
His Majesty even lost his temper.

429
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:23,190
I wonder

430
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:24,190
what happened.

431
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:26,570
Just thinking about it makes me nervous.

432
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:27,550
It hurts.

433
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:28,810
I didn't do anything.

434
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:29,670
It still hurts.

435
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:30,910
Okay, it's my fault.

436
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:36,840
Don't worry.

437
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:38,440
It's been a long time since then.

438
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,300
It will be fine.

439
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:41,430
Being with a king is like being with a tiger.

440
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:42,710
You know how Xinbai is.

441
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:44,030
Since childhood,

442
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:45,190
he only tells us good news.

443
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:45,810
We don't even know

444
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:46,720
what happened.

445
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,150
We can't help at all.

446
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:50,750
How about

447
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:52,200
I go to the Inspection Office

448
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,460
and ask what happened?

449
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:54,630
No.

450
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:56,460
It's been so many days

451
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,190
and he hasn't even come to see me.

452
00:28:58,190 --> 00:28:59,310
Why would you go to see him?

453
00:28:59,310 --> 00:28:59,840
Don't go.

454
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:01,510
Fine.

455
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:02,210
I won't go.

456
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:05,560
Is today

457
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:07,850
the Inspection Office's Doors Open Day?

458
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:10,230
Don’t move. It’s not done yet.

459
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:11,630
I'm going to report my son

460
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:12,710
and say my son is unfilial

461
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:13,950
and shows off at home.

462
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:14,580
So early?

463
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:15,840
I'm done.

464
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:16,710
You need to look proper.

465
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:17,710
It's not done yet.

466
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:19,480
I won't. I'll just be improper.

467
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:27,950
My lord.

468
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:29,430
My lord?

469
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:33,030
My lord,

470
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:35,110
why did you two sleep here?

471
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:45,590
Don't tell anyone

472
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:46,450
about this.

473
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,680
It's too late.

474
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:56,540
Right? Look.

475
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:57,490
Yes.

476
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:07,470
I can explain.

477
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:07,950
Shut up.

478
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:11,400
Speak up.

479
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:15,210
Speak up.

480
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:16,880
Speak up.

481
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:25,850
Mr. Jiang,

482
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:26,860
what's going on

483
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:28,620
between you and Ms. Yan?

484
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:29,790
Are you two

485
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:31,030
together?

486
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:32,750
Is the rumor true?

487
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:35,280
We have to face

488
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:36,490
what we must face.

489
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:41,790
Zhiyi!

490
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:43,290
Don't be angry.

491
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:44,310
Zhiyi.

492
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:52,830
Let go!

493
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:01,220
Yan Nanxing.

494
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:04,030
It's okay.

495
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:05,990
No matter what happens,

496
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:07,790
we'll face it together.

497
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:08,870
I...

498
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:12,720
Didn't she leave the capital?

499
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:14,350
Were you hiding her

500
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:15,310
these days?

501
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:16,350
Yes.

502
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:18,000
During this period,

503
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:18,790
Yan Nanxing

504
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,410
has been living in my house.

505
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:24,090
She is a traveler,

506
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:26,790
but she's been freeloading off of you.

507
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:27,590
What else

508
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:30,030
have you two done?

509
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:31,870
We even—

510
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:34,130
We reconciled and patched things up.

511
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:43,800
I want to talk to Yan Nanxing alone.

512
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:44,990
Get out.

513
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:54,940
Will you be okay?

514
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:00,270
Sure.

515
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,610
Have a good chat.

516
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:08,160
Don't worry.

517
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,450
I won't do anything stupid.

518
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:12,710
Go.

519
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,430
You're not leaving?

520
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:52,930
She almost discovered me.

521
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:55,190
This girl

522
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,300
is quite similar to your mother.

523
00:32:57,730 --> 00:32:58,460
She's smart,

524
00:32:59,090 --> 00:32:59,840
gentle,

525
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:01,110
and kind.

526
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:03,410
Right, Mr. Yan?

527
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,010
Name your price.

528
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:11,550
What price?

529
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:16,200
How much money do you need to leave Xinbai?

530
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:20,740
I didn't expect

531
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:22,710
such cliche words

532
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:24,310
would come from

533
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,110
the princess.

534
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,290
So tacky.

535
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:28,730
You're too shy to do it?

536
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:29,840
Fine.

537
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:32,160
I'll name the price for you.

538
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:33,390
One hundred taels of gold

539
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:35,330
is enough for you to live a good life.

540
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:36,080
As long as you leave,

541
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,540
I'll pay you immediately.

542
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:49,190
What is this?

543
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,870
You said you would give me 100 taels of gold,

544
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:53,470
but I don't see anything yet.

545
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,740
I'm different.

546
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:56,150
I'm a woman of my word.

547
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,460
I'll give it to you now.

548
00:33:58,350 --> 00:33:59,630
Since I promised you,

549
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,780
I will reward you with gold

550
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:03,120
as long as you leave.

551
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:05,560
If you give me 100 taels of gold,

552
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:07,650
I'll give you 100 taels of gold

553
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,850
and one copper coin.

554
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:11,510
If you give me 1,000 taels of gold,

555
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:13,330
I'll give you 1,000 taels of gold

556
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:14,920
and one copper coin.

557
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:15,530
You!

558
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,290
I'll always give more than you.

559
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:25,389
Why are they speaking nonsense?

560
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:27,000
Are they going to fight?

561
00:34:27,429 --> 00:34:29,230
Let them spill their hearts out.

562
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:30,940
Wait for them to

563
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:32,000
release their emotions.

564
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:32,719
After that,

565
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,600
everything will be doable.

566
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:36,190
That makes sense.

567
00:34:36,389 --> 00:34:37,449
Let's listen more.

568
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:38,909
You're a traitor.

569
00:34:38,929 --> 00:34:40,159
I treated you as my best friend,

570
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:41,170
but you seduced my son

571
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:42,080
and cheated me of my feelings.

572
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:42,989
How did I lie to you?

573
00:34:42,989 --> 00:34:43,790
I met your son

574
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:44,310
before I met you.

575
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:45,270
How did I lie?

576
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:45,960
You!

577
00:34:45,989 --> 00:34:46,800
What?

578
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,460
You said I was your close friend.

579
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,389
I'm not good enough for you.

580
00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:49,400
You are heartless.

581
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:49,960
They're fighting.

582
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:50,800
When did I ever look down on you?

583
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,790
Never.

584
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,659
You say you don't mind,

585
00:34:52,659 --> 00:34:53,409
but your feelings are honest.

586
00:34:53,409 --> 00:34:54,290
I'm your best friend when I say nice things.

587
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:55,199
I'm heartless when I don't.

588
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:56,010
You're such a wicked mother-in-law.

589
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:56,310
Wicked...

590
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:57,230
Wicked mother-in-law?

591
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:58,150
Wicked mother-in-law!

592
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:58,630
Okay.

593
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:00,410
I'll be the wicked mother-in-law.

594
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:01,060
You hit me?

595
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:06,570
Wait a bit more.

596
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:07,630
I'm so worried.

597
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:08,230
Just wait.

598
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:09,590
Okay.

599
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:14,120
Yan Nanxing!

600
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:14,720
Hurry up!

601
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:15,910
Let go!

602
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:16,850
Let go!

603
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,080
-Enough, Yan Nanxing.
-Stop fighting!

604
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:20,230
Zhiyi!

605
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:21,190
Why are you fighting?

606
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:22,390
You are the princess.

607
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:23,520
What are you doing?

608
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,710
Are you helping me or her?

609
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:26,240
It has nothing to do with me.

610
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:39,110
Zhiyi.

611
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:40,440
Can't sleep?

612
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:00,590
What's wrong?

613
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:01,950
I'm angry.

614
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,670
Actually,

615
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:06,670
I’ve been thinking of Yan Nanxing

616
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:07,830
every day,

617
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,610
but she said those things about me.

618
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:11,760
What did she say?

619
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,790
She said I only listen to what I want to hear.

620
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:16,020
She said I'm arrogant.

621
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,550
She said I'm unreasonable.

622
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,090
She even said I'm a wicked mother-in-law.

623
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:21,660
I'm not a wicked mother-in-law,

624
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:22,110
right?

625
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:28,170
Why aren't you saying anything?

626
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:35,330
I'm not that kind of person, am I?

627
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,440
You're not usually like this.

628
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,470
But

629
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:49,210
you care more about the people and things

630
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:50,950
around Xinbai.

631
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:53,110
Your concern makes you anxious,

632
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:53,640
so

633
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,000
you treat Yan Nanxing

634
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,430
a bit more strictly.

635
00:36:58,550 --> 00:36:59,590
Look,

636
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:01,350
so many people

637
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,040
saw Xinbai and Yan Nanxing

638
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:03,900
together today

639
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:05,670
and you made a scene too.

640
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:08,140
Who knows what the people

641
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:09,890
are saying

642
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,030
about this now?

643
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:14,150
What should I do?

644
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:16,590
I was just angry.

645
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:17,950
I couldn't help it.

646
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:20,360
Don't cry.

647
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:22,270
It's okay.

648
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:26,340
At most, those ignorant people

649
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:27,950
will say

650
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,010
that Blossom Beauty closed

651
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:31,990
because you abused your power

652
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:33,720
and bullied a commoner.

653
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:35,510
But it's okay.

654
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:36,970
How about this?

655
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:38,800
Yan Nanxing is living with Xinbai

656
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,030
because she has nowhere to stay.

657
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:40,950
In my opinion,

658
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:45,230
you should let Yan Nanxing reopen Blossom Beauty.

659
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:48,190
Suoluo told me already.

660
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,600
Xinbai has taken the title deed.

661
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:56,040
How come even Suoluo

662
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:57,190
is biased

663
00:37:57,210 --> 00:37:58,240
toward her brother now?

664
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,150
That's good.

665
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,480
It's sibling love,

666
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:01,630
right?

667
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:03,510
Fine.

668
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:06,080
Blossom Beauty can reopen,

669
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:07,580
but Yan Nanxing

670
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:09,240
can never be my daughter-in-law.

671
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:09,810
Why?

672
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:11,630
You don't understand.

673
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:12,310
When Xinbai

674
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:14,110
went on a blind date with Ms. Pei,

675
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:15,830
I asked Yan Nanxing to be the matchmaker.

676
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:16,910
If Pei Linfu

677
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:18,140
realizes that Xinbai

678
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:19,710
brought his ex-wife

679
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:21,140
on a date with his daughter

680
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:22,340
and made up in the end,

681
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,350
he might get angry and treat Xinbai badly.

682
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:25,610
Then what should we do?

683
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:28,590
It's that complicated?

684
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:29,790
Yes, it's that complicated.

685
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:31,080
Let's put Pei Linfu aside.

686
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,360
Yan Nanxing herself

687
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:33,630
is a troublemaker.

688
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,950
Xinbai is already treading on thin ice.

689
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:37,460
I can't let him be harmed by her.

690
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:37,980
So,

691
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,060
I must break them up

692
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,880
and be a wicked mother-in-law.

693
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:44,310
Why is love

694
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:45,610
so hard?

695
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,960
It's as hard as flying in the sky.

696
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:50,200
I ask the world,

697
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:52,470
what is love?

698
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:53,460
I just—

699
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:53,870
All right.

700
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:54,670
Stop talking.

701
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:56,940
Just remember one thing.

702
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:58,210
Keep an eye on Blossom Beauty.

703
00:38:58,210 --> 00:38:59,340
If anything happens,

704
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:00,540
tell me immediately.

705
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:05,950
I'll keep an eye on her.

706
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,530
What happened to your face?

707
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,470
Who hit you?

708
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:11,590
Let me see.

709
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:13,070
Why is it so red?

710
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:14,150
Is it five fingerprints?

711
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:14,550
Yes.

712
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:17,350
Stretch out your hand and check.

713
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:18,090
Compare it.

714
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:20,210
Isn't the size just right?

715
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,480
It wasn't me.

716
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:23,710
You're playing dumb.

717
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:38,910
You haven't eaten anything all day.

718
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:39,990
Eat some first.

719
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:42,270
These drumsticks and scallion pancakes

720
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:43,600
are all your favorites.

721
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:51,360
I didn't come to save you in time

722
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:53,230
because I wanted to give you two some space

723
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:54,070
to

724
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:56,530
vent your anger

725
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:58,850
and be honest with each other.

726
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:00,750
What trick is this?

727
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:07,270
To be honest,

728
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:09,070
it's good that you two

729
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:10,650
made a scene like this.

730
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:11,760
How is it good?

731
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:13,370
First,

732
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:15,550
for the sake of the people,

733
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:17,790
my mother won't target you anymore.

734
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:18,430
Second,

735
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,750
since everyone knows

736
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:22,030
about our relationship now,

737
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:23,290
Yuejiang's Residence

738
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:24,720
won't ignore it either.

739
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:26,390
Li Wufang

740
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:28,190
already has his eyes on you.

741
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:29,180
This means

742
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:30,590
the people behind him

743
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:31,840
will be after you too.

744
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:32,510
I'm afraid

745
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:34,750
I won't be able to

746
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:37,040
protect you by myself anymore.

747
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:38,670
So,

748
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:41,550
you wanted us to make up

749
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:45,470
and make it public

750
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:47,030
so I can be

751
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:49,090
protected by Yuejiang's Residence?

752
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:54,470
Then

753
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:56,230
is there

754
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:57,230
any other reason?

755
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:00,670
What other reasons do you think

756
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:01,530
there could be?

757
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:03,510
You

758
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:04,500
are so weird.

759
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:05,680
How would I know?

760
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:07,390
You're so smart.

761
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:09,090
How could you not know?

762
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:10,110
I'm not smart.

763
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:11,290
You have to tell me.

764
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:23,360
What is this?

765
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:27,780
Blossom Beauty can reopen.

766
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:29,810
Now that I'm your Boss,

767
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:30,680
no one

768
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:32,840
will dare to kick you out again.

769
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:34,510
How did you get it?

770
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:36,870
I have my own ways.

771
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:41,750
When Li Wufang

772
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:43,740
arrested me that day,

773
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:45,910
was this

774
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:48,280
the important thing that you wanted to

775
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:50,120
talk to me about?

776
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:57,790
Well...

777
00:41:58,910 --> 00:41:59,960
Well, thank you.

778
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:02,560
What do you mean "well, thank you"?

779
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:05,450
You're still unhappy?

780
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:07,590
Wait.

781
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:11,970
Look what this is.

782
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:13,920
What is this now?

783
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,830
I got the title deed

784
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:20,690
of your residence too.

785
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:26,750
You...

786
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:28,430
You...

787
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:30,350
really...

788
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,650
can do anything you want.

789
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:39,790
No, Yan Nanxing.

790
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:40,250
I'm not—

791
00:42:40,330 --> 00:42:41,660
I'm not kicking you out.

792
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:42,760
Enough. Stop it.

793
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:46,350
If you think

794
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:47,020
you like living here,

795
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:48,280
of course you can stay.

796
00:42:48,330 --> 00:42:48,910
No need.

797
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:51,560
I don't like it here.

798
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:53,230
Anyway, you gave me

799
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:54,650
the title and land deeds.

800
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:55,680
Tomorrow...

801
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:56,670
Tomorrow,

802
00:42:56,970 --> 00:42:57,870
I'll move back.

803
00:42:58,430 --> 00:42:59,360
No, Yan Nanxing.

804
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,170
You haven't eaten yet.

805
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:06,750
Thank you.

806
00:43:08,470 --> 00:43:09,110
Yan Nanxing!
