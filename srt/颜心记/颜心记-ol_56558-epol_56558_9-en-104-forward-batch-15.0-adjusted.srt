5
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:06,729
Father,

6
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:09,210
let me propose a toast to you.

7
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:11,200
I hope everything goes as you wish.

8
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,020
Everything goes as I wish?

9
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,400
You'd better control

10
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,550
your son.

11
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,460
Where did Xinbai go?

12
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,920
He purposely made Shang Bieli

13
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:29,150
put on an act for me.

14
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,590
Can these small tricks

15
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,590
fool me?

16
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:35,990
Didn't Xinbai say

17
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:37,930
he has something important to do?

18
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:39,910
Father,

19
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,110
don't be mad at him.

20
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:43,550
Daughter,

21
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:46,070
you might not know.

22
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:47,390
A few days ago,

23
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:50,990
His Majesty summoned me to the Imperial Study.

24
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:54,260
He mentioned the succession

25
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,829
of the Yuejiang's Residence.

26
00:02:55,829 --> 00:02:56,670
Succession?

27
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:58,310
I'm still alive and well.

28
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,920
What is His Majesty worried about?

29
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,920
Don't be willful.

30
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,450
You know the Yuejiang lineage

31
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,780
is the only noble family

32
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,840
in the capital with another surname.

33
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:08,530
His Majesty

34
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:09,750
pays special attention

35
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,810
to the successor of the Jiang family.

36
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:12,690
Suoluo

37
00:03:12,829 --> 00:03:14,550
is the crown prince's teacher.

38
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:16,430
She's close to the empress.

39
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:18,990
With the empress's input,

40
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,630
His Majesty's opinion

41
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,130
changed.

42
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:24,190
He wants Suoluo

43
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:25,790
to inherit the title.

44
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,390
What do you think?

45
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,840
Since I let my daughter take the title,

46
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,320
I'm naturally not against

47
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,870
letting my granddaughter take it either.

48
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:35,310
Father!

49
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,110
I know

50
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,870
you've always felt

51
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:39,470
pity and indebtedness

52
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:41,270
toward Xinbai all these years

53
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,910
and want him to inherit the title,

54
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:43,590
but

55
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:46,040
he's too similar to his father.

56
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,980
Zhaoming was a criminal after all.

57
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,160
Xinbai being like Zhaoming

58
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,470
is not a good thing

59
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,630
for His Majesty.

60
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:06,710
You look skinny,

61
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:08,110
but you're quite strong.

62
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:09,230
I do hard labor.

63
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:10,310
Be careful.

64
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:10,790
Okay.

65
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:17,070
He's not in a hurry to leave

66
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,660
after delivering the vegetables.

67
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,930
Is he suspicious?

68
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,150
We'll know

69
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,650
after investigating.

70
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:29,330
My lord,

71
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:31,320
there is still a woman left.

72
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:32,790
Is it possible that she is

73
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:35,050
the vegetable deliverer's accomplice?

74
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,320
Where is she now?

75
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:38,950
Bravo! Bravo!

76
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:39,550
One more!

77
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,160
Bravo! Bravo!

78
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:42,040
One more!

79
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:45,110
Bravo! Bravo!

80
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:49,800
What a big pancake.

81
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:50,830
Boss,

82
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,330
I want the biggest one.

83
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:53,830
One hundred coppers.

84
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,110
One hundred coppers?

85
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:57,870
That is too expensive.

86
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:00,470
Forget it. I don't want it anymore.

87
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:02,470
You must buy it after pointing at it.

88
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:04,060
I must buy it after pointing at it?

89
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:04,950
Why?

90
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:06,990
You're extorting money.

91
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:11,880
You're right.

92
00:05:11,909 --> 00:05:13,120
I'm extorting you,

93
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:15,670
because I haven't sold anything yet today.

94
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:16,870
What does your poor business

95
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:17,950
have to do with me?

96
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:19,030
I won't buy it.

97
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,390
Are you buying or not?

98
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:32,750
I'll buy it.

99
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:34,790
I happen to be hungry.

100
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:37,080
This is cheap. It's ten coppers.

101
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:38,070
Ten coppers?

102
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:39,600
It's a good price.

103
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:41,430
Ten coppers is great.

104
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:42,830
Here, Boss.

105
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:47,680
By the way, Boss,

106
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,940
I want to ask you something.

107
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:51,670
It's said that the Ghost Market

108
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:53,190
has a pawnbroker named Mr. Cao,

109
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:55,120
but I walked down the entire street

110
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:57,050
and didn't see any pawnshops.

111
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:58,310
Everyone in the Ghost Market

112
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,909
knows Mr. Cao.

113
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,070
His shop

114
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,720
doesn't need any signs.

115
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,150
Then how can I find it?

116
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,630
Give me ten more coppers.

117
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,150
Alright.

118
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:08,500
Ten coppers

119
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,670
is no big deal.

120
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:10,110
Here.

121
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:12,800
It's across the street.

122
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:18,550
That one?

123
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:20,800
It's just a few steps

124
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:22,680
and you charged me ten coppers?

125
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,350
You're purposely scamming me.

126
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:26,380
Your shop is a scam!

127
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:26,710
Iâ€”

128
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,700
Did he scam you?

129
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:35,670
No.

130
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,230
Of course not.

131
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:38,760
I was just kidding

132
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,360
to liven up the atmosphere.

133
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:41,780
Everyone,

134
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,270
this shop has great prices.

135
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,150
Come and buy.

136
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:45,830
Go on with your work.

137
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:46,990
Go ahead with your work.

138
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:47,550
Go ahead.

139
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,150
Go ahead.

140
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:48,810
It's great.

141
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:49,770
Go ahead with your work.

142
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:51,300
You don't have to see me off.

143
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:58,420
It's a full moon today.

144
00:06:58,450 --> 00:06:59,450
The code?

145
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:01,510
I'll make it quick.

146
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:02,240
You're here.

147
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:04,030
You're quite early.

148
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:05,310
Are you

149
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:06,850
Mr. Cao?

150
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:08,070
Yes.

151
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,220
You knew I was coming?

152
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,690
I've been waiting for you.

153
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:12,870
Mr. Cao

154
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,740
is indeed a trader of information.

155
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,350
He really is all-knowing.

156
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:24,110
This tea...

157
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:25,590
is free, right?

158
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:26,650
You must be joking.

159
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:27,330
Be my guest.

160
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:42,540
The verbal code is "it's a full moon tonight,"

161
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:44,810
but she said, "it's a full moon today.".

162
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:45,630
I'm thirsty.

163
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:46,470
The signal code

164
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:48,070
is to take one sip of each cup,

165
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:49,450
but she drank it all.

166
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:51,900
Why is the contact person chosen this time

167
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,310
so careless?

168
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,030
Miss,

169
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:56,590
where do you come from

170
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,970
and where are you going?

171
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:59,390
Iâ€™m from Heman.

172
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:01,510
Why do you care about where I'm going?

173
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:02,350
Here's the thing.

174
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:03,700
I have something urgent today.

175
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:04,860
Let's make it quick.

176
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:05,830
Great.

177
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:07,040

00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:00,190
is right beside you.

355
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,390
Beside me?

356
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:03,800
He's in the capital too?

357
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,650
Heaven's secret must not be revealed.

358
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:12,200
What I mean

359
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:14,150
is that when he should come,

360
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,790
he will come back to you.

361
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:17,470
I...

362
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:18,890
I have another question.

363
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:19,430
That is,

364
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,030
I was cursed

365
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:21,850
and poisoned.

366
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:22,800
What should I do?

367
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:24,080
Get married.

368
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,110
Marriage will cure all illnesses.

369
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,510
Go get married, my child.

370
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:28,310
But I've

371
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:29,330
already gotten married

372
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:30,590
and even got divorced.

373
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:32,070
Then get married again.

374
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:33,490
You weren't sincere in your last marriage.

375
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:35,220
You even know I wasn't sincere?

376
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:35,950
Psychic,

377
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:36,960
I have another question.

378
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,380
Psychicâ€”

379
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:37,950
Sis,

380
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:39,350
hurry.

381
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,430
Watch the shop for me.

382
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:41,270
I can't stand it anymore.

383
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:42,600
I'm going to the toilet.

384
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,140
Give me the token

385
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,960
and I'll spare your life.

386
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:26,270
Stop!

387
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,430
This...

388
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:37,720
He's dead.

389
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:44,470
Cut him open

390
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:45,810
and take out the token.

391
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:46,470
-Yes.
-Yes.

392
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:02,720
My lord.

393
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,540
The inventory holder doesn't know

394
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:17,940
that the contact is dead.

395
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:19,550
I don't think he's ready yet.

396
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:21,200
Seal off the Ghost Market immediately.

397
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,200
To ensure safety,

398
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:24,080
they always carry their token.

399
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,380
As long as we find the other half,

400
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,540
we can find the holder

401
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,720
and Zornia.

402
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:31,710
Got it.

403
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:44,130
[Persian Fortune Teller]

404
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:14,510
You are

405
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:16,470
the Persian psychic?

406
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,310
My child,

407
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:23,130
what are you looking for?

408
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,790
What fortune telling can you do?

409
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,270
Everything.

410
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:30,140
Okay.

411
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,040
Then tell me

412
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,110
if I can get what I want.

413
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:39,000
I asked the deity.

414
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:40,430
The deity told me

415
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,370
that it depends on your sincerity.

416
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,600
I'm rich!

417
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,850
The Ghost Market is a great place.

418
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,880
I asked the deity.

419
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:58,830
The deity told me

420
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,830
your wish will come true

421
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,140
as long as you get married.

422
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,820
Just get married.

423
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,920
Must I get married?

424
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:08,480
You must.

425
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:11,350
Is there a way without getting married?

426
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:14,400
If you don't get married...

427
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,300
My child,

428
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:18,670
I can tell you're the best of the best.

429
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:20,250
Whatever you want,

430
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:22,140
your family will give it to you.

431
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:23,230
Family?

432
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,050
Then you're wrong.

433
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:27,910
My brother

434
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:30,410
has always been doted on by my mother,

435
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:32,190
but he never helps me.

436
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:33,790
There must be some misunderstanding

437
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:35,450
between you and your brother.

438
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:36,810
You're siblings.

439
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:38,870
Just resolve the misunderstanding.

440
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:39,540
Really?

441
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:41,430
Why do I think

442
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:43,290
he never cares about me?

443
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:46,020
Maybe there's some misunderstanding.

444
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:46,620
Besides,

445
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,320
blood is thicker than water.

446
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:53,300
Blood is thicker than water.

447
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:54,460
The deity will help

448
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,480
resolve any misunderstanding you have.

449
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,610
You're not Persian.

450
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:59,110
You are a liar.

451
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:02,550
Who said I'm a liar?

452
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:04,200
Who told you that a Persian psychic

453
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,530
must be Persian?

454
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:07,670
The streets are sealed off.

455
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:08,550
Seal the streetâ€”

456
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:10,010
She's not Persian either.

457
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,260
Then who is she?

458
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:12,870
Sis,

459
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:14,390
you're doing well.

460
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:16,480
Go on.

461
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:17,900
I have to go home to take care of my child.

462
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:20,040
What do you mean they sealed off the streets?

463
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,630
Your wish will come true.

464
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:23,400
Why are the streets sealed?

465
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:25,740
Seal the streets?

466
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,550
It's almost the day of my shapeshifting.

467
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:28,950
If I shapeshift tonight,

468
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:31,180
they'll think I'm a monster and kill me.

469
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:31,830
No, no.

470
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,810
I'm leaving too.

471
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:34,890
Well...

472
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:35,850
You can have it back.

473
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:37,450
Get along with your brother.

474
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:52,150
You all bully us.

475
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:52,990
Excuse me.

476
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:55,150
Excuse me.

477
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:57,190
Excuseâ€”

478
00:21:57,370 --> 00:21:58,710
The Inspection Office is investigating a case.

479
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:00,060
No one is allowed to enter or exit the Ghost Market.

480
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,940
Wait on the street for the inspection.

481
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:02,580
Sir,

482
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,070
I have something urgent.

483
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:04,870
My house caught on fire.

484
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:06,270
I need to put out the fire.

485
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:06,910
Can you

486
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:07,660
see if you can

487
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,670
make an exception for me?

488
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:09,190
Move.

489
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:14,540
Don't be so mean.

490
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,260
I know your boss.

491
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:19,270
Stay where you are.

492
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:22,080
Otherwise, you'll be punished as an accomplice.

493
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,330
What happened?

494
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:29,180
The Inspection Office is working.

495
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,070
Open your eyes

496
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:31,130
and look at who I am.

497
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:31,800
Duchess.

498
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:33,170
Where is Jiang Xinbai?

499
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:33,780
Duchess?

500
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:36,710
Mr. Jiang is working on a case in the back street.

501
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:41,010
She called him by his name.

502
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:43,460
It seems that they are quite close.

503
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:46,460
Let us out!

504
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,510
Let us out!

505
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:48,110
Shut up!

506
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:49,030
Everyone, shut up

507
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:50,630
and wait for the inspection.

508
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:51,630
Shut up!

509
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:52,670
I want to get out!

510
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:53,310
Shut up!

511
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:54,440
Back off!

512
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:55,430
Stop pushing!

513
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:58,830
What right do you have to seal our shops?

514
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:00,270
Do you know where this is?

515
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:03,060
The Inspection Office is investigating a case.

516
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:05,120
All shops in Fanhou Street

517
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:06,860
must be closed for investigation.

518
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:07,990
If you don't cooperate,

519
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:09,650
don't blame us for being rude.

520
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:11,550
I don't care where you are from.

521
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,430
Fanhou Street's problems

522
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,470
have always been solved by ourselves.

523
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:16,590
Who do you think you are?

524
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:17,070
Go!

525
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:20,020
How dare you!

526
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,320
I am Cao Wenquan.

527
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,270
Because the men of Fanhou Street

528
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:34,270
support me,

529
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:38,090
they recommended me to be the speaker of the Ghost Market.

530
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,550
Tell your person in charge

531
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:40,300
to come out.

532
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:42,110
The speaker, right?

533
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:45,280
Let's see what you're capable of.

534
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:47,630
Wait.

535
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:55,540
I'm the director of the Inspection Office,

536
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:56,470
Jiang Xinbai.

537
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:58,310
Mr. Jiang,

538
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,830
you haven't come to Fanhou Street before.

539
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,280
Besides the Ghost Market,

540
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:05,110
Fanhou Street has another name.

541
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:07,550
It's called the Self-Managed Street,

542
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:09,990
because no matter what

543
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,230
happens here...

544
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:13,190
We don't need officials.

545
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:17,970
You want to discuss the rules?

546
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:22,830
The rule of the Inspection Office

547
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,840
is to prioritize case-solving.

548
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:27,240
We're dealing with an important case today.

549
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,500
It concerns the safety

550
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,830
and welfare of everyone in Fanhou Street.

551
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:32,790
If anyone

552
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,420
refuses to cooperate...

553
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:40,590
Yes,

554
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:43,130
you have power and authority.

555
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,670
Us civilians don't dare to

556
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:45,780
offend you,

557
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:47,280
unless you have

558
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:51,200
a notice from the Court of State Ceremonials.

559
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:57,580
Mr. Cao,

560
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,250
I'm afraid you don't know.

561
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:01,640
The Inspection Office

562
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,480
-works directly under His Majesty.
-Excuse me.

563
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,430
If I arrest you,

564
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:06,890
it's because you disobeyed my order.

565
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:09,150
It's your fault if you get hurt or killed.

566
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:10,220
But...

567
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:12,990
if someone obstructs the investigation

568
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:14,190
and injures a constable,

569
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:15,920
it'll be the crime of assaulting an official,

570
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,810
or even

571
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:18,830
viewed as treason.

572
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,960
At the very least, you'll be caned to death.

573
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,870
At worst,

574
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:24,650
nine generations will be exterminated.

575
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:28,760
Mr. Jiang, what great authority you have!

576
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:49,520
In the Ghost Market,

577
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:50,990
there are many fighters.

578
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,320
If a fight really breaks out,

579
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:55,190
neither side will win easily.

580
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:57,050
How about this?

581
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:59,690
The Jinwu Guards will be the middleman.

582
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,640
Please each take a step back.

583
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:03,910
What or who are you

584
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:05,030
looking for?

585
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,280
Let me help you.

586
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:08,830
Commander Shang,

587
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:10,700
are you afraid

588
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,190
that I'll find something today

589
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:13,430
that is bad for you?

590
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:18,150
Jinwu Guards, attention!

591
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:18,790
Yes.

592
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,610
The duty of the Jinwu Guards

593
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,950
is to protect the people of the capital,

594
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:25,620
whether they're native or foreign.

595
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:26,490
If anyone

596
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:27,850
hurts the people,

597
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:29,390
we will hurt them,

598
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,230
understand?

599
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:31,260
Yes.

600
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,180
Wait.

601
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:46,160
Suoluo.

602
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,180
You're still here?

603
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:50,920
Brother,

604
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:52,310
Mr. Shang,

605
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:53,740
can I say something?

606
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:58,110
The Inspection Office and Jinwu Guards

607
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:59,350
both work for the court.

608
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:00,480
You are not enemies.

609
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:03,050
Why donâ€™t both sides take a step back?

610
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:12,220
Sheâ€™s Jiang Xinbaiâ€™s sister?

611
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:14,000
I shouldnâ€™t have

612
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,330
defended that bastard.

613
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,990
You do need the Court of State Ceremonials' notice

614
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:19,520
to search the Ghost Market.

615
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:20,810
Why don't you send someone

616
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:21,940
to go get the notice?

617
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:23,550
Since the Inspection Office needs to search

618
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:24,960
for the case's investigation,

619
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,340
the Jinwu Guards should cooperate

620
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,340
to maintain order

621
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:29,450
and avoid disturbing the civilians.

622
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:30,190
But the Ghost Market

623
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:30,870
will be closed

624
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:31,710
in two hours.

625
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:33,770
If the Inspection Office

626
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,870
can find the spoils

627
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:35,890
within two hours,

628
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,400
it's naturally an accomplishment.

629
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,130
But if you can't find anything,

630
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:40,380
the Inspection Office

631
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:42,480
must give the Ghost Market an explanation.

632
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,280
Otherwise,

633
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:45,120
even if Commander Shang doesnâ€™t report you,

634
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,630
the Court of State Ceremonials will still report you

635
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:47,490
to His Majesty.

636
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:50,580
Xinbai, are you sure you want to search?

637
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:57,350
I have no objections.

638
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:08,050
Ask the registrar of the Court of State Ceremonials to come.

639
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:09,590
We don't have much time. Search the place.

640
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:10,190
Yes.

641
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:15,630
How can I do business?

642
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,630
Search carefully.

643
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:31,550
Yes.

644
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:33,470
Move! Move!

645
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:34,550
Move! Move!

646
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:36,750
Get up!

647
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:39,190
Move! Move!

648
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:40,070
Step aside.

649
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:41,580
Move.

650
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,390
This way.

651
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:47,940
What's in your pocket?

652
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,290
These are just clothes.

653
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:50,840
How about this?

654
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:56,940
Alright.

655
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,090
Thank you, Officer.

656
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,060
Commander Shang,

657
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,550
are you going to let

658
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:09,670
Jiang have his way?

659
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:11,470
Don't forget

660
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,210
we are on the same side.

661
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:14,870
Do you want to die?

662
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:16,850
Who's on your side?

663
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:18,930
You're not qualified.

664
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:21,080
Say what you should.

665
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:22,770
Don't talk nonsense.

666
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:23,890
My lord.

667
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:25,590
My lord,

668
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:27,410
there's a small issue.

669
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:28,550
Men can be searched,

670
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:29,420
but how

671
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,350
should we search the women?

672
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:40,150
You may leave.

673
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:40,910
Yes.

674
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:50,720
Suoluo,

675
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:53,530
I want to ask you

676
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:54,680
to do me a favor.

677
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:57,290
Xinbai,

678
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:59,240
you actually need my help for once?

679
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,780
The constables are all men.

680
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:05,670
They can't search the women.

681
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:06,510
Help me.

682
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:09,610
What are you looking for?

683
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:22,470
I need to find

684
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:24,030
the other half of this token as soon as possible.

685
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:24,630
Other than

686
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,320
the Inspection Office,

687
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:27,990
only you know about this.

688
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:29,870
Xinbai,

689
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:31,130
are you begging me?

690
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:34,070
Suoluo,

691
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:36,000
now is not the time to be willful.

692
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:36,800
Mr. Jiang,

693
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:38,530
is this how you ask for help?

694
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:44,190
Fine.

695
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:46,290
I beg you.

696
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:51,010
What's in it for me to help you?

697
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:53,080
What do you want?

698
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:56,450
I haven't decided yet,

699
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:59,120
but I want you to promise me

700
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:01,350
to do something for me in the future.

701
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:02,790
Can you promise that?

702
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:05,630
As long as it doesn't violate my principles,

703
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:06,430
I promise you.

704
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,760
I love to see you

705
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:12,580
lower yourself and ask for help.

706
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:17,900
It's easier on the eyes.

707
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:31,900
Next.

708
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:51,880
You're a doctor.

709
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:55,710
So she's also a female doctor.

710
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,000
No wonder the smell of medicine is so familiar.

711
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:00,260
â™«I'll fetch you the moon in my heartâ™«

712
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:02,540
â™«I dream of the courtyardâ™«

713
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:02,700
Turn around.

714
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:05,720
â™«It knows my heartâ™«

715
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:08,650
â™«I want to return triumphantly with youâ™«

716
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:10,750
â™«We can listen to the rainâ™«

717
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:14,730
â™«And watch the snowfall in the west hillsâ™«

718
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:17,180
â™«We meet with our heartsâ™«

719
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:17,470
Next.

720
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:19,640
â™«Let's not miss each otherâ™«

721
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:23,910
â™«I'll grow old for youâ™«

722
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,150
â™«I want this flower to bloom and never wiltâ™«

723
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:28,740
â™«And that's all I need for the rest of my lifeâ™«

724
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:32,790
â™«Promise me you'll fall in love with meâ™«

725
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,110
â™«And never break your promiseâ™«

726
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:40,660
My lord,

727
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:42,110
we've searched everyone outside

728
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:43,170
but found nothing.

729
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:46,200
Only these people haven't been searched.

730
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:50,990
Excuse me.

731
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:52,370
Excuse me.

732
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,710
Excuse me.

733
00:32:58,710 --> 00:32:59,270
What?

734
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:02,030
You want to search me too?

735
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:04,950
Why can't you be searched?

736
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:07,550
Move.

737
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:10,500
Don't get in the lord's way.

738
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:12,950
Fine, search me.

739
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:14,310
Search.

740
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:15,190
Yes.

741
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:33,030
My lord,

742
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:34,320
there's only a wallet.

743
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:35,900
Keep searching.

744
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:48,580
Leave.

745
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:49,310
Yes.

746
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:58,860
Mr. Jiang,

747
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:00,390
you've

748
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:01,970
searched everywhere.

749
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,650
It's already three in the morning.

750
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:05,580
The Ghost Market

751
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:07,030
should be closed.

752
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:08,790
You and your men

753
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,360
have had a long day.

754
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:12,990
Why don't you go back and rest early?

755
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:16,390
Go back.

756
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:19,850
This is bad.

757
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:22,560
Whatever I'm afraid of comes true.

758
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,210
Mr. Jiang, if you don't mind,

759
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,960
the Jinwu Guards will send you off.

760
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,670
The inventory holder will definitely

761
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:31,870
keep the token on him.

762
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:34,389
It's impossible that we can't find it.

763
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:38,940
This strange smell...

764
00:34:42,989 --> 00:34:43,590
Wait.

765
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:16,930
Commander Shang.

766
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:18,650
what the Inspection Office

767
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:19,980
is investigating today

768
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:22,150
is the Zornia transported from Heman.

769
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:23,030
This

770
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,590
is the token

771
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:26,050
for their exchange today.

772
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:27,810
Right,

773
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:30,540
Mr. Cao?

774
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:36,560
Turns out it's the batch of Zornia from Heman.

775
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,000
I feel so sick.

776
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:43,020
But Mr. Jiang,

777
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,660
what evidence do you have

778
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:46,270
that this token

779
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:47,630
is mine?

780
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:48,460
Yes.

781
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,540
That's right.

782
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:50,610
You're framing him.

783
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:51,410
That's right.

784
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,520
Itâ€™s him.

785
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,840
Jiang Xinbai, you better be smart.

786
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:06,310
There is a kind of bird

787
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:08,240
called the bunting.

788
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:12,220
This kind of bird's feces has an abnormal smell.

789
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:13,900
After being baked at a high temperature,

790
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,230
a special smell

791
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,360
is produced.

792
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:21,940
I'm sure Mr. Cao

793
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,510
usually cleans the feces

794
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:25,790
of your beloved birds.

795
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:27,110
Your hands

796
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:30,670
will inevitably have the smell of the feces

797
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:31,590
and thus

798
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:34,370
get the smell onto the token.

799
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:49,260
A hand that touches something dirty

800
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:50,590
can't become clean

801
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:52,520
no matter how one washes it.

802
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:54,310
Take him down!

803
00:36:57,730 --> 00:36:58,640
Jiang Xinbai,

804
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,070
you framed me!

805
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:03,800
The Zornia

806
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:05,830
must still be in the Ghost Market.

807
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:06,760
Keep searching.

808
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:07,550
Yes.

809
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:08,510
Wait.

810
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:14,340
Mr. Shang.

811
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:16,540
I know what to do.

812
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:21,350
Arresting people is the Jinwu Guards' duty.

813
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:22,350
I'll take him away

814
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:24,180
and interrogate him.

815
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:35,680
Commander Shang,

816
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:38,600
are you trying to snatch people again?

817
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:39,710
Mr. Jiang,

818
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:42,450
are you trying to get into a fight again?

819
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:57,600
They can fight anytime.

820
00:37:57,950 --> 00:37:59,400
Why now?

821
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:00,570
Jiang Xinbai,

822
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:01,970
donâ€™t show mercy.

823
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,600
Hurry up and fight.

824
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,140
Commander Shang,

825
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:03,510
I must

826
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:05,250
take him away today.

827
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:08,470
Fine.

828
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:13,100
I'll do you a favor today.

829
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:15,620
Remember to pay me back.

830
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:20,270
The criminal has been arrested,

831
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:22,770
but to prevent the accomplices from informing each other,

832
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:25,370
the Ghost Market will be sealed off for longer.

833
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:26,430
No one

834
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:27,880
is allowed to leave.

835
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:28,510
Yes.

836
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,120
Director!

837
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:39,670
Director,

838
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,790
I have something to report.

839
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:45,640
Yan Nanxing?

840
00:39:54,330 --> 00:39:56,130
When did you come to the capital?

841
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:57,030
Actually,

842
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:58,260
I have to

843
00:39:58,820 --> 00:39:59,950
leave immediately.

844
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:03,310
No.

845
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:04,840
Right now,

846
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:06,640
you can't leave.

847
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:08,060
Please.

848
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:12,310
What's wrong?

849
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:26,320
Go.

850
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:27,630
Follow me.

851
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:45,930
Go after him!

852
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:47,380
Come up.

853
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:54,710
Come in.

854
00:40:58,510 --> 00:40:59,240
Tell them

855
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:01,110
they're not allowed in.

856
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:03,190
Say it.

857
00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:06,650
You all stay outside.

858
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:08,070
Don't come in.

859
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:08,740
-Yes.
-Yes.

860
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:17,320
Don't worry.

861
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:18,200
He won't die.

862
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:20,880
Didn't you see

863
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:22,360
his fight with me earlier?

864
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,040
That girl is no match for him.

865
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:26,280
Mr. Jiang

866
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:28,180
was kidnapped on purpose.
