I'm Yan Nanxing.

00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,440
Greetings, Your Highness.

7
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:15,570
It was you

8
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,710
who took the duke hostage?

9
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:19,079
Who are you?

10
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,350
Who do you work for?

11
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,760
How long has it been?

12
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:25,280
Now you're settling the score with me.

13
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:26,710
Your Highness,

14
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,790
it was a misunderstanding.

15
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:31,070
If I had really taken the duke hostage,

16
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:32,400
would he have let me off?

17
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,070
I'm asking you,

18
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:36,510
not the other way around.

19
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,150
Your Highness.

20
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,880
A word in private.

21
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,390
Actually,

22
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:47,180
I'm a temporary secret scout

23
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,640
of the Inspection Office.

24
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:50,880
I'm working on the Zornia case.

25
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,900
That day, I helped the duke seize Zornia

26
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,030
at the Ghost Market.

27
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:56,079
As for taking him hostage,

28
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:57,740
it was just for show.

29
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,280
I've never heard of the Inspection Office

30
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,810
hiring a girl scout before.

31
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,930
That's why it's called a secret scout.

32
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,210
Do you think I'll buy that?

33
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,790
W-Why not?

34
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,430
If you don't believe me,

35
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,470
there's nothing I can do.

36
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:18,340
Anyway,

37
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:19,950
you can't just tell me

38
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:21,770
to close down Blossom Beauty.

39
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,220
I don't mind bringing it up

40
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,079

41

44
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:31,950
You overestimate yourself!

45
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:32,950
So what?

53

just ask me.

54
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,560
Why make such a fuss?

55
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,470
Will you be honest with me?

56
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,880
Will you tell me anything

57
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,460
without reservation?

58
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:08,960
This is about a major case

59

Forgive me

61

for holding it out on you.

62

She's part of the case too?

63
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:19,070
Oh no.

64
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:20,730

65

68

helped me a lot

69

in finding Zornia.

70
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,100

71

Yes.

72
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,780
Then why did she take you hostage?

73
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,100
That day at the Ghost Market,

74
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:51,790
Ms. Yan noticed hidden Zornia

75
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:53,920
in the secret warehouse of a shop.

76
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:56,659
But at that time,

77
00:04:56,909 --> 00:04:58,510
the suspects were all there.

78
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,270
To avoid alerting them,

79
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:00,820
she

80
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,670
pretended to take me hostage

81
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:04,440
and took me into the warehouse.

82
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:08,500
In that case,

83
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:11,990
I wronged you, Ms. Yan.

00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:49,110
and may fall off it tomorrow.

353
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:50,880
Life is unpredictable.

354
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:54,950
Mr. Pei.

355
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:55,830
Mr. Lu.

356
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,150
Mr. Jiang.

357
00:18:58,390 --> 00:18:59,110
Mr. Lu.

358
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,440
Congratulations, Mr. Jiang.

359
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:05,720
I want to invite you

360
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,950
to Jinchuan Restaurant

361
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:10,250
for a celebration tomorrow.

362
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:14,070
Mr. Lu.

363
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,150
Are you going to

364
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:18,390
exclude me?

365
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:24,070
I was just about to invite you.

366
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,670
Tomorrow, at Jinchuan Restaurant,

367
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:27,870
I'll wait for you two there.

368
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,230
No need.

369
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:34,520
I was just kidding.

370
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:35,950
Don't take it seriously.

371
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:37,090
Enjoy yourselves.

372
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:38,470
See you.

373
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:48,030
Mr. Jiang…

374
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:51,470
Mr. Lu,

375
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:55,150
I don't like the food at Jinchuan Restaurant.

376
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:56,590
How about

377
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:59,150
we meet

378
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:00,670
at Longxin Teahouse?

379
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:09,670
As you wish.

380
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:26,870
Mr. Jiang.

381
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:31,110
My lord,

382
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:32,870
Mr. Yao is not around.

383
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:33,770
It's not safe for you

384
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:35,550
to go to Longxin Teahouse alone.

385
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:37,550
How about bringing guards with you?

386
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:39,410
It's just a dinner.

387
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:41,510
Don't make a fuss.

388
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:44,030
Will you alert the targets

389
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:45,390
if you show up there?

390
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:48,070
I want to alert them

391
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:49,430
and make them scared.

392
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:56,400
Mr. Shang.

393
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:58,390
The man I sent to Heman

394
00:20:58,430 --> 00:20:59,510
sent a letter back.

395
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,470
You won't believe that

396
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:03,590
Jiang Xinbai

397
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,800
actually got married in Heman.

398
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:08,510
Married?

399
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:14,290
Jiang Xinbai is so obnoxious.

400
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:16,250
He actually found a girl to marry.

401
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:17,790
The witnesses

402
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:20,250
were General Nan and his wife.

403
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,100
Nan and Gaya witnessed his wedding?

404
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:28,630
Who was the bride?

405
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:31,750
I guess it was Yan Nanxing.

406
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:35,110
Any evidence?

407
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:36,590
Not yet.

408
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,830
But I've sent my subordinate

409
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:39,550
to Heman

410
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,500
to draw the portrait of the bride.

411
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:43,650
After the portrait arrives,

412
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:45,770
my guess will be confirmed.

413
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:49,150
However,

414
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:51,990
I can look for an opportunity

415
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,950
to test his bride.

416
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:55,950
Great.

417
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:58,550
The newlyweds

418
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:00,590
have worked together to fool me.

419
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:02,650
Shang,

420
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:04,870
have you crossed paths

421
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:06,150
with Yan Nanxing too?

422
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,160
Suoluo.

423
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:15,750
This is a serious matter.

424
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:18,710
No matter who in the Jiang family

425
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:20,070
wants to get married,

426
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,510
they must inform His Majesty

427
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:24,350
and get his approval.

428
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:30,630
Jiang Xinbai is overbearing.

429
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:32,070
He never cares

430
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:33,070
about our family.

431
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:35,950
Mr. Shang.

432
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:38,350
Will you…

433
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:39,230
No.

434
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:41,400
I wish

435
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,280
I could skin Jiang Xinbai alive,

436
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:45,190
but if reporting him

437
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,390
will hurt your family

438
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:49,570
and our friendship,

439
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:52,590
I'll keep silent.

440
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:54,730
I won't report him.

441
00:22:58,790 --> 00:22:59,390
Thank you.

442
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:01,950
Suoluo.

443
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:03,710
There is only one thing

444
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:05,150
you need to think about now.

445
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:06,550
If this matter is true,

446
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:09,570
you'll have something on him.

447
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:12,500
How will you use it against him?

448
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:16,160
He wants me to leave his girl alone.

449
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:18,410
No way.

450
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,530
I want him under my thumb

451
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,890
and never to disobey me.

452
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,880
I want him to renounce the succession

453
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,140
of his own accord

454
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:28,390
and be at my mercy

455
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:29,720
for the rest of his life.

456
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:38,960
Mr. Jiang, this way.

457
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:43,980
Jiang Xinbai?

458
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,590
He never deigns

459
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:52,790
to socialize.

460
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:54,440
Suoluo, go back.

461
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:55,990
Leave it to me.

462
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,460
I want to see

463
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:00,790
what tricks Jiang Xinbai has

464
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:02,430
up his sleeve.

465
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:13,110
Top-notch Moon River.

466
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,460
Please, enjoy.

467
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:23,850
[Li Jun, Vice Director of Personnel]

468
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:31,550
Moon River?

469
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,510
It does taste great to me.

470
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:39,260
But I wonder how it tasted

471
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:41,910
to the dead.

472
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:58,190
Mr. Jiang, what do you mean?

473
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:02,010
Yesterday,

474
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:04,110
a body was found

475
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:05,550
in a well.

476
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,740
The dead guy was Cao Wenquan,

477
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:10,470
a Zornia dealer who I'd been looking for for days.

478
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:17,030
This is the evidence

479
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:18,290
we found in his throat.

480
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:19,350
Li Wufang.

481
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:21,670
Take a look for me.

482
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:24,710
Is this Moon River?

483
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:47,750
Mr. Jiang.

484
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:49,310
Many people

485
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:50,790
come here every day.

486
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,470
I can't remember

487
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:54,250
everyone who ordered tea.

488
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:55,670
Besides,

489
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:56,910
that man died

490
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:58,830
after leaving Longxin Teahouse.

491
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:00,430
His death

492
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:03,030
had nothing to do with us.

493
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:10,150
We don't know that

494
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,910
until an investigation is done.

495
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:26,670
Seems that Mr. Jiang

496
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:29,790
is not here to celebrate.

497
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:32,430
I planned

498
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,620
to use this dinner

499
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,500
to clear our misunderstanding

500
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,630
that has lasted for more than 20 years.

501
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:43,150
I'm deeply sorry

502
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:46,470
for what happened to Chief Constable Xi back then.

503
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:49,030
But under the order of His Majesty,

504
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:51,530
I had to put him on trial.

505
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:06,470
My lord.

506
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:08,310
Counting is done.

507
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:09,970
We've seized a total of

508
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:11,480
425 boxes of Zornia

509
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:13,020
and 31 suspects.

510
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:15,070
They've all been imprisoned,

511
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:16,970
awaiting your instructions.

512
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,350
The witness is already outside the capital.

513
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:22,920
I'll bring the witness to His Majesty tomorrow

514
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,150
and let him point out the culprit before everyone.

515
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:26,870
This time, we can definitely get rid of Zornia,

516
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:28,270
a scourge of our society,

517
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:29,950
to reassure our people.

518
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:30,990
Yes, my lord.

519
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:34,030
Qingyun,

520
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:36,000
after solving this case,

521
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,950
the Inspection Office

522
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:38,350
will have done a great service to Daqi.

523
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:40,430
We'll be remembered for generations to come.

524
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:41,690
You're right, my lord.

525
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:43,240
If I can follow you

526
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:44,530
to complete this task,

527
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:46,510
I'll have no regrets in my life.

528
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:48,230
Report!

529
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:49,540
Report!

530
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:51,150
My lord,

531
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:52,710
Zhu Village was attacked last night.

532
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:54,030
The witness and his family all died.

533
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:55,590
The whole house was burned down.

534
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:56,790
Where's the suspect?

535
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,220
We only found the victims' burnt bodies.

536
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,070
All traces of the crime were erased.

537
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:02,270
We have no clue at all.

538
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:04,870
Xi Zhaoming.

539
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:07,350
Your operation failed

540
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:08,890
and resulted in a tragedy.

541
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,030
Do you admit your dereliction of duty?

542
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:12,790
I failed in my duty.

543
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:15,710
I have nothing to say.

544
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:19,590
I, Xi Zhaoming,

545
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:22,950
should pay with my life.

546
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:27,910
Okay.

547
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:30,830
Xi Zhaoming neglected his duties,

548
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:33,350
caused innocent people to die,

549
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:35,670
and damaged the reputation of the court.

550
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:37,750
After our investigation,

551
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:40,470
his dereliction of duty is confirmed.

552
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:44,110
He's dismissed from his position as the chief constable

553
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:45,510
of the Inspection Office

554
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:47,030
and sentenced to death.

555
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:47,820
Wait!

556
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:54,750
Mr. Pei.

557
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,440
Mr. Pei.

558
00:28:57,310 --> 00:29:00,400
Your Excellencies, you're conducting a trial.

559
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:03,230
The Censorate is not supposed to interfere.

560
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:03,790
However,

561
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,520
there's something

562
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:07,590
I have to say.

563
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:09,360
Go ahead.

564
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:11,000
I'm here

565
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:13,470
to plead for Chief Constable Xi.

566
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:14,990
I have three reasons.

567
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:15,960
First,

568
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,560
Chief Constable Xi did a great job in past cases,

569
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:21,390
and his investigation into Zornia

570
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:23,590
aligned with His Majesty's directives.

571
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:24,270
Second,

572
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:26,830
Zhu Village was slaughtered.

573
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:28,760
The one who should be executed

574
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,900
is the murderer.

575
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:32,880
Finding the culprit

576
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:34,440
is our priority now.

577
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:37,620
Killing the chief constable who made a mistake

578
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:40,300
can shut up the officials at court,

579
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:42,870
but killing a loyal official who doesn't deserve to die…

580
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:43,730
Think about it.

581
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:45,810
Will His Majesty

582
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,950
have regrets afterward?

583
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:49,830
Third,

584
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:52,410
Chief Constable Xi

585
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:55,360
is Prince Weiding's son-in-law.

586
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:58,350
Prince Weiding is not a member of the royal family,

587
00:29:58,350 --> 00:29:59,640
but in terms of military exploits,

588
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,310
no one can compete with him.

589
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:05,170
Besides, he's given the privilege of staying in the capital.

590
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:06,620
Shouldn't you

591
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:09,650
take him into consideration?

592
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:14,990
Since Xi Zhaoming

593
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:16,940
seized a large quantity of Zornia,

594
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:20,280
he'll receive a lighter sentence than the death penalty.

595
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,250
After careful consideration,

596
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:24,990
we decide to relieve him from his position

597
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:26,500
and banish him to Yazhou.

598
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,920
He must never return to the capital.

599
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:34,670
Don't be sorry, Mr. Lu.

600
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,090
I'll delve into the case

601
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:39,630
my father couldn't solve.

602
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:45,040
It seems that

603
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,370
it's too soon to celebrate today.

604
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:50,430
We can wait until Zornia

605
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:52,350
is completely gotten rid of.

606
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:54,110
See you.

607
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:58,590
Mr. Jiang.

608
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:01,670
Mr. Jiang, you haven't eaten anything.

609
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:04,680
Father-in-law,

610
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,690
what did Jiang Xinbai mean?

611
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:08,870
Father.

612
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,990
Can't you take a hint?

613
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:13,870
Jiang Xinbai was warning us.

614
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:16,310
I was so scared just now.

615
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:17,960
Behave yourself.

616
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:20,750
Stop trading for now.

617
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:22,870
Then we'd take losses.

618
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:24,160
Short-sighted.

619
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:26,610
Just listen to your grandfather.

620
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:29,710
I outsmarted his father

621
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:30,790
back then.

622
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,310
It'll end the same way for him.

623
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:42,470
Mr. Jiang.

624
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:45,920
What a surprise to see you here.

625
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,530
Let's sit down and talk.

626
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:28,950
Mr. Shang.

627
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:32,150
You're doing business

628
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:34,160
with Longxin Teahouse too?

629
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:37,640
Aren't you here

630
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:39,710
exactly because

631
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:40,870
my business is here?

632
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:43,950
I'm curious.

633
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:45,950
Where do you get

634
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:47,990
Moon River?

635
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,350
Why do you only supply it to Longxin Teahouse?

636
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:56,310
Great! Great!

637
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,310
What did you say?

638
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:04,270
I didn't hear you.

639
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:09,940
I'm asking you why you only sell

640
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:11,470
Moon River to Longxin Teahouse

641
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:12,790
and where you get it.

642
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:16,580
No rush.

643
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:19,570
A question for a question.

644
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:21,080
I go first.

645
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,080
Where is Nan?

646
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:24,580
What has the guy

647
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:26,080
you sent out found?

648
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:29,620
He hasn't sent word back yet.

649
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,430
But my guess

650
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:33,200
is almost the same as yours.

651
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:35,980
Your brother didn't flee to avoid punishment.

652
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:37,620
I sent someone to look for him

653
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:38,870
to protect him.

654
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:43,000
You went to Heman not long ago.

655
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:45,530
What on earth happened there?

656
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:46,790
I've answered

657
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:47,800
your question.

658
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,900
It's your turn to answer mine.

659
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,480
Moon River

660
00:33:58,310 --> 00:34:01,020
is produced in Mount Kunlun near the border.

661
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:03,390
It has a low yield.

662
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:06,270
I promised Gaya

663
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,909
to find a sustainable source of livelihood

664
00:34:09,909 --> 00:34:11,659
for her tribe.

665
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,989
As for why I only sell it

666
00:34:14,989 --> 00:34:16,190
to Longxin Teahouse,

667
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:19,120
it's because I can raise the price.

668
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,590
There's value in rarity.

669
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:32,230
Wait.

670
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:41,260
You haven't answered

671
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:42,699
my second question.

672
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:48,360
The Zornia dealers in Heman

673
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:51,110
framed and coerced your brother.

674
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:52,429
Gaya

675
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:54,630
died to protect him.

676
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:01,110
Now you know.

677
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:24,510
It smells so good.

678
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,050
-Your Highness.
-So comfortable.

679
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:35,180
Yan Nanxing is here.

680
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:36,670
Greetings, Your Highness.

681
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:37,200
Nanxing,

682
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,030
did you bring me beauty creams?

683
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:40,260
I brought you many new products.

684
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:40,940
Let me apply one for you.

685
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:41,740
Okay. Come on.

686
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:42,830
No.

687
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:44,410
Your Highness.

688
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:45,760
Let me check them first.

689
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:46,870
No need.

690
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:49,120
I do know a thing or two

691
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:50,870
about beauty products.

692
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:53,810
Ms. Yan's creams

693
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:55,070
are made of herbs.

694
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:57,350
They're gentle and nourishing.

695
00:35:57,350 --> 00:35:59,230
Even if the cream is slightly toxic,

696
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:00,710
it would require high doses

697
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:02,070
to be lethal.

698
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:05,150
I don't think I'd ever use that much.

699
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:07,670
You're brilliant, Your Highness.

700
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:09,080
The people's admiration for you

701
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:11,030
is like a river,

702
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:12,150
endless and unceasing.

703
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:13,280
Stop

704
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:14,510
flattering me.

705
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,030
Apply it for me now.

706
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:18,170
The rest of you,

707
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:20,230
leave.

708
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:24,660
Nanxing, hurry.

709
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,880
Miss Bai, you heard Her Highness…

710
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:36,430
I…

711
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:41,780
Should I leave too?

712
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:44,750
Suoluo.

713
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:45,310
You can stay.

714
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:46,110
Come here.

715
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:52,880
So comfortable.

716
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,650
Ms. Yan.

717
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:55,440
Nice to meet you.

718
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:07,910
Mother.

719
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:10,900
I heard that Blossom Beauty's cream

720
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,740
only works best

721
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,960
when combined

722
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,990
with Ms. Yan's special massage.

723
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:17,230
Since I'm here today,

724
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:18,150
Ms. Yan,

725
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:19,870
can you let me try it too?

726
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:22,110
Sure.

727
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:24,180
Look.

728
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:27,320
My skin is brighter than usual, isn't it?

729
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:29,350
Suoluo.

730
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:31,140
The hostage thing

731
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:33,180
at the Ghost Market

732
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:34,730
was a misunderstanding.

733
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:36,670
Now, Ms. Yan

734
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:38,280
is your mother's friend.

735
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:41,140
You should be nice to each other in the future.

736
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:45,940
Sure enough, you snitched on me.

737
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:48,850
Yesterday, you said

738
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:51,440
Xinbai secretly got married in Heman.

739
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:53,710
How is the investigation going?

740
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:56,920
How come she knows everything?

741
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:58,150
What did Jiang Xinbai do

742
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,680
to make her hate him so much?

743
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:01,710
But her beef is with him.

744
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:03,390
Can't she leave me alone?

745
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:04,270
Your Highness.

746
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:04,960
Look.

747
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:07,190
You and the duchess are talking about family affairs.

748
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:08,050
I should leave.

749
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,000
No need.

750
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:11,550
You're my confidante.

751
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:13,430
I don't keep secrets from you.

752
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:16,140
Go on.

753
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:20,110
That woman has come to the capital too.

754
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:22,150
But Xinbai is very protective

755
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:23,220
of her.

756
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:24,730
No one has seen her yet.

757
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:27,970
You can't even find a girl in the capital.

758
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,760
I can find her.

759
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:31,090
I just need to do it secretly

760
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:32,590
to avoid upsetting Xinbai.

761
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:33,620
You have a point.

762
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:36,550
Xinbai is always looking into other people.

763
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:38,590
If he knows we're secretly looking into him,

764
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:40,120
he'll definitely be angry.

765
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:47,400
Mother.

766
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:51,510
That woman is infatuated with Xinbai.

767
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:54,390
Mother,

768
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,990
why don't you give them your approval?

769
00:38:57,870 --> 00:38:59,750
Did I say I'd break them up?

770
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:02,250
Given Xinbai's personality,

771
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,280
I thought

772
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:04,910
he'd die alone.

773
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:07,560
Now that he's found himself a wife,

774
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:09,330
why should I turn her away?

775
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,810
I want you to look into her because I want

776
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:13,090
to know who she is.

777
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:15,650
If she's from a good family,

778
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:17,550
I'll be elated.

779
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:19,510
Since Mother

780
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:20,990
wants to help them…

781
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:23,390
Ms. Yan.

782
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:26,390
Why don't you ask around for us?

783
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:30,230
I don't have the right.

784
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:31,660
You do.

785
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,630
You're my mother's friend

786
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:34,850
and Xinbai's friend.

787
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:37,430
You're the best one for this job.

788
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:39,360
But

789
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:41,250
if you're reluctant, forget it.

790
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:42,830
Yeah.

791
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:44,470
You're so smart, Suoluo.

792
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:45,690
Nanxing.

793
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:47,950
I can only ask you to do it

794
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:49,230
without making Xinbai

795
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:50,750
mad at me.

796
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:52,720
I'll leave it to you.

797
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:53,610
Your Highness,

798
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:55,410
I'm just a businesswoman.

799
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:58,260
I'm not good at gathering information.

800
00:39:58,750 --> 00:39:59,680
That's not true.

801
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:01,590
I think you're good at it.

802
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:02,230
Yes.

803
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:04,510
Isn't it the same as running a business?

804
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:06,670
You just need to plan it carefully.

805
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:10,350
It's settled then.
