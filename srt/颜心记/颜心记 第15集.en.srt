12

14

Besides,

26
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,750
since your brother doesn't want to say it,

27
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,410
it means it isn't a good match.

28

63

has anything to do with Zornia.

65
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,470
Considering his feelings for Gaya

66
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:08,000
and his loyal personality,

67
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:09,910
how could he sell Zornia?

68

How could I have evidence?

72

Of course.

75
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,950
For example, my intuition tells me

76
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,310
that your sister picks on you

77
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:33,430
and hates you.

78
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,330
And you'll get me into trouble.

To be honest,

80
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:40,350

you got married in Heman.

82
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:43,680
She even coaxed your mother

83
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,810
to make me investigate your marriage.

84
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:47,870
How can I investigate it?

85
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:50,070

"Your Highness, I'm sorry."

87
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,330
That person was me.

00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:56,590
There's nothing between us.

You used me.

Or maybe...

94
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,380
We had a deal.

95
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,270
I was just helping you investigate the case.

96
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,070
I'll say that.

97
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:13,400
Will she believe me?

98
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,380
Anyway,

99
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:16,670

100
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,170

00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:19,720
She's the Duchess of Yuejiang.

177
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:21,350
They can just claim that

178
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:22,590
she has talents.

179
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,590
She must be here to marry into money.

180
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:28,130
She'll get married and have children in two years.

181
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:29,390
Women are all the same.

182
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:30,710
If you have a problem,

183
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,510
just step forward and say it.

184
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:34,390
The school just started today.

185
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:36,050
It's not too late to say it now.

186
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:44,160
Excellence comes from diligence, while neglect leads to failure.

187
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:49,110
Success comes from careful thought, while destruction comes from carelessness.

188
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:51,040
Today, the wise have come together

189
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,180
and all tools for governance are prepared.

190
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:52,770
[Husband of Princess of Yuejiang, Yan Qingyun]

191
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:54,940
We must eliminate evil and harm

192
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:57,470
and give power to the virtuous and capable.

193
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,750
This way, those nearby shall be pleased,

194
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,750
and those far away shall be drawn in.

195
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:05,190
This is the way of the great cause.

196
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,470
Somehow, the chancellor looks like

197
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,150
the lady in the carriage.

198
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,800
But their temperament is different.

199
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,660
Why aren't they here?

200
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:54,510
Father.

201
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:59,280
You're the only one who cares about me.

202
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:02,100
Your brother had something urgent to attend to.

203
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,960
Your mother and your grandfather

204
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,050
went to the palace.

205
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:14,910
[Lian Shan Yi]

206
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:14,510
Lian Shan Yi?

207
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:17,630
The ancient book thought to be lost?

208
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:21,070
Xinbai asked me to pass it on to you.

209
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:22,230
He heard that you had been

210
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:23,490
looking for this book.

211
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,230
He tripped me up on one hand

212
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:26,270
and gave me gifts on the other.

213
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:27,430
How hypocritical!

214
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:30,150
Suoluo.

215
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,030
It was an emergency today.

216
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,070
-Your brother...
-Father.

217
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:35,990
As you can see,

218
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:38,170
in Mother and Grandfather's eyes,

219
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:38,790
Jiang Xinbai

220
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:40,350
is always more important than me.

221
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:41,390
Why do you have to

222
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:43,070
compare yourself to your brother?

223
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:44,940
Because people like comparing things.

224
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,390
People always compare you to Chief Constable Xi.

225
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:48,520
Father, do you know?

226
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:49,790
Outsiders always say

227
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:51,950
you married your sister-in-law to cling to her status.

228
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:53,150
They even call me the second husband's daughter.

229
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,610
and say I'm a lowly person.

230
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:01,680
When Chief Constable Xi was exiled to Yazhou,

231
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:04,190
your grandfather

232
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:07,570
wanted to pick a new husband for your mother

233
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:10,190
to prove that

234
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:12,980
the Jiang family

235
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:16,870
had cut their ties with Chief Constable Xi.

236
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,070
But your mother

237
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,730
didn't want to marry anyone else.

238
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:24,780
I was the one who proposed.

239
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:27,920
Your mother and I

240
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,350
can miss the same person

241
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:32,030
without any resentment.

242
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:36,830
This is the foundation of our

243
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:40,830
relationship for so many years.

244
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:44,350
For this matter,

245
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,870
I am not ashamed.

246
00:13:58,630 --> 00:13:59,190
Father.

247
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,240
I don't care what others think.

248
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:08,080
But what about our family members?

249
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,480
What about Jiang Xinbai?

250
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:10,910
Does he really have

251
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,510
no hard feelings towards us?

252
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,310
He has been back from Yazhou for so many years.

253
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:16,430
I tried my best to please him,

254
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:18,090
but he never had me in his eyes.

255
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,590
Grandfather seems to like me more than

256
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:21,850
he likes Jiang Xinbai.

257
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,070
But in reality, he just takes me

258
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,330
as a training partner.

259
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,830
He's just using me to encourage Xinbai.

260
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:27,630
And Mother...

261
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:29,160
Every step I take,

262
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:30,840
Mother would try to stop me.

263
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:32,670
She's just afraid that

264
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:35,130
I'll steal the limelight from Jiang Xinbai.

265
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:41,370
I want to fight for what I deserve.

266
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:46,750
Suoluo.

267
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,670
You're a tad too extreme.

268
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,960
It's useless for me to say more now.

269
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,980
But time will prove that

270
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:07,910
not all care and love

271
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,890
have ulterior motives.

272
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:23,770
Who does Lu Dingzhao

273
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:24,770
think he is?

274
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:28,150
How dare he recommend you to be a major in Jiangzhou?

275
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:29,550
It's a demotion in disguise!

276
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:31,280
Did he think I wouldn't notice?

277
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:32,960
Thank goodness Her Majesty and I

278
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,560
are close,

279
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:34,990
so I heard the news in advance

280
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:36,190
and saved you from it.

281
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:40,350
You've offended someone just after receiving a reward.

282
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:41,820
You sure are something.

283
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:45,330
If I didn't want your mother to be sad,

284
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:46,700
I should have let you go.

285
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:48,720
Jiangzhou

286
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,020
is a peaceful place.

287
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:52,550
It's not as turbulent as the capital.

288
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:55,190
Today,

289
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,670
thank you, Mother and Grandfather,

290
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:58,530
for helping me.

291
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:00,390
But

292
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:02,510
today was also Suoluo's

293
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:03,770
succession ceremony.

294
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,670
Both of you were absent.

295
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:06,920
Would she...

296
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:09,340
Suoluo is understanding, unlike you.

297
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:16,950
Son.

298
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,110
It's okay.

299
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:20,350
I'll talk to Suoluo.

300
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:21,570
She will understand.

301
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:26,240
I'm leaving.

302
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:46,200
[Shang Residence]

303
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:50,230
Regardless,

304
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:51,600
congratulations.

305
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:54,790
You're one step closer to your goal.

306
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:55,950
No matter what you do,

307
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:57,110
I will support you,

308
00:16:58,110 --> 00:16:59,840
the next Princess of Yuejiang.

309
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:01,920
The next Princess of Yuejiang.

310
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:05,910
We don't even know

311
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:08,150
if the current Princess of Yuejiang

312
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:09,160
regards me as

313
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:10,720
a successor candidate yet.

314
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:16,089
Is there anyone else besides you?

315
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,790
The rumor of Jiang Xinbai's marriage

316
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:20,750
has spread in the capital.

317
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,829
As long as we know who the woman is

318
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,869
and confirm it,

319
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:28,510
he will be out.

320
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:33,670
General.

321
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:35,730
Ms. Tong Sai'er wants to see you.

322
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:37,830
Who is Tong Sai'er?

323
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,890
An employee of Blossom Beauty.

324
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:41,630
The one who fought for Yan Nanxing

325
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:43,290
at Longxin Teahouse that day.

326
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:48,190
Why does she

327
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:49,110
want to see you?

328
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:51,000
I won't know until I see her.

329
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,470
I'll excuse myself then.

330
00:17:58,850 --> 00:17:59,870
What's the meaning of this?

331
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,270
This is the custom of my hometown.

332
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:02,190
Once I drip my blood

333
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:03,030
on this,

334
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:04,640
it represents my promise to you.

335
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,410
You can ask me

336
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,630
to do 3 things for you.

337
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:08,630
No matter how dangerous, I'll do it.

338
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:11,150
Consider it as me taking responsibility for

339
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:12,080
my rash actions.

340
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:13,150
Please accept it.

341
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:18,190
Oh, right.

342
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,150
Keep it well.

343
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:29,070
I won't be responsible for it if you lose it.

344
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,400
Remember to contact me.

345
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:43,550

346
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,230

00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:50,430
Hurry up!

522
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:51,910
Run!

523
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:55,070
Keep up!

524
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:12,600
His Majesty rewarded the Inspection Office.

525
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:14,440
We have to live up to the reward.

526
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:16,920
With your current stamina,

527
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:18,630
you won't be able to handle

528
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:19,830
even the simplest

529
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:20,980
household dispute.

530
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:24,890
From now on, we'll practice for two extra hours every day.

531
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:25,430
Carry on.

532
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:31,330
My lord,

533
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,160
I've retrieved what you wanted.

534
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:44,910
Why is the Inspection Office

535
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:46,470
giving Boss

536
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:48,250
such an expensive dress?

537
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:49,720
Are you dumb?

538
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:52,070
This is not from the Inspection Office.

539
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:53,330
This is from Mr. Jiang.

540
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:57,270
Why is Jiang Xinbai

541
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:58,670
asking me to wear this

542
00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:00,000
for the public banquet?

543
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:00,870
Boss.

544
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:03,950
This is what happens when

545
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:06,310
one party is clearly interested, while the other party is not.

546
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:07,840
What are you talking about?

547
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:09,150
You want to be beaten?

548
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:10,350
And you.

549
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,040
What are you grinning at?

550
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,180
Are you slacking off here?

551
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,470
Get back to work.

552
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:17,460
I'm not paying you to stand idle.

553
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,990
Don't slack off. Off you go.

554
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,730
Why are you giving me clothes

555
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:29,530
for no reason?

556
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:32,830
Could it be...

557
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:34,870
To recognize me?

558
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,620
[Blossom Beauty]

559
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:14,490
Mrs. Bao.

560
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:17,430
Ms. Yan

561
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:18,870
is so smart and capable.

562
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,210
This public banquet

563
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:21,270
looks so well done.

564
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:22,630
Of course.

565
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:25,710
Let me ask you.

566
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:27,610
Why is the Princess's birthday banquet

567
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:28,610
being held at

568
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,770
the Blossom Beauty?

569
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:32,430
Mrs. Bao,

570
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:33,880
you have no idea.

571
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:35,470
The princess

572
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:37,190
is a close friend of our boss.

573
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:38,590
Really?

574
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:42,780
Don't brag at such a young age.

575
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:51,310
So handsome.

576
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:55,350
The duke is personally here to support the event.

577
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:57,150
Looks like you weren't kidding.

578
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:02,310
So handsome.

579
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:08,960
Yan Nanxing.

580
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:11,910
Didn't you receive

581
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:12,810
the clothes I told someone

582
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:14,470
to deliver to Blossom Beauty?

583
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:15,310
I did.

584
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:16,790
If you did,

585
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,520
why aren't you wearing it?

586
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,520
I'm here to work.

587
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:23,470
It's not convenient to dress so fancy.

588
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:23,870
No.

589
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:25,870
How are the clothes I gave to you

590
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:26,830
inconvenient?

591
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:30,640
It's just slightly more formal

592
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,150
and more special

593
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:33,930
than the one you're wearing.

594
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:36,450
You can say whatever you want.

595
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:38,090
I can wear whatever I want.

596
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:38,870
You...

597
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:43,990
If I wear something so high-profile

598
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,520
on such a special day today,

599
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:47,930
what if someone mistakes me

600
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:49,100
for the hostess?

601
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,360
If word gets to your mother,

602
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:52,730
I'll have to disappear

603
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:53,660
from this world.

604
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:54,430
My mother?

605
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,410
Yan Nanxing,

606
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:01,110
did my mother say something

607
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:01,790
to you?

608
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:06,030
Not at all.

609
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:09,930
Quit thinking about that.

610
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:12,710
Besides,

611
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:14,390
you can't recognize me anyway.

612
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:15,850
Does it matter what I wear?

613
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:17,780
I didn't buy you clothes

614
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:18,830
to recognize you.

615
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:20,430
Then why did you do it?

616
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:25,670
Well...

617
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:28,110
I just wanted to

618
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:29,430
give you a gift.

619
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:39,110
Why would you do that?

620
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:42,960
To thank me for helping you?

621
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,230
Sort of.

622
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:49,710
As a duke,

623
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,510
isn't it too petty for you

624
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:52,910
to just gift me an outfit?

625
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:56,120
That was the most expensive

626
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,650
piece the shop had in stock.

627
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:01,140
It's still just an outfit.

628
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:04,030
You could have gifted me gold.

629
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:05,640
Yan Nanxing!

630
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,850
The duchess is here.

631
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:22,130
Your Grace.

632
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:23,470
Ms. Yan.

633
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,070
Suoluo?

634
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:27,190
Xinbai.

635
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:29,870
Doesn't the Imperial Academy have classes today?

636
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:30,550
It's fine.

637
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:31,820
I thought you might not

638
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:33,310
be able to handle things alone.

639
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:34,590
So I came to help you.

640
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:37,030
Thank you.

641
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:40,370
Ms. Yan, you did a great job

642
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:42,420
setting up the public banquet.

643
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:43,150
Not at all.

644
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:45,230
It is all thanks to Her Highness that

645
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:47,230
the banquet can serve a total of 24 dishes,

646
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:49,200
including sweet, salty, sour, and spicy options.

647
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,710
The guests can take what they like

648
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:51,530
and chat among themselves

649
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:52,530
and make friends.

650
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:54,960
Would you like to try some, Your Grace?

651
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:55,670
Ms. Yan,

652
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,460
such a capable lady like you

653
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:59,220
can do things better than a man.

654
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:01,580
You're too nice, Your Grace.

655
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:02,350
Am I?

656
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:04,470
I think that you look

657
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:06,470
quite like the head of the family

658
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:07,310
standing beside

659
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:08,750
my brother like that.

660
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:10,590
Suoluo.

661
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:16,390
Don't talk nonsense.

662
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:22,030
What are they talking about?

663
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:23,910
Let's get closer.

664
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:25,550
Did you hear their conversation?

665
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:26,280
Not clearly.

666
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:29,110
I'm not good at handling guests.

667
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:31,290
Please take charge of the rest.

668
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:35,870
Are you in a rush

669
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:37,390
to meet your bride?

670
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:38,740
Bride?

671
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:41,350
He is married?

672
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:41,980
No way.

673
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,220
Have you heard?

674
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:46,660
I thought it was a rumor.

675
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:47,810
I didn't expect

676
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:49,910
Her Grace to confirm it.

677
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,240
You still don't know, do you?

678
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:54,430
The whole capital

679
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:56,790
is talking about your secret bride.

680
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,060
I think everyone

681
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,070
wants to know

682
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,200
who the beauty you're hiding

683
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:02,750
really is.

684
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:04,110
How about

685
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:06,170
making her identity public today

686
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:06,790
to take

687
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:08,520
this matter off Mother's mind?

688
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:09,770
What do you think?

689
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,680
Enough is enough.

690
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:23,340
This is an important occasion.

691
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:25,040
Your bride

692
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:26,990
should be by your side.

693
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:33,870
Ms. Yan, you're my brother's...

694
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:35,960
good friend.

695
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:37,790
I'm sure you know who

696
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:38,710
this bride is.

697
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:40,830
Can you tell me about her?

698
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:47,150
Why do I feel that

699
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:49,710
there is some sibling rivalry

700
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:51,970
between the two of you?

701
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:54,930
What nonsense are you spouting?

702
00:33:54,930 --> 00:33:56,260
Am I spouting nonsense?

703
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:57,790
Why do I feel that

704
00:33:58,510 --> 00:34:00,370
you are the one talking nonsense?

705
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,190
You're spreading rumors

706
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:03,740
before the truth could be uncovered.

707
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:05,760
Not only does this damage His Grace's reputation,

708
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,020
the common folks

709
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:08,520

How dare you!

You...

714
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:18,270
Oh no! Oh no!

Ruoqian! Ruoqian!

716
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:21,050
What's wrong?

717
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:21,590
They...

718
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:23,560
They seem to be quarreling inside.

719
00:34:24,219 --> 00:34:25,150
Why don't you...

720

Why don't you see

721
00:34:26,429 --> 00:34:27,389
if there are any cold dishes I can serve?

722
00:34:27,389 --> 00:34:28,940
Maybe it'll cool them down.

723
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:30,360
Enough, both of you.

724
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:41,370
Today is Mother's birthday.

725
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:42,989
Don't overdo it and have a

726
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:44,760
hard time answering to Mother.

727
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:46,480
I think you're the one who'd

728
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,340
have a hard time answering to her.

729

So many people are watching.

I was just kidding.

a red packet.

735

Thank you, Your Grace.

Thank you, Your Grace.

738
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:11,670

[Blossom Beauty]

740
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:16,990
Thank you, Your Grace.

Thank you.

00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:19,390
Thank you, Your Grace.

Thank you.

747

You've already received one.

748
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:26,630
You can't receive another.

749
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:27,470
I didn't.

750
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:29,510
She hasn't received one yet.

751
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:30,230
She did.

752
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:32,190
Sister, I got it.

753
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,360
Thank you, Your Grace.

They're twins!

Even ordinary folks can't tell them apart.

756
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:40,630
How could you tell?

757
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:42,650
I'm also an ordinary folk.

758
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:44,050
Why couldn't you tell?

759
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:46,110
Is it that hard?

760
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:49,150
Can you recognize your family

761
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:51,010
when you return home, Your Grace?

762
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:56,350
I mean,

763
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:58,350
you're usually so arrogant.

764
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:00,860
How do you treat your family and relatives?

765
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:04,520
What about you, Ms. Yan?

766
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:08,120
How does it feel to shapeshift?

767
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:17,670
I mean Ms. Yan is an excellent merchant

Thanks for your hard work today.

774

It's all good, Boss.

775
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:41,830
Good timing.

I have to help Sai'er serve the dishes.

777

Could you and Mr. Jiang please

778
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,870
help with preparing the dishes?

Okay. Go ahead.

I'll do it.

One for each.

Where is the kitchen?

In there.

00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,550
I think your sister

00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:15,530
is here to piss you off.

786
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:17,260
You should have a word with her.

787
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,940
I'm fine as long as you're not pissing me off.

788
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:26,380
Do you think

789
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:28,340
she knows your weakness?

790
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:30,710

792
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:43,720
Ms. Yan, you're truly capable both

793
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,120
in and out of the kitchen.

794
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:47,510
In terms of cooking,

795
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:49,480
I'm not as good as your brother.

796
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:54,950
Have you eaten my brother's cooking?

797
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:55,590
Of course.

798
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:57,630
Haven't you eaten it before?

799
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:05,110
Rather than siblings, my brother and I

800
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:07,510
are more like political rivals.

801
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:11,500
You're the one treating me like a political rival.

802
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,300
That's right.

803
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:13,590
To you,

804
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:15,310
I'm not even worthy of being your political rival.

805
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:16,150
Suoluo...

806
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:20,610
Ms. Yan,

807
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:22,230
do you have siblings?

808
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:27,380
Not only do I not have siblings,

809
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:29,190
I don't even have parents.

810
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:30,190
What?

811
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:31,590
Didn't you

812
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:32,960
investigate me before?

813
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:46,790
Ms. Yan.

814
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:52,510
I'm really sorry about just now.

815
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:52,950
I...

816
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:54,270
Wasn't informed.

817
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:55,310
It's okay.

818
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:57,350
You might not be

819
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,200
fully informed now, either.

820
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:01,630
Disregarding past matters,

821
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:03,290
do you really have no feelings

822
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:05,030
towards my brother?

823
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,240
You're overthinking.

824
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:12,110
Why not?

825
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:14,910
Marrying into the Yuejiang's Residence

and becoming a princess

827
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:17,200
is a marry-up

828
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:18,230

Marry-up?

So the best outcome

832
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,660
for ordinary people like us

833
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,800
is to marry up?

A woman's destiny

I'm a little disappointed.

00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:36,870

the first female chancellor of the dynasty

840
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:39,690
would be different from the rest.

841
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,590
In the end, you still believe in the same thing.

842
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:42,920

I'll give it to you in their place.

870
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:38,890
I just remembered.

871
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:41,210
Isn't the duchess the chancellor

872
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:42,190
of the Imperial Academy?

873
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:43,590
Ask her for one yourself.

874
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:45,430
I've never met her before.

875
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:47,470
It's not very nice for me to ask her

876
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:48,930
for a red packet like that.

877
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:50,670
You're right.

878
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:52,590
Take it.

879
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:53,840
Thank you, Boss.

880
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:54,490
I'll leave you to your work.

881
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:56,490
I'm going to take a break somewhere.

882
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:58,150
Boss!

883
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:03,450
On the back of your dress...

884
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:05,750
No way.

885
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,860
It's not time yet.

886
00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:09,760
Is it so early this time?

887
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:13,500
Boss!

888
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:14,920
Boss!

889
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:16,340
Boss, what's wrong?

890
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:17,070
Boss!

891
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:19,030
Boss.

892
00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:20,640
Boss, are you really okay?

893
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,700
I’m fine. I’m fine.

894
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:23,230
Go back to your work.

895
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:23,550
No.

896
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:24,650
I just wanted to say...

897
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:25,330
Off you go.

898
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:26,230
Hurry now.

899
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:28,090
Are you kidding me?

900
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:30,710
Don't make me shapeshift in public!

901
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:32,110
Somebody help me!

902
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:36,010
What happened to Yan Nanxing?

903
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:37,270
Boss is alone inside.

904
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:38,150
I don’t know what happened.

905
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:38,880
Yan Nanxing!

906
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:40,360
Yan Nanxing!

907
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:46,560
Yan Nanxing.

908
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:50,990
What's wrong?

909
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:52,880
Yan Nanxing?

910
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:55,770
Where are you feeling unwell?

911
00:41:56,310 --> 00:41:56,670
I...

912
00:41:56,830 --> 00:41:57,690
What happened?

913
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:01,140
I'm going to change.

914
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,070
What?

915
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:03,510
I'm shapeshifting.

916
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:07,370
Don't be afraid. I'm here.

917
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:14,310
I'll take you home.

918
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:14,870
Let's go.
