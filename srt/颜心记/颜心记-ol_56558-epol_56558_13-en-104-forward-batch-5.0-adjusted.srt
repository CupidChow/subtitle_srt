No!

16

No.

Jiang Xinbai sent you here?

38

It's really not what you think.

Why did you go to Longxin Teahouse?

41

I had never been to a teahouse before.

42
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,860
I was just there

43

50

let alone the so-called punishment.

Li Jun, Vice Director of Personnel,

61
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,130
denounced Nan Jifeng,

62
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:15,050
accusing him of taking huge bribes,

63
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:16,860
eliminating dissidents,

64
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:20,270
killing loyal officials, and running away to avoid punishment.

65

It happened sooner

00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:34,330
Commander.

178
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:35,670
Mr. Jiang is here.

179
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,760
Yan Nanxing?

180
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:56,990
Why…

181
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:59,010
Why are you dressed like this?

182
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,630
I have heavy makeup on.

183
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:01,960
How did he recognize me?

184
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:05,800
I'm asking you.

185
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:07,390
Ask him.

186
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:18,640
Let's go.

187
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:23,740
Shang Bieli, are you crazy?

188
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,630
You caused my sister-in-law's death,

189
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,960
and now you want my brother dead too?

190
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,430
What are you talking about?

191
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:33,430
Stop pretending!

192
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:35,830
My brother just went missing in Heman,

193
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:36,950
and this morning,

194
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:38,870
you sent your right-hand man there.

195
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:41,070
You want to confirm if he's dead, right?

196
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,300
You're so biased against me.

197
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,830
I have nothing to say to you.

198
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:50,870
Watch out!

199
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:59,390
Shang Bieli,

200
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,080
I don't want to fight with you today.

201
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:02,920
Shang Bieli,

202
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:04,070
if Jiang Xinbai

203
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,270
wanted to harm General Nan,

204
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:06,870
he would've done it in Heman.

205
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,470
You know my brother?

206
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:10,440
I know not only your brother

207
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,100
but also your sister-in-law.

208
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:14,870
Lady Gaya was my friend.

209
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:16,380
You have to trust us.

210
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:18,030
Mr. Shang.

211
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:21,920
Are you okay?

212
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,120
Take a close look.

213
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,430
Were these knives used to remove

214
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:27,630
your mask last night?

215
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,150
It was you?

216
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:29,950
Yes.

217
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:31,940
I just wanted to confirm

218
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:33,190
if you were my fiancé.

219
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:43,350
So to sum up,

220
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,650
when your mom was about to give birth,

221
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,280
she ran into bandits

222
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:48,860
and was saved

223
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,830
by a righteous teenager.

224
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:52,750
In order to thank him,

225
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:53,990
she promised to marry the unborn you

226
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:54,830
to him.

227
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,240
But she didn't know

228
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,390
his name.

229
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:00,070
She only knew he was from the capital

230
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:01,470
and had a scar on his face?

231
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:05,280
My mom passed away three months ago.

232
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,030
Before she died,

233
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,690
she told me about this matter.

234
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,380
She drew me

235
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:09,990
my fiancé's portrait

236
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:11,430
from memory

237
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,690
and asked me to fulfill that promise.

238
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,240
You have the portrait,

239
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,350
but the person your mother drew

240
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,430
from memory

241
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,430
was what that boy looked like

242
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:23,510
in his teens.

243
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:25,310
Why were you sure

244
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:27,270
that boy was Shang Bieli?

245
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,630
I wasn't sure of it.

246
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:32,720
But I can see that Mr. Shang

247
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,520
is about ten years older than me.

248
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:36,790
He always wears a mask.

249
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,670
I simply wanted to see

250
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:39,130
if he had a scar on his face.

251
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,150
I really didn't mean

252
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,410
to cause such trouble.

253
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:43,560
I'm very sorry.

254
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,050
Mr. Shang, I just need to know

255
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:47,080
if you are my fiancé.

256
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:48,430
Can you show me your face?

257
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:49,310
-Enough!
-I…

258
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,400
You're making my head hurt.

259
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:56,020
I'm not your fiancé.

260
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:58,710
Wait. Let me explain.

261
00:11:58,910 --> 00:11:59,910
I just want to fulfill

262
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:00,970
my mom's last wish.

263
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:01,510
If…

264
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:02,230
If…

265
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:02,950
If you

266
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:03,860
really don't want me,

267
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:04,830
write me a repudiation letter.

268
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:05,750
I'll burn it to let my mom know.

269
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:06,350
Otherwise,

270
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,910
my mom will be turning in her grave.

271
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,910
I'll be too ashamed to meet her in the afterlife.

272
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:10,600
And I…

273
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:16,750
Come with me.

274
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,080
What are you going to do?

275
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,150
She doesn't believe me.

276
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:21,830
I'll show her my face.

277
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:23,530
Come.

278
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:39,960
Give me your arm.

279
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:41,070
For what?

280
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:42,640
I'll bandage it for you.

281
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:57,190
♫Sit with you at night and listen to the wind♫

282
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:00,630
♫When the wind flutters, the heart does too♫

283
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,250
♫Step by step, no words are spoken♫

284
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:08,210
♫Barged into sight♫

285
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:11,680
♫When did your figure grow hazy?♫

286
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:15,340
♫And how clear is it?♫

287
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,090
♫I don't intend to break your heart♫

288
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:21,300
♫Silently fall into my arms♫

289
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:24,870
♫The world is ever-changing♫

290
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:26,490
♫We still remember♫

00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:27,630
♫To be the stars♫

292
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,550
♫That light up each other's worlds♫

293
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:32,220
♫I invite you♫

♫Stay together forever♫

296
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:48,430
You don't have a scar.

297
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:53,960
So you're not my fiancé.

298
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,120
That's what happened.

299
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:01,710
She was looking for someone,

300
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:02,430
and so was I.

301
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:03,110
As a result,

302
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,730
we bumped into each other.

303
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:11,150
What are you thinking? Say something.

304
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:14,870
Mr. Jiang.

305
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:16,670
I want to know

306
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,050
why Mr. Shang

307
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,210
doesn't have a nose.

308
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,740
He doesn't have a nose?

309
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,340
So,

310
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:26,050
he wears a mask

311
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:28,020
to cover that?

312
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:31,210
Five years ago,

313
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,710
Shang Bieli followed Nan Jifeng

314
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,000
to fight enemies at the border.

315
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:38,030
Unluckily, he was captured.

316
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,390
Shang Bieli only came back to the capital

317
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:40,350
five years ago.

318
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:42,440
He had been in the army before that.

319
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:44,310
It seems that Shang Bieli

320
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,100
is really not my young sir.

321
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:47,630
The enemies were barbarians

322
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:48,950
and cut off his nose

323
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:50,940
according to their convention

324
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,320
to humiliate him.

325
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:54,150
Then,

326
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:55,830
by luck, Shang Bieli

327
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:57,430
escaped from the prison camp

328
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:58,870
and returned to the battlefield.

329
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,000
He fought fiercely,

330
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:01,520
wiped out the enemy,

331
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,620
and became a decorated warrior.

332
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:06,310
To be honest,

333
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:08,510
before Shang Bieli was injured,

334
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:10,310
he was quite handsome.

335
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:12,630
But that incident

336
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:14,970
made him a completely difficult man.

337
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:17,670
So what he wants to cover with the mask

338
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,350
is not just his nose.

339
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:22,750
I think

340
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,790
Mr. Shang is just a heartbroken man

341
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,470
who lost his nose.

342
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:31,330
I'm afraid in the whole capital,

343
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:32,590
you're the only person

344
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:34,140
who will say that about him.

345
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:35,270
Really?

346
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:38,630
By the way,

347
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:39,590
Boss,

348
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:41,110
I got the wrong guy.

349
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,070
How about you?

350
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:48,910
I think I got the wrong guy as well.

351
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:51,340
The guy I'm looking for

352
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,990
is handsome,

353
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:54,990
gentle, considerate,

354
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:57,110
brave, and righteous.

355
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:58,230
To protect me,

356
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:59,760
he even put his life at risk.

357
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,190
If he's such a good man,

358
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:04,950
how come you lost him?

359
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:11,310
Well,

360
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:13,670
people come and go.

361
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,390
We parted ways

362
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:17,070
for a better reunion.

363
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:20,360
Tong Sai'er.

364
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:22,630
According to the rules here,

365
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:23,670
outsiders

366
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:25,530
who want to live in the capital

367
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:27,450
have to get formally registered.

368
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:28,790
Your paperwork is not done yet.

369
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:31,390
You have to go to the Inspection Office with me.

370
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:32,270
But I…

371
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,110
Go with him.

372
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:33,590
Go.

373
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:35,830
You must go to the Inspection Office.

374
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:37,290
But you can't go like this.

375
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:38,550
You need to

376
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:39,830
wash up and get changed

377
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:40,760
to show respect.

378
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:41,750
Don't bother.

379
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:43,190
No way.

380
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:44,680
It's not a bother at all.

381
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:46,290
It's a government office.

382
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:47,850
Take it seriously.

383
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:37,950
Bieli.

384
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:41,870
Everyone's waiting for you at the celebration.

385
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:42,400
Let's go.

386
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:49,190
I was once taken captive.

387
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:52,040
I don't deserve to celebrate.

388
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:54,810
Who said that?

389
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,700
You won this battle.

390
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,140
You're the greatest hero.

391
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,380
As a man,

392
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,510
you don't need

393
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:11,870
good looks to be accomplished.

394
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:12,540
What they cut off

395
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,470
was not my nose,

396
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:14,500
but my dignity!

397
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:15,390
My dignity!

398
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,330
If you're so upset about it,

399
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:27,350
fine,

400
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:30,330
I'll lose my nose with you.

401
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:32,750
Brother!

402
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:37,270
Brother,

403
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:40,890
that's not what I mean.

404
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,680
I failed to protect you.

405
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,480
If you've lost your dignity,

406
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:51,550
so have I.

407
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:56,830
Nan.

408
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:05,020
Nan.

409
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:06,530
I have a gift

410
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:08,020
for Shang.

411
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:20,910
Shang, in my eyes,

412
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:22,990
you've always been unique.

413
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,730
This mask

414
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:27,750
is made of seven kinds of ore.

415
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:29,910
Only the best warrior in my tribe

416
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:30,750
can wear it.

417
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,470
When you wear it,

418
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,560
the world will only remember

419
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:36,270
that you

420
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:38,350
are an invincible hero.

421
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:03,710
Gaya.

422
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:05,870
I promise you,

423
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:08,970
I'll find my brother.

424
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:19,710
Mother.

425
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:21,590
I went to the palace today

426
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:23,390
to catch up with the crown prince.

427
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:25,100
I heard that Li Jun, Vice Director of Personnel,

428
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,830
denounced General Nan Jifeng,

429
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:28,540
saying that countless valuables

430
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:30,670
were found in the General's Residence

431
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:32,790
and that General Nan might have fled

432
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:34,110
to escape punishment.

433
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:35,630
Really?

434
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:37,910
His Majesty has ordered

435
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:39,440
an investigation in Heman.

436
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:41,910
I'm afraid

437
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,550
Xinbai may be blamed too.

438
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:50,100
What does it have to do with Xinbai?

439
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:52,670
He just came back from Heman,

440
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:55,360
and something so serious happened there.

441
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,790
What if His Majesty blames him?

442
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,150
How do you know

443
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:01,550
Xinbai went to Heman?

444
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,790
Mr. Shang told me.

445
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:05,190
How did he know?

446
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:07,910
Mother, don't worry.

447
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:09,440
Mr. Shang intended no harm.

448
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:11,300
He told me this

449
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:13,350
just because he was worried that the Jiang family

450
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:14,550
might be implicated.

451
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:17,160
What else did he say?

452
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,430
He also said that after Xinbai came back,

453
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:21,070
the Inspection Office and Jinwu Guards

454
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:23,000
had a conflict at the Ghost Market.

455
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:25,560
A conflict at the Ghost Market?

456
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:28,590
Conflicts between two government departments

457
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:29,870
are quite normal,

458
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:32,070
but weirdly,

459
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,990
Xinbai was actually taken hostage

460
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:36,650
by a woman at the Ghost Market.

461
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:38,710
Taken hostage?

462
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:40,150
By a woman?

463
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,620
What's weirder is that

464
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,320
instead of

465
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:43,630
punishing that woman,

466
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:44,600
Xinbai

467
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:45,750
just let her go.

468
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:48,750
I'm worried

469
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:51,070
that woman may have something

470
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:52,580
on Xinbai.

471
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:56,950
How could that happen?

472
00:21:58,750 --> 00:21:59,440
Mother.

473
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:01,830
I think Xinbai didn't tell you

474
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:03,990
because he didn't want you to worry.

475
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:06,470
How about

476
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:08,510
I talk to him?

477
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:11,000
No need.

478
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:12,590
You and he

479
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:13,860
never get along.

480
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,430
You fight whenever you meet.

481
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:16,360
I'll talk to him.

482
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,670
Mother.

483
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:19,970
It's not that I have an issue with him.

484
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:21,190
It's just that

485
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:22,520
he's never cared for me.

486
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:25,600
He does care for you. He just…

487
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:34,860
You'll understand one day.

488
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:49,910
[Inspection Office]

489
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,470
My lord.

490
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:55,850
Let her in for some paperwork.

491
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:56,670
Yes, my lord.

492
00:22:58,150 --> 00:22:59,670
You can't recognize me, can you?

493
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:00,590
I knew what happened just now

494
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:02,770
at Shang Bieli's house was an accident.

495
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:04,500
I'll give you a hard time later.

496
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:08,520
Let's go.

497
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:25,910
Have you brought Blossom Beauty's license with you?

498
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:27,590
Hold it. I can't speak.

499
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:29,110
To do the paperwork

500
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,150
for someone else, you need

501
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:32,190
to show your ID,

502
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:33,290
Ms. Yan.

503
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:37,050
Yes.

504
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:39,270
Stop trying to test me.

505
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,440
If you want

506
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:42,730
your sketchbook back,

507
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,270
you can beg me.

508
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,510
Dream on.

509
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:34,330
Why are you still here?

510
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:35,760
I'm waiting for you.

511
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,360
I saw

512
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:39,050
a lot of fruits

513
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:40,050
in the yard above.

514
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,510
Why didn't anyone pick them?

515
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:42,510
I just tasted one.

516
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:43,570
It was very sweet.

517
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,040
Try it.

518
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:51,590
You stayed here

519
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:53,230
just to pick fruit?

520
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:55,190
Of course not.

521
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:59,160
I want to ask you something.

522
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:01,910
At Shang Bieli's house during the day,

523
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:03,200
I was all dressed up.

524
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,380
And tonight,

525
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:05,340
I'm wearing

526
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,870
the same clothes as Sai'er.

527
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:09,000
How did you manage to recognize me?

528
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:12,110
To me,

529
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:14,470
no matter what clothes you wear,

530
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,840
whether your hair is different,

531
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,640
or whether you smell different,

532
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:20,390
it makes no difference.

533
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:21,550
You

534
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,370
are just you.

535
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:37,310
Well,

536
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,150
were you

537
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:39,950
born this way?

538
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:42,920
Or did you become like this afterward?

539
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:44,630
How can you work like this?

540
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:47,250
Maybe you can get help at work,

541
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:49,170
but how do you live after work?

542
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,230
I know.

543
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:57,630
You're like a cat.

544
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:00,150
Cats and dogs

545
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:02,600
usually can't recognize their owners.

546
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,440
But their keen sense of smell

547
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:05,710
and hearing

548
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:06,930
can help them do it.

549
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:09,510
Or,

550
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:10,990
you're like a cat

551
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:13,240
that loves cuddling up to its owner

552
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:14,110
to make marks.

553
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:17,190
Do you like making marks too?

554
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:20,010
Swear at me if you want.

555
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:22,200
Don't compare me to cats and dogs.

556
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:24,320
I'm right, aren't I?

557
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:29,760
Tell me about you.

558
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,600
What's the feeling that's guiding you

559
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:35,160
in your search for that man?

560
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,410
Tell me.

561
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:40,990
You cherish your life so much.

562
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:43,330
How good does he have to be

563
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:45,990
to be worth all your efforts to find him?

564
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:50,400
What does it have to do with you?

565
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:52,310
If you say it like that,

566
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:54,440
I'm very likely to get the wrong idea

567
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,640
that you're jealous.

568
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,390
I'm just sick of

569
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:01,720
running around for you.

570
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,030
I don't have time

571
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:04,190
to save you again.

572
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:05,320
No need for that.

573
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:05,810
No need.

574
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,070
No matter what happens in the future,

575
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:09,600
I'll never ask you for help.

576
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:10,360
I'm leaving.

577
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,320
By the way,

578
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:16,980
I have something on you now.

579
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,630
My sketchbook;

580
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:20,830
I'll get it back sooner or later.

581
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:22,750
Take it.

582
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,630
Yan Nanxing.

583
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,000
At Shang Bieli's house,

584
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:37,910
why could I recognize her

585
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:39,990
without using any tricks?

586
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,550
[Blossom Beauty]

587
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:10,630
Sai'er.

588
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:12,830
You were so thoughtless.

589
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:13,630
You forced him

590
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:14,690
to pick at his scab.

591
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,220
I need to apologize to him.

592
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:21,510
What do you think

593
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,430
I should do

594
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:25,860
to compensate Mr. Shang?

595
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:27,960
Morning.

596
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:29,690
Morning, Boss.

597
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:30,970
Morning, Boss.

598
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:32,520
What are you talking about?

599
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,760
Sai'er just told me

600
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:36,050
what happened at Mr. Shang's yesterday.

601
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:39,070
You said you'd keep it a secret.

602
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:42,240
Ruoqian isn't an outsider.

603
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:43,730
Boss, don't worry.

604
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:45,250
I'll keep it a secret.

605
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:53,590
Sai'er.

606
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:01,150
What's wrong?

607
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:03,550
Here's the thing.

608
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:04,590
Sai'er,

609
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:08,230
your portrait

610
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:11,110
is too blurry.

611
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:12,790
I…

612
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:14,530
It's fine, Boss.

613
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:18,990
I understand.

614
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:21,880
I…

615
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:24,680
I just need an excuse

616
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:26,110
to stay here for longer.

617
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:32,710
You don't need any excuses.

618
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,510
Stay if you want.

619
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:35,150
Stay forever.

620
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:35,630
Okay?

621
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:37,200
Both Ruoqian and I

622
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,390
welcome you, right?

623
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:44,710
Don't cry.

624
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,430
It's a joyful thing.

625
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:48,530
You should smile.

626
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:49,630
Smile.

627
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:54,350
Ruoqian.

628
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:55,990
Boss.

629
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:58,070
I promise

630
00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:00,390
I won't hide anything from you anymore.

631
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:02,000
I trust you.

632
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:04,350
I trust you too.

633
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:10,310
As for me,

634
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:11,930
I have nothing to hide.

635
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:12,950
I'm a slave.

636
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:14,210
A top student.

637
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:15,070
Very likeable.

638
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:16,730
You two already know that.

639
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:21,870
Boss.

640
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:23,070
How about you?

641
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:27,390
Me?

642
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,630
I…

643
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:32,880
I…

644
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:34,550
I…

645
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:35,760
I'm just kidding.

646
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:37,830
Boss,

647
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:40,400
you don't have to tell us your secrets.

648
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:41,590
You can tell us

649
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:42,670
when you're ready.

650
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,840
What matters is not what you think but what you do.

651
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,700
Even a saint has bad thoughts too.

652
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:55,950
Mr. Shang.

653
00:30:56,650 --> 00:30:57,370
Oh my god.

654
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,830
Is he here for me?

655
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:02,860
He's here for me.

656
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:19,390
You're very efficient, Mr. Shang.

657
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:21,110
You came to me so soon.

658
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:22,590
You knew I'd come?

659
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:25,270
You want to ask me

660
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:27,050
about Gaya, right?

661
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,190
That day, in Twelve Music House,

662
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:36,270
I heard you call a dancer

663
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:38,470
Gaya.

664
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:50,310
You didn't do anything wrong

665
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:52,880
or disturb her and General Nan.

666
00:31:56,730 --> 00:31:58,460
Were you really Gaya's friend?

667
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:47,410
She's still so beautiful.

668
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:00,230
Did she

669
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:02,810
ever mention me?

670
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:10,910
Yeah.

671
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:14,170
She didn't have any reason

672
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:16,370
to mention me.

673
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:18,120
She and I

674
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:19,590
weren't friends for long.

675
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:21,070
Maybe she just didn't have time

676
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:22,730
to talk about certain things.

677
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:27,390
No matter how many times I ask you

678
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:29,560
whether Gaya's death was caused

679
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,510
by Jiang Xinbai,

680
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,900
you won't answer me, will you?

681
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:37,130
I can only tell you that

682
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:39,960
Jiang Xinbai did nothing wrong.

683
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,400
So Gaya was wrong?

684
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:49,330
Do you really want to know the answer?

685
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:50,990
Have you ever thought that

686
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:52,810
your brother kept it from you

687
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:54,030
because he wanted Gaya

688
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:55,830
to stay a good woman in your eyes?

689
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:57,950
Actually, deep down, you're afraid

690
00:33:57,950 --> 00:33:58,960
to know the truth.

691
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:03,000
You stand against Jiang Xinbai

692
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:04,910
because you're afraid.

693
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:11,280
You're on Jiang Xinbai's side.

694
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:13,429
Of course you'd say that.

695
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:18,449
I'm not on his side.

696
00:34:22,389 --> 00:34:23,449
I'm not on his side.

697
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:24,870
Not now.

698
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:26,389
Not in the past.

699
00:34:27,469 --> 00:34:28,469
Not in the future.

700
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:32,389
I hope it's true.

701
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:35,110
I'm not done

702
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:36,960
with Jiang Xinbai yet.

703
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:40,550
You were Gaya's friend.

704
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:44,210
I don't want to drag you in.

705
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:04,030
Can you

706
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:07,170
give me this portrait?

707
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,400
Thank you.

708
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:36,670
Mother.

709
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,580
What brought you here?

710
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:39,380
I heard

711
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:41,790
Nan Jifeng, the general overseeing Heman,

712
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:42,750
was accused

713
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:45,270
of taking bribes,

714
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:48,560
and he's fled to the border to escape punishment.

715
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:49,590
Those bribes

716
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:51,030
were from the enemy.

717
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:52,890
They tried to buy off General Nan,

718
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:54,860
and he played along.

719
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,480
He didn't spend a penny of them

720
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:59,380
because he hoped that one day

721
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:01,040
he could prove his innocence.

722
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,270
I planned

723
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:05,000
to wait for an opportunity

724
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:06,720
to report it to His Majesty.

725
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:08,210
But unexpectedly,

726
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,020
the rumors spread so fast.

727
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:14,630
I'll go to the palace now.

728
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,470
Don't go.

729
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:18,090
His Majesty has sent people

730
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:19,690
to Heman for investigation.

731
00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:21,630
Xinbai,

732
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:23,330
why hasn't His Majesty given this task

733
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:24,790
to the Inspection Office?

734
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,470
Can't you

735
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:28,790
read between the lines?

736
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:32,780
No matter how highly His Majesty thinks of you,

737
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,380
you're the Duke of Yuejiang.

738
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:36,040
More or less,

739
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:37,570
he sees you as a threat.

740
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:40,930
The fact that you went to Heman

741
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:41,990
should be kept a secret.

742
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:42,720
At this time,

743
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:44,750
you must not provoke him.

744
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:46,870
Moreover…

745
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:49,790
By the way,

746
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:52,070
at the Ghost Market, did you…

747
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:55,190
Suoluo told you

748
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:56,660
I had a conflict

749
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:58,970
with Shang Bieli at the Ghost Market?

750
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:01,800
Forget it.

751
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:04,000
Let's not talk about that.

752
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:06,190
Xinbai.

753
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:07,950
Can you promise me

754
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,630
to drop

755
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:12,020
the Zornia case for now?

756
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:13,990
Can you?

757
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:24,990
Mother,

758
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:27,620
have you talked to Xinbai?

759
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:33,070
I also found out

760
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,250
that the woman who took him hostage

761
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:37,480
opened a store in Ruyi District

762
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:39,550
instead of leaving the capital.

763
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:41,440
How about

764
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:42,760
I go meet her?

765
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:45,230
Suoluo.

766
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:48,750
The Imperial Academy will start giving classes soon.

767
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:50,080
As a female chancellor,

768
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,230
shouldn't you pay more attention

769
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:53,400
to your students?

770
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:58,670
Daughter,

771
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:01,590
you're the first

772
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,960
female chancellor in this dynasty.

773
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,380
I'm happy for you

774
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:06,670
and proud of you.

775
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:10,470
But women are at a disadvantage in this game.

776
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:11,590
That's exactly why

777
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:13,550
you can't give others ammunition.

778
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,140
To get everything I have now,

779
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:19,430
my cousins and I were once

780
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:21,110
at each other's throats.

781
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:23,910
So I hope

782
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:25,570
you can take the high road too.

783
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:31,030
I'll keep that in mind.

784
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:37,640
As for that woman…

785
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:44,980
I have a plan for her.

after you hired new staff,

789
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:09,370
your business is even better.

790
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:10,820
Hello.

791
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:12,310
How can I help you?

00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:14,030
Where is Yan Nanxing?

793

You can tell me what you need.

I am Yan Nanxing.

797
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:26,660
What can I do for you?

798
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:31,550
Wait.

Fairy Powder.

801
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,680
Good name.

802
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:39,770
But it's an exaggeration.

803
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:46,430
The main component is motherwort.

804
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:47,560
There's also poria,

pearl powder, and other herbs in it.

806
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:52,530
Most importantly,

807
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:54,310
there's jimsonweed in it.

808
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:57,360
Ladies,

809
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,660
jimsonweed is poisonous.

810
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,430
It has a great immediate effect,

811
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:03,970
but once you stop using it,

812
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:05,970
your skin will age ten times faster.

813

Ten times faster?

00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:08,510
Besides,

815
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,470
if you use it for a long time,

816
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,080
you may faint or go into a coma

817

No way.

Am I poisoned?

Talking about toxicity without considering dosage

00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:50,030
-Sai'er.
-Boss.

872
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:50,870
Listen to me, Sai'er.

873
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:51,270
Boss.

874
00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:51,950
Sai'er, calm down.

875
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:53,610
-Boss.
-Sai'er, listen to me.

876
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:54,470
Calm down.

877
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:55,450
It may be a trap.

878
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:59,140
We need an explanation.

879
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:04,950
Mrs. Bao.

880
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:05,660
Mrs. Bao.

881
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,230
What should we do?

882
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:08,790
How would I know?

883
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:10,590
Ms. Yan should know better

884
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:11,290
than to antagonize

885
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:12,720
the Jiang family.

886
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:14,110
That's right.

887
00:42:16,890 --> 00:42:17,660
Some time ago,

888
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,630
the Duke of Yuejiang came here, didn't he?

889
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:20,870
Aren't they friends?

890
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:21,630
Yes.

891
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:24,180
Jiang Xinbai is the Duke of Yuejiang.

892
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:25,190
Yes.

893
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:25,950
Right.

894
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:28,020
Thank you, Mrs. Bao.

895
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,400
What did I say?

896
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:34,120
