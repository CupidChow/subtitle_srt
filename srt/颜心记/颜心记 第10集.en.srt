00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:12,430
and brawls

178
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:13,350
happen every day.

179
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:13,990
Once the constables

180
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:14,750
get here,

181
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:15,710
they can get straight to work.

182
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:17,990
It's a breeding ground for crime.

183
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:20,370
So she works for the government?

184
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,770
How have I never heard of

185
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:23,670
any female military officer?

186
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,380
My niece is a doctor.

187
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:27,330
But because of this house,

188
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:29,600
I should persuade her to be a thief.

189
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:31,930
Madam, what are you implying?

190
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:32,770
Just be frank.

191
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:33,830
Give me a discount.

192
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:34,450
10% off.

193
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:35,140
60%.

194
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:36,960
You drive a hard bargain.

195
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,420
Isn't your niece a doctor?

196
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,880
Doctors are highly paid.

197
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,070
I hope so,

198
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:44,750
but she's just started her career and has no resources at all.

199
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:47,850
If she likes it here,

200
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:50,260
she'll let you raise the rent next year.

201
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:53,810
Six is a lucky number.

202
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:54,740
60% off, please.

203
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:56,510
Four is even luckier.

204
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,460
So 40% off it is.

205
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,110
Actually, I want to ask you,

206
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:03,910
which area of the capital

207
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:05,490
is the most densely populated

208
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:07,290
and most suitable for business?

209
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,520
You want to help your niece

210
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:11,150
start a business, don't you?

211
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,750
Land, housing, and goods are all expensive in the capital.

212
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:15,880
To find my young sir,

213
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:17,650
I have to make a living first.

214
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,690
[Ruyi District]

215
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:22,750
Ruyi District has the best stores in the capital.

216
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:23,950
I'm familiar with it.

217
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,280
Mrs. Bao, you're a jack of all trades.

218
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,440
"Bao" means comprehensive.

219
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:30,320
So my family's services

220
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,500
cover renting, errand running, and information gathering.

221
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,910
You're new here.

222
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:35,250
Whether you rent or buy a house,

223
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,400
open a shop, or transfer its ownership,

224
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,150
you have to come to me.

225
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,790
I've sorted everything out for you.

226
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:41,310
You won't be disappointed.

227
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:42,240
You're amazing.

228
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,230
You flatter me.

229
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,380
Does your niece

230
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,750
want to be an apprentice

231
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:51,750
or open her own shop?

232
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:53,060
Is she planning for a big business

233
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,060
or a small one?

234
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:54,940
A big business.

235
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,070
Super big.

236
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,630
But the stores in Ruyi District

237
00:12:58,630 --> 00:12:59,790
are expensive.

238
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:03,990
To open a store…

239
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:06,250
You can't dither about expenses.

240
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:11,320
Money's no problem.

241
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:14,230
Then leave it to me.

242
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:15,800
You won't be disappointed.

243
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,120
My lord.

244
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:19,390
We searched every corner

245
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,950
within a 7-mile radius of the Ghost Market.

246
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:21,550
We looked all night

247
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,480
but still didn't find Cao Wenquan.

248
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:25,990
Cao Wenquan is in charge of the Ghost Market.

249
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:27,440
Of course he knows better than us

250
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,310
the intricate lanes there.

251
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:32,460
It's not surprising that he's escaped for now.

252
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:33,590
Just bring him back.

253
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:35,550
Now that the handler has died

254
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:37,520
and the holder has escaped,

255
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:38,610
does that mean

256
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:40,210
we've sweated over nothing?

257
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:41,070
No.

258
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:42,550
First,

259
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,520
we deterred the outlaws.

260
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:45,590
Second,

261
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:48,220
Cao Wenquan didn't kill himself

262
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:50,320
last night at the Ghost Market.

263
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:51,190
It means

264
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,250
he's not a man of sacrifice.

265
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:53,910
Right.

266
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:55,400
I've looked into it.

267
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:56,710
He has no wife, children,

268
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:57,870
or siblings.

269
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:00,470
Someone like him is hard to control.

270
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:02,390
Great.

271
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,830
Once we catch Cao Wenquan,

272
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:06,790
we can knock holes in this case.

273
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:07,870
Yes, my lord.

274
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:10,790
Why did Ms. Yan

275
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:13,230
take you hostage last night?

276
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,760
Something urgent came up.

277
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:19,590
I have to

278
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:21,190
leave now.

279
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:21,830
I…

280
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,790
I can't let others

281
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:23,720
see me like this.

282
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:29,030
Since Ms. Yan found out

283
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:29,910
your identity,

284
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:31,380
her attitude towards you

285
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,780
has changed a lot.

286
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:36,430
Yeah.

287
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:38,920
She's indeed changed a lot.

288
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:54,070
Young Sir, wait for me.

289
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:57,630
I'll roll with the punches.

290
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,670
After I make a lot of money

291
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:02,710
and find my footing here,

292
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,710
we can go have fun

293
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:04,710
wherever we want.

294
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:05,470
Cheers.

295
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:23,880
Where's my sketchbook?

296
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:29,910
Did I lose it at the Ghost Market?

297
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,600
Where on earth is my sketchbook?

298
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:48,830
Forget it.

299
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,560
These people couldn't understand it

300
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:53,390
even if they had picked it up.

301
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:29,010
Could it be…

302
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:00,230
In the middle of every month,

303
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:01,780
around the full moon?

304
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:04,430
My lord,

305
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:06,960
what's in your hands?

306
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:11,030
Yao.

307
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:13,109
We haven't found Cao Wenquan yet.

308
00:17:13,109 --> 00:17:14,670
Nothing unusual at the city gates

309
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:15,829
and downtown streets

310
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:17,030
in various districts.

311
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:18,030
So we plan

312
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:19,390
to expand the search.

313
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:22,230
Keep looking.

314
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:28,369
One more thing.

315
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:30,470
Go find out

316
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:32,840
if Yan Nanxing is still in the capital.

317
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:45,650
[Longxin Teahouse]

318
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:55,290
Your Grace.

319
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:56,110
Welcome.

320
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:28,590
Here's this month's fee.

321
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:32,290
Tell me when you're running out of stock.

322
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:56,210
How do you like the tea?

323
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:57,070
It's good.

324
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:58,840
Top-notch Moon River.

325
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:01,350
I only supply it to Longxin Teahouse.

326
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,900
No wonder the owner of Longxin Teahouse

327
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,430
gave you high commissions.

328
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:07,430
Shang.

329
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,870
You're an official and a tea merchant.

330
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:11,750
You have to be careful

331
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:13,470
lest the wrong people

332
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:14,910
hear the gossip.

333
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:17,110
Do you mean Jiang Xinbai?

334
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:18,840
You think I'm afraid of him?

335
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:20,150
I asked you here today

336
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:21,390
to talk about

337
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:22,990
him and that woman.

338
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:27,030
You're still thinking about the woman at the Ghost Market?

339
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:28,090
I've looked her up.

340
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:30,150
She's not from the Ghost Market.

341
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,570
Before that day,

342
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:35,350
I had met her at a Persian witch's shop.

343
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,310
What did you talk about?

344
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:38,630
Just…

345
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,520
just small talk.

346
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:43,310
But I find it

347
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:44,710
more and more confusing.

348
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,720
I thought they were acquainted,

349
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,040
but when I searched her that day,

350
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:52,070
they didn't seem

351
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:53,150
to know each other.

352
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:56,590
Later, that woman

353
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,190
held Jiang Xinbai hostage.

354
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:00,190
Why?

355
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:02,970
They must've pretended to be strangers,

356
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:04,690
which gives us more reason

357
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,780
to think they have a special relationship.

358
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:11,190
Then,

359
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:12,580
have you tried to find out

360
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,510
where she is now?

361
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,190
Interesting question.

362
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:20,190
I had someone look for her the other day,

363
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:23,230
but she disappeared.

364
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:24,950
Has she left the capital?

365
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,550
I'll find her

366
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:27,780
by all means.

367
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:30,310
Maybe

368
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:31,870
I can use her

369
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:33,730
to get something on Jiang Xinbai.

370
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:34,710
Shang.

371
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:37,750
Actually, there's a question

372
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,410
I've always wanted to ask you.

373
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:40,590
Why are you so sure

374
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:41,700
that Jiang Xinbai caused

375
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,360
your sister-in-law's death?

376
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:46,040
It's a very serious matter.

377
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:47,030
Shouldn't you

378
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:48,890
have asked your brother about it?

379
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:57,610
He sent me an urgent letter from afar,

380
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:00,670
saying that my sister-in-law died of illness.

381
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:03,580
But she had always

382
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:04,670
been very healthy.

383
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:07,960
There was no way she'd die so suddenly.

384
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:09,150
And as it happens,

385
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:14,350
Jiang Xinbai came back from Heman.

386
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:15,910
I thought

387
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:17,710
he had something to do with this,

388
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:19,170
so I asked him about it.

389
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:20,950
Guess what?

390
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:24,710
He didn't deny it.

391
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:27,910
That's all?

392
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:28,990
That's all.

393
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:31,350
But what you said

394
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:32,280
is not evidence.

395
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,440
Don't defend him!

396
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:35,550
I still think you shouldn't have

397
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:37,150
jumped to that conclusion.

398
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:38,170
Even if he didn't

399
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:39,070
kill her himself,

400
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:40,470
he was definitely involved!

401
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:42,330
Otherwise, why didn't he deny it?

402
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:48,890
Sorry, Suoluo.

403
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:52,360
I shouldn't have yelled at you.

404
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,700
If it weren't for my duties

405
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,240
keeping me in the capital,

406
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,270
I would've gone to Heman myself

407
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:01,470
to find out the truth.

408
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:02,550
Later,

409
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:05,090
I wrote a letter to my brother,

410
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:07,110
asking him

411
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:08,440
if it was what I thought.

412
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:14,130
He still hasn't replied to me yet.

413
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:15,720
Shang.

414
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:18,330
I understand

415
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:18,870
how you felt

416
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:19,830
about Lady Gaya.

417
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:21,270
Maybe it's those feelings

418
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:22,860
you can't tell anyone about

419
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,410
that have clouded your judgment.

420
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,020
I'm not

421
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:27,450
defending Jiang Xinbai.

422
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,370
I just don't want to see you in so much pain.

423
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:45,150
My lord.

424
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:46,350
I've got something.

425
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:48,110
Someone rented a detached house

426
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:50,570
in Tongshan District in Yan Nanxing's name.

427
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:53,640
She didn't rent it herself?

428
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:56,590
The person who checked the house and paid the rent

429
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:58,450
claimed to be Yan Nanxing's aunt.

430
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:16,230
It's been five days.

431
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:18,520
Why haven't I changed back?

432
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:23,070
Could it be that

433
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:24,670
my sketchbook was taken

434
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:25,600
by Jiang Xinbai?

435
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:28,690
I can't be that unlucky.

436
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:29,620
The odds are low.

437
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:37,030
Am I drunk?

438
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:41,310
No one's home.

439
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,690
I told you so many times!

440
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:48,450
No one's...

441
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:50,780
home.

442
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:56,770
Yan Nanxing.

443
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:58,550
I knew you were here.

444
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:00,550
What did he call me?

445
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:02,720
You have poor eyesight?

446
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:05,230
You got the wrong person.

447
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,320
What do you want?

448
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:10,150
I can't let others

449
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:11,080
see me like this.

450
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:14,010
It's the voice that day.

451
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:23,140
I'm from the Inspection Office.

452
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:25,990
I'm here to check on the new tenants in the capital.

453
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:26,750
Please…

454
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:29,830
madam,

455
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:31,010
cooperate.

456
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:40,270
I didn't break any laws

457
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:41,590
or cause any trouble.

458
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,980
What's wrong with me drinking alone at home,

459
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:46,470
Mr. Chief Constable?

460
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:48,440
I only said

461
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,240
I'm from the Inspection Office.

462
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,380
I never said I'm the chief constable.

463
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,710
How did you know that?

464
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:55,550
I...

465
00:24:58,470 --> 00:24:59,750
I can tell that

466
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:01,950
from your extraordinary temperament.

467
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:06,210
It makes sense.

468
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:12,690
The registered tenant of this house

469
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:13,860
is Yan Nanxing.

470
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:16,270
Where is she?

471
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:16,910
I...

472
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:18,570
I was about to tell you

473
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,360
my niece went out.

474
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,030
Niece?

475
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:26,830
She's out?

476
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:32,640
Will she come back tonight?

477
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:33,830
Maybe,

478
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,220
maybe not.

479
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:37,840
Where did she go?

480
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:40,750
Somewhere far away.

481
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:43,370
Can't see it from here.

482
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,470
Then I'll wait for her

483
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:46,200
here tonight

484
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:48,870
until she comes back.

485
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:53,720
I...

486
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,230
I walk very fast.

487
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:56,570
It's not that far away.

488
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,100
I'll go get her for you.

489
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:05,310
Can you find her?

490
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:06,750
Of course.

491
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,890
He came uninvited.

492
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:18,820
He must have come prepared.

493
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,240
He called me Yan Nanxing at the Ghost Market

494
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,660
and called me Yan Nanxing again here.

495
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:29,390
Why?

496
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:33,840
I haven't changed back.

497
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:10,100
I knew it.

498
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:12,420
My room.

499
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:15,830
Gosh.

500
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:29,160
Stop!

501
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:33,190
What are you doing?

502
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:34,800
Without my permission,

503
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,510
you broke into my house

504
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:36,680
and went through my stuff.

505
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,630
Is this how the Inspection Office

506
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:39,030
treats ordinary people?

507
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:45,630
Yan Nanxing?

508
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:47,710
It's your voice.

509
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,630
But why are you dressed

510
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:50,490
the same as the woman

511
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:51,250
just now?

512
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:55,300
What does it have to do with you?

513
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,180
She's my aunt.

514
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:57,230
We're close.

515
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:59,230
We like to wear the same clothes.

516
00:27:59,350 --> 00:27:59,990
Aunt?

517
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:06,270
Then where is your aunt now?

518
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:07,310
She...

519
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:08,670
She went out.

520
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:10,970
That's none of your business.

521
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:18,160
You smell like alcohol.

522
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:21,550
I'm right.

523
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,190
It's you.

524
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:28,350
Now I understand

525
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:30,520
why you were so afraid

526
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:32,190
of being seen by others that night

527
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:33,320
at the Ghost Market.

528
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:39,130
What you were afraid of

529
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:43,090
was a shocking secret.

530
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:47,330
That's total nonsense!

531
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:49,230
I'm done talking with you.

532
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:53,320
Yan Nanxing.

533
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:55,120
Who on earth are you?

534
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:57,350
What does the real you look like?

535
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:00,150
You're so weird!

536
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:01,830
You asked a stranger

537
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:03,270
if she was Yan Nanxing

538
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:04,390
and then asked me

539
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:05,550
who I was.

540
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,450
I see. You have face blindness.

541
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:15,790
Young man,

542
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:17,310
please

543
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:19,940
go rest somewhere else.

544
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:21,530
I don't trust you

545
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:23,990
because I can't see you clearly.

546
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:26,550
What?

547
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,990
Kill me once you're done using me?

548
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:28,790
How could you?

549
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:29,340
It's you.

550
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:31,890
Pretending not to know me?

551
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:40,950
I got you there, right?

552
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:43,430
Jiang Xinbai, you have face blindness!

553
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:49,590
Yan Nanxing, listen.

554
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:51,750
You held me hostage at the Ghost Market that day.

555
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:53,010
It was a serious crime.

556
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:54,490
You'd better honestly

557
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:56,210
answer my questions here,

558
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:58,270
or I'll take you back to the Inspection Office

559
00:29:58,270 --> 00:29:59,390
for interrogation.

560
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:01,050
Who are you to interrogate me?

561
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:03,110
It should be me interrogating you.

562
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:04,040
Come with me.

563
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:04,870
You...

564
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:05,550
Come out!

565
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:06,720
What are you doing?

566
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,430
Come.

567
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:09,160
Yan Nanxing!

568
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:15,850
This is my sketchbook.

569
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:17,240
My self-portrait is in it.

570
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:17,900
Take a look.

571
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:18,970
Which one is me?

572
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:24,910
Fortunately,

573
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:27,150
I've drawn a few portraits from memory lately.

574
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:28,670
They come in handy now.

575
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,830
Can't recognize me?

576
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,810
You do have face blindness.

577
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:45,730
This one is you.

578
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:49,390
Wrong.

579
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:54,600
Yan Nanxing.

580
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,600
I've seen

581
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:57,960
your other sketchbook.

582
00:30:58,510 --> 00:30:59,190
In it,

583
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:01,230
you're on the first page too.

584
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:02,310
It's your habit,

585
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:03,350
right?

586
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:05,250
You have that sketchbook?

587
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,430
Why did you come to the capital?

588
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:08,790
Why did you

589
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:10,770
go to the Ghost Market?

590
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:23,440
I don't mean to push you.

591
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:25,390
I know,

592
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:28,150
you still haven't gotten over

593
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:29,480
what happened at Heman.

594
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:31,430
If you're really

595
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:32,760
in some kind of trouble,

596
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:34,430
I hope I can help you.

597
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:36,600
I hope you can tell me

598
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:38,400
what I should do

599
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:40,130
to make it up to you.

600
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:43,210
Make it up to me?

601
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:46,490
One can only make up for mistakes.

602
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:49,550
Jiang Xinbai.

603
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:52,040
Do you think you were wrong?

604
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:56,870
You don't,

605
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:57,750
right?

606
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:01,200
So you don't want to make up for anything.

607
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:02,360
You're doing all this

608
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,190
just to make yourself

609
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:03,920
feel better.

610
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:04,630
Get out!

611
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:05,000
No.

612
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:05,520
Get out.

613
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:06,350
I don't want to talk to you.

614
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:07,830
-This is my house.
-Yan Nanxing.

615
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:09,090
Don't come to me again!

616
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:09,880
Yan Nanxing.

617
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:45,710
Here.

618
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:50,310
Sir.

619
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:51,150
I want this one.

620
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:52,230
I'll buy it.

621
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:53,840
Hello, Mrs. Bao.

622
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,310
Mrs. Bao, you...

623
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:57,350
Not now.

624
00:32:57,370 --> 00:32:58,950
Tomorrow. We settled on tomorrow.

625
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:00,280
Tomorrow it is.

626
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:02,470
Mrs. Bao.

627
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,580
You look great.

628
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:07,990
Ms. Yan.

629
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:10,990
You didn't sleep well last night, did you?

630
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:13,120
You have dark circles under your eyes.

631
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:16,220
I saw someone off yesterday.

632
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,830
I was upset.

633
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:19,470
Your aunt?

634
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:20,990
You two are very close.

635
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:22,390
You must want her to stay.

636
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:25,680
Look.

637
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:27,630
This is the best store for rent

638
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:29,070
in Ruyi District.

639
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:40,990
It's a prime site

640
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:42,990
at the intersection.

641
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:45,490
You can go anywhere from here.

642
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:49,350
Its feng shui

643
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:50,630
is exceptional.

644
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:52,650
It absorbs the vibrant energy

645
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:53,910
from the bustling crowds

646
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:56,310
while avoiding any negative forces.

647
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:57,710
Perfect.

648
00:33:58,550 --> 00:33:59,350
Except for the high rent,

649
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:00,680
it has no shortcomings.

650
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:01,670
Mrs. Bao.

651
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:04,530
What kinds of stores are there in Ruyi District?

652
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:06,020
There are tea houses,

653
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,520
restaurants, bars,

654
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:10,130
antique stores, art shops,

655
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:13,010
and shops for fortune-telling.

656
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:15,199
Oh, there's also a pharmacy.

657
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:16,870
Pharmacy?

658
00:34:17,949 --> 00:34:19,110
Doctor Zhang there

659
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:20,870
charges a lot

660
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:23,380
for treatment and consultation.

661
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:26,010
Only rich people with ailments go to him.

662
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:28,330
Mrs. Bao,

663
00:34:28,989 --> 00:34:31,230
is there a cosmetics store in the capital?

664
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:31,889
What store?

665
00:34:31,989 --> 00:34:32,989
Cosmetics store.

666
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:34,710
I've never heard of it.

667
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:35,790
No, right?

668
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,320
Then if I open one,

669
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:40,469
it'll be the only cosmetics store in the capital.

670
00:34:40,469 --> 00:34:41,830
By that time, the money

671
00:34:41,989 --> 00:34:43,389
is gonna come pouring in.

672
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:44,270
Mrs. Bao.

673
00:34:44,389 --> 00:34:45,130
This store...

674
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:46,449
The rent is not negotiable.

675
00:34:46,449 --> 00:34:47,790
Many people want to rent it.

676
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:48,650
I'll rent it.

677
00:34:52,219 --> 00:34:53,219
Ms. Yan,

678
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,960
you're so generous.

679
00:34:55,949 --> 00:34:57,880
You're much better than your aunt.

680
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:22,990
Jiang Xinbai.

681
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:25,740
Do you think you were wrong?

682
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:27,030
You don't,

683
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:27,990
right?

684
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:31,430
So you don't want to make up for anything.

685
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:32,510
You're doing all this

686
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:33,400
just to make yourself

687
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,130
feel better!

688
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:40,270
Linglong.

689
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:42,470
Tell me.

690
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:44,950
Was I doing all that just for myself?

691
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:47,030
Then,

692
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,320
how can I

693
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:52,270
put myself in her shoes?

694
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:00,750
Answer me.

695
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:04,850
You don't know either?

696
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:06,360
Do you know, Daimao?

697
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,210
I like how you decorated the house.

698
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:02,430
You even got a swing over there.

699
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:04,140
Girls all like such things.

700
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:04,770
It looks good, right?

701
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:06,380
Mrs. Bao, have some tea.

702
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:09,160
This place looks great.

703
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:11,310
You just said

704
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:13,460
you won't stay in the capital for long.

705
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:14,680
Where are you going?

706
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,710
Mrs. Bao,

707
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:17,650
is this how you know everything?

708
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:19,610
After asking about my plan today,

709
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:20,510
you want to know

710
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:21,810
my plan for the future.

711
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:24,670
You know me.

712
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,920
Gathering information is what I do.

713
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,190
Well,

714
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:28,910
Mrs. Bao,

715
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:30,630
there's something

716
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:31,890
I want to ask you about.

717
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:33,710
Well,

718
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,510
the soldiers in the capital

719
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:37,190
sometimes bring back patients

720
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:38,220
and criminals from outside.

721
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:39,470
Where are they usually kept?

722
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:41,130
Why are you asking about that?

723
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,490
I'm a traveling doctor.

724
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:46,430
I'm looking for a patient.

725
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:51,390
All the outsiders in the capital

726
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:52,990
have to get registered

727
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:54,450
at the Inspection Office.

728
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:56,510
Then

729
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:57,470
what about someone

730
00:37:57,470 --> 00:37:58,530
brought back personally by a soldier?

731
00:37:58,530 --> 00:37:59,150
They still have to

732
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:01,550
be interrogated at the Inspection Office.

733
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:04,190
What if he's special?

734
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:06,510
What do you mean?

735
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:09,190
For example,

736
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:12,990
he's different from other people

737
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:15,990
or has psychic abilities.

738
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:17,130
Well,

739
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,770
everyone in the capital

740
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:20,470
is on the registry

741
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,960
of the Inspection Office.

742
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:22,910
Anyway,

743
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:25,510
go to the Inspection Office if you're looking for someone.

744
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:26,950
Trust me.

745
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:28,940
The Inspection Office.

746
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:30,980
It's in my way again.

747
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:35,230
I know a secret about the Inspection Office.

748
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:36,430
Do you want to hear it?

749
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:37,540
What secret?

750
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:40,930
The chief constable of the Inspection Office,

751
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:41,770
Jiang Xinbai,

752
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:44,870
is the Duke of Yuejiang.

753
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,580
Have you heard of

754
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,550
the Duke of Yuejiang?

755
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:50,470
He's the only duke in the capital who's not from the royal family.

756
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:52,070
So Mr. Jiang is the kind of man

757
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:55,230
who was born with a silver spoon in his mouth.

758
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:56,860
His sister is a duchess.

759
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:59,110
It's not surprising that he's a duke.

760
00:38:59,110 --> 00:38:59,750
No wonder

761
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:01,710
he's spoiled

762
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:02,750
and overbearing.

763
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:05,390
That's not true.

764
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:07,280
The Duke of Yuejiang

765
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,680
is quite a character.

766
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:11,310
Although he's from a rich family,

767
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:13,470
he lives in a frugal manner.

768
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:14,670
He lives outside

769
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:15,930
Yuejiang's Residence

770
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:17,270
in a small house.

771
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,470
He doesn't even have personal guards

772
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:20,350
or servants.

773
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:21,430
Mrs. Bao,

774
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:22,830
I'm impressed.

775
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:24,830
You even know where he lives.

776
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:27,760
That I don't know.

777
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:29,310
If you want to know,

778
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:30,460
I'll ask around for you.

779
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:31,660
N-No need.

780
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,030
I want nothing to do

781
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:34,140
with him.

782
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:37,770
Yan Nanxing came to the capital to look for someone.

783
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:40,340
Is it related to her shapeshifting?

784
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:46,460
Is there anything else you want to know?

785
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:47,300
No, no.

786
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,200
Have some tea.

787
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:48,630
Here.

788
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:50,630
I've asked everything I want to ask.

789
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:51,550
Have some nuts

790
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:52,450
and candied fruits.

791

let me take you to a place.

00:39:58,420 --> 00:39:59,370
You've found Cao Wenquan?

795
00:39:59,370 --> 00:39:59,830
Not yet.

796
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,110
I’m not interested in other things.

797
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:03,440
It's about Yan Nanxing.

798
