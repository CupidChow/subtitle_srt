Dismissed.

11
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:25,310
My lord,

12
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:26,910
I only heard that Shang Bieli

13
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,570
once worked under Nan Jifeng.

14
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:29,329
I didn't know

15
00:02:29,329 --> 00:02:30,790
they were sworn brothers.

16
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,230
That's not the point.

17
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:33,430
The point is

18
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:36,070
it took Shang Bieli so little time

19
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:37,870
to find out that we went to Heman.

20
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:38,990
That means

21
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:42,170
that batch of Zornia has arrived in the capital,

22
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,079
and

23
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:45,550

24

25
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:48,590
the lord who appeared in Heman

26
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:49,300
was me.

27
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,090
It was indeed fast.

28
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:53,070
I'm afraid His Majesty will soon

29
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:53,750
know it.

30
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,000
They spread the news

31
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,630
because they wanted me to be scolded by His Majesty

32
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,860
so that they could stop my investigation.

33
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:03,540
So,

34
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:05,450
we must find that batch of Zornia

35
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:06,990
and root out their contact in the capital

36
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:09,080
as soon as possible.

37
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:10,630
Only in this way

38
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,650
can we explain to His Majesty.

It's been a while.

53
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,110
How have you been?

54
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:51,890
This batch of Zornia was first transported by ship and then over land.

55
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:52,950
It should be

56
00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:54,870
in the capital by now.

57
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:56,210
Right, my lord.

58
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:57,980
Not long after they took the Zornia out of Heman,

59
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:00,120
they transferred it from the ship to a carriage.

60
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,390
They changed the carriage

61
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:02,550
every time they passed a checkpoint.

62
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:03,900
After arriving at the posthouse outside the capital,

63
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,190
they designed a cover-up

64
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,310
by driving three carriages

65
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,370
into the capital at different times.

66
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:09,550
Our men are trying to find out

67
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:10,740
which carriage they put the Zornia in.

68
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:13,110
Perhaps there's Zornia in all three carriages.

69
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:13,670
My lord,

70
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,730
after we locate the Zornia,

71
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:18,600
shall we seize it and arrest those men immediately?

72
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,910
Don't rush.

73
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,140
I deliberately let them take the Zornia out of Heman

74
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,590
to catch a big fish.

75
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,600
We just need to keep an eye on the bait

76
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:29,990
and see

77
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,550
who'll rise to it.

78
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,870
But the checkpoint through which the Zornia entered the capital

79
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,870
was controlled by the Jinwu Guards.

80
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:37,610
If they had checked it thoroughly,

81
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,390
the Zornia

82
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,310
wouldn't have entered the capital.

83
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,909
Now that it's in the capital,

84
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:42,960
the Jinwu Guards

85
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:44,790
should be the first to be held accountable.

86
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:46,990
At least they're guilty of negligence.

87
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:47,950
I'm afraid

88
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:50,150
the Jinwu Guards will give us a hard time

89
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:51,840
in order to shift the blame.

90
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,430
They've already given us a lot of hard times!

91
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:55,830
What Mr. Fu said is right.

92
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,550
The Jinwu Guards failed to guard the city gate

93
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:00,410
and let Zornia enter the capital.

94
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,430
They

95
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:03,300
can't get away with it.

96
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:04,180
My lord,

97
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:06,830
did Shang Bieli pick a fight here this morning

98
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,510
to give us a hint?

99
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:10,360
My lord,

100
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:12,200
I'm still a little worried.

101
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:13,590
It was a risky move

102
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:15,670
to let them take the Zornia out of Heman.

103
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:17,000
If anything goes wrong,

104
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,110
we'll be guilty

105
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:20,110
of leading others to commit a crime.

106
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:22,440
The jurisdiction given by His Majesty

107
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:24,210
has made others jealous of us.

108
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,550
If we get caught,

109
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,630
it will cause a lot of trouble.

110
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,070
By then,

111
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:30,710
our mistake will be more serious

112
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:32,230
than the Jinwu Guards'.

113
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:38,630
The moment I let the Zornia out of Heman,

114
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:39,950
I knew

115
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,350
I must

116
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:43,670
succeed.

117
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:49,270

118
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,909

-Yes.
-Yes.

Since I started to shapeshift,

122

I've been keeping records.

123

I will find you.

No matter what you look like by then,

129
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,550
I'll accept it.

130
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,080
I'll protect you.

What are you waiting for?

Well,

135
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:53,350
how did you see through my disguise again?

136
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:53,710
My lord,

137
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:55,070
you're so smart.

138
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:56,750
It's not because I'm smart,

139
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,150
but because you didn't pay enough attention to detail.

140
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:58,909
Right.

141
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:00,690
My lord, you're sharp.

142
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:02,810
But how did you

143
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:04,170
see through my disguise this time?

144
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:06,350
Last time, you said it was from my smell.

145
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:07,530
But this time, before I came out,

146
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:08,240
I burned incense,

147
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,230
and I'm wearing a sachet.

148
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:10,550
It can cover my smell.

149
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:13,350
What betrayed you was not your smell

150
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:14,500
but your hand.

151
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:15,800
My hand?

152
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:19,330
What was wrong with my hand?

153
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:20,850
The way you waved your fan

154
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,310
seemed very stiff.

155
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:24,180
Obviously, you don't use fans very often.

156
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:24,870
Besides,

157
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:27,850
although you're dressed like a playboy,

158
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,350
there are calluses on your hand,

159
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,860
which clearly shows you've practiced martial arts

160

I was careless.

165

I'll be more careful next time.

166
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,630
Let's go.

167

You never confuse them?

00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:27,870
got injured.

176
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:29,320
The rest are fine.

177
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:32,950
The pigeons

178
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:33,790
look so alike,

179
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,650
yet you can tell one from another.

180
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,010
How come you can't recognize people?

181
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,970
Because everyone has many faces,

182
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:48,120
and they may change it anytime.

183
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:49,070
That's right.

184
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:50,240
Most people

185
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,060
act in their self-interest.

186
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:53,480
They tend to change their attitude anytime.

187
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,860
The only forthright, sincere person

188
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,430
I've seen over the years

189
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:58,250
is the Poison Girl.

190
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:03,790
Her name is Yan Nanxing.

191
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:05,510
Okay.

192
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:06,590
Yan Nanxing.

193
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:07,950
My lord,

194
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:09,790
haven't you ever thought about

195
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:10,950
looking for Ms. Yan?

196
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:15,510
Where

197
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,160
are you going next?

198
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:21,230
Perhaps

199
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:24,870
I'll go to my mother

200
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:26,480
or

201
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:28,570
somewhere I've never been to.

202
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,060
If...

203
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:33,150
If I run into trouble,

204
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:35,170
I'll go to the capital to find you.

205
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:42,070
She didn't commit a crime.

206
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:43,910
Why should I look for her?

207
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:45,310
My lord,

208
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,520
you know

209
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:47,670
I didn't mean that.

210
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,080
Now that she's gone,

211
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:50,470
aren't you worried about her?

212
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:51,530
Don't you miss her?

213
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:57,910
Have you found out

214
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,370
where the goods from Heman

215
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:00,270
are?

216
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:01,550
My lord,

217
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:04,040
the goods were taken to Fanhou Street.

218
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:05,270
Fanhou Street?

219
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:07,390
The Ghost Market?

220
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:08,190
That's right.

221
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:12,550
No wonder

222
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:14,050
we didn't find any traces.

223
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:17,200
Turns out the Zornia was taken into the Ghost Market.

224
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:20,490
Which store in the market did they take it to?

225
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:22,400
We lost them.

226
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:24,590
You lost them?

227
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:26,830
Don't worry, my lord.

228
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:28,870
The Ghost Market's road network is complex.

229
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:29,470
Our men

230
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:31,110
lost them at the last moment.

231
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,390
The goods must be still in the market.

232
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:34,870
I've sent spies there.

233
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:36,310
If anything happens,

234
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:38,110
they'll report it immediately.

235
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:40,880
They were in such a hurry

236
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:43,890
to transport the Zornia from Heman to the capital.

237
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:44,940
This batch of Zornia won't be kept

238
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,390
in the Ghost Market for long

239
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:48,350
and will soon go to market.

240
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:53,910
It seems

241
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:55,630
the big fish

242
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:57,390
is about to take the bait.

243
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,350
Don't worry, my lord.

244
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:01,010
Our men are watching closely.

245
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:04,310
Didn't you say there were three carriages?

246
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:05,550
What about the other two?

247
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:06,950
We've checked the other two.

248
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:08,270
One was hired by them randomly,

249
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,470
and there was nothing wrong with it.

250
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:11,160
The woman from Heman

251
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:12,610
was sitting in the other carriage.

252
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:14,070
Our men are following her.

253
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:16,070
My lord,

254
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,690
the woman who transported the Zornia from Heman to the capital

255
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:18,790
found out we were after her.

256
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,070
She went to Twelve Music House

257
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:22,470
and are now surrounded by the Jinwu Guards.

258
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:27,280
[Twelve Music House]

259
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:42,310
Move.

260
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:42,710
Make way.

261
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:44,230
Get out of the way.

262
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:45,960
The officers are here.

263
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,390
Yes.

264
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,510
Jiang Xinbai,

265
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,100
I didn't mean to do your job.

266
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:00,910
She came in herself.

267
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,270
I can't let her kill someone

268
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:04,070
under my nose.

269
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:07,520
The Inspection Office will take over now.

270
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:09,940
Please take your Jinwu Guards away.

271
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,550
Do you think we're

272
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:17,020
entertainers at Twelve Music House

273
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:19,120
who come and go

274
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,990
as you wish?

275
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:22,390
Let me go,

276
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:23,550
or

277
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:24,590
I'll cut her neck.

278
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:27,950
Mr. Shang,

279
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:30,470
we can talk about

280
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:32,200
our personal grudge later.

281
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:33,310
Now,

282
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:36,630
please take your Jinwu Guards away.

283
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:38,910
You don't know how to treat girls gently.

284
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:40,630
I'm afraid once you do something,

285
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:41,870
both girls

286
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:43,030
will die.

287
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:12,750
Why did you kill her?

288
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:17,070
I killed the suspect

289
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:18,930
to protect the victim.

290
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:20,290
Was that wrong?

291
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:24,770
You're not convinced?

292
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:27,030
Go impeach me.

293
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,230
Shang Bieli!

294
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:34,870
Jiang Xinbai,

295
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,430
since you came here to arrest the girl yourself,

296
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:38,950
it must be a big case.

297
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:40,230
What a pity!

298
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:42,750
She died.

299
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,370
You must be very upset.

300
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:52,380
Take your time.

301
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:00,500
The suspect attempted to murder a girl.

302
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,680
I had no choice

303
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,760
but to execute her on the spot.

304
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:06,090
Jinwu Guards, leave here.

305
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:07,270
Leave the rest

306
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:09,810
to the Inspection Office.

307
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:11,310
-Yes.
-Yes.

308
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,360
Take her body away first.

309
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,670
Shang Bieli was so cruel.

310
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:38,990
He killed her with a single blow.

311
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:40,870
He didn't give us a chance to ask her anything.

312
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:42,130
Another lead dried up.

313
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:44,530
When we want a lead, there will be one.

314
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,300
Ask the spies in Heman

315
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:48,550
to watch more closely.

316
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:50,240
If anyone suspicious

317
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:51,590
contacts someone in the capital,

318
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:52,670
let me know immediately.

319
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:53,410
Don't worry, my lord.

320
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:54,940
I've arranged everything.

321
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:58,950
Why did she go to Twelve Music House?

322
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:00,350
Did she enter by mistake,

323
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:01,470
or...

324
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,390
You mean

325
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,490
she went to Twelve Music House

326
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,680
to find her partner

327
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:07,620
or contact?

328
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:09,150
Aren't Zornia traders

329
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,410
all desperadoes

330
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,930
or men of sacrifice?

331
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,190
Why would she lead us

332
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:14,630
to her partner?

333
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:17,370
When someone's life is in danger,

334
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:19,590
it's their instinct to seek survival.

335
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:20,230
I see.

336
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:21,650
I'll send some men

337
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:23,030
to keep a close watch on Twelve Music House

338
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,870
and find out who entered or left there

339
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:26,470
in the past four hours.

340
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:28,590
The only way

341
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:30,990
is to lock the Ghost Market down.

342
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:32,410
My lord,

343
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:33,550
the Ghost Market is where minorities from the border

344
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:35,210
and foreign refugees gather.

345
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,410
Criminal cases involving foreigners

346
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:38,350
are handled by the Court of State Ceremonials.

347
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:39,790
The Inspection Office is not in charge of that.

348
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:40,520
Yes, my lord.

349
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,390
If we

350
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,190
barge into the Ghost Market rashly,

351
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:44,310
there might be trouble in the future.

352
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:44,770
My lord,

353
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:46,150
I'll go to the Court of State Ceremonials

354
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:47,410
to apply for a document

355
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,590
in case we need it.

356
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:53,490
The Inspection Office

357
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:55,670
has never been to the Ghost Market for a case.

358
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:57,600
If you apply for a document rashly,

359
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:59,770
I'm afraid our secret will be leaked.

360
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:02,390
I'm going to

361
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:03,910
my grandfather's birthday banquet tonight.

362
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,460
If there's an emergency,

363
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,420
come to Western Suburb Mansion to find me.

364
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,680
Will anything happen?

365
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,990
Just

366
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:11,230
in case.

367
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:17,230
[Western Suburb Mansion]

368
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:19,790
[Yanzhu Hall]

369
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:38,860
[Duchess of Yuejiang, Jiang Suoluo]

370
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:58,860
[Yanzhu Hall]

371
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,270
Xinbai, you're still so arrogant

372
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:11,470
and full of yourself.

373
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:12,990
It's Suoluo,

374
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:14,430
not a female guest.

375
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:16,670
Suoluo.

376
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:21,830
Sorry.

377
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:24,270
I was thinking about something.

378
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:25,870
I didn't look carefully.

379
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,800
It was dark last time.

380
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,080
But we're in broad daylight now.

381
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,500
How do you explain it?

382
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:39,560
Why did you arrive so late, too?

383
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:41,820
The crown prince had a morning class today.

384
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,710
Her Majesty asked me to stay to have a chat.

385
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:44,840
That's why I'm late.

386
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:47,290
What about you?

387
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:50,540
Why are you late?

388
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:54,450
I had work to do at the Inspection Office.

389
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,400
Right.

390
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,670
You never

391
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:01,070
care about socializing

392
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,200
or this family.

393
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:03,570
Grandfather is already very happy

394
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:05,120
that you agreed to come.

395
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:06,580
He won't care

396
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,660
whether you're late or not.

397
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:10,590
What?

398
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:12,560
You are not talking

399
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:14,790
because you don't want

400
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:16,520
to argue with your fake sister?

401
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:18,910
Suoluo,

402
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,080
we have the same mother.

403
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:22,890
What do you mean by "fake"?

404
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:24,830
Don't say this in front of

405
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,230
Mother and Grandfather.

406
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:30,400
You're so considerate towards Mother.

407
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,390
Are you determined

408
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:32,320
to get her title?

409
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,650
Are you interested in the succession,

410
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,590
or are you curious

411
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:39,650
about whether I'll be the successor?

412
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,040
Both.

413
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:46,020
Since Mother can be a princess,

414
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:47,150
why can't I?

415
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:53,420
Will you support me?

416
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:57,590
If I don't,

417
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,160
will you give up?

418
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:02,230
Of course not.

419
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:03,680
On the contrary,

420
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,350
if you support me,

421
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:07,230
I'll be more worried.

422
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:08,870
Because I don't know

423
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:10,350
what you will actually do

424
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:12,600
when you claim to support me.

425
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:17,570
It's getting late.

426
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:18,830
Don't keep Mother

427
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:20,290
and Grandfather waiting.

428
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:22,670
Xinbai.

429
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,260
I won't keep you waiting, too.

430
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:38,760
Nice to meet you.

431
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,350
My lords.

Grandfather.

433
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:45,710
My little granddaughter is here.

434
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:46,880
Let me look at you.

435
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,270
Greetings, Grandfather.

436
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:50,030
Good.

437
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:50,950
Did you miss me?

438
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:51,510
Yes.

439
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:52,670
Grandfather.

440

[Prince of Weiding]

441
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:55,430
Let me look at you.

442
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:57,110
Good.

443
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:00,030
Where is your father?

444
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:04,110
Xinbai,

445
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,190
you're here.

446
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:06,030
Mother.

447
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:07,650
Here's the thing.

448
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:09,190
My father said

449
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:10,630
many big shots

450
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:11,760
would be here today,

451
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,400
so he'd better not come.

452
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:14,910
Nonsense.

453
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:16,910
Your father and mother

454
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:19,070
are officially married.

455
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,780
Who dares to talk?

456
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:23,400
Your father

457
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:24,310
gave me

458
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:26,510
such a clever granddaughter.

459
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:28,070
I value you and your father

460
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:29,390
very much.

461
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:30,410
Ask him

462
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:31,720
to come here a few days later

463
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,760
to drink tea and play chess with me.

464
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:35,990
Okay, Grandfather.

465
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:36,790
Xinbai,

466
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,590
find a chance to propose a toast

467
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:40,670
to your grandfather later.

468
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:43,210
Mother, you know

469
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:44,670
I don't drink.

470
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,050
A little.

471
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,150
Just a little.

472
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,580
We're family after all.

473
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,030
Father,

474
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,350
today is your 70th birthday.

475
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:02,480
I specially prepared

476
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,960
these fancy clothes.

477
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:05,290
Am I beautiful?

478
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,270
Of course.

479
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,780
My daughter

480
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,840
is always beautiful

481
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,110
and elegant.

482
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:14,630
The other day, she went to the palace to drink tea

483
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:16,590
in a gold-threaded dress.

484
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:19,070
Even Her Majesty praised her.

485
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:20,520
Mother,

486
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,910
let me wear the gold-threaded dress

487
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:22,750
someday

488
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,600
so I'll have a glorious moment, too.

489
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,840
You're so sweet.

490
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:26,930
I'll give it to you.

491
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:28,570
Thank you, Mother.

492
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:30,020
Grandfather,

493
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:30,990
Mother said she'll give the dress

494
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:31,830
to me.

495
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,160
Good.

496
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:40,720
Lord Lu, Lord Hu,

497
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:43,270
and Lord Yuan are here.

498
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:45,410
Your Highness, we wish you

499
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:47,240
happiness

500
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:48,750
and good health.

501
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:50,750
Thank you.

502
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:53,910
Your Highness, I knew you liked calligraphy works and paintings,

503
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:54,710
so

504
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:56,900
I went to Qiuci

505
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,920
[Assistant Minister of Rites, Lu Dingzhao]

506
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:59,000
to find this Flying Fairy painting

507
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,390
for you.

508
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:02,710
Thank you.

509
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:03,750
Thank you.

510
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:08,510
Suoluo.

511
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:09,890
This is Lord Lu,

512
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:12,790
who just got promoted from Assistant Imperial Censor

513
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:16,030
to Assistant Minister of Rites.

514
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:18,820
He is Lord Lu,

515
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:20,310
who handled my father's case

516
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:21,840
and sentenced him to exile.

517
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:22,500
Lord Lu,

518
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:24,630
it's a pleasure to meet you.

519
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:28,400
Your Grace, you're so kind.

520
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:30,630
You just started your political career.

521
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:31,830
If you need me

522
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:32,790
in the future,

523
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:34,060
just let me know.

524
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:38,450
You just started your political career?

525
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:49,180
Mother,

526
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,160
Grandfather,

527
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:52,080
I didn't have time to tell you.

528
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:54,310
Today, I've asked for His Majesty

529
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:56,190
and Her Majesty's permission to resign.

530
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:57,310
Starting next month,

531
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,270
I'll stop teaching

532
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,510
the crown prince.

533
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,720
His Majesty has allowed me

534
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:03,750
to transfer to the Imperial Academy

535
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:04,680
as a chancellor.

536
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,300
Chancellor? That's amazing. Right.

537
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:11,390
Although being the crown prince's teacher is an honor,

538
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:12,710
a chancellor at the Imperial Academy

539
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:14,110
is an official position.

540
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:15,920
I've studied hard for years.

541
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,720
I want to put my knowledge into use

542
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,000
to serve the court

543
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,920
and share my mother's burden.

544
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,550
Good.

545
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:24,190
Great!

546
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,920
This is the best gift

547
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:27,190
I've received today.

548
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:31,240
Every girl of the Jiang family

549
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:33,630
is a heroine.

550
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,190
My daughter

551
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:37,070
is the first princess

552
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:38,270
in this dynasty.

553
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:40,160
My granddaughter

554
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:41,430
is the first female chancellor

555
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:43,350
in this dynasty.

556
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:49,630
This shows His Majesty's wisdom and good judgment.

557
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:51,550
He strives for gender equality

558
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:52,790
and offers a position to anyone with talent.

559
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:54,960
His open-mindedness

560
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:57,480
is a blessing to the country.

561
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:58,070
Yes.

562
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:00,510
It's a blessing to the country.

563
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:02,260
It's a blessing to the country.

564
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:07,430
Mother.

565
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:08,430
Grandfather.

566
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:10,880
There's a report from the Inspection Office.

567
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,430
I need to deal with it at the gate.

568
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:13,490
I'll be right back.

569
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:26,030
My lord,

570
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:26,990
I just got

571
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:28,050
an important clue.

572
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,270
Previously, Zornia in the capital

573
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:31,550
was distributed on the 15th of every month.

574
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:32,190
The 15th?

575
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:33,790
It's today.

576
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,470
Is the news reliable?

577
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:37,950
Yes.

578
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,270
Just now, our spies reported

579
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:40,830
that they saw someone suspicious in the Ghost Market

580
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,550
who was probably there to pick up the goods.

581
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:43,590
I'll go in and say goodbye.

582
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:44,590
Wait for me here.

583
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:45,350
Yes.

584
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:48,830
Mother.

585
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:50,360
Where are you going?

586
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:51,590
I...

587
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:00,720
It seems

588
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:03,030
you're leaving early again.

589
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,590
But today is your grandfather's

590
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:09,470
birthday.

591
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:11,710
It's inappropriate to leave early.

592
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,550
I let a batch of Zornia

593
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:21,720
out of Heman.

594
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:23,760
Now it has entered the capital.

595
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:27,090
So serious?

596
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,230
It has entered

597
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:31,350
the Ghost Market.

598
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,160
So, I can't let it

599
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:34,150
get out of the Ghost Market.

600
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:34,810
Otherwise,

601
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:36,870
what I did will be unforgivable.

602
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:38,470
So,

603
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:40,000
even if

604
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:41,550
I offend Grandfather today,

605
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:42,830
I have to leave.

606
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:44,470
The Ghost Market?

607
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:45,910
Report.

608
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:48,100
The commander-in-chief of the Jinwu Guards,

609
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,410
Shang Bieli, is here.

610
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:52,770
Wait for me here.

611
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:53,290
Yes.

612
00:26:59,070 --> 00:26:59,930
Your Highness.

613
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,350
Mr. Shang.

614
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:03,120
I didn't expect you

615
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:04,230
to come here today.

616
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:05,820
I thought the Jinwu Guards

617
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:07,380
were rushed off their feet.

618
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,020
Your Highness.

619
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:11,450
The duchess and I have known each other for years,

620
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:12,580
so I came uninvited.

621
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:13,970
Please forgive me.

622
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:16,470
That just means you're a man who follows his heart.

623
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:17,330
Please come in.

624
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:19,750
Mr. Jiang...

625
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:21,670
No.

626
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:23,680
You're a duke today.

627
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:27,310
It's rare for us to meet in private.

628
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:29,160
I have some doubts.

629
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:31,130
May I ask you a few questions?

630
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:36,230
Sure.

631
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:37,870
It's rare for us to meet.

632
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:39,330
We should have a good chat.

633
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:40,190
But

634
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:41,980
I want to take you

635
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:43,580
to see my grandfather first.

636
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:53,510
Grandfather.

637
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,430
I brought Mr. Shang here

638
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:57,030
to wish you a happy birthday.

639
00:27:57,910 --> 00:27:58,870
Mr. Shang.

640
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:00,370
Your Highness,

641
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:02,510
I've prepared some gifts for you.

642
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:03,320
I wish you

643
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:04,750
happiness, good health,

644
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:05,670
and longevity.

645
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:07,750
Thank you, Mr. Shang.

646
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:13,800
This jade Ruyi scepter is from the state in the south.

647
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:17,210
It came to our country through Heman.

648
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:19,880
The quality is rare.

649
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:21,150
I hope you like it.

650
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:22,270
Good.

651
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:24,430
Grandfather,

652
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:26,400
there's one more thing.

653
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,040
The Jinwu Guards

654
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:29,390
are on patrol tonight.

655
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:31,030
They are short-handed.

656
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:31,790
So,

657
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:32,930
Mr. Shang

658
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:34,660
came here to ask for my help.

659
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:36,870
I need to go back to the Inspection Office now

660
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:38,530
and send some men to Mr. Shang.

661
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,830
Grandfather, please allow me to go.

662
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:41,710
-I…
-Mr. Shang.

663
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:43,070
Never mind.

664
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:45,690
My grandfather is a sensible man.

665
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:47,970
He won't blame you for taking me away.

666
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:50,710
Mr. Shang, turns out

667
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:51,830
you didn't come here

668
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:53,470
to celebrate my birthday.

669
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:54,770
Well, I…

670
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:56,190
Mr. Shang and Xinbai

671
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:57,270
are both working for the court

672
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:58,470
and the people.

673
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,940
Business comes first

674
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,270
rather than private matters.

675
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:02,310
It doesn't matter.

676
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:03,570
Go do your thing.

677
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:06,830
Then Mr. Shang and I

678
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:08,060
shall take our leave.

679
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:08,790
Go.

680
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:11,680
Your Highness.

681
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:12,590
I...

682
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:21,270
You wanted the old prince to think

683
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:22,400
I'm rude, right?

684
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:24,830
Everyone in the capital knows

685
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:26,240
you're a lunatic.

686
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:27,790
So what

687
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,580
if my grandfather thinks you're rude?

688
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,590
Your spies have been busy these days.

689
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:33,590
They even entered the Ghost Market.

690
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:35,430
Mr. Jiang,

691
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:37,270
what are you looking for?

692
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:41,640
Is it because the Jinwu Guards are well-informed,

693
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,040
or is it because you're keeping an eye on me?

694
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:46,370
What a bad memory you have!

695
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:49,310
You forgot what you owe me?

696
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:52,190
So, I will pay much attention

697
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:55,490
to everything related to the Inspection Office.

698
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:56,010
My lord.

699
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:01,740
I have something urgent to do.

700
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:03,450
Let's talk next time.

701
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:33,030
Bravo!

702
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:35,630
Bravo!

703
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:37,470
Knick-knacks and small pendants.

704
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:38,400
Come take a look.

705
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:39,550
Sachets.

706
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:40,830
Look at the sachets.

707
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:41,560
Hello, Miss.

708
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:45,270
Nv'er hong.

709
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:48,510
Bravo!

710
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:51,110
Miss, do you want a steamed stuffed bun?

711
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:57,470
Here are your dishes.

712
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,180
Take care.

713
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:03,270
Don't miss it.

714
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:05,370
Eat and drink to warm up your stomach.

715
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:08,870
Miss.

716
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:11,350
Although the restaurant is small, there's everything you want.

717
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:12,610
What do you want to eat?

718
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:19,110
Let's go.

719
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:21,960
Please sit down.

720
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:24,310
Do you want to have a meal

721
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,310
or get a room?

722
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:27,030
I'd like a cup of hot tea first

723
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:28,190
to relieve my fatigue.

724
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:29,750
Then, fill the table

725
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:30,700
with delicious food.

726
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:31,190
Okay.

727
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:33,970
Fill the table?

728
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:36,270
Are you eating alone?

729
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:38,640
Are you looking down on me?

730
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,420
I'm afraid you can't finish all the food.

731
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:44,090
The dishes will be ready soon.

732
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:02,120
Miss, you have a good appetite.

733
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:04,430
Have some soup.

734
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:05,950
Young man,

735
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:08,300
I like the food here.

736
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:10,750
I'll stay here for a few more days

737
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:12,050
for the food.

738
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:13,400
Get me a room

739
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:14,430
for two days.

740
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:15,450
Okay.

741
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:16,750
I'll arrange it now.

742
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:17,570
Wait.

743
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:20,110
Since this restaurant

744
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:21,750
is located in the capital

745
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:23,600
and packed with customers,

746
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,680
you must have seen a lot.

747
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:27,480
You look smart

748
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:28,870
and nice.

749
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:31,390
May I

750
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:33,550
ask you something?

751
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,700
Is now a good time?

752
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,240
You want to ask me something?

753
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:39,750
Now is not a good time.

754
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,670
What a pity!

755
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:47,150
Now is not a good time?

756
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:49,280
It is a good time.

757
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,110
Just ask.

758
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:52,070
I'll tell you

759
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:53,330
everything I know.

760
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:54,790
Here's the thing.

761
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:56,390
The Ghost Market?

762
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:57,580
Is it haunted?

763
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:01,690
The Ghost Market is located in Fanhou District.

764
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:02,930
There are many refugees from outside the capital.

765
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:04,970
All sorts of people gather there.

766
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,560
It's not regulated by the law of the capital.

767
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:10,790
Young man, you know a lot.

768
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:13,390
Tell me more.

769
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:15,770
As the saying goes,

770
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:17,390
both thieves and officials

771
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:19,320
have their own way of doing things.

772
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:20,230
Many shady trades

773
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:21,940
take place in the Ghost Market,

774
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,910
including the trading of information.

775
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:25,610
If you want to ask for information,

776
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:27,330
the best place in the capital

777
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:28,880
is the Ghost Market.

778

Who should I go to?

00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,500
What's the man's name?

780
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:36,190
It's on the tip of my tongue.

781
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:37,990
I can't remember. His name is...

782

It's on the tip of my tongue. I can't remember...

What's his name?

to do accounts.

796

You are the only slave who got admitted

Mr. Cao, I'm flattered.

But some items in the account book

802

don't match the actual goods.

is the account for yesterday.

Yesterday?

808
00:34:51,810 --> 00:34:52,840
It should be tea.

We don't know what she's up to.

871
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:35,630
Their contact code today is

872
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:36,830
"There's a full moon tonight."

873
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:37,710
Besides the contact code,

874
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:38,790
the receiver and the holder

875
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:40,190
each have a special token,

876
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:43,790
which will be combined into one piece to confirm their identity.

877
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:49,110
If any new faces

878
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:50,830
come here after me,

879
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:52,000
keep an eye on them as well.

880
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,210
Okay. Enjoy your tea.

881
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:01,780
My lord,

882
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:03,500
the woman is paying her full attention

883
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:04,580
to the dancer.

884
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:06,980
If she's here to pick up the goods,

885
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:09,110
she should be looking for her contact.

886
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:11,230
Not only isn't she looking for her contact,

887
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:12,090
but she might be

888
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,040
betting on how many spins the dancer can do.

889
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:17,180
You can even guess that?

890
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:20,700
I didn't guess.

891
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:23,110
Look at the drummer

892
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:24,420
next to her.

893
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:28,990
784.

894
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:33,110
You're amazing!

895
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,310
Let's go down and have a look.

896
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:38,870
My lord,

897
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:40,670
we've been followed all the way here.

898
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:41,390
Shall we...

899
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:42,800
Shake her off.

900
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:57,980
Why did Jiang Xinbai come to the Ghost Market?

901
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:00,370
Let me see

902
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:02,110
what you're up to.

903
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:05,520
Do you like this?

904
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:17,670
I haven't found

905
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:18,790
any pawnshops.

906
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:20,830
No branches.

907
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:22,480
Is it so hard to find?

908
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:36,810
[Twelve Music House]

909
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:45,740
Stop it.

910
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,960
I don't want to listen to any music

911
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,420
or watch any dances today.

912
00:40:59,070 --> 00:40:59,670
Mr. Shang.

913
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:02,030
Mr. Jiang has entered the Ghost Market.

914
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:04,330
Let's wait.

915
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,020
Only after Jiang Xinbai sets a "fire"

916
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:09,990
can we go there to put it out

917
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:12,230
and

918
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:15,230
catch the "arsonist."
