5
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:51,729
Father,

6
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:54,210
let me propose a toast to you.

7
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:56,200
I hope everything goes as you wish.

8
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,020
Everything goes as I wish?

9
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,400
You'd better control

10
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:07,550
your son.

11
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,460
Where did Xinbai go?

12
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,920
He purposely made Shang Bieli

13
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,150
put on an act for me.

14
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,590
Can these small tricks

15
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,590
fool me?

16
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:20,990
Didn't Xinbai say

17
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:22,930
he has something important to do?

18
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:24,910
Father,

19
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,110
don't be mad at him.

20
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:28,550
Daughter,

21
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:31,070
you might not know.

22
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:32,390
A few days ago,

23
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,990
His Majesty summoned me to the Imperial Study.

24
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:39,260
He mentioned the succession

25
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,829
of the Yuejiang's Residence.

26
00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:41,670
Succession?

27
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,310
I'm still alive and well.

28
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,920
What is His Majesty worried about?

29
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,920
Don't be willful.

30
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:49,450
You know the Yuejiang lineage

31
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,780
is the only noble family

32
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,840
in the capital with another surname.

33
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:53,530
His Majesty

34
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:54,750
pays special attention

35
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,810
to the successor of the Jiang family.

36
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:57,690
Suoluo

37
00:02:57,829 --> 00:02:59,550
is the crown prince's teacher.

38
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:01,430
She's close to the empress.

39
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:03,990
With the empress's input,

40
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,630
His Majesty's opinion

41
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:07,130
changed.

42
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,190
He wants Suoluo

43
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:10,790
to inherit the title.

44
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,390
What do you think?

45
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:16,840
Since I let my daughter take the title,

46
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,320
I'm naturally not against

47
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,870
letting my granddaughter take it either.

48
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:20,310
Father!

49
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,110
I know

50
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:22,870
you've always felt

51
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:24,470
pity and indebtedness

52
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,270
toward Xinbai all these years

53
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,910
and want him to inherit the title,

54
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:28,590
but

55
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:31,040
he's too similar to his father.

56
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:33,980
Zhaoming was a criminal after all.

57
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,160
Xinbai being like Zhaoming

58
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:37,470
is not a good thing

59
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:39,630
for His Majesty.

60
00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:51,710
You look skinny,

61
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,110
but you're quite strong.

62
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,230
I do hard labor.

63
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:55,310
Be careful.

64
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:55,790
Okay.

65
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,070
He's not in a hurry to leave

66
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,660
after delivering the vegetables.

67
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,930
Is he suspicious?

68
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,150
We'll know

69
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,650
after investigating.

70
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:14,330
My lord,

71
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:16,320
there is still a woman left.

72
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:17,790
Is it possible that she is

73
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:20,050
the vegetable deliverer's accomplice?

74
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,320
Where is she now?

75
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:23,950
Bravo! Bravo!

76
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:24,550
One more!

77
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:26,160
Bravo! Bravo!

78
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,040
One more!

79
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:30,110
Bravo! Bravo!

80
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:34,800
What a big pancake.

81
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:35,830
Boss,

82
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,330
I want the biggest one.

83
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:38,830
One hundred coppers.

84
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:40,110
One hundred coppers?

85
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:42,870
That is too expensive.

86
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,470
Forget it. I don't want it anymore.

87
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:47,470
You must buy it after pointing at it.

88
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,060
I must buy it after pointing at it?

89
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:49,950
Why?

90
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:51,990
You're extorting money.

91
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:56,880
You're right.

92
00:04:56,909 --> 00:04:58,120
I'm extorting you,

93
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,670
because I haven't sold anything yet today.

94
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:01,870
What does your poor business

95
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:02,950
have to do with me?

96
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,030
I won't buy it.

97
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,390
Are you buying or not?

98
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:17,750
I'll buy it.

99
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:19,790
I happen to be hungry.

100
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:22,080
This is cheap. It's ten coppers.

101
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:23,070
Ten coppers?

102
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:24,600
It's a good price.

103
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,430
Ten coppers is great.

104
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:27,830
Here, Boss.

105
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:32,680
By the way, Boss,

106
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,940
I want to ask you something.

107
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:36,670
It's said that the Ghost Market

108
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,190
has a pawnbroker named Mr. Cao,

109
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:40,120
but I walked down the entire street

110
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,050
and didn't see any pawnshops.

111
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,310
Everyone in the Ghost Market

112
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,909
knows Mr. Cao.

113
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,070
His shop

114
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,720
doesn't need any signs.

115
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,150
Then how can I find it?

116
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:50,630
Give me ten more coppers.

117
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:52,150
Alright.

118
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:53,500
Ten coppers

119
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,670
is no big deal.

120
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:55,110
Here.

121
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:57,800
It's across the street.

122
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:03,550
That one?

123
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:05,800
It's just a few steps

124
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,680
and you charged me ten coppers?

125
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,350
You're purposely scamming me.

126
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,380
Your shop is a scam!

127
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:11,710
I—

128
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,700
Did he scam you?

129
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:20,670
No.

130
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:22,230
Of course not.

131
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:23,760
I was just kidding

132
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:25,360
to liven up the atmosphere.

133
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:26,780
Everyone,

134
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,270
this shop has great prices.

135
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,150
Come and buy.

136
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:30,830
Go on with your work.

137
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:31,990
Go ahead with your work.

138
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:32,550
Go ahead.

139
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:33,150
Go ahead.

140
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:33,810
It's great.

141
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:34,770
Go ahead with your work.

142
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,300
You don't have to see me off.

143
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:43,420
It's a full moon today.

144
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:44,450
The code?

145
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:46,510
I'll make it quick.

146
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:47,240
You're here.

147
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,030
You're quite early.

148
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:50,310
Are you

149
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:51,850
Mr. Cao?

150
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,070
Yes.

151
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,220
You knew I was coming?

152
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:56,690
I've been waiting for you.

153
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:57,870
Mr. Cao

154
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,740
is indeed a trader of information.

155
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,350
He really is all-knowing.

156
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:09,110
This tea...

157
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:10,590
is free, right?

158
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:11,650
You must be joking.

159
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:12,330
Be my guest.

160
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:27,540
The verbal code is "it's a full moon tonight,"

161
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:29,810
but she said, "it's a full moon today.".

162
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:30,630
I'm thirsty.

163
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:31,470
The signal code

164
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:33,070
is to take one sip of each cup,

165
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:34,450
but she drank it all.

166
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:36,900
Why is the contact person chosen this time

167
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,310
so careless?

168
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,030
Miss,

169
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:41,590
where do you come from

170
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,970
and where are you going?

171
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:44,390
I’m from Heman.

172
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,510
Why do you care about where I'm going?

173
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:47,350
Here's the thing.

174
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:48,700
I have something urgent today.

175
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,860
Let's make it quick.

176
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:50,830
Great.

177
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,040

00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:45,190
is right beside you.

355
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,390
Beside me?

356
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:48,800
He's in the capital too?

357
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,650
Heaven's secret must not be revealed.

358
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:57,200
What I mean

359
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,150
is that when he should come,

360
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,790
he will come back to you.

361
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:02,470
I...

362
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:03,890
I have another question.

363
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:04,430
That is,

364
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,030
I was cursed

365
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:06,850
and poisoned.

366
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:07,800
What should I do?

367
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:09,080
Get married.

368
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:11,110
Marriage will cure all illnesses.

369
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:12,510
Go get married, my child.

370
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:13,310
But I've

371
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:14,330
already gotten married

372
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:15,590
and even got divorced.

373
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:17,070
Then get married again.

374
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:18,490
You weren't sincere in your last marriage.

375
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:20,220
You even know I wasn't sincere?

376
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:20,950
Psychic,

377
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:21,960
I have another question.

378
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,380
Psychic—

379
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:22,950
Sis,

380
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:24,350
hurry.

381
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,430
Watch the shop for me.

382
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:26,270
I can't stand it anymore.

383
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,600
I'm going to the toilet.

384
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,140
Give me the token

385
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,960
and I'll spare your life.

386
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:11,270
Stop!

387
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,430
This...

388
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:22,720
He's dead.

389
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,470
Cut him open

390
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:30,810
and take out the token.

391
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:31,470
-Yes.
-Yes.

392
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:47,720
My lord.

393
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,540
The inventory holder doesn't know

394
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,940
that the contact is dead.

395
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:04,550
I don't think he's ready yet.

396
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,200
Seal off the Ghost Market immediately.

397
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,200
To ensure safety,

398
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:09,080
they always carry their token.

399
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,380
As long as we find the other half,

400
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,540
we can find the holder

401
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,720
and Zornia.

402
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:16,710
Got it.

403
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:29,130
[Persian Fortune Teller]

404
00:18:58,630 --> 00:18:59,510
You are

405
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:01,470
the Persian psychic?

406
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,310
My child,

407
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:08,130
what are you looking for?

408
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:10,790
What fortune telling can you do?

409
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:12,270
Everything.

410
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:15,140
Okay.

411
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:16,040
Then tell me

412
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,110
if I can get what I want.

413
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:24,000
I asked the deity.

414
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,430
The deity told me

415
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,370
that it depends on your sincerity.

416
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,600
I'm rich!

417
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:38,850
The Ghost Market is a great place.

418
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,880
I asked the deity.

419
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:43,830
The deity told me

420
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:45,830
your wish will come true

421
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,140
as long as you get married.

422
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,820
Just get married.

423
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,920
Must I get married?

424
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:53,480
You must.

425
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:56,350
Is there a way without getting married?

426
00:19:57,870 --> 00:19:59,400
If you don't get married...

427
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,300
My child,

428
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:03,670
I can tell you're the best of the best.

429
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:05,250
Whatever you want,

430
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:07,140
your family will give it to you.

431
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:08,230
Family?

432
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:11,050
Then you're wrong.

433
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,910
My brother

434
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:15,410
has always been doted on by my mother,

435
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:17,190
but he never helps me.

436
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:18,790
There must be some misunderstanding

437
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:20,450
between you and your brother.

438
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:21,810
You're siblings.

439
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:23,870
Just resolve the misunderstanding.

440
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:24,540
Really?

441
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,430
Why do I think

442
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:28,290
he never cares about me?

443
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,020
Maybe there's some misunderstanding.

444
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:31,620
Besides,

445
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,320
blood is thicker than water.

446
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:38,300
Blood is thicker than water.

447
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:39,460
The deity will help

448
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:41,480
resolve any misunderstanding you have.

449
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,610
You're not Persian.

450
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:44,110
You are a liar.

451
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:47,550
Who said I'm a liar?

452
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:49,200
Who told you that a Persian psychic

453
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,530
must be Persian?

454
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:52,670
The streets are sealed off.

455
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:53,550
Seal the street—

456
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:55,010
She's not Persian either.

457
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,260
Then who is she?

458
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:57,870
Sis,

459
00:20:58,150 --> 00:20:59,390
you're doing well.

460
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:01,480
Go on.

461
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,900
I have to go home to take care of my child.

462
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,040
What do you mean they sealed off the streets?

463
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,630
Your wish will come true.

464
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:08,400
Why are the streets sealed?

465
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:10,740
Seal the streets?

466
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,550
It's almost the day of my shapeshifting.

467
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:13,950
If I shapeshift tonight,

468
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,180
they'll think I'm a monster and kill me.

469
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:16,830
No, no.

470
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,810
I'm leaving too.

471
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:19,890
Well...

472
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:20,850
You can have it back.

473
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:22,450
Get along with your brother.

474
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:37,150
You all bully us.

475
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:37,990
Excuse me.

476
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:40,150
Excuse me.

477
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:42,190
Excuse—

478
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:43,710
The Inspection Office is investigating a case.

479
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:45,060
No one is allowed to enter or exit the Ghost Market.

480
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:46,940
Wait on the street for the inspection.

481
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:47,580
Sir,

482
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:49,070
I have something urgent.

483
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:49,870
My house caught on fire.

484
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:51,270
I need to put out the fire.

485
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:51,910
Can you

486
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:52,660
see if you can

487
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,670
make an exception for me?

488
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:54,190
Move.

489
00:21:58,430 --> 00:21:59,540
Don't be so mean.

490
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,260
I know your boss.

491
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:04,270
Stay where you are.

492
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:07,080
Otherwise, you'll be punished as an accomplice.

493
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:12,330
What happened?

494
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:14,180
The Inspection Office is working.

495
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,070
Open your eyes

496
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:16,130
and look at who I am.

497
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:16,800
Duchess.

498
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:18,170
Where is Jiang Xinbai?

499
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:18,780
Duchess?

500
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:21,710
Mr. Jiang is working on a case in the back street.

501
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:26,010
She called him by his name.

502
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:28,460
It seems that they are quite close.

503
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:31,460
Let us out!

504
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,510
Let us out!

505
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:33,110
Shut up!

506
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:34,030
Everyone, shut up

507
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:35,630
and wait for the inspection.

508
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:36,630
Shut up!

509
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:37,670
I want to get out!

510
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:38,310
Shut up!

511
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:39,440
Back off!

512
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:40,430
Stop pushing!

513
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:43,830
What right do you have to seal our shops?

514
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:45,270
Do you know where this is?

515
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:48,060
The Inspection Office is investigating a case.

516
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:50,120
All shops in Fanhou Street

517
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:51,860
must be closed for investigation.

518
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:52,990
If you don't cooperate,

519
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:54,650
don't blame us for being rude.

520
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,550
I don't care where you are from.

521
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,430
Fanhou Street's problems

522
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,470
have always been solved by ourselves.

523
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:01,590
Who do you think you are?

524
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:02,070
Go!

525
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:05,020
How dare you!

526
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,320
I am Cao Wenquan.

527
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:18,270
Because the men of Fanhou Street

528
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:19,270
support me,

529
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:23,090
they recommended me to be the speaker of the Ghost Market.

530
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:24,550
Tell your person in charge

531
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:25,300
to come out.

532
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:27,110
The speaker, right?

533
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:30,280
Let's see what you're capable of.

534
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:32,630
Wait.

535
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:40,540
I'm the director of the Inspection Office,

536
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,470
Jiang Xinbai.

537
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:43,310
Mr. Jiang,

538
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,830
you haven't come to Fanhou Street before.

539
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,280
Besides the Ghost Market,

540
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:50,110
Fanhou Street has another name.

541
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:52,550
It's called the Self-Managed Street,

542
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:54,990
because no matter what

543
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:56,230
happens here...

544
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:58,190
We don't need officials.

545
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:02,970
You want to discuss the rules?

546
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:07,830
The rule of the Inspection Office

547
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,840
is to prioritize case-solving.

548
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,240
We're dealing with an important case today.

549
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,500
It concerns the safety

550
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,830
and welfare of everyone in Fanhou Street.

551
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:17,790
If anyone

552
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,420
refuses to cooperate...

553
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:25,590
Yes,

554
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:28,130
you have power and authority.

555
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:29,670
Us civilians don't dare to

556
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:30,780
offend you,

557
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:32,280
unless you have

558
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:36,200
a notice from the Court of State Ceremonials.

559
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:42,580
Mr. Cao,

560
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:45,250
I'm afraid you don't know.

561
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:46,640
The Inspection Office

562
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,480
-works directly under His Majesty.
-Excuse me.

563
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,430
If I arrest you,

564
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:51,890
it's because you disobeyed my order.

565
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:54,150
It's your fault if you get hurt or killed.

566
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:55,220
But...

567
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:57,990
if someone obstructs the investigation

568
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:59,190
and injures a constable,

569
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:00,920
it'll be the crime of assaulting an official,

570
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,810
or even

571
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:03,830
viewed as treason.

572
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,960
At the very least, you'll be caned to death.

573
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,870
At worst,

574
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:09,650
nine generations will be exterminated.

575
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:13,760
Mr. Jiang, what great authority you have!

576
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:34,520
In the Ghost Market,

577
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:35,990
there are many fighters.

578
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,320
If a fight really breaks out,

579
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:40,190
neither side will win easily.

580
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:42,050
How about this?

581
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:44,690
The Jinwu Guards will be the middleman.

582
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,640
Please each take a step back.

583
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:48,910
What or who are you

584
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:50,030
looking for?

585
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,280
Let me help you.

586
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:53,830
Commander Shang,

587
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:55,700
are you afraid

588
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,190
that I'll find something today

589
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:58,430
that is bad for you?

590
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:03,150
Jinwu Guards, attention!

591
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:03,790
Yes.

592
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,610
The duty of the Jinwu Guards

593
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,950
is to protect the people of the capital,

594
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:10,620
whether they're native or foreign.

595
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:11,490
If anyone

596
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:12,850
hurts the people,

597
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:14,390
we will hurt them,

598
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,230
understand?

599
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:16,260
Yes.

600
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,180
Wait.

601
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:31,160
Suoluo.

602
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,180
You're still here?

603
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:35,920
Brother,

604
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:37,310
Mr. Shang,

605
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:38,740
can I say something?

606
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:43,110
The Inspection Office and Jinwu Guards

607
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:44,350
both work for the court.

608
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:45,480
You are not enemies.

609
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:48,050
Why don’t both sides take a step back?

610
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:57,220
She’s Jiang Xinbai’s sister?

611
00:26:58,270 --> 00:26:59,000
I shouldn’t have

612
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,330
defended that bastard.

613
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,990
You do need the Court of State Ceremonials' notice

614
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:04,520
to search the Ghost Market.

615
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:05,810
Why don't you send someone

616
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:06,940
to go get the notice?

617
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:08,550
Since the Inspection Office needs to search

618
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:09,960
for the case's investigation,

619
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,340
the Jinwu Guards should cooperate

620
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,340
to maintain order

621
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:14,450
and avoid disturbing the civilians.

622
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:15,190
But the Ghost Market

623
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:15,870
will be closed

624
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:16,710
in two hours.

625
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:18,770
If the Inspection Office

626
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,870
can find the spoils

627
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:20,890
within two hours,

628
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,400
it's naturally an accomplishment.

629
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,130
But if you can't find anything,

630
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:25,380
the Inspection Office

631
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,480
must give the Ghost Market an explanation.

632
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,280
Otherwise,

633
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:30,120
even if Commander Shang doesn’t report you,

634
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,630
the Court of State Ceremonials will still report you

635
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:32,490
to His Majesty.

636
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:35,580
Xinbai, are you sure you want to search?

637
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:42,350
I have no objections.

638
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:53,050
Ask the registrar of the Court of State Ceremonials to come.

639
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:54,590
We don't have much time. Search the place.

640
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:55,190
Yes.

641
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:00,630
How can I do business?

642
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,630
Search carefully.

643
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:16,550
Yes.

644
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:18,470
Move! Move!

645
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:19,550
Move! Move!

646
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:21,750
Get up!

647
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:24,190
Move! Move!

648
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:25,070
Step aside.

649
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:26,580
Move.

650
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,390
This way.

651
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:32,940
What's in your pocket?

652
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,290
These are just clothes.

653
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:35,840
How about this?

654
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:41,940
Alright.

655
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:44,090
Thank you, Officer.

656
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,060
Commander Shang,

657
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,550
are you going to let

658
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:54,670
Jiang have his way?

659
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:56,470
Don't forget

660
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:58,210
we are on the same side.

661
00:28:58,870 --> 00:28:59,870
Do you want to die?

662
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:01,850
Who's on your side?

663
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:03,930
You're not qualified.

664
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:06,080
Say what you should.

665
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:07,770
Don't talk nonsense.

666
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:08,890
My lord.

667
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:10,590
My lord,

668
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:12,410
there's a small issue.

669
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:13,550
Men can be searched,

670
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:14,420
but how

671
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,350
should we search the women?

672
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:25,150
You may leave.

673
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:25,910
Yes.

674
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:35,720
Suoluo,

675
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:38,530
I want to ask you

676
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:39,680
to do me a favor.

677
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:42,290
Xinbai,

678
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:44,240
you actually need my help for once?

679
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,780
The constables are all men.

680
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:50,670
They can't search the women.

681
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:51,510
Help me.

682
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:54,610
What are you looking for?

683
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:07,470
I need to find

684
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:09,030
the other half of this token as soon as possible.

685
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:09,630
Other than

686
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:11,320
the Inspection Office,

687
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:12,990
only you know about this.

688
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:14,870
Xinbai,

689
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:16,130
are you begging me?

690
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:19,070
Suoluo,

691
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:21,000
now is not the time to be willful.

692
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,800
Mr. Jiang,

693
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:23,530
is this how you ask for help?

694
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:29,190
Fine.

695
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:31,290
I beg you.

696
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:36,010
What's in it for me to help you?

697
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:38,080
What do you want?

698
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:41,450
I haven't decided yet,

699
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,120
but I want you to promise me

700
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:46,350
to do something for me in the future.

701
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:47,790
Can you promise that?

702
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:50,630
As long as it doesn't violate my principles,

703
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:51,430
I promise you.

704
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,760
I love to see you

705
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:57,580
lower yourself and ask for help.

706
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:02,900
It's easier on the eyes.

707
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:16,900
Next.

708
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:36,880
You're a doctor.

709
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:40,710
So she's also a female doctor.

710
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,000
No wonder the smell of medicine is so familiar.

711
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:45,260
♫I'll fetch you the moon in my heart♫

712
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:47,540
♫I dream of the courtyard♫

713
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:47,700
Turn around.

714
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:50,720
♫It knows my heart♫

715
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:53,650
♫I want to return triumphantly with you♫

716
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:55,750
♫We can listen to the rain♫

717
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,730
♫And watch the snowfall in the west hills♫

718
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:02,180
♫We meet with our hearts♫

719
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:02,470
Next.

720
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,640
♫Let's not miss each other♫

721
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:08,910
♫I'll grow old for you♫

722
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,150
♫I want this flower to bloom and never wilt♫

723
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:13,740
♫And that's all I need for the rest of my life♫

724
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:17,790
♫Promise me you'll fall in love with me♫

725
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,110
♫And never break your promise♫

726
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:25,660
My lord,

727
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,110
we've searched everyone outside

728
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:28,170
but found nothing.

729
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:31,200
Only these people haven't been searched.

730
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:35,990
Excuse me.

731
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:37,370
Excuse me.

732
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,710
Excuse me.

733
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:44,270
What?

734
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:47,030
You want to search me too?

735
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:49,950
Why can't you be searched?

736
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:52,550
Move.

737
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:55,500
Don't get in the lord's way.

738
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:57,950
Fine, search me.

739
00:32:58,830 --> 00:32:59,310
Search.

740
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:00,190
Yes.

741
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:18,030
My lord,

742
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,320
there's only a wallet.

743
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:20,900
Keep searching.

744
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:33,580
Leave.

745
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:34,310
Yes.

746
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:43,860
Mr. Jiang,

747
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:45,390
you've

748
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:46,970
searched everywhere.

749
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,650
It's already three in the morning.

750
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:50,580
The Ghost Market

751
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:52,030
should be closed.

752
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:53,790
You and your men

753
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,360
have had a long day.

754
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:57,990
Why don't you go back and rest early?

755
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:01,390
Go back.

756
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:04,850
This is bad.

757
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:07,560
Whatever I'm afraid of comes true.

758
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,210
Mr. Jiang, if you don't mind,

759
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:12,960
the Jinwu Guards will send you off.

760
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,670
The inventory holder will definitely

761
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:16,870
keep the token on him.

762
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:19,389
It's impossible that we can't find it.

763
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:23,940
This strange smell...

764
00:34:27,989 --> 00:34:28,590
Wait.

765
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:01,930
Commander Shang.

766
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:03,650
what the Inspection Office

767
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:04,980
is investigating today

768
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:07,150
is the Zornia transported from Heman.

769
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:08,030
This

770
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,590
is the token

771
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:11,050
for their exchange today.

772
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:12,810
Right,

773
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:15,540
Mr. Cao?

774
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:21,560
Turns out it's the batch of Zornia from Heman.

775
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,000
I feel so sick.

776
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:28,020
But Mr. Jiang,

777
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:29,660
what evidence do you have

778
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:31,270
that this token

779
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:32,630
is mine?

780
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:33,460
Yes.

781
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,540
That's right.

782
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:35,610
You're framing him.

783
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:36,410
That's right.

784
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,520
It’s him.

785
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,840
Jiang Xinbai, you better be smart.

786
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:51,310
There is a kind of bird

787
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:53,240
called the bunting.

788
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,220
This kind of bird's feces has an abnormal smell.

789
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,900
After being baked at a high temperature,

790
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,230
a special smell

791
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,360
is produced.

792
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:06,940
I'm sure Mr. Cao

793
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,510
usually cleans the feces

794
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:10,790
of your beloved birds.

795
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:12,110
Your hands

796
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:15,670
will inevitably have the smell of the feces

797
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:16,590
and thus

798
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:19,370
get the smell onto the token.

799
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:34,260
A hand that touches something dirty

800
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:35,590
can't become clean

801
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:37,520
no matter how one washes it.

802
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:39,310
Take him down!

803
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:43,640
Jiang Xinbai,

804
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:46,070
you framed me!

805
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:48,800
The Zornia

806
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:50,830
must still be in the Ghost Market.

807
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:51,760
Keep searching.

808
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:52,550
Yes.

809
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:53,510
Wait.

810
00:36:58,740 --> 00:36:59,340
Mr. Shang.

811
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:01,540
I know what to do.

812
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:06,350
Arresting people is the Jinwu Guards' duty.

813
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:07,350
I'll take him away

814
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,180
and interrogate him.

815
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,680
Commander Shang,

816
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:23,600
are you trying to snatch people again?

817
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:24,710
Mr. Jiang,

818
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:27,450
are you trying to get into a fight again?

819
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:42,600
They can fight anytime.

820
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:44,400
Why now?

821
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:45,570
Jiang Xinbai,

822
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:46,970
don’t show mercy.

823
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,600
Hurry up and fight.

824
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,140
Commander Shang,

825
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:48,510
I must

826
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:50,250
take him away today.

827
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:53,470
Fine.

828
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:58,100
I'll do you a favor today.

829
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:00,620
Remember to pay me back.

830
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:05,270
The criminal has been arrested,

831
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:07,770
but to prevent the accomplices from informing each other,

832
00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:10,370
the Ghost Market will be sealed off for longer.

833
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:11,430
No one

834
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:12,880
is allowed to leave.

835
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:13,510
Yes.

836
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,120
Director!

837
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:24,670
Director,

838
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:26,790
I have something to report.

839
00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:30,640
Yan Nanxing?

840
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:41,130
When did you come to the capital?

841
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:42,030
Actually,

842
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:43,260
I have to

843
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:44,950
leave immediately.

844
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:48,310
No.

845
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:49,840
Right now,

846
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:51,640
you can't leave.

847
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:53,060
Please.

848
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:57,310
What's wrong?

849
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:11,320
Go.

850
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:12,630
Follow me.

851
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:30,930
Go after him!

852
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:32,380
Come up.

853
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:39,710
Come in.

854
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:44,240
Tell them

855
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:46,110
they're not allowed in.

856
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:48,190
Say it.

857
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:51,650
You all stay outside.

858
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:53,070
Don't come in.

859
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:53,740
-Yes.
-Yes.

860
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:02,320
Don't worry.

861
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:03,200
He won't die.

862
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:05,880
Didn't you see

863
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,360
his fight with me earlier?

864
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,040
That girl is no match for him.

865
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:11,280
Mr. Jiang

866
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:13,180
was kidnapped on purpose.
