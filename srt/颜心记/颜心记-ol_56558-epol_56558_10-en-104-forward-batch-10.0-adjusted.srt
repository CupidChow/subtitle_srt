00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:22,430
and brawls

178
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:23,350
happen every day.

179
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:23,990
Once the constables

180
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:24,750
get here,

181
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:25,710
they can get straight to work.

182
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,990
It's a breeding ground for crime.

183
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:30,370
So she works for the government?

184
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,770
How have I never heard of

185
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:33,670
any female military officer?

186
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,380
My niece is a doctor.

187
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:37,330
But because of this house,

188
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:39,600
I should persuade her to be a thief.

189
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:41,930
Madam, what are you implying?

190
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:42,770
Just be frank.

191
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:43,830
Give me a discount.

192
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:44,450
10% off.

193
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:45,140
60%.

194
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:46,960
You drive a hard bargain.

195
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,420
Isn't your niece a doctor?

196
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,880
Doctors are highly paid.

197
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,070
I hope so,

198
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:54,750
but she's just started her career and has no resources at all.

199
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:57,850
If she likes it here,

200
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:00,260
she'll let you raise the rent next year.

201
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:03,810
Six is a lucky number.

202
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:04,740
60% off, please.

203
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:06,510
Four is even luckier.

204
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,460
So 40% off it is.

205
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,110
Actually, I want to ask you,

206
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:13,910
which area of the capital

207
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:15,490
is the most densely populated

208
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:17,290
and most suitable for business?

209
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,520
You want to help your niece

210
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:21,150
start a business, don't you?

211
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,750
Land, housing, and goods are all expensive in the capital.

212
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:25,880
To find my young sir,

213
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:27,650
I have to make a living first.

214
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,690
[Ruyi District]

215
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:32,750
Ruyi District has the best stores in the capital.

216
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:33,950
I'm familiar with it.

217
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,280
Mrs. Bao, you're a jack of all trades.

218
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,440
"Bao" means comprehensive.

219
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:40,320
So my family's services

220
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:42,500
cover renting, errand running, and information gathering.

221
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,910
You're new here.

222
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:45,250
Whether you rent or buy a house,

223
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,400
open a shop, or transfer its ownership,

224
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,150
you have to come to me.

225
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,790
I've sorted everything out for you.

226
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:51,310
You won't be disappointed.

227
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:52,240
You're amazing.

228
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:55,230
You flatter me.

229
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,380
Does your niece

230
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,750
want to be an apprentice

231
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:01,750
or open her own shop?

232
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:03,060
Is she planning for a big business

233
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,060
or a small one?

234
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:04,940
A big business.

235
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,070
Super big.

236
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,630
But the stores in Ruyi District

237
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:09,790
are expensive.

238
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:13,990
To open a store…

239
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:16,250
You can't dither about expenses.

240
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:21,320
Money's no problem.

241
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:24,230
Then leave it to me.

242
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,800
You won't be disappointed.

243
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,120
My lord.

244
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,390
We searched every corner

245
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:30,950
within a 7-mile radius of the Ghost Market.

246
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:31,550
We looked all night

247
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:33,480
but still didn't find Cao Wenquan.

248
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,990
Cao Wenquan is in charge of the Ghost Market.

249
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:37,440
Of course he knows better than us

250
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,310
the intricate lanes there.

251
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:42,460
It's not surprising that he's escaped for now.

252
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,590
Just bring him back.

253
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:45,550
Now that the handler has died

254
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:47,520
and the holder has escaped,

255
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:48,610
does that mean

256
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:50,210
we've sweated over nothing?

257
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,070
No.

258
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:52,550
First,

259
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,520
we deterred the outlaws.

260
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:55,590
Second,

261
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:58,220
Cao Wenquan didn't kill himself

262
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:00,320
last night at the Ghost Market.

263
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:01,190
It means

264
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,250
he's not a man of sacrifice.

265
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:03,910
Right.

266
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:05,400
I've looked into it.

267
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:06,710
He has no wife, children,

268
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:07,870
or siblings.

269
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:10,470
Someone like him is hard to control.

270
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:12,390
Great.

271
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,830
Once we catch Cao Wenquan,

272
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,790
we can knock holes in this case.

273
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:17,870
Yes, my lord.

274
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:20,790
Why did Ms. Yan

275
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:23,230
take you hostage last night?

276
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,760
Something urgent came up.

277
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:29,590
I have to

278
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:31,190
leave now.

279
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:31,830
I…

280
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,790
I can't let others

281
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:33,720
see me like this.

282
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:39,030
Since Ms. Yan found out

283
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:39,910
your identity,

284
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:41,380
her attitude towards you

285
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,780
has changed a lot.

286
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:46,430
Yeah.

287
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:48,920
She's indeed changed a lot.

288
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:04,070
Young Sir, wait for me.

289
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:07,630
I'll roll with the punches.

290
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:10,670
After I make a lot of money

291
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:12,710
and find my footing here,

292
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,710
we can go have fun

293
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:14,710
wherever we want.

294
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:15,470
Cheers.

295
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:33,880
Where's my sketchbook?

296
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:39,910
Did I lose it at the Ghost Market?

297
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,600
Where on earth is my sketchbook?

298
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:58,830
Forget it.

299
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,560
These people couldn't understand it

300
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:03,390
even if they had picked it up.

301
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:39,010
Could it be…

302
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:10,230
In the middle of every month,

303
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:11,780
around the full moon?

304
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:14,430
My lord,

305
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:16,960
what's in your hands?

306
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:21,030
Yao.

307
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:23,109
We haven't found Cao Wenquan yet.

308
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:24,670
Nothing unusual at the city gates

309
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:25,829
and downtown streets

310
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:27,030
in various districts.

311
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:28,030
So we plan

312
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:29,390
to expand the search.

313
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:32,230
Keep looking.

314
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:38,369
One more thing.

315
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:40,470
Go find out

316
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:42,840
if Yan Nanxing is still in the capital.

317
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:55,650
[Longxin Teahouse]

318
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:05,290
Your Grace.

319
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:06,110
Welcome.

320
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:38,590
Here's this month's fee.

321
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:42,290
Tell me when you're running out of stock.

322
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:06,210
How do you like the tea?

323
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:07,070
It's good.

324
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,840
Top-notch Moon River.

325
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:11,350
I only supply it to Longxin Teahouse.

326
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,900
No wonder the owner of Longxin Teahouse

327
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,430
gave you high commissions.

328
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:17,430
Shang.

329
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,870
You're an official and a tea merchant.

330
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,750
You have to be careful

331
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:23,470
lest the wrong people

332
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:24,910
hear the gossip.

333
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:27,110
Do you mean Jiang Xinbai?

334
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:28,840
You think I'm afraid of him?

335
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:30,150
I asked you here today

336
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:31,390
to talk about

337
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:32,990
him and that woman.

338
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:37,030
You're still thinking about the woman at the Ghost Market?

339
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:38,090
I've looked her up.

340
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:40,150
She's not from the Ghost Market.

341
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,570
Before that day,

342
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:45,350
I had met her at a Persian witch's shop.

343
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,310
What did you talk about?

344
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:48,630
Just…

345
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:51,520
just small talk.

346
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:53,310
But I find it

347
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,710
more and more confusing.

348
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,720
I thought they were acquainted,

349
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,040
but when I searched her that day,

350
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,070
they didn't seem

351
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,150
to know each other.

352
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:06,590
Later, that woman

353
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,190
held Jiang Xinbai hostage.

354
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:10,190
Why?

355
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,970
They must've pretended to be strangers,

356
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:14,690
which gives us more reason

357
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,780
to think they have a special relationship.

358
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:21,190
Then,

359
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:22,580
have you tried to find out

360
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:23,510
where she is now?

361
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,190
Interesting question.

362
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:30,190
I had someone look for her the other day,

363
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,230
but she disappeared.

364
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:34,950
Has she left the capital?

365
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:36,550
I'll find her

366
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:37,780
by all means.

367
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:40,310
Maybe

368
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:41,870
I can use her

369
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:43,730
to get something on Jiang Xinbai.

370
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:44,710
Shang.

371
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:47,750
Actually, there's a question

372
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,410
I've always wanted to ask you.

373
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:50,590
Why are you so sure

374
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:51,700
that Jiang Xinbai caused

375
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,360
your sister-in-law's death?

376
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:56,040
It's a very serious matter.

377
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:57,030
Shouldn't you

378
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:58,890
have asked your brother about it?

379
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:07,610
He sent me an urgent letter from afar,

380
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:10,670
saying that my sister-in-law died of illness.

381
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:13,580
But she had always

382
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:14,670
been very healthy.

383
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:17,960
There was no way she'd die so suddenly.

384
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:19,150
And as it happens,

385
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:24,350
Jiang Xinbai came back from Heman.

386
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:25,910
I thought

387
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,710
he had something to do with this,

388
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:29,170
so I asked him about it.

389
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:30,950
Guess what?

390
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:34,710
He didn't deny it.

391
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:37,910
That's all?

392
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:38,990
That's all.

393
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:41,350
But what you said

394
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:42,280
is not evidence.

395
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,440
Don't defend him!

396
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:45,550
I still think you shouldn't have

397
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:47,150
jumped to that conclusion.

398
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,170
Even if he didn't

399
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:49,070
kill her himself,

400
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:50,470
he was definitely involved!

401
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:52,330
Otherwise, why didn't he deny it?

402
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:58,890
Sorry, Suoluo.

403
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:02,360
I shouldn't have yelled at you.

404
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,700
If it weren't for my duties

405
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,240
keeping me in the capital,

406
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,270
I would've gone to Heman myself

407
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:11,470
to find out the truth.

408
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:12,550
Later,

409
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:15,090
I wrote a letter to my brother,

410
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:17,110
asking him

411
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:18,440
if it was what I thought.

412
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:24,130
He still hasn't replied to me yet.

413
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:25,720
Shang.

414
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:28,330
I understand

415
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:28,870
how you felt

416
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:29,830
about Lady Gaya.

417
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:31,270
Maybe it's those feelings

418
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:32,860
you can't tell anyone about

419
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:35,410
that have clouded your judgment.

420
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,020
I'm not

421
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:37,450
defending Jiang Xinbai.

422
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,370
I just don't want to see you in so much pain.

423
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:55,150
My lord.

424
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:56,350
I've got something.

425
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:58,110
Someone rented a detached house

426
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:00,570
in Tongshan District in Yan Nanxing's name.

427
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:03,640
She didn't rent it herself?

428
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:06,590
The person who checked the house and paid the rent

429
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:08,450
claimed to be Yan Nanxing's aunt.

430
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:26,230
It's been five days.

431
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:28,520
Why haven't I changed back?

432
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:33,070
Could it be that

433
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,670
my sketchbook was taken

434
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:35,600
by Jiang Xinbai?

435
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:38,690
I can't be that unlucky.

436
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:39,620
The odds are low.

437
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:47,030
Am I drunk?

438
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:51,310
No one's home.

439
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,690
I told you so many times!

440
00:23:57,790 --> 00:23:58,450
No one's...

441
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:00,780
home.

442
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:06,770
Yan Nanxing.

443
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:08,550
I knew you were here.

444
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:10,550
What did he call me?

445
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:12,720
You have poor eyesight?

446
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:15,230
You got the wrong person.

447
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,320
What do you want?

448
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:20,150
I can't let others

449
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:21,080
see me like this.

450
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:24,010
It's the voice that day.

451
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:33,140
I'm from the Inspection Office.

452
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:35,990
I'm here to check on the new tenants in the capital.

453
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:36,750
Please…

454
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:39,830
madam,

455
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:41,010
cooperate.

456
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:50,270
I didn't break any laws

457
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:51,590
or cause any trouble.

458
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,980
What's wrong with me drinking alone at home,

459
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:56,470
Mr. Chief Constable?

460
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:58,440
I only said

461
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,240
I'm from the Inspection Office.

462
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,380
I never said I'm the chief constable.

463
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:04,710
How did you know that?

464
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:05,550
I...

465
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:09,750
I can tell that

466
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:11,950
from your extraordinary temperament.

467
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:16,210
It makes sense.

468
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:22,690
The registered tenant of this house

469
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:23,860
is Yan Nanxing.

470
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:26,270
Where is she?

471
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:26,910
I...

472
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:28,570
I was about to tell you

473
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,360
my niece went out.

474
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:34,030
Niece?

475
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:36,830
She's out?

476
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:42,640
Will she come back tonight?

477
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:43,830
Maybe,

478
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,220
maybe not.

479
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:47,840
Where did she go?

480
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:50,750
Somewhere far away.

481
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:53,370
Can't see it from here.

482
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,470
Then I'll wait for her

483
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:56,200
here tonight

484
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:58,870
until she comes back.

485
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:03,720
I...

486
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,230
I walk very fast.

487
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:06,570
It's not that far away.

488
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,100
I'll go get her for you.

489
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:15,310
Can you find her?

490
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:16,750
Of course.

491
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,890
He came uninvited.

492
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:28,820
He must have come prepared.

493
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,240
He called me Yan Nanxing at the Ghost Market

494
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,660
and called me Yan Nanxing again here.

495
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:39,390
Why?

496
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:43,840
I haven't changed back.

497
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:20,100
I knew it.

498
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:22,420
My room.

499
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:25,830
Gosh.

500
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:39,160
Stop!

501
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:43,190
What are you doing?

502
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:44,800
Without my permission,

503
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,510
you broke into my house

504
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:46,680
and went through my stuff.

505
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,630
Is this how the Inspection Office

506
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:49,030
treats ordinary people?

507
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:55,630
Yan Nanxing?

508
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:57,710
It's your voice.

509
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,630
But why are you dressed

510
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:00,490
the same as the woman

511
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:01,250
just now?

512
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:05,300
What does it have to do with you?

513
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,180
She's my aunt.

514
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:07,230
We're close.

515
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:09,230
We like to wear the same clothes.

516
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:09,990
Aunt?

517
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:16,270
Then where is your aunt now?

518
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:17,310
She...

519
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:18,670
She went out.

520
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:20,970
That's none of your business.

521
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,160
You smell like alcohol.

522
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:31,550
I'm right.

523
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,190
It's you.

524
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:38,350
Now I understand

525
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:40,520
why you were so afraid

526
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:42,190
of being seen by others that night

527
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:43,320
at the Ghost Market.

528
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:49,130
What you were afraid of

529
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:53,090
was a shocking secret.

530
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:57,330
That's total nonsense!

531
00:28:57,770 --> 00:28:59,230
I'm done talking with you.

532
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:03,320
Yan Nanxing.

533
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:05,120
Who on earth are you?

534
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:07,350
What does the real you look like?

535
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:10,150
You're so weird!

536
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:11,830
You asked a stranger

537
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:13,270
if she was Yan Nanxing

538
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:14,390
and then asked me

539
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:15,550
who I was.

540
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,450
I see. You have face blindness.

541
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:25,790
Young man,

542
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:27,310
please

543
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:29,940
go rest somewhere else.

544
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:31,530
I don't trust you

545
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:33,990
because I can't see you clearly.

546
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:36,550
What?

547
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,990
Kill me once you're done using me?

548
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:38,790
How could you?

549
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:39,340
It's you.

550
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:41,890
Pretending not to know me?

551
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:50,950
I got you there, right?

552
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:53,430
Jiang Xinbai, you have face blindness!

553
00:29:58,390 --> 00:29:59,590
Yan Nanxing, listen.

554
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:01,750
You held me hostage at the Ghost Market that day.

555
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:03,010
It was a serious crime.

556
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:04,490
You'd better honestly

557
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:06,210
answer my questions here,

558
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:08,270
or I'll take you back to the Inspection Office

559
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:09,390
for interrogation.

560
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:11,050
Who are you to interrogate me?

561
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:13,110
It should be me interrogating you.

562
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:14,040
Come with me.

563
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:14,870
You...

564
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:15,550
Come out!

565
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:16,720
What are you doing?

566
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,430
Come.

567
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:19,160
Yan Nanxing!

568
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:25,850
This is my sketchbook.

569
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:27,240
My self-portrait is in it.

570
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:27,900
Take a look.

571
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:28,970
Which one is me?

572
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:34,910
Fortunately,

573
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:37,150
I've drawn a few portraits from memory lately.

574
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:38,670
They come in handy now.

575
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:40,830
Can't recognize me?

576
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,810
You do have face blindness.

577
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:55,730
This one is you.

578
00:30:58,710 --> 00:30:59,390
Wrong.

579
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:04,600
Yan Nanxing.

580
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:06,600
I've seen

581
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:07,960
your other sketchbook.

582
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:09,190
In it,

583
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:11,230
you're on the first page too.

584
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:12,310
It's your habit,

585
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:13,350
right?

586
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:15,250
You have that sketchbook?

587
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,430
Why did you come to the capital?

588
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:18,790
Why did you

589
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:20,770
go to the Ghost Market?

590
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:33,440
I don't mean to push you.

591
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:35,390
I know,

592
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:38,150
you still haven't gotten over

593
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:39,480
what happened at Heman.

594
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:41,430
If you're really

595
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:42,760
in some kind of trouble,

596
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:44,430
I hope I can help you.

597
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:46,600
I hope you can tell me

598
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,400
what I should do

599
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:50,130
to make it up to you.

600
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:53,210
Make it up to me?

601
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:56,490
One can only make up for mistakes.

602
00:31:58,750 --> 00:31:59,550
Jiang Xinbai.

603
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:02,040
Do you think you were wrong?

604
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:06,870
You don't,

605
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:07,750
right?

606
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:11,200
So you don't want to make up for anything.

607
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:12,360
You're doing all this

608
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,190
just to make yourself

609
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:13,920
feel better.

610
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:14,630
Get out!

611
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:15,000
No.

612
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:15,520
Get out.

613
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:16,350
I don't want to talk to you.

614
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:17,830
-This is my house.
-Yan Nanxing.

615
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:19,090
Don't come to me again!

616
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:19,880
Yan Nanxing.

617
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:55,710
Here.

618
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:00,310
Sir.

619
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:01,150
I want this one.

620
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:02,230
I'll buy it.

621
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:03,840
Hello, Mrs. Bao.

622
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,310
Mrs. Bao, you...

623
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:07,350
Not now.

624
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:08,950
Tomorrow. We settled on tomorrow.

625
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:10,280
Tomorrow it is.

626
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:12,470
Mrs. Bao.

627
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,580
You look great.

628
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:17,990
Ms. Yan.

629
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,990
You didn't sleep well last night, did you?

630
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:23,120
You have dark circles under your eyes.

631
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:26,220
I saw someone off yesterday.

632
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,830
I was upset.

633
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:29,470
Your aunt?

634
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,990
You two are very close.

635
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:32,390
You must want her to stay.

636
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:35,680
Look.

637
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:37,630
This is the best store for rent

638
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:39,070
in Ruyi District.

639
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:50,990
It's a prime site

640
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:52,990
at the intersection.

641
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:55,490
You can go anywhere from here.

642
00:33:58,390 --> 00:33:59,350
Its feng shui

643
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:00,630
is exceptional.

644
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:02,650
It absorbs the vibrant energy

645
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:03,910
from the bustling crowds

646
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:06,310
while avoiding any negative forces.

647
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:07,710
Perfect.

648
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:09,350
Except for the high rent,

649
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:10,680
it has no shortcomings.

650
00:34:10,930 --> 00:34:11,670
Mrs. Bao.

651
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:14,530
What kinds of stores are there in Ruyi District?

652
00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:16,020
There are tea houses,

653
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,520
restaurants, bars,

654
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:20,130
antique stores, art shops,

655
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:23,010
and shops for fortune-telling.

656
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:25,199
Oh, there's also a pharmacy.

657
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:26,870
Pharmacy?

658
00:34:27,949 --> 00:34:29,110
Doctor Zhang there

659
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:30,870
charges a lot

660
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:33,380
for treatment and consultation.

661
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:36,010
Only rich people with ailments go to him.

662
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:38,330
Mrs. Bao,

663
00:34:38,989 --> 00:34:41,230
is there a cosmetics store in the capital?

664
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:41,889
What store?

665
00:34:41,989 --> 00:34:42,989
Cosmetics store.

666
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:44,710
I've never heard of it.

667
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:45,790
No, right?

668
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,320
Then if I open one,

669
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:50,469
it'll be the only cosmetics store in the capital.

670
00:34:50,469 --> 00:34:51,830
By that time, the money

671
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:53,389
is gonna come pouring in.

672
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,270
Mrs. Bao.

673
00:34:54,389 --> 00:34:55,130
This store...

674
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:56,449
The rent is not negotiable.

675
00:34:56,449 --> 00:34:57,790
Many people want to rent it.

676
00:34:57,790 --> 00:34:58,650
I'll rent it.

677
00:35:02,219 --> 00:35:03,219
Ms. Yan,

678
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,960
you're so generous.

679
00:35:05,949 --> 00:35:07,880
You're much better than your aunt.

680
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:32,990
Jiang Xinbai.

681
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:35,740
Do you think you were wrong?

682
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:37,030
You don't,

683
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:37,990
right?

684
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:41,430
So you don't want to make up for anything.

685
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:42,510
You're doing all this

686
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:43,400
just to make yourself

687
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,130
feel better!

688
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:50,270
Linglong.

689
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:52,470
Tell me.

690
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:54,950
Was I doing all that just for myself?

691
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:57,030
Then,

692
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,320
how can I

693
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:02,270
put myself in her shoes?

694
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:10,750
Answer me.

695
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:14,850
You don't know either?

696
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:16,360
Do you know, Daimao?

697
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,210
I like how you decorated the house.

698
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,430
You even got a swing over there.

699
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:14,140
Girls all like such things.

700
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:14,770
It looks good, right?

701
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:16,380
Mrs. Bao, have some tea.

702
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:19,160
This place looks great.

703
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:21,310
You just said

704
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:23,460
you won't stay in the capital for long.

705
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:24,680
Where are you going?

706
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:25,710
Mrs. Bao,

707
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:27,650
is this how you know everything?

708
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:29,610
After asking about my plan today,

709
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:30,510
you want to know

710
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:31,810
my plan for the future.

711
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:34,670
You know me.

712
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,920
Gathering information is what I do.

713
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,190
Well,

714
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:38,910
Mrs. Bao,

715
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:40,630
there's something

716
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:41,890
I want to ask you about.

717
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:43,710
Well,

718
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,510
the soldiers in the capital

719
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:47,190
sometimes bring back patients

720
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:48,220
and criminals from outside.

721
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:49,470
Where are they usually kept?

722
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:51,130
Why are you asking about that?

723
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,490
I'm a traveling doctor.

724
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:56,430
I'm looking for a patient.

725
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:01,390
All the outsiders in the capital

726
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:02,990
have to get registered

727
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:04,450
at the Inspection Office.

728
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:06,510
Then

729
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:07,470
what about someone

730
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:08,530
brought back personally by a soldier?

731
00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:09,150
They still have to

732
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:11,550
be interrogated at the Inspection Office.

733
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:14,190
What if he's special?

734
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:16,510
What do you mean?

735
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:19,190
For example,

736
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:22,990
he's different from other people

737
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:25,990
or has psychic abilities.

738
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:27,130
Well,

739
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:28,770
everyone in the capital

740
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:30,470
is on the registry

741
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,960
of the Inspection Office.

742
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:32,910
Anyway,

743
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:35,510
go to the Inspection Office if you're looking for someone.

744
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:36,950
Trust me.

745
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:38,940
The Inspection Office.

746
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:40,980
It's in my way again.

747
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:45,230
I know a secret about the Inspection Office.

748
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:46,430
Do you want to hear it?

749
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:47,540
What secret?

750
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:50,930
The chief constable of the Inspection Office,

751
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:51,770
Jiang Xinbai,

752
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:54,870
is the Duke of Yuejiang.

753
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:56,580
Have you heard of

754
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,550
the Duke of Yuejiang?

755
00:38:57,550 --> 00:39:00,470
He's the only duke in the capital who's not from the royal family.

756
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:02,070
So Mr. Jiang is the kind of man

757
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:05,230
who was born with a silver spoon in his mouth.

758
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:06,860
His sister is a duchess.

759
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:09,110
It's not surprising that he's a duke.

760
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:09,750
No wonder

761
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:11,710
he's spoiled

762
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:12,750
and overbearing.

763
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:15,390
That's not true.

764
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:17,280
The Duke of Yuejiang

765
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,680
is quite a character.

766
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:21,310
Although he's from a rich family,

767
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:23,470
he lives in a frugal manner.

768
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:24,670
He lives outside

769
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:25,930
Yuejiang's Residence

770
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:27,270
in a small house.

771
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,470
He doesn't even have personal guards

772
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:30,350
or servants.

773
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:31,430
Mrs. Bao,

774
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:32,830
I'm impressed.

775
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:34,830
You even know where he lives.

776
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:37,760
That I don't know.

777
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:39,310
If you want to know,

778
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:40,460
I'll ask around for you.

779
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:41,660
N-No need.

780
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,030
I want nothing to do

781
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:44,140
with him.

782
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:47,770
Yan Nanxing came to the capital to look for someone.

783
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:50,340
Is it related to her shapeshifting?

784
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:56,460
Is there anything else you want to know?

785
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:57,300
No, no.

786
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,200
Have some tea.

787
00:39:58,350 --> 00:39:58,630
Here.

788
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:00,630
I've asked everything I want to ask.

789
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:01,550
Have some nuts

790
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:02,450
and candied fruits.

791
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:04,070

let me take you to a place.

You've found Cao Wenquan?

00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:09,830
Not yet.

796
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,110
I’m not interested in other things.

797
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:13,440
It's about Yan Nanxing.
