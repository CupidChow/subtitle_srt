4
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:01,870
Where's Lady Gaya?

5
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,509
Let's split up.

6
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:11,950
Okay.

7
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,240
Did you find her?

8
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:36,900
No.

9
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,240
What should we do?

10
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:40,480
How about...

11
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,630
we go up ahead?

12
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:43,829
Okay.

13
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:46,150
I can't do it.

14
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:49,340
Wait...

15
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,579
That's Gaya's voice.

16
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,650
You can even hear that?

17
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:04,570
I think you should worry about

18
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:06,100
yourself and your husband.

19
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:08,420
If anything goes wrong,

20
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,450
you can only be a wedded couple

21
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:11,770
in the next life.

22
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,110
Gaya!

23
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:27,510
Gaya.

24
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:28,900
Why are you here?

25
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,120
I wanted to take a walk around

26
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:33,030
but I got lost.

27
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,870
Many bridges in Heman City are similar.

28
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,270
If you don't go out often,

29
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,530
you'd get lost easily.

30
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:39,590
Madam.

31
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,630
Who was that?

32
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,750
I was going to ask her for the way.

33
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,870
She said the street was noisy,

34
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,360
so she took me to the alley.

35
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,990
I didn't get to ask anything

36
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:51,920
before you came.

37
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,610
Did she do anything to you?

38
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,460
What could she have done?

39
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:58,310
W-Well...

40
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,510
I've been out for a while.

41
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:01,670
I'm a little tired.

42
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:03,190
Why don't we go back first?

43
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:04,710
Sure.

44
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:05,520
Let's go.

45
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,810
Back then, when Gaya's tribe

46
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:22,700
was fighting against an enemy tribe,

47
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:23,840
she dressed like this

48
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,300
to cheer for the warriors.

49
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,250
I was attracted

50
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:27,990
at a glance.

51
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:32,830
Well,

52
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:34,380
your taste

53
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,330
is indeed extraordinary.

54
00:04:37,909 --> 00:04:39,080
Then...

55
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,010
what is it for today?

56
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,240
For you two.

57
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,040
-For us?
-For us?

58
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:51,800
Dr. Yan,

59
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:52,590
Mr. Xi.

60
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:53,670
We are unable to

61
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:55,200
repay you for your kindness

62
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,470
towards us.

63
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:58,240
The two of you look like

64
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:00,870
you've taken a liking to each other these days.

65
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,630
So,

66
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:03,710
I prayed to God

67
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,720
for your marriage.

68
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:07,270
No need!

69
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:08,750
No need.

70
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,560
Didn't we...

71
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,120
tell you last time?

72
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,740
There's nothing between us.

73
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,450
According to divination,

74
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:17,380
you two are destined to be married.

75
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:18,360
And it's

76
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:19,470
three marriages.

77
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,060
What does the three marriages mean?

78
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:24,930
It's not clear.

79
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:27,590
But your first marriage

80
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,270
is in the direction of "water."

81
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,730
Wouldn't that be in Heman?

82
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:32,350
Hubby.

83
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,880
Since it's God's will,

84
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,800
let's go with it

85
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:37,760
and hold their first wedding.

86
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:39,350
No!

87
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:43,990
I mean...

88
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,870
marriage is an important affair,

89
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,070
we shouldn't be so hasty about it.

90
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:48,590
Right?

91
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:50,310
She's right.

92
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,909
They have to set off to the capital too.

93
00:05:52,909 --> 00:05:53,870
Isn't it too late?

94
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:54,770
Yes.

95
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:55,710
No.

96
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:56,950
Let's go hold the water wedding

97
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,790
unique to Heman.

98
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:00,850
The last step of the wedding

99
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:02,550
is for the newlyweds to take a boat out of the city

100
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:04,010
to go around the river bay.

101
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:06,610
On the second day, after you consummate,

102
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:07,870
you return to the city.

103
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:08,530
But

104
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:09,770
we can modify it.

105
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,320
After the wedding,

106
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,690
the wedding boat can just leave the city

107
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:13,870
and there's no need for them to come back.

108
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:14,670
That's right.

109
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:18,110
That'd make it easy for them to leave the city and take a carriage afterwards

110
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:19,640
to go to the capital by land.

111
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,250
No need, no need!

112
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:22,710
We...

113
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,630
We are really not at that stage yet.

114
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:27,350
Hubby.

115
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:28,580
It’s been a long time

116
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,070
since we've had a wedding in Heman.

117
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:30,930
Say something.

118
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:31,390
Okay.

119
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:34,000
I shall invite everyone in the town

120
00:06:34,659 --> 00:06:36,320
and hold the wedding banquet.

121
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,270
Say something!

122
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:38,980
Just right.

123
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:43,950
Actually,

124
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,430
I have long

125
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:46,330
fallen for you.

126
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,270
Since it's God's will,

127
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:50,550
why don't we go with it?

128
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,830
I don't understand.

129
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,830
Why do you have to marry me?

130
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,760
I'm worried that it's not safe

131
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,620
if you go alone.

132
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:23,470
I can't rest assured.

133
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:25,740
How about

134
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:28,420
we go back to the capital together?

135
00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:34,790
Actually,

136
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:37,570
I'm afraid that things are not fully settled in Heman yet.

137
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:39,470
So I want to wait

138
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,100
for when things are settled–

139
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,190
Things are not fully settled?

140
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,470
What do you mean?

141
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:44,630
No.

142
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:45,920
I'm leaving.

143
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:46,760
Yan Nanxing!

144
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,500
Do you really think

145
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,360
you’ll be safe if you leave Heman?

146
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:56,480
What do you mean?

147
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,670
In the eyes of outsiders,

148
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:02,180
I'm on General Nan's side.

149
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:03,630
We are a couple.

150
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:06,150
If those people who haven't been dealt with

151
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:07,480
want to kill General Nan

152
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:08,110
and me,

153
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,310
they won't let you go.

154
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,390
After you leave Heman,

155
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:14,720
they will come after you

156
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:16,350
to murder you.

157
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:21,470
You...

158
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,190
Don't scare me.

159
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:25,940
Listen.

160
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:27,560
I don't believe.

161
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:31,150
Even if you're doing this to protect me,

162
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:32,230
why...

163
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,190
why must we get married?

164
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:41,150
Here.

165
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:42,909
Take a seat.

166
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:46,470
Listen to me.

167
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:52,870
I

168
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:56,530
have another plan.

169
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,600
This plan

170
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:03,670
can not only help General Nan

171
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:05,930
to catch all those we haven't dealt with,

172
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:07,000
but also protect

173
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:08,030
Lady Gaya and you

174
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:09,450
to leave Heman safely.

175
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:12,190
What kind of great plan

176
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:14,360
requires us to get married?

177
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:17,210
It concerns the safety of others.

178
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,550
I can't tell you the details for now.

179
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:25,350
If you really want to know the truth,

180
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:26,710
stay with me

181
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:27,620
until the end.

182
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:31,870
Have you already discussed it

183
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:32,870
with General Nan?

184
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:34,670
Of course.

185
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:37,550
But this plan,

186
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:39,740
without your cooperation,

187
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,000
it can't be completed.

188
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,310
I can't cooperate.

189
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:47,670
Why?

190
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:49,630
You have a sense of justice, don't you?

191
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,790
Even so,

192
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,870
I should prioritize my own life.

193
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:54,640
Think about it yourself.

194
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,540
All the things you've done

195
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:56,150
in Heman

196
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:58,360
are all bloody.

197
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:00,650
Your plan will definitely be

198
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:01,950
very dangerous.

199
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,070
I'm not going.

200
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:10,150
I'll speak the truth.

201
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,090
I've been have been through a lot of

202
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:12,780
tragedies and disasters since childhood.

203
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,540
It's not easy for me to live till this day.

204
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,340
I'm no Buddha.

205
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:17,790
Please.

206
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:19,350
Please. Please.

207
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:20,100
I'm leaving.

208
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:21,440
Yan Nanxing!

209
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:22,950
Yan Nanxing!

210
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:28,870
So,

211
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,190
no matter what,

212
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:31,590
you won't help me, right?

213
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:34,190
I really can't.

214
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,330
Wh-What are you doing?

215
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:58,070
Why are you looking at me like that?

216
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:05,190
In Lanna Village,

217
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:08,450
when you burned the Zornia field,

218
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:09,920
though I said

219
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,030
you were being reckless,

220
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:12,630
I was actually really happy.

221
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,270
I thought

222
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,270
you were like another me.

223
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,590
One that is more passionate

224
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:20,710
and more brave.

225
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,630
You can help me see

226
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:24,150
many things I can't see.

227
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:26,150
And help me

228
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:27,830
make decisions

229
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:28,990
I dare not make.

230
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,110
I've been cautious since I was young.

231
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:37,970
I seldom make promises to others.

232
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:40,200
But that day,

233
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,950
after you burned the Zornia field,

234
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:46,280
I told the villagers of Lanna Village that...

235
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,520
no one will plant Zornias

236
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:51,390
in your village anymore.

237
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:53,380
Do you know why?

238
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:00,320
Because I trust you.

239
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,840
I believe

240
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:04,200
no matter what happens,

241
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,510
you will always be on my side.

242
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,570
You started trusting me

243
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:11,840
since back then?

244
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:25,430
Everything I'm doing now

245
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,910
is to fulfill the promise

246
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,240
I made to Lanna Village.

247
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,100
Of course,

248
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:31,590
I told you

249
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,460
I will protect you too.

250
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:37,340
I brought you back to Heman.

251
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,120
I must bring you out

252
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:39,950
safely.

253
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:43,730
After everything is over,

254
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,830
I will tell you my real identity.

255
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:53,150
Actually,

256
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:56,470
I don't have many friends.

257
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:58,910
But in my heart,

258
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:03,150
I already take you

259
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,440
as my friend.

260
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:11,910
Really?

261
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:14,950
You treat me as a friend?

262
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:18,150
Really.

263
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:22,790
Although

264
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,950
we have different personalities,

265
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,520
deep down,

266
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,110
we are the same kind of people.

267
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:31,960
I remember

268
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:32,910
you told me

269
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:35,320
there are things you're more afraid of

270
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,390
than death.

271
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:40,650
There are things you want to do more than living.

272
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:43,750
Me too.

273
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:47,090
You want to save everyone in front of you,

274
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,280
and I want to save more people too.

275
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:51,510
Our goal

276
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,550
has always been the same.

277
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,150
So, Yan Nanxing,

278
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,750
my promise to Lanna Village

279
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:05,530
can't be fulfilled

280
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:07,920
without you.

281
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:29,950
You taught me this.

282
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:33,790
Trust me.

283
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,320
I will protect you.

284
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:41,790
Young man.

285
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:43,110
Thanks.

286
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:51,670
Fine, let's get married.

287
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,010
I'm not to be trifled with.

288
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:55,250
I would like to see

289
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,270
which stubborn bastard

290
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,390
refuse to

291
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:58,990
turn over a new leaf.

292
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,100
I trust you too.

293
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,150
It's him again.

294
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:46,320
Get him!

295
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:04,510
Young Sir!

296
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:24,220
Does it hurt?

297
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,040
Those people won't give us food,

298
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:33,110
but they dressed you

299
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:34,190
like a real bride.

300
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:35,710
I don't want to be

301
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:36,870
a bride.

302
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,190
I miss my mother.

303
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,870
I want to go home.

304
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:42,030
Trust me.

305
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:43,730
You can go home soon.

306
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,430
Then you can grow up happily

307
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:48,230
and get married then.

308
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,200
I don't want to get married.

309
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:53,110
Unless...

310
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:54,480
Unless what?

311
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:56,190
No.

312
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:58,200
You'll laugh at me if I tell you.

313
00:16:58,980 --> 00:16:59,870
I won't.

314
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,350
I really want to know.

315
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:02,460
Tell me.

316
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:03,680
Unless what?

317
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:05,869
Unless...

318
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:08,230
my groom knows magic

319
00:17:08,869 --> 00:17:10,069
and can bloom flowers

320
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,619
in winter,

321
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:13,670
then I'll get married to him.

322
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,690
So you want to

323
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:15,910
marry a floral deity.

324
00:17:16,349 --> 00:17:17,310
I can’t do that.

325
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:17,950
You...

326
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:21,430
You're not my groom.

327
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:25,069
Although I'm not your groom,

328
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:27,210
I can't make all flowers bloom

329
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:28,109
for you...

330
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:29,350
Follow me.

331
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,930
What kind of flower is this?

332
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:58,550
I heard that

333
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:00,310
they came from the Netherworld.

334
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:02,600
So they are called the Netherworld Flower.

335
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,480
They like to grow

336
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:06,690
in dark, cold and humid environment.

337
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:08,710
It's hard to find them in day time.

338
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:09,950
They only appear

339
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:10,790
at night.

340
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:18,850
Are you cold?

341
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:20,320
Have my clothes.

342
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:27,520
Young man,

343
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:29,930
will I see you again?

344
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:31,760
When you grow up,

345
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,310
and want to look for me,

346
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:34,390
just say, "Are you cold?

347
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:35,390
Have my clothes."

348
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,290
and I will know it's you.

349
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:50,380
Nanxing.

350
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:53,040
Why haven't you dressed up?

351
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:56,630
Leave it here.

352
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,920
In two hours,

353
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:01,950
you will be the star

354
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:03,270
of the whole Heman.

355
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,340
This is the best moment

356
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:06,750
in a woman's life.

357
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,200
What's wrong?

358
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,750
You're going to be a bride.

359
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:13,680
Are you unhappy?

360
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:16,950
No.

361
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:18,840
I just feel like now that I'm going to

362
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,300
marry into a noble family,

363
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:22,110
I'm going to become a sparrow

364
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:23,080
with no freedom.

365
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:26,970
So that's what you're worried about.

366
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:29,710
Actually,

367
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:32,070
there are cages everywhere in life.

368
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,200
There's no freedom.

369
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:34,430
But

370
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:36,650
if you have a lover in your heart,

371
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:37,970
and you cage yourself,

372
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:40,400
you're doing it willingly.

373
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:44,910
You're so mature.

374
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:46,690
Hearing you say that,

375
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,660
I don't find marriage a beautiful thing.

376
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:52,030
All right.

377
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:53,370
It's a happy day.

378
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:54,350
Let's not talk about this.

379
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:54,880
Let's go.

380
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,360
Let me show you a gift.

381
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:57,550
A gift?

382
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:05,990
This is...

383
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:08,750
A luminous jade cup?

384
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:09,310
Yes.

385
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,390
It's a luminous jade cross-cup.

386
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:12,910
I asked someone to look for this

387
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:14,370
as a gift for your wedding.

388
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:16,110
When you consummate,

389
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:17,060
use this to drink

390
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:18,480
the cross-cupped wine.

391
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:20,160
The wedding is not real.

392
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:21,550
How can I accept

393
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:22,750
such a precious gift?

394
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,860
This is too precious.

395
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:27,430
I can't accept it.

396
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:29,150
No.

397
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,960
This is my sincerity.

398
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,230
Take it.

399
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:34,590
I really don't know

400
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:35,790
what else

401
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:36,910
I can give you.

402
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:38,890
You don't owe me anything.

403
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:42,670
I mean,

404
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,080
I wanted to invite your mother over,

405
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,880
but we don't have enough time.

406
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,550
I feel sorry for making you get married

407
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:51,290
without your family members.

408
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:53,030
It's okay.

409
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:54,810
I think these decorations

410
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:56,400
are done up really well.

411
00:20:59,310 --> 00:20:59,870
Nanxing.

412
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:05,040
Nanxing,

413
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:06,950
if General and I

414
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:08,410
have a child in the future,

415
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:09,750
can we use your name?

416
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,950
No matter if they're a boy or a girl,

417
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:13,350
I will name them Nanxing.

418
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:16,430
Well...

419
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:18,620
Is it okay?

420
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,270
Sure.

421
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:24,230
Since you like me so much,

422
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:25,480
why not?

423
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,460
It's just a name.

424
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:28,530
Just use it.

425
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,320
That's great.

426
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:31,590
From now on,

427
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:33,130
I'll take the liberty

428
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:34,350
to be your family.

429
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:46,990
My lord,

430
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,470
they've loaded the goods.

431
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:50,130
It's among the wedding boats.

432
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:52,960
The city is under siege.

433
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,150
Only the wedding ship can get in and out.

434
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:56,790
What a plan.

435
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:58,190
I think we can

436
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:59,120
take action now.

437
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:00,880
You don't have to take the risk.

438
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,500
I want to catch them red-handed.

439
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:04,590
Yes.

440
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:09,770
Anything else?

441
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:11,170
Didn't you ask me to check on Ms. Yan

442
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:12,770
at the General's Residence?

443
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:14,510
What's wrong?

444
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:15,550
Ms. Yan is fine.

445
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,750
It's just that I saw

446
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:18,950
she and Lady Gaya

447
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:21,110
seem very close.

448
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:24,310
Yes.

449
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:26,100
Ms. Yan is usually sharp-tongued,

450
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,110
but she is kind

451
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:27,860
and sincere.

452
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,270
I'm afraid

453
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:31,200
she would be hurt when she finds out

454
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:32,190
the truth.

455
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,340
♫I'll fetch you the moon in my heart♫

456
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:23,620
♫I dream of the courtyard♫

457
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:26,810
♫It knows my heart♫

458
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:29,740
♫I want to return triumphantly with you♫

459
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,840
♫We can listen to the rain♫

460
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,980
♫And watch the snowfall in the west hills♫

461
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,120
♫On the streets, the alleys, and the palace♫

00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:41,250
♫We shall always meet♫

463

♫I only hope you fall into my heart♫

464
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,580
♫The fire warms winter days♫

465
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,210

♫You're what I always think about♫

470
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:04,870
♫I'm willing to go to the sky for you♫

471
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:07,700
♫To pluck the moon above the clouds♫

472

♫I'll grow old for you♫

476
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:22,810
♫I want this flower to bloom and never wilt♫

477
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,390

478
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:29,430

479
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,750
♫And never break your promise♫

480
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:50,630
Ceremony music, get ready!

481
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,350
Welcome the bride!

482
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:15,330
Enter the ceremony, hand in hand.

483
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:23,570
You regret it?

484
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:24,830
Is it too late?

485
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:29,190
You're already wearing the wedding dress.

486
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:30,590
I'm afraid it's too late.

487
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:37,830
What a perfect match.

488
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:38,510
Yes.

489
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:40,650
They look great together.

490
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:41,520
Gaya.

491
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:42,830
We did a

492
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:43,610
great thing.

493
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:49,430
Embrace each other.

494
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:55,540
Why do we have to do that?

495
00:25:57,570 --> 00:25:58,970
This is a wedding ritual.

496
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:05,850
-Good!
-Great!

497
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:07,690
You don't have to adhere to it.

498
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:09,540
Good!

499
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,590
The wedding ceremony begins.

500
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:16,750
Cross the saddle;

501
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:18,630
that symbolizes safety.

502
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:20,310
Rise.

503
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:27,200
Sprinkle the five grains.

504
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,000
First, sprinkle the red beans to signify your everlasting longing.

505
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:38,110
Second, sprinkle the lotus for abundance of children.

506
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:44,660
Third, sprinkle the chestnuts for a prosperous family and offspring.

507
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:49,140
Fourth, sprinkle longan for a harmonious family.

508
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:57,210
Respect and love each other, for the good of your descendants.

509
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:01,150
Walk through the painting of a hundred children playing.

510
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:14,050
Are you really regretting it?

511
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,690
I just think

512
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:17,800
so many people are blessing us,

513
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:19,570
yet we are deceiving them.

514
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,800
I feel bad.

515
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,340
We are just putting up a show.

516
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,130
Don't be so serious.

517
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:32,780
Walk through the painting of a hundred children playing.

518
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,660
This is the most important part of

519
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:49,050
[Peace for the People]

520
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,000
the traditional wedding customs of Heman.

521
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,530
It's called the Ceremony of Joining Clothes.

522
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,500
The couple

523
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,210
walk towards each other in this ceremony,

524
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:57,230
symbolizing their love

525
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:59,650
and dedication towards each other,

526
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:02,310
keeping no secrets from each other.

527
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:02,910
Come on.

528
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:12,950
The Ceremony of Joining Clothes.

529
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:24,890
Why aren't you moving?

530
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:27,030
Stop fooling around.

531
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:27,630
Come here.

532
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:29,870
I'm not.

533
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:31,390
In their custom,

534
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,950
the groom should be the one coming over.

535
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,590
There's no need to care about the details.

536
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:37,200
Come over.

537
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,430
What a coincidence.

538
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:39,370
I like it when the other party

539
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:40,650
takes the initiative.

540
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:43,120
What a coincidence.

541
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:44,590
I like that too.

542
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,750
Hey!

543
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:49,710
Why are you cheating?

544
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:52,590
I told you to come here.

545
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,530
The ceremony is complete!

546
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:16,170
♫Branches bare as flowers fall off♫

547
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:21,850
♫Like how I don't appear in your heart and dreams♫

548
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,830
♫When I pluck up the courage♫

549
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:29,350
♫To get a little closer♫

550
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:33,790
♫I'll hold your sleeves tightly and never push away♫

551
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,150
Yan Nanxing.

552
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:36,080
What does the wedding of your dreams

553
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,860
♫In my dream, the person in front of me looks the same♫

554
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:36,990
look like?

555
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:44,850
♫The wind blows through the building, leaving nothing♫

556
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:43,760
Unless my groom knows magic

557
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:45,550
and is able to make all flowers bloom

558
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,980
♫But I♫

559
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:47,270
in winter,

560
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:50,210
♫Left no trace♫

561
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:49,790
I'm not getting married.

562
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:51,340
So you want to marry

563
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:53,170
♫When can I stop?♫

564
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,310
A flower deity?

565
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:59,350
♫Stop thinking about you♫

566
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:57,350
They all say

567
00:29:58,590 --> 00:29:59,730
you're very beautiful today.

568
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:02,960
♫I miss you so much♫

569
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:03,960
How beautiful are you?

570
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:05,190
♫Sadness fills my heart♫

571
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:07,520
♫No matter when it ends♫

572
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:11,190
♫I have no more tears that flow by themselves♫

573
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:15,080
♫I miss you, be it right or wrong♫

574
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,460
♫The past will last forever♫

575
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:22,640
♫I just want to give you as much time♫

576
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,980
♫As I can♫

577
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:29,330
♫Be it in the past or now♫

578
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:04,650
Be careful.

579
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:15,870
Are you okay?

580
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:17,630
I'm fine.

581
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:20,310
Interesting.

582
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,270
You're laughing?

583
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:24,000
They didn't follow the custom.

584
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:25,990
Only by not following the custom can we make new ones.

585
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:26,800
Let's change

586
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:28,990
the wedding customs tomorrow.

587
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:31,540
We shall start burning red cloth

588
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:33,910
during the Ceremony of Joining Clothes from now on.

589
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:35,280
What does everyone think?

590
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,400
Good!

591
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:40,000
Singing and dancing for the guests!

592
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:43,510
Great!

593
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:45,840
Wishing you a lasting and happy marriage!

594
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:50,810
Have a harmonious family!

595
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:52,910
Have a baby soon!

596
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:55,830
Wishing you a lasting and happy marriage!

597
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:56,870
All the best!

598
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:58,410
Congratulations!

599
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,780
I know the groom can't drink much.

600
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:20,640
But tonight

601
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:22,230
is your wedding night.

602
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:23,680
You should drink

603
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:25,110
this cross-cupped wine.

604
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:29,150
Actually, we don't have to

605
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:30,750
follow all these etiquette.

606
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:38,190
Of course.

607
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,340
We must drink this.

608
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:46,250
My wife.

609
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:49,460
Please.

610
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,390
Yes.

611
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:11,990
All right.

612
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:14,350
Every moment of the night is precious.

613
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:15,510
I'll get going then.

614
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:36,310
I'm sure Gaya's pretending to be okay.

615
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,840
She must be very sad.

616
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:39,220
How about

617
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:40,540
I go to take a look at her?

618
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:41,110
Wait.

619
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:47,150
What's wrong?

620
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:48,830
I feel dizzy.

621
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:49,830
Dizzy?

622
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,570
Let me help you sit down.

623
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:09,250
He can really drink only a cup of wine.

624
00:34:09,469 --> 00:34:10,440
Look at him.

625
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,370
Get up.

626
00:34:13,429 --> 00:34:14,510
I can't move.

627
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:17,830
Lie down over there if you can't move.

628
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:18,630
My head hurts.

629
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:20,310
Get up!

630
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:21,830
Get up!

631
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:28,270
You...

632
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:30,350
You're not drunk?

633
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:33,710
Just stay here.

634
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:37,250
I...

635
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:38,280
Yan Nanxing.

636
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:41,650
After tonight,

637
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:43,950
I'll explain everything to you.

638
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:24,590
What's going on outside?

639
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:41,340
What...

640
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:44,520
What's wrong?

641
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:02,930
Be careful!

642
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:42,710
Speak.

643
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:44,390
Who sent you here?

644
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:47,230
Speak!

645
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:48,000
Mr. Xi.

646
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:00,240
Let that man and the boat go.

647
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:01,390
Or...

648
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,180
Or I’ll kill Yan Nanxing!

649
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,600
This has nothing to do with Yan Nanxing.

650
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:08,470
Let her go.

651
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,700
So...

652
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,590
So you knew

653
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:13,580
I set this up.

654
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:22,150
What?

655
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:26,460
What did you say?

656
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,010
You deceived me.

657
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:49,070
Hurry up!

658
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:50,610
Otherwise,

659
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,870
or I'll cut her throat!

660
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:06,230
Hurry up!
