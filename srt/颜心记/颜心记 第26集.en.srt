00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:55,990
So that's how the fireworks last night

6
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,110
came about.

7
00:01:59,120 --> 00:01:59,870
Boss,

8
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:01,370
do you and Mr. Jiang

9
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,290
really have to leave the capital?

10
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:04,780
No.

11
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:06,610
There must be a way.

12
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:10,310
Boss.

13
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:11,990
It's a blessing in disguise

14
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:13,210
for you and Mr. Jiang.

15
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:14,630
You're getting married.

16
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,400
What are you envious of?

17
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:19,790
It's not the first time we're getting married.

18
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:21,920
We're just going through the motions.

19
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:25,829
But...

20
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:28,010
since I can't find my mother now,

21
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,100
I am thinking of

22
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,060
getting married from Blossom Beauty.

23
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,020
You want to get married from Blossom Beauty?

24
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,510
You're sending yourself off?

25
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:36,390
How is that the case?

26
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:37,550
You two

27
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,870
are my family.

28
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:39,790
Really?

29
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:41,820
That's great!

30
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,800
In that case,

31
00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:45,030
both Ruoqian and I are now

32
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,490

33
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,720
If Mr. Jiang

34
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:48,900
dares to bully you,

35
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:49,920
I'll beat him for you.

36
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,230
Beat him?

37
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:50,829
Yes, Boss.

38
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:52,190
I'll straighten him up for you.

39
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:52,710
Come.

40
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,390
We're family from now on.

41
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:57,750
This is great.

42
00:02:58,670 --> 00:02:59,470
Let me see.

43
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,140
What should I wear?

44
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:05,490
Wedding dress?

45
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:08,680
My mother

46
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:10,870
found the best embroiderer in the capital

47
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,000
to sew it overnight.

48
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:13,590
Sewn overnight?

49
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,360
The cost must have been doubled then.

50
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:19,530
The cost is not important.

51
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,570
On the surface,

52
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:26,750
Xinbai has cut ties with the Jiang family,

53
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,790
so it's inconvenient for Mother to come here.

54
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:29,630
Mother had asked me

55
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,070
to deliver this message for her.

56
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:32,270
The Jiang family

57
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,150
has caused you to suffer.

58
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,700
Consider this priceless wedding dress

59
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,750
as a way of making up

60
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,630
towards you.

61
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,550
You Jiang's really think

62
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,010
money can solve anything.

63
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:48,590
Since we've come to this point,

64
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,160
I might as well

65
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,250
make things clear.

66
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,450
The last time I came here

67
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:54,870
was to drive you away.

68
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,310
But this time,

69
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,960
I'm here to welcome you

70
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:06,080
as you marry into the Jiang family.

71
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:12,610
Speaking of welcome,

72
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:15,890
how do you plan on showing it?

73
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,630
What do you want?

74
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,500
How about...

75
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,640
You call me sister-in-law?

76
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:26,950
Don't push your luck.

77
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,350
Don't be shy.

78
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,490
After I marry into your family,

79
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:32,110
you have to call me that sooner or later.

80
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:33,790
You could... try it now.

81
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:35,050
Get some practice.

82
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:37,510
No.

83
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,390
That's fine.

85
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:45,990
you siblings are up to.

and Li Jun?

89
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,720
He doesn't want you to know,

90
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,510
because he was afraid

91
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:57,659
you would treat this wedding as an act.

92
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,950
He really wants to marry you.

93
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:03,950
I know.

94
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,320
So, you just have to prepare

95
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,320
for this wedding.

96

you look so beautiful today.

107

Seeing you like this,

108

it makes me want to get married.

109

111
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,420
also send you off.

Yan Nanxing.

228
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:57,900
I'm sorry.

229
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:00,390
Due to circumstances,

230
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,550
I couldn't give you

231
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:05,590
a grander wedding than what we had at Heman.

232
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:07,150
But...

233
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:12,440
I'm sure you know

234
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:14,550
how I feel.

235
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:41,590
Tonight,

236
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:44,570
you must be beautiful.

237
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:48,750
I really wish I could

238
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,790
see your face clearly.

239
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:44,770
♫I'll fetch you the moon in my heart♫

240

Wait!

252
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,230
I...

253
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:33,950
I...

254
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:36,080
Yan Nanxing.

255
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:38,430
You are...

256
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:41,310
You are not feeling shy, are you?

257
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,110
I'm not feeling shy.

258
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:45,630
I think...

259
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:46,430
Don't worry.

260
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:48,520
I will be gentle.

261
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,860
Are you still playing that trick?

262
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,350
I didn’t expect you, Yan Nanxing,

263
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:15,010
who is not afraid of anything,

264
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,020
to actually get shy.

265
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:26,870
Yan Nanxing.

266
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:29,190
Are you…

267
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:37,430
Why is it tonight?

268
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:40,790
It's my wedding night tonight!

269
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:47,910
Tonight?

270
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,820
How would I know, Brother?

271
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:52,190
It's not even a full moon tonight!

272
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:53,150
That's why!

273
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:55,170
Why on earth is this happening?

274
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:56,850
How would I know?

275
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:00,430
My dear.

276
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,020
Please.

277
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:04,599
Let me shapeshift back!

278
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:14,440
Of all times, Li Jun chose to

279
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,470
leave tonight,

280
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:17,200
when it's their wedding night.

281
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:29,580
According to the capital's wedding customs,

282
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,550
the couple must share

283
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:33,060
a bowl of longan red date soup

284
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,140
on their wedding.

285
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:35,430
It symbolizes

286
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,830
a sweet marriage.

287
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,760
It's not sweet at all.

288
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,400
How can it be sweet?

289
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,570
Why is your shapeshifting

290
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,410
getting more and more irregular?

291
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:53,130
How would I know?

292
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:54,330
Do you think I want to?

293
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:57,720
Forget it.

294
00:17:58,870 --> 00:17:59,860
I'm not angry.

295
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:01,580
I'm angry.

296
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,070
No hurry.

297
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,020
We have many days ahead of us.

298
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:08,980
Drink slowly.

299
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:22,930
It's Yao.

300
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,100
Yao?

301
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,490
What is he doing here on the wedding night?

302
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:32,090
I asked Yao to keep an eye on Li Jun.

303
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,230
Once Li Jun leaves the city,

304
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:35,030
he has to inform me immediately.

305
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:38,070
You even arranged tasks for yourself

306
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,030
on your wedding night?

307
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,560
How could I have expected Li Jun

308
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,020
to leave the city tonight?

309
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,610
It's just like how I didn't expect

310
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:49,670
you would shapeshift tonight.

311
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:53,550
You want to deal with Li Jun?

312
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:54,410
I want to go too.

313
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:56,910
What are you going to do?

314
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:59,190
Li Jun is cunning.

315
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:00,670
For all you know,

316
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,150
he might recognize you guys.

317
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:02,750
Look at me.

318
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,340
A complete stranger.

319
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,310
It will be seamless.

320
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,800
That actually makes sense.

321
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,270
But...

322
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,520
You don't think I look like a killer?

323
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:20,110
You do, just a bit.

324
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:40,350
That's good.

325
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,190
Go lower.

326
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:46,440
Come on.

327
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,840
You can go a little lower.

328
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:52,960
Yes.

329
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:54,310
Okay.

330
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,230
Yes, yes.

331
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,420
Go lower.

332
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,290
Where are you?

333
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:03,380
Didn't I tell you to

334
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:04,630
go a little lower?

335
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:08,310
W-Who are you?

336
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:09,590
Who are you?

337
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:11,950
It's obvious, can't you tell?

338
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,960
Someone hired us to kill you.

339
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:15,110
Hitmen?

340
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:16,600
Let me tell you.

341
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:18,250
I'm a court official.

342
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:18,910
If you dare...

343
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:20,170
We're precisely in...

344
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,910
the business of bloodshed.

345
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:23,920
What we're after is exactly you,

346
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:25,270
this court official.

347
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:26,710
Brother.

348
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,220
When we get the reward,

349
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:30,150
let's all have have fun for a while.

350
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:31,010
Do it.

351
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:33,060
Wait, wait.

352
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:34,520
Guys, I have money.

353
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:35,590
How about this?

354
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,720
However much the other party offered, I will...

355
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,350
double.

356
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,690
Double!

357
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:48,260
Help!

358
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,520
Kill... kill...

359
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,800
You still want to resist?

360
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:57,630
T-They're all dead?

361
00:20:58,470 --> 00:20:59,350
No, no, no.

362
00:20:59,390 --> 00:20:59,920
Good lad.

363
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:01,570
Please spare me.

364
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:02,720
Spare your life?

365
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:03,670
Tell me.

366
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:06,310
Why should I spare your life?

367
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:08,390
Sir, I have money.

368
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:10,350
Double, triple or even five times more.

369
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:11,610
I'll give it all to you.

370
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:14,880
Who cares about your filthy money?

371
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,590
I'm a man of rules as a hitman.

372
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:21,080
Don't think you can bribe me

373
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:22,590
just because you have money.

374
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:23,320
How about...

375
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:25,740
you tell me what you want?

376
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:27,030
I, Li Jun,

377
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:28,230
will be your pawn

378
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:30,290
even if it's at the expense of my life.

379
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:33,590
Will you keep your promise?

380
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:34,310
Yes.

381
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:38,070
What if I wanted you dead?

382
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:38,800
Don't!

383
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:41,710
I have a family.

384
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:43,430
Don't kill me! Don't kill me!

385
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,070
Please, I'm begging you.

386
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:53,790
What?

387
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:56,370
You even called for accomplices?

388
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:59,210
So, you've been lying to me all along.

389
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:00,970
I... I didn't, Sir.

390
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,760
I... I don't know who they are.

391
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,970
I don't know them.

392
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:10,240
You've done so many immoral deeds.

393
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:13,450
How could my hirer be your only enemy?

394
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:16,350
If they are not your accomplices,

395
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,760
then they must have come for revenge.

396
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:22,810
Rather than dying in their hands,

397
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:24,440
why not

398
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:28,130
die by my hand instead?

399
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:28,760
Don't!

400
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,190
Don't... Don't kill me!

401
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:39,820
Come!

402
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:45,470
You're hurting me.

403
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:49,670
Who are you?

404
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,350
A friend.

405
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:57,820
Mr. Yan.

406
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,970
I'm Xinbai's man.

407
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:08,470
Where is he?

408
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:13,070
He needed to hurry back to the city, so he left first.

409
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:14,790
He left me behind to

410
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,480
stall Li Jun and wait for you.

411
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:20,990
Understood.

412
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:22,890
Mr. Li.

413
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:24,990
Mr. Li?

414
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,720
Don't.. don’t kill me!

415
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:30,070
Chief Constable Yan,

416
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,860
he wants to kill me.

417
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:32,790
Mr. Yan,

418
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:33,670
please help me.

419
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,140
Mr. Yan.

420
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:36,030
Li Jun,

421
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:37,810
is there any truth in your words?

422
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:38,300
You...

423
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:39,550
Didn't you say

424
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:41,150
you don't know them?

425
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:43,310
This man is ruthless.

426
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:43,830
Look.

427
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:46,430
He killed all my servants.

428
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:47,230
Mr. Yan,

429
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:49,410
you have to uphold justice for me.

430
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:51,230
Mr. Li,

431
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:52,760
don't worry.

432
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:55,250
Justice lies in the heart of all of us.

433
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:57,030
By the way, Mr. Yan,

434
00:23:57,890 --> 00:23:59,170
what brings you here?

435
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:05,990
Shang Bieli reported to the Inspection Office

436
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:07,320
saying that you, Mr. Li,

437
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:09,150
might have something to do with General Nan's death.

438
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:10,790
That's why I'm here to invite you to

439
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,660
go back to the capital for investigation.

440
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,540
Also, Mr. Li,

441
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,170
you took leave to go back to your hometown.

442
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:18,230
Why did you divert elsewhere midway?

443
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:21,950
How did you come to know that

444
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:23,510
I diverted elsewhere?

445
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:29,060
Don't kill me! Don't kill me!

446
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:32,050
Detain him!

447
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:36,360
Tell me, who ordered you to do this?

448
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:37,810
Where is your accomplice?

449
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,930
Every profession has its own rules.

450
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:42,500
I'd never betray my brother!

451
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:46,320
You... you're such a prick.

452
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:54,140
Young man, you're quite stubborn.

453
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:57,990
No, don't!

454
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:01,800
I'm just taking money and

455
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:03,030
doing others a favor.

456
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:03,750
Tell me.

457
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:05,270
Who sent you here?

458
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:08,450
I-I can't tell you.

459
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:10,060
I'll die if I do.

460
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,680
If you don't tell me,

461
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,360
you'll die right now.

462
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:14,430
I...

463
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:15,890
I'll tell you! I'll!

464
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:17,390
It's Mr. Lu, Lu Dingzhao.

465
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:19,810
-Lu Dingzhao gave us the orders.
-What?

466
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:21,110
Mr. Lu.

467
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:22,430
Nonsense!

468
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:23,790
Mr. Lu is

469
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:24,980
a fourth-rank official,

470
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:26,430
and also Mr. Li's father-in-law.

471
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:28,290
How could he possibly hurt Mr. Li?

472
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:30,230
You want to die, don't you?

473
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:32,100
I'll kill you!

474
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:32,710
Wait!

475
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:34,410
It really is him.

476
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:39,870
Mr. Li.

477
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,710
Is what he said true?

478
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:43,130
As in-laws, you two

479
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:44,910
shouldn't be like this.

480
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:46,450
What exactly is going on?

481
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:49,080
He wasn't even looking to send me away.

482
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:50,290
He wanted me to die.

483
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:53,470
My lord, look!

484
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:55,650
I've told you everything.

485
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:57,010
I'm telling the truth.

486
00:25:57,010 --> 00:25:58,010
Did you hear that?

487
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,220
I can

488
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,430
hand over the money

489
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:02,870
Mr. Lu Dingzhao gave me

490
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:04,110
to bribe me.

491
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,770
I don't deserve to die, my lord.

492
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,550
It's not just enough to pay.

493
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:10,390
You have go back and be a witness.

494
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,750
I can consider that as redeeming yourself.

495
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:13,790
Mr. Lu, no.

496
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,710
Old man Lu is ruthless.

497
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,530
He can even try to kill his son-in-law.

498
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:21,630
If you want me to be a witness,

499
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:22,900
you might as well

500
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:23,860
kill me now.

501
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,870
Okay, I won't stand on ceremony then.

502
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:27,270
If he won't testify, I’ll testify.

503
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:28,240
I want to expose Lu Dingzhao

504
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,570
for killing Nan Jifeng.

505
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:33,390
Mr. Li,

506
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,320
do you have evidence?

507
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:36,680
I am the witness.

508
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,510
Lu Dingzhao killed Nan Jifeng.

509
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:40,690
He's the main culprit and I'm his accomplice.

510
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:41,250
Besides,

511
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:42,910
Lu Dingzhao not only killed Nan Jifeng.

512
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:43,350
He...

513
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:48,270
Mr. Yan.

514
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:50,230
I have something more important to report

515
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:52,110
to His Majesty back in the capital.

516
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,110
I'll leave first.

517
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,780
Escort Mr. Li back to the capital.

518
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:55,400
Yes.

519
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:00,000
Come, give me a hand.

520
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:15,470
Bro.

521
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:17,160
Thank you.

522
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:19,030
I'm used to it.

523
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:20,510
Jiang Xinbai

524
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:22,450
used to play with me like this too.

525
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,190
I knew it.

526
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:27,470
I'm sorry.

527
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,580
It's just that, when I swung my body up just now...

528
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:30,610
My back...

529
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,390
I sprained my back.

530
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:33,110
Go stretch.

531
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:33,750
Okay.

532
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:34,530
I'll be off.

533
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:35,160
Let's go.

534
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:35,690
Let's go.

535
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:37,780
Go.

536
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:42,840
[Remarkable past and present]

537
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:05,640
Official Lu.

538
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:08,680
How do you explain this?

539
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:12,830
Your Majesty,

540
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:15,310
Prince of Weiding and I

541
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:17,350
are friends in calligraphy and painting.

542
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:19,630
We've been in touch with each other

543
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:21,990
to admire the posthumous works of

544
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,700
famous artists together.

545
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:25,030
It was just amicable chat.

546
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:26,110
But somehow,

547
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:28,630
it has caused him to misunderstand.

548
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:33,680
Your Majesty,

549
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:37,380
please help me.

550
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:39,310
Rise.

551
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:41,190
Thank you, Your Majesty.

552
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:46,460
Report! Duke of Yuejiang, Jiang Xinbai,

553
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:47,970
asks to see Your Majesty.

554
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:50,570
Send him in.

555
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:03,070
Greetings, Your Majesty.

556
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:04,190
Rise.

557
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,080
Thank you, Your Majesty.

558
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:11,010
Mr. Jiang, you came at the right time.

559
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:13,340
Official Lu was just telling me about

560
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,890
how he was just pen pals with Prince of Weiding.

561
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,510
But somehow, he had offended you.

562
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:22,160
He even asked me for a favor

563
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:24,310
to make peace with you.

564
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:27,230
Your Majesty,

565
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,270
profits from sales of Zornia are transacted in paintings and calligraphy.

566
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:32,280
It may seem unrelated, but it is.

567
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:34,220
The painting from Mr. Lu

568
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:35,710
is ill-gotten gains.

569
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:37,140
This is not just a trap,

570
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:39,410
but also evidence of Li Wufang

571
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:41,370
profiteering off sales of Zornia.

572
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:42,560
Your Majesty,

573
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:44,330
it seems that Mr. Jiang's

574
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,980
misunderstanding of me runs deep.

575
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:50,530
But the matter of Zornia is very significant.

576
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:55,830
Your Grace, please watch your words.

577
00:29:58,750 --> 00:29:59,280
Alright.

578
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:00,210
Jiang Xinbai.

579
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,780
I exiled you to

580
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,060
Yazhou for three years

581
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:06,880
for you to reflect on yourself.

582
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:10,960
When you return to court, I expect you to serve the country well.

583
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:12,690
You know what's on my mind,

584
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:14,230
don't you?

585
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:18,030
Li Wufang has now been exiled.

586
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:20,720
I think these calligraphy and paintings

587
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,810
can be handed over to

588
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:24,070
the Inspection Office for safekeeping.

589
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:28,580
Your Majesty is wise.

590
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,120
I will never forget

591
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:32,270
the trouble you have taken.

592
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:34,230
Before I leave,

593
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:35,150
I...

594
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:37,890
have one more thing to share.

595
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:39,990
Go ahead.

596
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,020
Although I have resigned,

597
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:44,670
but the case of Zornia

598
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:46,010
has not been resolved.

599
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:47,000
It might...

600
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:49,380
even involve others.

601
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:54,030
Your Majesty, please allow me to report.

602
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,280
You...

603
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:56,850
Report!

604
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,720
Mr. Yan from the Inspection Office

605
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,520
has something urgent to report.

606
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:02,490
Send him in.

607
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:18,620
Greetings, Your Majesty. I'm Yan Qingyun.

608
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:19,870
Rise.

609
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:22,150
Thank you, Your Majesty.

610
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:25,620
Mr. Li, didn't you go back to your hometown to recuperate?

611
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,640
Mr. Yan, what happened?

612
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:30,670
Your Majesty,

613
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:32,010
the Inspection Office

614
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:33,790
has been investigating General Nan's death.

615
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:34,590
As a witness,

616
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,900
he can identify the murderer.

617
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:50,060
Greetings, Your Majesty. I'm Li Jun.

618
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:52,030
Who is the murderer?

619
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:54,030
Your Majesty.

620
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:56,550
It's Lu Dingzhao.

621
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:01,110
Li Jun.

622
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:03,590
This is the Imperial Study.

623
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,160
Don't you dare talk nonsense

624
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,220
and accuse others!

625
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:07,110
Your Majesty,

626
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:08,990
I dare not lie to you.

627
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:11,870
I was ordered by Lu Dingzhao

628
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:15,150
to bribe bandits and assassinate General Nan.

629
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:19,350
Your Majesty.

630
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:22,450
I have no grudge against General Nan.

631
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:23,340
There's no reason for me

632
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:24,870
to want to kill General Nan.

633
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:26,320
You knew that General Nan

634
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,980
was helping Mr. Jiang investigate the case.

635
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,800
You were afraid of being found out,

636
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,900
so you killed him.

637
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:32,070
Your Majesty,

638
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:34,780
I have no idea what Li Jun is

639
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:35,660
talking about.

640
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:36,740
I also didn't know

641
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:39,120
General Nan was helping His Grace

642
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:39,810
on the case.

643
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,680
Go on. What case?

644
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:48,350
Your Majesty.

645
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,830
Everything Lu Dingzhao did

646
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:53,570
was aimed at the Duke of Yuejiang.

647
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:56,100
On the fifth night of this month,

648
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:58,160
fireworks broke out through the city.

649
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,070
It was also Lu Dingzhao who

650
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:00,800
ordered me to set off fireworks

651
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:02,590
in order to frame His Grace,

652
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:03,480
and sow discord

653
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:05,790
between Your Majesty and His Grace.

654
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:06,790
Well Li Jun,

655
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:08,870
since you've admitted that

656
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:10,950
these were events orchestrated by you,

657
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:12,080
then go and bring the bandits

658
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,260
who set off the fireworks

659
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:14,460
to come and see me for a

660
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,010
face-to-face confrontation.

661
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:17,750
Don't you dare try to

662
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,010
throw dirt on me.

663
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:21,710
Do you have witness or evidence?

664
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,780
Even if there is even one witness,

665
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:27,150
I wouldn't need Your Majesty to judge.

666
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:27,860
I'll

667
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:30,830
kill myself on the spot and apologize with my life.

668
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:40,440
Lu Dingzhao!

669
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:42,180
You sent me away

670
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:44,470
and destroyed all the evidence

671
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:47,600
just so that you could push the blame on me.

672
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:48,470
Li Jun.

673
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:51,390
Your claims are merely empty words.

674
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:53,230
Do you have any evidence?

675
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,040
Your Majesty.

676
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:01,480
Yes!

677
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:04,390
Li Wufang is the witness.

678
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,840
Li Wufang is your son.

679
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:08,949
Of course, he'll do whatever you say.

680
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:09,870
Besides,

681
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:11,540
how can the words of

682
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:13,570
a criminal in exile be trusted?

683
00:34:20,989 --> 00:34:21,650
And also...

684
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:23,920
Your Majesty...

685
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,429
Your grandson, Lu Bo'an.

686
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:30,020
Your Majesty.

687
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:32,440
Bo'an has traveled to the State of Miluo.

688
00:34:32,989 --> 00:34:34,710
If His Majesty decrees,

689
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:35,590
I can

690
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:37,480
ask someone to find him.

691
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:39,770
But, it'll take a few days.

692
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:57,070
Your Majesty.

693
00:34:57,910 --> 00:34:58,830
Lu Bo'an

694
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:01,040
has never left the capital.

695
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:10,910
Xinbai.

696
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:13,170
Lu Bo'an didn't come to school today.

697
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,040
It's Lu Dingzhao.

698
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:17,900
Lu Dingzhao wants to send Lu Bo'an

699
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:18,960
out of the capital.

700
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:24,100
Go and find Shang Bieli.

701
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,410
You must stop Lu Bo'an.

702
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:36,730
Greetings, Your Majesty.

703
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:38,030
Rise.

704
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:41,540
Your Majesty.

705
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:42,740
Lu Bo'an has arrived.

706
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:44,130
He has already told me that

707
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:45,780
he, Li Jun, and Li Wufang

708
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:49,340
had been making money from forged paintings and calligraphy.

709
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:51,070
Lu Bo'an,

710
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:53,800
What kind of money did you make?

711
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,990
What do you know?

712
00:35:56,310 --> 00:35:56,870
I...

713
00:35:57,270 --> 00:35:58,000
I don't know.

714
00:35:58,070 --> 00:35:58,390
I...

715
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:02,300
Your Majesty.

716
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,590
I'm asking Lu Bo'an!

717
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:09,190
Grandfather! Grandfather!

718
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,660
Help me, Grandfather!

719
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:11,590
Grandfather!

720
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:12,890
Help me, Grandfather!

721
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:14,470
Bo’an.

722
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:16,730
If you have anything to confess,

723
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:18,270
just tell us.

724
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:19,910
His Majesty

725
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,880
will uphold justice for you.

726
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:23,450
Grandfather.

727
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:25,260
I don't want to die, Grandfather.

728
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:25,780
Bo’an.

729
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,050
I know.

730
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:28,310
My child.

731
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:30,060
Don't worry.

732
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:33,990
Your grandfather has his own plans.

733
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,640
He won’t implicate the innocent.

734
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:02,390
Grandfather!

735
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:04,270
Grandfather! Help me! Grandfather!

736
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:05,070
Grandfather.

737
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:11,430
Grandfather. Grandfather.

738
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:14,990
Your Majesty.

739
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:16,710
Bo'an is still young.

740
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,040
Let me explain.

741
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:19,140
Explain what?

742
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:20,710
At this point,

743
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,350
you're still trying to defend yourself?

744
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:23,270
Guards!

745
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:24,700
Li Jun.

746
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:27,010
If you don't tell us today

747
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:28,820
what case you were investigating,

748
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:30,710
and what kind of money you collected,

749
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:32,430
I'll drag you and Lu Bo'an

750
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,270
to be beheaded.

751
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:35,440
Grandfather!

752
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,040
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

753
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,040
Your Majesty!

754
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:39,710
I'm innocent, Your Majesty!

755
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:44,550
Protect His Majesty!

756
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,040
Protect His Majesty!

757
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,270
Don't come over!

758
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:50,560
Don't come over!

759
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:52,910
Lu Dingzhao!

760
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:54,830
Don't do anything stupid.

761
00:37:56,430 --> 00:37:57,230
Your Majesty,

762
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:01,230
I was framed by a villain.

763
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:02,820
I have nothing to say.

764
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:05,440
I have to die to prove my innocence.

765
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:07,840
Your Majesty,

766
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:10,610
on the account of

767
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,140
my loyalty to Your Majesty and the court,

768
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:15,790
please spare the Lu family

769
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:17,910
from death.

770
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:23,300
Grandfather

771
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:25,520
Lu Dingzhao!

772
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:26,680
Lu Dingzhao!

773
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:37,510
Your Majesty.

774
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:38,660
Lu Dingzhao

775
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:40,360
is officially dead.

776
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:45,680
I can't believe we failed at the very last hurdle.

777
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:47,310
A mystery

778
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:49,340
is about to come to light.

779
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,490
Jiang Xinbai, listen to my decree.

780
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:56,630
I order you

781
00:38:57,630 --> 00:39:00,030
to find out the mastermind behind all this.

782
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:01,970
Yes, Your Majesty.
