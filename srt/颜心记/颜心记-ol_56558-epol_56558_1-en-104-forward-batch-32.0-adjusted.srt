Wind is the fragrance of osmanthus.

165
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,800
Flower is the clusters of roses.

166
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:43,670
Snow is the snowy mountain's spring water.

167

Moon is the red clay stove.

168

00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,710
Mr. Xi, please wait.

180
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:56,850
This tea is called "Entrancement".

181
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:58,720
Please try it.

182
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:30,040
It's good stuff indeed.

183
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,110
Mr. Xi.

184
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:32,670
You're new here.

185
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,940
Take some goods and test them in the streets.

186
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:54,830
I want to see the big boss

187
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:55,670
of this world.

188
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:56,830
This money

189
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,230
is

190
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,850
your introduction fee.

191
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:01,190
Okay?

192
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:05,070
I'm the big boss.

193
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:07,470
I have the final say

194
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:09,890
in everything.

195
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:18,790
I'll be frank with you.

196
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:19,990
I know

197
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,180
you are

198
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,910
number one

199
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:23,870
in Heman,

200
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:25,530
but you aren't a big shot.

201
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,470
Please pass my message.

202
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:28,940
I'm sincere

203
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,640
about doing business.

204
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:32,210
If we get along,

205
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:33,070
money

206
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:34,570
isn't a problem.

207
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:35,830
Mr. Xi.

208
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:39,630
This is different from

209
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:40,890
what we discussed.

210
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:46,060
It's the same.

211
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:48,070
I just wanna make more money.

212
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:49,490
It's human nature.

213
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:56,690
I'll wait for your good news.

214
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:00,690
Wait a minute.

215
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,830
The deal's not done yet.

216
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:08,920
Sorry for the trouble then.

217
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:12,720
Goodbye.

218
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:14,280
Let's go.

219
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,640
Mr. San.

220
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:53,000
This isn't how business is talked.

221
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,010
Are you talking business?

222
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:57,420
Then what is it?

223
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:16,560
Someone's dead!

224
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,170
Someone's dead!

225
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:19,590
Someone's dead!

226
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:21,590
Murder!

227
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:22,450
Murder!

228
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,390
Clean up!

229
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:36,690
What are you doing?

230
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:38,950
What's going on?

231
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:43,140
Move.

232
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:01,190
Bravo!

233
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:07,710
Who are you?

234
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:13,460
Get down!

235
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:21,390
And who are you?

236
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:22,630
Don't disturb our opera.

237
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:23,310
Step aside.

238
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,660
This is my turf.

239
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,680
You two can scram!

240
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,160
Who the hell are you?

241
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,110
I'm not with you.

242
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:01,550
Miss.

243
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:03,690
This thief stole my money.

244
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,730
It's up to me how I deal with him.

245
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:06,640
I don't care.

246
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:07,410
Get down!

247
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,420
Stop fighting!

248
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:12,590
Stop before

249
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:13,690
you kill someone.

250
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:14,930
I just saw

251
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:16,230
soldiers coming.

252
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,820
Let's just compromise

253
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,060
and stop here.

254
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:20,150
Okay?

255
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,440
He's dead!

256
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:35,200
Someone's dead!

257
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:37,270
What's going on?

258
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,310
Out of the blue?

259
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:42,640
Someone's dead!

260
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:45,870
Move!

261
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:46,470
Move!

262
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,420
[Lieutenant General Li]

263
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,890
Excuse me.

264
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,000
Killing someone

265
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,160
by faking it as acting?

266
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:17,780
Officer.

267
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,050
You misunderstood.

268
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,360
That thief

269
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:21,450
barged in.

270
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:22,590
It was an accident.

271
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:24,430
Everyone can testify,

272
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:25,150
right?

273
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,660
Yes, we can testify!

274
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:27,550
We can testify!

275
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:29,830
We can testify!

276
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,150
Nonsense!

277
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,480
Take everyone on stage away!

278
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:34,460
Yes!

279
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:35,990
Wait!

280
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:36,790
Wait.

281
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:38,300
Officer.

282
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:41,210
I set the stage.

283
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,270
I'll take

284
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,320
full responsibility.

285
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,200
I'll go with you to see the general.

286
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,810
Don't implicate others.

287
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:48,860
Of course you can't escape.

288
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,640
Even without this murder,

289
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,810
you'd be condemned.

290
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,890
Out of all the operas,

291
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,450
you insisted on "Li Ji Slays the Serpent".

292
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,030
You're asking for trouble!

293
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:02,480
Could she've

294
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:04,250
put on this show

295
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:05,690
to meet Nan Jifeng?

296
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:10,670
Officer.

297
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,200
Actually, I'm involved

298
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,050
in his death.

299
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:18,970
I'll go cooperate with your investigation.

300
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,400
Who the hell are you?

301
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:25,030
Who are you?

302
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:29,910
I'm just

303
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:32,230
an ordinary tea merchant.

304
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:32,980
Tea merchant?

305
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:33,570
Officer!

306
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:35,920
I did it.

307
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:37,380
It's unrelated with you.

308
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:38,550
Besides,

309
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:39,920
they want to take me away

310
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,610
not only for the thief's death

311
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:43,510
but also for the opera.

312
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:43,950
You...

313
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:45,750
All the more should I go with you.

314
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,760
I've only heard of being convicted for one's words,

315
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,850
and not for singing operas.

316
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:54,760
I want to see

317
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:55,830
how powerful

318
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:57,890
the general is.

319
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,720
How dare you slander our general!

320
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,460
Take him away too!

321
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:03,090
Yes!

322
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,200

323
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:05,270
Calm down, Officer.

00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:06,630
Calm down, Officer.

Thank you for your righteous words.

326
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:12,090
I appreciate your kindness.

327
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:13,050
But I don't like

328
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:14,170
to implicate others.

329
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:14,920
Leave now.

330
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:16,670
I'm not doing this for you.

331
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:18,220
Then for whom?

332
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,600
It's my own business.

333
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,190
Go. Don't be stubborn.

334
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:23,710
Go.

335
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,540
Stop arguing.

336
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:25,770
Take them all away!

337
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:26,270
Yes!

338
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:28,920

339
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:43,870

Let's go.

343
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:51,840
Let's go.

Why didn't they arrest you?

351

Did Nan Jifeng

352
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:16,070
catch on to us

353
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:18,570
and is just not exposing us for now?

00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,460
claiming to be from Yazhou

358
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,790
was living outside the city

359
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:43,450
and just met Bai San and Ma Jiu.

360
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:45,070
It's his first night in the city.

361
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:45,990
Ma Jiu and Bai San

362
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,120
died because of him.

363
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,720
Two inferior men died.

364
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,770
Don't make a fuss.

365
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:56,010
Keep an eye on

366
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:57,810
the tea merchant.

367
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,200
Yes, General.

368
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:02,280
Where's the female traveling doctor?

369
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:04,110
She's been sent to Her Ladyship.

370
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,650
Your Ladyship, she's here.

371
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,030
You may all leave.

372
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,270
Yes.

373
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:36,140
Yan Nanxing.

374
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,230
Greetings, Your Ladyship.

375
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:51,790
You and your mother

376
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:53,250
[General's wife, Gaya]

377
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:53,450
consulted for days in the city

378
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:54,270
just to

379
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:55,670
get my attention, right?

380
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:01,150
You deliberately arranged tonight's show

381
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,680
because you couldn't wait to see me.

382
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:07,180
So you already knew.

383
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,190
I was being a smarty pants.

384
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:12,460
I haven't been out

385
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:13,500
for a long time.

386
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:16,520
What are the rumors about me?

387
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:18,350
They say

388
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,750
you're a reincarnated snake fairy.

389
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:33,150
You're so sweet.

390
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:34,950
They clearly say

391
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:36,310
I'm a reincarnated snake demon

392
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:37,710
bewitching the general.

393
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:39,340
They're ignorant.

394
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:41,570
Your Ladyship just has

395
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,990
a minor skin disease.

396
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,670
To be honest,

397
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:47,990
my mother and I

398
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:49,590
heard this rumor while consulting

399
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:51,050
at a nearby state capital.

400
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:52,800
I was already guessing

401
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:54,510
you have a rare

402
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:55,770
silver snake disease.

403
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,520
So I came to Heman

404
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:58,700
to treat you.

405
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,580
I wanted to wait for you

406
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,600
to summon us.

407
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:03,510
But I heard you're

408
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:04,600
returning to

409
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:05,890
your maiden home soon.

410
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:07,670
So in a panic,

411
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,260
I resorted to this.

412
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:12,430
You are well-informed.

413
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:15,540
General did ask me to return to my maiden home.

414
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:16,380
But the date

415
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:18,240
hasn't been set yet.

416
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:22,310
Fake news?

417
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:24,770
Since you're here,

418
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:26,940
please treat me.

419
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,800
Of course.

420
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:30,690
After the full moon,

421
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:32,070
I'll treat you.

422
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:33,760
After the full moon?

423
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:36,190
Can you only treat

424
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:38,310
on auspicious days?

425
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:40,330
It's because

426
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:42,460
I use unique recipes.

427
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:45,550
I need to prepare some herbs carefully.

428
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:47,640
Preparing well is the key to success.

429
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,640
Please pardon me.

430
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:54,910
General said

431
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:56,150
since you're here,

432
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:56,950
don’t leave.

433
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,710
Ridiculous!

434
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:03,630
How dare they detain you!

435
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:05,210
And you. Don't you have legs?

436
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:06,270
Why didn't you run?

437
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:08,590
You know that

438
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:11,240
with my shabby skills,

439
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:13,150
I can’t defeat the men here.

440
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,490
Besides,

441
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:15,920
even if I defeat them,

442
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,670
how can I

443
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:17,660
get in again?

444
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:18,940
Our plan will be

445
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,040
all ruined.

446
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:24,610
You sure are my kid.

447
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:27,550
You have a pretty face

448
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:29,950
and a meticulous brain.

449
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,400
I have a meticulous brain.

450
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:35,490
What about you?

451
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:37,550
You paid so much

452
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:38,830
for fake news.

453
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:40,440
General's wife is

454
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,190
leaving soon?

455
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:41,750
But they

456
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:43,280
haven't even set a date.

457
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,480
Is it all my fault?

458
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:48,170
Didn't you believe it?

459
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:49,990
What's this?

460
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,810
Tea. It's fresh.

461
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,010
Have some.

462
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:57,610
Her Ladyship wants treatment

463
00:26:57,610 --> 00:26:58,440
in three days.

464
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,970
The full moon is in three days,

465
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:03,020
when I'll menstruate.

466
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:05,190
Menstruation!

467
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,610
We'll be doomed.

468
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:09,050
So annoying.

469
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:10,590
Listen.

470
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:12,420
Count on me.

471
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:14,070
Everything will

472
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:15,190
be fine.

473
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,100
You said the same thing last time.

474
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:18,470
Last time...

475
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,400
that was a unique situation.

476
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:21,550
It'll be different this time.

477
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:21,950
Here.

478
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:24,830
Keep this secret whistle on you.

479
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:26,030
In an emergency,

480
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:26,720
just blow it

481
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:27,930
and I'll show up.

482
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:30,150
Will it work?

483
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,460
You said the same thing last time.

484
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:34,190
Why not?

485
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,680
Whenever

486
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:37,670
it is,

487
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:40,070
I'm always by your side.

488
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:41,670
I'll protect you

489
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:43,360
whenever you're in danger.

490
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:44,310
Besides,

491
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:46,800
once we get Her Ladyship's

492
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:49,310
magical medicine,

493
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:51,490
you'll be completely free

494
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,560
and no longer afraid of the full moon.

495
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:57,110
Is that medicine really so magical?

496
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:58,070
Of course.

497
00:27:58,670 --> 00:27:59,670
How would you know

498
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,800
if you don't try it?

499
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:03,120
The most important thing now

500
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,650
is to win Her Ladyship's favor.

501
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:06,850
As for the rest,

502
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:08,230
count on me.

503
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:10,030
Everything will be fine.

504
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:12,290
Why are you copying me?

505
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:13,630
It'd better be so.

506
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:26,670
What is

507
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:28,330
Nan Jifeng's deal?

508
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:30,940
It's been a day.

509
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,520
He just sent men

510
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:33,550
to keep an eye on us;

511
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:34,960
nothing else.

512
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:36,990
He's so calm.

513
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:39,190
Has he found out

514
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:40,220
our identities?

515
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:43,150
Impossible.

516
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,030
Our trip is confidential.

517
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:47,590
Just in case,

518
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:50,230
let's not stay in inns from tomorrow.

519
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:51,310
Where will we live?

520
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,890
A place that's easy to defend and hard to attack.

521
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:08,110
Renting a pleasure boat without courtesans?

522
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:10,020
Your boss

523
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:11,750
is really strange.

524
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,090
Exactly.

525
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:14,150
You can

526
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,520
just keep this money.

527
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:17,490
Have the girls sing and dance

528
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:18,830
as usual.

529
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:20,750
Based on the usual rate,

530
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:22,830
we'll pay for

531
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:24,670
all the expenses.

532
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:30,070
I've met

533
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,410
you two at a restaurant.

534
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,520
You caused such chaos.

535
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:37,150
Someone even died.

536
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,390
Are you two

537
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:41,670
killers?

538
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:44,490
Madam, come on.

539
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:46,800
We did that for justice.

540
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:48,550
If we were really evil,

541
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:49,960
we'd be convicted

542
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:50,770
already.

543
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:53,960
Well...

544
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:55,030
Don't worry.

545
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:00,190
Of course.

546
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:08,150
My lord.

547
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,230
It's been two days.

548
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:10,960
Still nothing from Nan Jifeng.

549
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:11,950
In my opinion,

550
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:13,150
you should use

551
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:14,770
the Inspection Office badge

552
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:16,150
to transfer soldiers over

553
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:17,680
to surround his residence.

554
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,430
Nan Jifeng's earned military merits

555
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:20,910
to be sent to Heman.

556
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:24,010
Even the Inspection Office

557
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:25,630
must have evidence

558
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:26,390
to arrest

559
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:27,650
a general with merits.

560
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,030
Isn't this evidence?

561
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:40,550
It's a lack of supervision at most.

562
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:42,690
We might not be able to arrest him.

563
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,750
I came all the way here

564
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:45,740
to seal off

565
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:47,960
the Zornia trade route

566
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:49,170
and arrest

567
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:51,230
all their big fish in Heman

568
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,700
once and for all.

569
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:58,630
Tonight,

570
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:01,440
let's check out the General's Residence.

571
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:18,400
Your Ladyship, how do you feel?

572
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:22,790
I feel hot and relaxed.

573
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:25,030
The itching

574
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,840
seems to have subsided.

575
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:28,880
When

576
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,520
your pores are fully opened,

577
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,300
I'll apply medicine for you.

578
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:33,070
Okay.

579
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:35,810
By the way, Dr. Yan,

580
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,350
what's the mystery behind waiting

581
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,050
until the full moon's over?

582
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:42,240
Actually, there's no mystery.

583
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:45,080
I menstruate around the full moon,

584
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,440
so it's inconvenient.

585
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:50,150
Speaking of mysteries,

586
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,720
I heard that you come from the border tribe.

587
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:55,890
It is said that

588
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:58,390
they have some magical medicine

589
00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:00,690
that can cure incurable diseases.

590
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:03,440
Is it just a legend?

591
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:06,470
The medicine exists indeed.

592
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:38,140
What is this?

593
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,420
It's so weak.

594
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:41,910
Are you curious why

595
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:43,830
I don't use the medicine?

596
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:46,270
Yes.

597
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:50,360
Strong medicine may not cure mild diseases.

598
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,360
They're made from

599
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:52,570
highly toxic substances

600
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:54,370
from the mountains and jungles.

601
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:55,960
My skin disease

602
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:58,220
was caused by my hometown's miasma.

603
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:00,870
Using wild poison on miasma poison

604
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:01,870
could be fatal

605
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:03,880
if it doesn't work.

606
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:05,390
You're right.

607
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:08,110
You do know a little about medicine.

608
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,500
[Chishan]

609
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,420
[National General, Nan Jifeng]

610
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:05,130
Dr. Yan.

611
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,810
How many doses will it take

612
00:34:07,810 --> 00:34:08,930
to see results?

613
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:10,790
How many doses?

614
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:11,830
Let me think.

615
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:13,700
Well...

616
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:17,350
How many?

617
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:19,270
Well...

618
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:21,510
It varies.

619
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:24,090
Some only take one dose;

620
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:25,580
some may need several.

621
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:26,790
Your Ladyship.

622
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,790
We're at a vital stage

623
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:28,990
of the treatment.

624
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,700
Don't open your eyes.

625
00:34:30,930 --> 00:34:31,510
Is the cloth necessary?

626
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:32,430
Don't open your eyes.

627
00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:33,070
Yes.

628
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:34,790
This is my...

629
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,360
secret recipe.

630
00:34:37,390 --> 00:34:38,380
Don't open your eyes.

631
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:39,980
Or it'll affect the results.

632
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:44,130
Next...

633
00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:47,170
Next...

634
00:34:47,659 --> 00:34:48,870
Next, there's...

635
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:50,560
my special

636
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:51,780
massage technique.

637
00:34:51,810 --> 00:34:52,880
It's so effective.

638
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,270
Listen to me.

639
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:57,030
Don't open your eyes.

640
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,120
There's a whistle.

641
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:35,720
Whistle?

642
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:37,760
Why didn't I hear it?

643
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:40,730
It's a secret signal whistle.

644
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:41,890
Ordinary people can't hear it.

645
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:42,710
What did it say?

646
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:44,080
-Stop there!
-Stop there!

647
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,320
-Stop there!
-Don't run!

648
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,780
-Stop there!
-Stop there!

649
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,280
Dr. Yan.

650
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:49,670
Why are you using

651
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:50,820
more and more force?

652
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,680
Dr. Yan.

653
00:35:58,110 --> 00:35:58,950
Who are you?

654
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:03,250
Stop staring!

655
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:05,660
Help!

656
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,170
Help!

657
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,890
Help!

658
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,230
-Stop there!
-Stop there!

659
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:16,630
-Stop there!
-Don't run!

660
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:19,740
I'll jump over the wall.

661
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:25,980
Stop there!

662
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:26,920
-Don't run!
-Don't run!

663
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:27,830
I'm talking to you!

664
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:29,090
Stop there! Don't run!

665
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:29,930
Stop there!

666
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:35,110
-Stop there!
-Stop there!

667
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,420
I'll protect you

668
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,230
whenever you're in danger.

669
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,330
-Stop there!
-Stop there!

670
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:42,990
Stop there!

671
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:43,850
Stop there!

672
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:46,580
Don't run!

673
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:47,870
My lord.

674
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,960
It's the traveling doctor and her mom.

675
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,280
They were after the mom.

676
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,080
Now they're after the daughter.

677
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:54,410
You follow the mom.

678
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:56,190
I'll chase the other one.

679
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:56,790
When you get her,

680
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:58,070
ask what happened.

681
00:36:58,670 --> 00:36:59,630
But don't confront

682
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:00,480
the soldiers.

683
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:01,750
Yes.

684
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,570
-Stop there!
-Stop there!

685
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:12,260
Don't run!

686
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:13,330
Don't run!

687
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:16,690
Stop there!

688
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:18,010
Stop there!

689
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:23,190
Don't run!

690
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:25,270
Stop there!

691
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:28,570
Stop there!

692
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:38,110
Chase them down!

693
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:39,100
Yes!

694
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:41,330
Get the boats to dock

695
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:42,790
and search them one by one!

696
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:43,470
Yes!

697
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:45,070
Oh no.

698
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:47,180
There's Zornia in my pleasure boat.

699
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:02,180
Idiots.

700
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:34,540
A few of you,

701
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:35,350
search here!

702
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:35,950
Yes!

703
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:36,810
Hurry up!

704
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:38,710
You, search the back!

705
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:40,110
Check over there!

706
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:40,830
Yes!

707
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:43,250
