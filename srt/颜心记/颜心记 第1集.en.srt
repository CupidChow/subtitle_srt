Wind is the fragrance of osmanthus.

165

Flower is the clusters of roses.

166
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:11,670
Snow is the snowy mountain's spring water.

167

Moon is the red clay stove.

168

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,710
Mr. Xi, please wait.

180
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:24,850
This tea is called "Entrancement".

181
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:26,720
Please try it.

182
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:58,040
It's good stuff indeed.

183
00:12:58,390 --> 00:12:59,110
Mr. Xi.

184
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:00,670
You're new here.

185
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,940
Take some goods and test them in the streets.

186
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:22,830
I want to see the big boss

187
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:23,670
of this world.

188
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:24,830
This money

189
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:26,230
is

190
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,850
your introduction fee.

191
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,190
Okay?

192
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:33,070
I'm the big boss.

193
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:35,470
I have the final say

194
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:37,890
in everything.

195
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:46,790
I'll be frank with you.

196
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:47,990
I know

197
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,180
you are

198
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,910
number one

199
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:51,870
in Heman,

200
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:53,530
but you aren't a big shot.

201
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,470
Please pass my message.

202
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:56,940
I'm sincere

203
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,640
about doing business.

204
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:00,210
If we get along,

205
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:01,070
money

206
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:02,570
isn't a problem.

207
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:03,830
Mr. Xi.

208
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:07,630
This is different from

209
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:08,890
what we discussed.

210
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,060
It's the same.

211
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:16,070
I just wanna make more money.

212
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:17,490
It's human nature.

213
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:24,690
I'll wait for your good news.

214
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:28,690
Wait a minute.

215
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,830
The deal's not done yet.

216
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:36,920
Sorry for the trouble then.

217
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:40,720
Goodbye.

218
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:42,280
Let's go.

219
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,640
Mr. San.

220
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:21,000
This isn't how business is talked.

221
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,010
Are you talking business?

222
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,420
Then what is it?

223
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:44,560
Someone's dead!

224
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,170
Someone's dead!

225
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:47,590
Someone's dead!

226
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:49,590
Murder!

227
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:50,450
Murder!

228
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,390
Clean up!

229
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:04,690
What are you doing?

230
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:06,950
What's going on?

231
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:11,140
Move.

232
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:29,190
Bravo!

233
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:35,710
Who are you?

234
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:41,460
Get down!

235
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:49,390
And who are you?

236
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:50,630
Don't disturb our opera.

237
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:51,310
Step aside.

238
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,660
This is my turf.

239
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,680
You two can scram!

240
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,160
Who the hell are you?

241
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,110
I'm not with you.

242
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:29,550
Miss.

243
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:31,690
This thief stole my money.

244
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,730
It's up to me how I deal with him.

245
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:34,640
I don't care.

246
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:35,410
Get down!

247
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,420
Stop fighting!

248
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:40,590
Stop before

249
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:41,690
you kill someone.

250
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:42,930
I just saw

251
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:44,230
soldiers coming.

252
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,820
Let's just compromise

253
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,060
and stop here.

254
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:48,150
Okay?

255
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,440
He's dead!

256
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:03,200
Someone's dead!

257
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:05,270
What's going on?

258
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:07,310
Out of the blue?

259
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,640
Someone's dead!

260
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:13,870
Move!

261
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:14,470
Move!

262
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,420
[Lieutenant General Li]

263
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:27,890
Excuse me.

264
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,000
Killing someone

265
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,160
by faking it as acting?

266
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:45,780
Officer.

267
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:47,050
You misunderstood.

268
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,360
That thief

269
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:49,450
barged in.

270
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:50,590
It was an accident.

271
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,430
Everyone can testify,

272
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:53,150
right?

273
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:54,660
Yes, we can testify!

274
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:55,550
We can testify!

275
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:57,830
We can testify!

276
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,150
Nonsense!

277
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,480
Take everyone on stage away!

278
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:02,460
Yes!

279
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:03,990
Wait!

280
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:04,790
Wait.

281
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:06,300
Officer.

282
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:09,210
I set the stage.

283
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:10,270
I'll take

284
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,320
full responsibility.

285
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,200
I'll go with you to see the general.

286
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,810
Don't implicate others.

287
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:16,860
Of course you can't escape.

288
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:18,640
Even without this murder,

289
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,810
you'd be condemned.

290
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,890
Out of all the operas,

291
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,450
you insisted on "Li Ji Slays the Serpent".

292
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,030
You're asking for trouble!

293
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:30,480
Could she've

294
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:32,250
put on this show

295
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:33,690
to meet Nan Jifeng?

296
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:38,670
Officer.

297
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,200
Actually, I'm involved

298
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,050
in his death.

299
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:46,970
I'll go cooperate with your investigation.

300
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,400
Who the hell are you?

301
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:53,030
Who are you?

302
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:57,910
I'm just

303
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:00,230
an ordinary tea merchant.

304
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:00,980
Tea merchant?

305
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:01,570
Officer!

306
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:03,920
I did it.

307
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:05,380
It's unrelated with you.

308
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:06,550
Besides,

309
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:07,920
they want to take me away

310
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,610
not only for the thief's death

311
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:11,510
but also for the opera.

312
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:11,950
You...

313
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:13,750
All the more should I go with you.

314
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,760
I've only heard of being convicted for one's words,

315
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,850
and not for singing operas.

316
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:22,760
I want to see

317
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:23,830
how powerful

318
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:25,890
the general is.

319
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,720
How dare you slander our general!

320
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,460
Take him away too!

321
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:31,090
Yes!

322
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,200

323
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:33,270
Calm down, Officer.

Calm down, Officer.

00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:40,090
I appreciate your kindness.

327
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:41,050
But I don't like

328
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:42,170
to implicate others.

329
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:42,920
Leave now.

330
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:44,670
I'm not doing this for you.

331
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:46,220
Then for whom?

332
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,600
It's my own business.

333
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,190
Go. Don't be stubborn.

334
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:51,710
Go.

00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:52,540
Stop arguing.

336
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:53,770
Take them all away!

337
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:54,270
Yes!

339
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:11,870

Why didn't they arrest you?

catch on to us

353
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,570
and is just not exposing us for now?

00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,460
claiming to be from Yazhou

358
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,790
was living outside the city

359
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:11,450
and just met Bai San and Ma Jiu.

360
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:13,070
It's his first night in the city.

361
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:13,990
Ma Jiu and Bai San

362
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:15,120
died because of him.

363
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,720
Two inferior men died.

364
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,770
Don't make a fuss.

365
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:24,010
Keep an eye on

366
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:25,810
the tea merchant.

367
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,200
Yes, General.

368
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:30,280
Where's the female traveling doctor?

369
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:32,110
She's been sent to Her Ladyship.

370
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,650
Your Ladyship, she's here.

371
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,030
You may all leave.

372
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:45,270
Yes.

373
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:04,140
Yan Nanxing.

374
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,230
Greetings, Your Ladyship.

375
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:19,790
You and your mother

376
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:21,250
[General's wife, Gaya]

377
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:21,450
consulted for days in the city

378
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:22,270
just to

379
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:23,670
get my attention, right?

380
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:29,150
You deliberately arranged tonight's show

381
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,680
because you couldn't wait to see me.

382
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:35,180
So you already knew.

383
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,190
I was being a smarty pants.

384
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:40,460
I haven't been out

385
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,500
for a long time.

386
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:44,520
What are the rumors about me?

387
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,350
They say

388
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:48,750
you're a reincarnated snake fairy.

389
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:01,150
You're so sweet.

390
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:02,950
They clearly say

391
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:04,310
I'm a reincarnated snake demon

392
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,710
bewitching the general.

393
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:07,340
They're ignorant.

394
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:09,570
Your Ladyship just has

395
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,990
a minor skin disease.

396
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,670
To be honest,

397
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:15,990
my mother and I

398
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:17,590
heard this rumor while consulting

399
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:19,050
at a nearby state capital.

400
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:20,800
I was already guessing

401
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:22,510
you have a rare

402
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:23,770
silver snake disease.

403
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,520
So I came to Heman

404
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:26,700
to treat you.

405
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,580
I wanted to wait for you

406
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,600
to summon us.

407
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:31,510
But I heard you're

408
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:32,600
returning to

409
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:33,890
your maiden home soon.

410
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:35,670
So in a panic,

411
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,260
I resorted to this.

412
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:40,430
You are well-informed.

413
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:43,540
General did ask me to return to my maiden home.

414
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,380
But the date

415
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:46,240
hasn't been set yet.

416
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:50,310
Fake news?

417
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:52,770
Since you're here,

418
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:54,940
please treat me.

419
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,800
Of course.

420
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:58,690
After the full moon,

421
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:00,070
I'll treat you.

422
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:01,760
After the full moon?

423
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,190
Can you only treat

424
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:06,310
on auspicious days?

425
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:08,330
It's because

426
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:10,460
I use unique recipes.

427
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:13,550
I need to prepare some herbs carefully.

428
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:15,640
Preparing well is the key to success.

429
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,640
Please pardon me.

430
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:22,910
General said

431
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:24,150
since you're here,

432
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:24,950
don’t leave.

433
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,710
Ridiculous!

434
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:31,630
How dare they detain you!

435
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,210
And you. Don't you have legs?

436
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:34,270
Why didn't you run?

437
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:36,590
You know that

438
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:39,240
with my shabby skills,

439
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:41,150
I can’t defeat the men here.

440
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,490
Besides,

441
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:43,920
even if I defeat them,

442
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,670
how can I

443
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:45,660
get in again?

444
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:46,940
Our plan will be

445
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,040
all ruined.

446
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:52,610
You sure are my kid.

447
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:55,550
You have a pretty face

448
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:57,950
and a meticulous brain.

449
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,400
I have a meticulous brain.

450
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:03,490
What about you?

451
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:05,550
You paid so much

452
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:06,830
for fake news.

453
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:08,440
General's wife is

454
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,190
leaving soon?

455
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:09,750
But they

456
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:11,280
haven't even set a date.

457
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,480
Is it all my fault?

458
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:16,170
Didn't you believe it?

459
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:17,990
What's this?

460
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,810
Tea. It's fresh.

461
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,010
Have some.

462
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:25,610
Her Ladyship wants treatment

463
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:26,440
in three days.

464
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:28,970
The full moon is in three days,

465
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,020
when I'll menstruate.

466
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:33,190
Menstruation!

467
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,610
We'll be doomed.

468
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:37,050
So annoying.

469
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:38,590
Listen.

470
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:40,420
Count on me.

471
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:42,070
Everything will

472
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:43,190
be fine.

473
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,100
You said the same thing last time.

474
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:46,470
Last time...

475
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,400
that was a unique situation.

476
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:49,550
It'll be different this time.

477
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:49,950
Here.

478
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:52,830
Keep this secret whistle on you.

479
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:54,030
In an emergency,

480
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:54,720
just blow it

481
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:55,930
and I'll show up.

482
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:58,150
Will it work?

483
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,460
You said the same thing last time.

484
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:02,190
Why not?

485
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,680
Whenever

486
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:05,670
it is,

487
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:08,070
I'm always by your side.

488
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:09,670
I'll protect you

489
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:11,360
whenever you're in danger.

490
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:12,310
Besides,

491
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,800
once we get Her Ladyship's

492
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:17,310
magical medicine,

493
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:19,490
you'll be completely free

494
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,560
and no longer afraid of the full moon.

495
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:25,110
Is that medicine really so magical?

496
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:26,070
Of course.

497
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:27,670
How would you know

498
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,800
if you don't try it?

499
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:31,120
The most important thing now

500
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,650
is to win Her Ladyship's favor.

501
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:34,850
As for the rest,

502
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:36,230
count on me.

503
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:38,030
Everything will be fine.

504
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:40,290
Why are you copying me?

505
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:41,630
It'd better be so.

506
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:54,670
What is

507
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:56,330
Nan Jifeng's deal?

508
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:58,940
It's been a day.

509
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,520
He just sent men

510
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:01,550
to keep an eye on us;

511
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:02,960
nothing else.

512
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:04,990
He's so calm.

513
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:07,190
Has he found out

514
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:08,220
our identities?

515
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:11,150
Impossible.

516
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,030
Our trip is confidential.

517
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:15,590
Just in case,

518
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:18,230
let's not stay in inns from tomorrow.

519
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:19,310
Where will we live?

520
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:22,890
A place that's easy to defend and hard to attack.

521
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:36,110
Renting a pleasure boat without courtesans?

522
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:38,020
Your boss

523
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:39,750
is really strange.

524
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,090
Exactly.

525
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:42,150
You can

526
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,520
just keep this money.

527
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:45,490
Have the girls sing and dance

528
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:46,830
as usual.

529
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:48,750
Based on the usual rate,

530
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:50,830
we'll pay for

531
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:52,670
all the expenses.

532
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:58,070
I've met

533
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,410
you two at a restaurant.

534
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,520
You caused such chaos.

535
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:05,150
Someone even died.

536
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,390
Are you two

537
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:09,670
killers?

538
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:12,490
Madam, come on.

539
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:14,800
We did that for justice.

540
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:16,550
If we were really evil,

541
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:17,960
we'd be convicted

542
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:18,770
already.

543
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:21,960
Well...

544
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:23,030
Don't worry.

545
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:28,190
Of course.

546
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:36,150
My lord.

547
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,230
It's been two days.

548
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:38,960
Still nothing from Nan Jifeng.

549
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:39,950
In my opinion,

550
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,150
you should use

551
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:42,770
the Inspection Office badge

552
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:44,150
to transfer soldiers over

553
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:45,680
to surround his residence.

554
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:47,430
Nan Jifeng's earned military merits

555
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:48,910
to be sent to Heman.

556
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:52,010
Even the Inspection Office

557
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:53,630
must have evidence

558
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:54,390
to arrest

559
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:55,650
a general with merits.

560
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,030
Isn't this evidence?

561
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:08,550
It's a lack of supervision at most.

562
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:10,690
We might not be able to arrest him.

563
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,750
I came all the way here

564
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:13,740
to seal off

565
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:15,960
the Zornia trade route

566
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:17,170
and arrest

567
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:19,230
all their big fish in Heman

568
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,700
once and for all.

569
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:26,630
Tonight,

570
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:29,440
let's check out the General's Residence.

571
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:46,400
Your Ladyship, how do you feel?

572
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:50,790
I feel hot and relaxed.

573
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:53,030
The itching

574
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,840
seems to have subsided.

575
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:56,880
When

576
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,520
your pores are fully opened,

577
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,300
I'll apply medicine for you.

578
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:01,070
Okay.

579
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:03,810
By the way, Dr. Yan,

580
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,350
what's the mystery behind waiting

581
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,050
until the full moon's over?

582
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:10,240
Actually, there's no mystery.

583
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:13,080
I menstruate around the full moon,

584
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:14,440
so it's inconvenient.

585
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:18,150
Speaking of mysteries,

586
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,720
I heard that you come from the border tribe.

587
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:23,890
It is said that

588
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:26,390
they have some magical medicine

589
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:28,690
that can cure incurable diseases.

590
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:31,440
Is it just a legend?

591
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:34,470
The medicine exists indeed.

592
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:06,140
What is this?

593
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:07,420
It's so weak.

594
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:09,910
Are you curious why

595
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:11,830
I don't use the medicine?

596
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:14,270
Yes.

597
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:18,360
Strong medicine may not cure mild diseases.

598
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,360
They're made from

599
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:20,570
highly toxic substances

600
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:22,370
from the mountains and jungles.

601
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:23,960
My skin disease

602
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:26,220
was caused by my hometown's miasma.

603
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:28,870
Using wild poison on miasma poison

604
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:29,870
could be fatal

605
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:31,880
if it doesn't work.

606
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:33,390
You're right.

607
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:36,110
You do know a little about medicine.

608
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:41,500
[Chishan]

609
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:07,420
[National General, Nan Jifeng]

610
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:33,130
Dr. Yan.

611
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,810
How many doses will it take

612
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:36,930
to see results?

613
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:38,790
How many doses?

614
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:39,830
Let me think.

615
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:41,700
Well...

616
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:45,350
How many?

617
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:47,270
Well...

618
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,510
It varies.

619
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:52,090
Some only take one dose;

620
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:53,580
some may need several.

621
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:54,790
Your Ladyship.

622
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,790
We're at a vital stage

623
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:56,990
of the treatment.

624
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,700
Don't open your eyes.

625
00:33:58,930 --> 00:33:59,510
Is the cloth necessary?

626
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:00,430
Don't open your eyes.

627
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:01,070
Yes.

628
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:02,790
This is my...

629
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,360
secret recipe.

630
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:06,380
Don't open your eyes.

631
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,980
Or it'll affect the results.

632
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:12,130
Next...

633
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:15,170
Next...

634
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:16,870
Next, there's...

635
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:18,560
my special

636
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:19,780
massage technique.

637
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:20,880
It's so effective.

638
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,270
Listen to me.

639
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,030
Don't open your eyes.

640
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:02,120
There's a whistle.

641
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,720
Whistle?

642
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:05,760
Why didn't I hear it?

643
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:08,730
It's a secret signal whistle.

644
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:09,890
Ordinary people can't hear it.

645
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:10,710
What did it say?

646
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:12,080
-Stop there!
-Stop there!

647
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,320
-Stop there!
-Don't run!

648
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,780
-Stop there!
-Stop there!

649
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,280
Dr. Yan.

650
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:17,670
Why are you using

651
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:18,820
more and more force?

652
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,680
Dr. Yan.

653
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:26,950
Who are you?

654
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,250
Stop staring!

655
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:33,660
Help!

656
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,170
Help!

657
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,890
Help!

658
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,230
-Stop there!
-Stop there!

659
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:44,630
-Stop there!
-Don't run!

660
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:47,740
I'll jump over the wall.

661
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:53,980
Stop there!

662
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:54,920
-Don't run!
-Don't run!

663
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:55,830
I'm talking to you!

664
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:57,090
Stop there! Don't run!

665
00:35:57,270 --> 00:35:57,930
Stop there!

666
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:03,110
-Stop there!
-Stop there!

667
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:04,420
I'll protect you

668
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,230
whenever you're in danger.

669
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:10,330
-Stop there!
-Stop there!

670
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:10,990
Stop there!

671
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:11,850
Stop there!

672
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:14,580
Don't run!

673
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:15,870
My lord.

674
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,960
It's the traveling doctor and her mom.

675
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,280
They were after the mom.

676
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,080
Now they're after the daughter.

677
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:22,410
You follow the mom.

678
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:24,190
I'll chase the other one.

679
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:24,790
When you get her,

680
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:26,070
ask what happened.

681
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:27,630
But don't confront

682
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:28,480
the soldiers.

683
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:29,750
Yes.

684
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,570
-Stop there!
-Stop there!

685
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:40,260
Don't run!

686
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:41,330
Don't run!

687
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:44,690
Stop there!

688
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:46,010
Stop there!

689
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:51,190
Don't run!

690
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:53,270
Stop there!

691
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:56,570
Stop there!

692
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:06,110
Chase them down!

693
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:07,100
Yes!

694
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:09,330
Get the boats to dock

695
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:10,790
and search them one by one!

696
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:11,470
Yes!

697
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:13,070
Oh no.

698
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:15,180
There's Zornia in my pleasure boat.

699
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:30,180
Idiots.

700
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:02,540
A few of you,

701
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:03,350
search here!

702
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:03,950
Yes!

703
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:04,810
Hurry up!

704
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:06,710
You, search the back!

705
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:08,110
Check over there!

706
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:08,830
Yes!

707
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:11,250
