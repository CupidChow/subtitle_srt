So that's how the fireworks last night

6
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:02,110
came about.

7
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:04,870
Boss,

8
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,370
do you and Mr. Jiang

9
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,290
really have to leave the capital?

10
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:09,780
No.

11
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:11,610
There must be a way.

12
00:02:14,699 --> 00:02:15,310
Boss.

13
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:16,990
It's a blessing in disguise

14
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:18,210
for you and Mr. Jiang.

15
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:19,630
You're getting married.

16
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:22,400
What are you envious of?

17
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,790
It's not the first time we're getting married.

18
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:26,920
We're just going through the motions.

19
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:30,829
But...

20
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:33,010
since I can't find my mother now,

21
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,100
I am thinking of

22
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:36,060
getting married from Blossom Beauty.

23
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,020
You want to get married from Blossom Beauty?

24
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,510
You're sending yourself off?

25
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:41,390
How is that the case?

26
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:42,550
You two

27
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:43,870
are my family.

28
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:44,790
Really?

29
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:46,820
That's great!

30
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,800
In that case,

31
00:02:48,829 --> 00:02:50,030
both Ruoqian and I are now

32
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,490

33
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,720
If Mr. Jiang

34
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:53,900
dares to bully you,

35
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:54,920
I'll beat him for you.

36
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,230
Beat him?

37
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:55,829
Yes, Boss.

38
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:57,190
I'll straighten him up for you.

39
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:57,710
Come.

40
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,390
We're family from now on.

41
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:02,750
This is great.

42
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:04,470
Let me see.

43
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,140
What should I wear?

44
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:10,490
Wedding dress?

45
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:13,680
My mother

46
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:15,870
found the best embroiderer in the capital

47
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,000
to sew it overnight.

48
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:18,590
Sewn overnight?

49
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,360
The cost must have been doubled then.

50
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,530
The cost is not important.

51
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,570
On the surface,

52
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,750
Xinbai has cut ties with the Jiang family,

53
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,790
so it's inconvenient for Mother to come here.

54
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:34,630
Mother had asked me

55
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,070
to deliver this message for her.

56
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:37,270
The Jiang family

57
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,150
has caused you to suffer.

58
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,700
Consider this priceless wedding dress

59
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,750
as a way of making up

60
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,630
towards you.

61
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,550
You Jiang's really think

62
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:49,010
money can solve anything.

63
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,590
Since we've come to this point,

64
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,160
I might as well

65
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,250
make things clear.

66
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,450
The last time I came here

67
00:03:58,670 --> 00:03:59,870
was to drive you away.

68
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,310
But this time,

69
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,960
I'm here to welcome you

70
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:11,080
as you marry into the Jiang family.

71
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:17,610
Speaking of welcome,

72
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:20,890
how do you plan on showing it?

73
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,630
What do you want?

74
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,500
How about...

75
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:28,640
You call me sister-in-law?

76
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:31,950
Don't push your luck.

77
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,350
Don't be shy.

78
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,490
After I marry into your family,

79
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:37,110
you have to call me that sooner or later.

80
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,790
You could... try it now.

81
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:40,050
Get some practice.

82
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:42,510
No.

83
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,390
That's fine.

85
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:50,990
you siblings are up to.

and Li Jun?

89
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,720
He doesn't want you to know,

90
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,510
because he was afraid

91
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:02,659
you would treat this wedding as an act.

92
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:04,950
He really wants to marry you.

93
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:08,950
I know.

94
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,320
So, you just have to prepare

95
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,320
for this wedding.

96

you look so beautiful today.

107

Seeing you like this,

it makes me want to get married.

109

111
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,420
also send you off.

Yan Nanxing.

228
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:02,900
I'm sorry.

229
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:05,390
Due to circumstances,

230
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:07,550
I couldn't give you

231
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:10,590
a grander wedding than what we had at Heman.

232
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:12,150
But...

233
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:17,440
I'm sure you know

234
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:19,550
how I feel.

235
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:46,590
Tonight,

236
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:49,570
you must be beautiful.

237
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:53,750
I really wish I could

238
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:56,790
see your face clearly.

239
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:49,770
♫I'll fetch you the moon in my heart♫

240

Wait!

252
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:36,230
I...

253
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:38,950
I...

254
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:41,080
Yan Nanxing.

255
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:43,430
You are...

256
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,310
You are not feeling shy, are you?

257
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,110
I'm not feeling shy.

258
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:50,630
I think...

259
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:51,430
Don't worry.

260
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:53,520
I will be gentle.

261
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,860
Are you still playing that trick?

262
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,350
I didn’t expect you, Yan Nanxing,

263
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:20,010
who is not afraid of anything,

264
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,020
to actually get shy.

265
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:31,870
Yan Nanxing.

266
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:34,190
Are you…

267
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:42,430
Why is it tonight?

268
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:45,790
It's my wedding night tonight!

269
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:52,910
Tonight?

270
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,820
How would I know, Brother?

271
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:57,190
It's not even a full moon tonight!

272
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:58,150
That's why!

273
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:00,170
Why on earth is this happening?

274
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:01,850
How would I know?

275
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:05,430
My dear.

276
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,020
Please.

277
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:09,599
Let me shapeshift back!

278
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:19,440
Of all times, Li Jun chose to

279
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,470
leave tonight,

280
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:22,200
when it's their wedding night.

281
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:34,580
According to the capital's wedding customs,

282
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:36,550
the couple must share

283
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:38,060
a bowl of longan red date soup

284
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,140
on their wedding.

285
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:40,430
It symbolizes

286
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,830
a sweet marriage.

287
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,760
It's not sweet at all.

288
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:50,400
How can it be sweet?

289
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,570
Why is your shapeshifting

290
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:57,410
getting more and more irregular?

291
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,130
How would I know?

292
00:17:58,130 --> 00:17:59,330
Do you think I want to?

293
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:02,720
Forget it.

294
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:04,860
I'm not angry.

295
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:06,580
I'm angry.

296
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,070
No hurry.

297
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:11,020
We have many days ahead of us.

298
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:13,980
Drink slowly.

299
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:27,930
It's Yao.

300
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,100
Yao?

301
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,490
What is he doing here on the wedding night?

302
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:37,090
I asked Yao to keep an eye on Li Jun.

303
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,230
Once Li Jun leaves the city,

304
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:40,030
he has to inform me immediately.

305
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:43,070
You even arranged tasks for yourself

306
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,030
on your wedding night?

307
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,560
How could I have expected Li Jun

308
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,020
to leave the city tonight?

309
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,610
It's just like how I didn't expect

310
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:54,670
you would shapeshift tonight.

311
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,550
You want to deal with Li Jun?

312
00:18:58,550 --> 00:18:59,410
I want to go too.

313
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,910
What are you going to do?

314
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:04,190
Li Jun is cunning.

315
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:05,670
For all you know,

316
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,150
he might recognize you guys.

317
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:07,750
Look at me.

318
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:09,340
A complete stranger.

319
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,310
It will be seamless.

320
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,800
That actually makes sense.

321
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:16,270
But...

322
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,520
You don't think I look like a killer?

323
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,110
You do, just a bit.

324
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:45,350
That's good.

325
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:47,190
Go lower.

326
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:51,440
Come on.

327
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,840
You can go a little lower.

328
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:57,960
Yes.

329
00:19:58,750 --> 00:19:59,310
Okay.

330
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:01,230
Yes, yes.

331
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,420
Go lower.

332
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:07,290
Where are you?

333
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:08,380
Didn't I tell you to

334
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:09,630
go a little lower?

335
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:13,310
W-Who are you?

336
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:14,590
Who are you?

337
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:16,950
It's obvious, can't you tell?

338
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,960
Someone hired us to kill you.

339
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:20,110
Hitmen?

340
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,600
Let me tell you.

341
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:23,250
I'm a court official.

342
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:23,910
If you dare...

343
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:25,170
We're precisely in...

344
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,910
the business of bloodshed.

345
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:28,920
What we're after is exactly you,

346
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:30,270
this court official.

347
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:31,710
Brother.

348
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,220
When we get the reward,

349
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,150
let's all have have fun for a while.

350
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:36,010
Do it.

351
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:38,060
Wait, wait.

352
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:39,520
Guys, I have money.

353
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:40,590
How about this?

354
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,720
However much the other party offered, I will...

355
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,350
double.

356
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,690
Double!

357
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:53,260
Help!

358
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,520
Kill... kill...

359
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,800
You still want to resist?

360
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:02,630
T-They're all dead?

361
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:04,350
No, no, no.

362
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:04,920
Good lad.

363
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:06,570
Please spare me.

364
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:07,720
Spare your life?

365
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:08,670
Tell me.

366
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:11,310
Why should I spare your life?

367
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:13,390
Sir, I have money.

368
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:15,350
Double, triple or even five times more.

369
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:16,610
I'll give it all to you.

370
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:19,880
Who cares about your filthy money?

371
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:23,590
I'm a man of rules as a hitman.

372
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:26,080
Don't think you can bribe me

373
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,590
just because you have money.

374
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:28,320
How about...

375
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:30,740
you tell me what you want?

376
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,030
I, Li Jun,

377
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:33,230
will be your pawn

378
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:35,290
even if it's at the expense of my life.

379
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:38,590
Will you keep your promise?

380
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:39,310
Yes.

381
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:43,070
What if I wanted you dead?

382
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:43,800
Don't!

383
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:46,710
I have a family.

384
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:48,430
Don't kill me! Don't kill me!

385
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:50,070
Please, I'm begging you.

386
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:58,790
What?

387
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:01,370
You even called for accomplices?

388
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:04,210
So, you've been lying to me all along.

389
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:05,970
I... I didn't, Sir.

390
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,760
I... I don't know who they are.

391
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,970
I don't know them.

392
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:15,240
You've done so many immoral deeds.

393
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:18,450
How could my hirer be your only enemy?

394
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:21,350
If they are not your accomplices,

395
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,760
then they must have come for revenge.

396
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:27,810
Rather than dying in their hands,

397
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:29,440
why not

398
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:33,130
die by my hand instead?

399
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:33,760
Don't!

400
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,190
Don't... Don't kill me!

401
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:44,820
Come!

402
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:50,470
You're hurting me.

403
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:54,670
Who are you?

404
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,350
A friend.

405
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:02,820
Mr. Yan.

406
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,970
I'm Xinbai's man.

407
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:13,470
Where is he?

408
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:18,070
He needed to hurry back to the city, so he left first.

409
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:19,790
He left me behind to

410
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:23,480
stall Li Jun and wait for you.

411
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:25,990
Understood.

412
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:27,890
Mr. Li.

413
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:29,990
Mr. Li?

414
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,720
Don't.. don’t kill me!

415
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,070
Chief Constable Yan,

416
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,860
he wants to kill me.

417
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:37,790
Mr. Yan,

418
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:38,670
please help me.

419
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,140
Mr. Yan.

420
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:41,030
Li Jun,

421
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,810
is there any truth in your words?

422
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:43,300
You...

423
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:44,550
Didn't you say

424
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:46,150
you don't know them?

425
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,310
This man is ruthless.

426
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:48,830
Look.

427
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:51,430
He killed all my servants.

428
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:52,230
Mr. Yan,

429
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:54,410
you have to uphold justice for me.

430
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:56,230
Mr. Li,

431
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:57,760
don't worry.

432
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:00,250
Justice lies in the heart of all of us.

433
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:02,030
By the way, Mr. Yan,

434
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:04,170
what brings you here?

435
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:10,990
Shang Bieli reported to the Inspection Office

436
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:12,320
saying that you, Mr. Li,

437
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:14,150
might have something to do with General Nan's death.

438
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:15,790
That's why I'm here to invite you to

439
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,660
go back to the capital for investigation.

440
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,540
Also, Mr. Li,

441
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:21,170
you took leave to go back to your hometown.

442
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:23,230
Why did you divert elsewhere midway?

443
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:26,950
How did you come to know that

444
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:28,510
I diverted elsewhere?

445
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,060
Don't kill me! Don't kill me!

446
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:37,050
Detain him!

447
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:41,360
Tell me, who ordered you to do this?

448
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:42,810
Where is your accomplice?

449
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:44,930
Every profession has its own rules.

450
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:47,500
I'd never betray my brother!

451
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:51,320
You... you're such a prick.

452
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:59,140
Young man, you're quite stubborn.

453
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:02,990
No, don't!

454
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,800
I'm just taking money and

455
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:08,030
doing others a favor.

456
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:08,750
Tell me.

457
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:10,270
Who sent you here?

458
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:13,450
I-I can't tell you.

459
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:15,060
I'll die if I do.

460
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:16,680
If you don't tell me,

461
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,360
you'll die right now.

462
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:19,430
I...

463
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:20,890
I'll tell you! I'll!

464
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:22,390
It's Mr. Lu, Lu Dingzhao.

465
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:24,810
-Lu Dingzhao gave us the orders.
-What?

466
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:26,110
Mr. Lu.

467
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:27,430
Nonsense!

468
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:28,790
Mr. Lu is

469
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:29,980
a fourth-rank official,

470
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:31,430
and also Mr. Li's father-in-law.

471
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:33,290
How could he possibly hurt Mr. Li?

472
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:35,230
You want to die, don't you?

473
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:37,100
I'll kill you!

474
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:37,710
Wait!

475
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:39,410
It really is him.

476
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:44,870
Mr. Li.

477
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:46,710
Is what he said true?

478
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:48,130
As in-laws, you two

479
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,910
shouldn't be like this.

480
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:51,450
What exactly is going on?

481
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:54,080
He wasn't even looking to send me away.

482
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:55,290
He wanted me to die.

483
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:58,470
My lord, look!

484
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:00,650
I've told you everything.

485
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:02,010
I'm telling the truth.

486
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:03,010
Did you hear that?

487
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,220
I can

488
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,430
hand over the money

489
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:07,870
Mr. Lu Dingzhao gave me

490
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:09,110
to bribe me.

491
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,770
I don't deserve to die, my lord.

492
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:13,550
It's not just enough to pay.

493
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:15,390
You have go back and be a witness.

494
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,750
I can consider that as redeeming yourself.

495
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:18,790
Mr. Lu, no.

496
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,710
Old man Lu is ruthless.

497
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,530
He can even try to kill his son-in-law.

498
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:26,630
If you want me to be a witness,

499
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:27,900
you might as well

500
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:28,860
kill me now.

501
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,870
Okay, I won't stand on ceremony then.

502
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:32,270
If he won't testify, I’ll testify.

503
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:33,240
I want to expose Lu Dingzhao

504
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,570
for killing Nan Jifeng.

505
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:38,390
Mr. Li,

506
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,320
do you have evidence?

507
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:41,680
I am the witness.

508
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,510
Lu Dingzhao killed Nan Jifeng.

509
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:45,690
He's the main culprit and I'm his accomplice.

510
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:46,250
Besides,

511
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:47,910
Lu Dingzhao not only killed Nan Jifeng.

512
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:48,350
He...

513
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:53,270
Mr. Yan.

514
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:55,230
I have something more important to report

515
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:57,110
to His Majesty back in the capital.

516
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:58,110
I'll leave first.

517
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,780
Escort Mr. Li back to the capital.

518
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:00,400
Yes.

519
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,000
Come, give me a hand.

520
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:20,470
Bro.

521
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:22,160
Thank you.

522
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:24,030
I'm used to it.

523
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:25,510
Jiang Xinbai

524
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:27,450
used to play with me like this too.

525
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:30,190
I knew it.

526
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:32,470
I'm sorry.

527
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,580
It's just that, when I swung my body up just now...

528
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:35,610
My back...

529
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,390
I sprained my back.

530
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:38,110
Go stretch.

531
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:38,750
Okay.

532
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:39,530
I'll be off.

533
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:40,160
Let's go.

534
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:40,690
Let's go.

535
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:42,780
Go.

536
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:47,840
[Remarkable past and present]

537
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:10,640
Official Lu.

538
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:13,680
How do you explain this?

539
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:17,830
Your Majesty,

540
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:20,310
Prince of Weiding and I

541
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:22,350
are friends in calligraphy and painting.

542
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:24,630
We've been in touch with each other

543
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:26,990
to admire the posthumous works of

544
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,700
famous artists together.

545
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,030
It was just amicable chat.

546
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:31,110
But somehow,

547
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:33,630
it has caused him to misunderstand.

548
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:38,680
Your Majesty,

549
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:42,380
please help me.

550
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:44,310
Rise.

551
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:46,190
Thank you, Your Majesty.

552
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,460
Report! Duke of Yuejiang, Jiang Xinbai,

553
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:52,970
asks to see Your Majesty.

554
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:55,570
Send him in.

555
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:08,070
Greetings, Your Majesty.

556
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:09,190
Rise.

557
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,080
Thank you, Your Majesty.

558
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:16,010
Mr. Jiang, you came at the right time.

559
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:18,340
Official Lu was just telling me about

560
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,890
how he was just pen pals with Prince of Weiding.

561
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:24,510
But somehow, he had offended you.

562
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:27,160
He even asked me for a favor

563
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:29,310
to make peace with you.

564
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:32,230
Your Majesty,

565
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,270
profits from sales of Zornia are transacted in paintings and calligraphy.

566
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:37,280
It may seem unrelated, but it is.

567
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:39,220
The painting from Mr. Lu

568
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:40,710
is ill-gotten gains.

569
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:42,140
This is not just a trap,

570
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:44,410
but also evidence of Li Wufang

571
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:46,370
profiteering off sales of Zornia.

572
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:47,560
Your Majesty,

573
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:49,330
it seems that Mr. Jiang's

574
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:51,980
misunderstanding of me runs deep.

575
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:55,530
But the matter of Zornia is very significant.

576
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:00,830
Your Grace, please watch your words.

577
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:04,280
Alright.

578
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:05,210
Jiang Xinbai.

579
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,780
I exiled you to

580
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,060
Yazhou for three years

581
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:11,880
for you to reflect on yourself.

582
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:15,960
When you return to court, I expect you to serve the country well.

583
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:17,690
You know what's on my mind,

584
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,230
don't you?

585
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:23,030
Li Wufang has now been exiled.

586
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:25,720
I think these calligraphy and paintings

587
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,810
can be handed over to

588
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:29,070
the Inspection Office for safekeeping.

589
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:33,580
Your Majesty is wise.

590
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,120
I will never forget

591
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:37,270
the trouble you have taken.

592
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:39,230
Before I leave,

593
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:40,150
I...

594
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:42,890
have one more thing to share.

595
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:44,990
Go ahead.

596
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,020
Although I have resigned,

597
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:49,670
but the case of Zornia

598
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:51,010
has not been resolved.

599
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:52,000
It might...

600
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:54,380
even involve others.

601
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:59,030
Your Majesty, please allow me to report.

602
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,280
You...

603
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:01,850
Report!

604
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,720
Mr. Yan from the Inspection Office

605
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,520
has something urgent to report.

606
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:07,490
Send him in.

607
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:23,620
Greetings, Your Majesty. I'm Yan Qingyun.

608
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:24,870
Rise.

609
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,150
Thank you, Your Majesty.

610
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:30,620
Mr. Li, didn't you go back to your hometown to recuperate?

611
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,640
Mr. Yan, what happened?

612
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:35,670
Your Majesty,

613
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:37,010
the Inspection Office

614
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:38,790
has been investigating General Nan's death.

615
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:39,590
As a witness,

616
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,900
he can identify the murderer.

617
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:55,060
Greetings, Your Majesty. I'm Li Jun.

618
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:57,030
Who is the murderer?

619
00:31:58,230 --> 00:31:59,030
Your Majesty.

620
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:01,550
It's Lu Dingzhao.

621
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:06,110
Li Jun.

622
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:08,590
This is the Imperial Study.

623
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:10,160
Don't you dare talk nonsense

624
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,220
and accuse others!

625
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:12,110
Your Majesty,

626
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:13,990
I dare not lie to you.

627
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:16,870
I was ordered by Lu Dingzhao

628
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:20,150
to bribe bandits and assassinate General Nan.

629
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:24,350
Your Majesty.

630
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:27,450
I have no grudge against General Nan.

631
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:28,340
There's no reason for me

632
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:29,870
to want to kill General Nan.

633
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:31,320
You knew that General Nan

634
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,980
was helping Mr. Jiang investigate the case.

635
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:34,800
You were afraid of being found out,

636
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:35,900
so you killed him.

637
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:37,070
Your Majesty,

638
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:39,780
I have no idea what Li Jun is

639
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,660
talking about.

640
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:41,740
I also didn't know

641
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:44,120
General Nan was helping His Grace

642
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:44,810
on the case.

643
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,680
Go on. What case?

644
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:53,350
Your Majesty.

645
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,830
Everything Lu Dingzhao did

646
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:58,570
was aimed at the Duke of Yuejiang.

647
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,100
On the fifth night of this month,

648
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:03,160
fireworks broke out through the city.

649
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,070
It was also Lu Dingzhao who

650
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:05,800
ordered me to set off fireworks

651
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:07,590
in order to frame His Grace,

652
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:08,480
and sow discord

653
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:10,790
between Your Majesty and His Grace.

654
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:11,790
Well Li Jun,

655
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:13,870
since you've admitted that

656
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:15,950
these were events orchestrated by you,

657
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:17,080
then go and bring the bandits

658
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,260
who set off the fireworks

659
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:19,460
to come and see me for a

660
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,010
face-to-face confrontation.

661
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:22,750
Don't you dare try to

662
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,010
throw dirt on me.

663
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:26,710
Do you have witness or evidence?

664
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,780
Even if there is even one witness,

665
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:32,150
I wouldn't need Your Majesty to judge.

666
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:32,860
I'll

667
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:35,830
kill myself on the spot and apologize with my life.

668
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:45,440
Lu Dingzhao!

669
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:47,180
You sent me away

670
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:49,470
and destroyed all the evidence

671
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:52,600
just so that you could push the blame on me.

672
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:53,470
Li Jun.

673
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:56,390
Your claims are merely empty words.

674
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:58,230
Do you have any evidence?

675
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,040
Your Majesty.

676
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,480
Yes!

677
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:09,390
Li Wufang is the witness.

678
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,840
Li Wufang is your son.

679
00:34:11,890 --> 00:34:13,949
Of course, he'll do whatever you say.

680
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:14,870
Besides,

681
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:16,540
how can the words of

682
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:18,570
a criminal in exile be trusted?

683
00:34:25,989 --> 00:34:26,650
And also...

684
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:28,920
Your Majesty...

685
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,429
Your grandson, Lu Bo'an.

686
00:34:34,219 --> 00:34:35,020
Your Majesty.

687
00:34:35,179 --> 00:34:37,440
Bo'an has traveled to the State of Miluo.

688
00:34:37,989 --> 00:34:39,710
If His Majesty decrees,

689
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:40,590
I can

690
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,480
ask someone to find him.

691
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:44,770
But, it'll take a few days.

692
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:02,070
Your Majesty.

693
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:03,830
Lu Bo'an

694
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:06,040
has never left the capital.

695
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:15,910
Xinbai.

696
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:18,170
Lu Bo'an didn't come to school today.

697
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,040
It's Lu Dingzhao.

698
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:22,900
Lu Dingzhao wants to send Lu Bo'an

699
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:23,960
out of the capital.

700
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:29,100
Go and find Shang Bieli.

701
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,410
You must stop Lu Bo'an.

702
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:41,730
Greetings, Your Majesty.

703
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,030
Rise.

704
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:46,540
Your Majesty.

705
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:47,740
Lu Bo'an has arrived.

706
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:49,130
He has already told me that

707
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:50,780
he, Li Jun, and Li Wufang

708
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:54,340
had been making money from forged paintings and calligraphy.

709
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:56,070
Lu Bo'an,

710
00:35:57,070 --> 00:35:58,800
What kind of money did you make?

711
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,990
What do you know?

712
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:01,870
I...

713
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:03,000
I don't know.

714
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:03,390
I...

715
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,300
Your Majesty.

716
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,590
I'm asking Lu Bo'an!

717
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:14,190
Grandfather! Grandfather!

718
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,660
Help me, Grandfather!

719
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:16,590
Grandfather!

720
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:17,890
Help me, Grandfather!

721
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:19,470
Bo’an.

722
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:21,730
If you have anything to confess,

723
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:23,270
just tell us.

724
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:24,910
His Majesty

725
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,880
will uphold justice for you.

726
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:28,450
Grandfather.

727
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:30,260
I don't want to die, Grandfather.

728
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:30,780
Bo’an.

729
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,050
I know.

730
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:33,310
My child.

731
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:35,060
Don't worry.

732
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:38,990
Your grandfather has his own plans.

733
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:43,640
He won’t implicate the innocent.

734
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:07,390
Grandfather!

735
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:09,270
Grandfather! Help me! Grandfather!

736
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:10,070
Grandfather.

737
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:16,430
Grandfather. Grandfather.

738
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:19,990
Your Majesty.

739
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:21,710
Bo'an is still young.

740
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,040
Let me explain.

741
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:24,140
Explain what?

742
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:25,710
At this point,

743
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,350
you're still trying to defend yourself?

744
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:28,270
Guards!

745
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:29,700
Li Jun.

746
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:32,010
If you don't tell us today

747
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:33,820
what case you were investigating,

748
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:35,710
and what kind of money you collected,

749
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:37,430
I'll drag you and Lu Bo'an

750
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,270
to be beheaded.

751
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:40,440
Grandfather!

752
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,040
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

753
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,040
Your Majesty!

754
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:44,710
I'm innocent, Your Majesty!

755
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:49,550
Protect His Majesty!

756
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,040
Protect His Majesty!

757
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:53,270
Don't come over!

758
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:55,560
Don't come over!

759
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:57,910
Lu Dingzhao!

760
00:37:58,370 --> 00:37:59,830
Don't do anything stupid.

761
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:02,230
Your Majesty,

762
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:06,230
I was framed by a villain.

763
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:07,820
I have nothing to say.

764
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:10,440
I have to die to prove my innocence.

765
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:12,840
Your Majesty,

766
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:15,610
on the account of

767
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,140
my loyalty to Your Majesty and the court,

768
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:20,790
please spare the Lu family

769
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:22,910
from death.

770
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:28,300
Grandfather

771
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:30,520
Lu Dingzhao!

772
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:31,680
Lu Dingzhao!

773
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:42,510
Your Majesty.

774
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:43,660
Lu Dingzhao

775
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:45,360
is officially dead.

776
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:50,680
I can't believe we failed at the very last hurdle.

777
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:52,310
A mystery

778
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:54,340
is about to come to light.

779
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,490
Jiang Xinbai, listen to my decree.

780
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:01,630
I order you

781
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:05,030
to find out the mastermind behind all this.

782
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:06,970
Yes, Your Majesty.
