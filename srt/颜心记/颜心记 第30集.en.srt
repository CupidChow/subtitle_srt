[Blossom Beauty]

5
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:53,630
One time, she changed

6
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:54,590
into a girl

7
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,789
with a fish tail.

8
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:56,390
Another time,

9
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:58,030
she changed into a boy

10
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,640
with the lower part of a horse.

11
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,110
Anyway, on every full moon,

12
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:02,310
she shapeshifts.

13
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,040
-I see.
-I see.

14
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:08,310
You believe that?

15
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,990
You're indeed her true friends.

16
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:13,870
I was

17
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:14,830
making things up.

18
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,230
You actually fell for it.

19
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,130
There is one thing I don't understand.

20
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:21,310
Over the past few years,

21
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,670
has Boss never noticed

22
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,990
Zornia in her blood?

23
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:25,710
Good question.

24
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:27,870
It's a long story.

25
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:29,870
When she was little,

26
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,670
I made her try all kinds of herbs,

27
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,829
so she had

28
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,790
various poisons in her body.

29
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:35,990
Later,

30
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,670
those assorted poisons

31
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:41,670
happened to counteract the effects of Zornia.

32
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:43,550
That's true.

33
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:46,220
Boss,

34
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:47,700
can you change back?

35
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:48,630
Of course.

36
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,290
I'll change back in a few days.

37
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:51,690
Great.

38
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,290
What do you mean?

39
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,680
I don't look good now?

40
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:58,870
You do.

41
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:00,990
Aren't I charming?

42
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:01,590
You are.

43
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,050
Since I'm also

44
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:10,110
a victim of Zornia,

45
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,190
I have to tell Jiang Xinbai immediately

46
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:12,990
that his enemy

47
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:14,190
is my enemy now.

48
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,160
I've decided

49
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:17,270
to go to Tingzhou,

50
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:19,040
setting off at first light.

51
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:20,390
No way!

52
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:23,820
Mom.

53
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,470
Jiang Xinbai

54
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,170
is looking for the mastermind behind Zornia.

55
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:27,110
Maybe he can find the guy

56
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:27,850
who drugged me.

57
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:28,700
Maybe he can find

58
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,470
the antidote.

59
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,150
Mom.

60
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:31,510
Boss.

61
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:33,780
I'm going to Tingzhou with you.

62
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:34,780
Me too.

63
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:36,570
It's safer to have a man

64
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:37,700
traveling with you.

65
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:38,660
If you two

66
00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:39,660
go with me,

67
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:41,050
who will run the store?

68
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:42,480
You have to stay.

69
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,150
Ms. Yen is just the beginning.

70
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,000
They'll definitely

71
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,460
send more people like her.

72
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:47,510
You two have to stay

73
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:48,329
and observe carefully.

74
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:49,530
Don't miss any clues.

75
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,550
If anything happens…

76
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:53,670
Don't act tough.

77
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:54,530
Go to Mr. Shang.

78
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:56,570
Also,

79
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,270
we won't tell anyone

80
00:03:58,350 --> 00:03:59,880
about your shapeshifting.

81
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:02,150
I'm relieved.

82
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,230
I have nothing to say.

83
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:08,370
You've grown up

84
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,400
and won't listen to me anymore.

85
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:12,700
Mom.

86
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,250
Get off me.

87
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:13,990
Mom.

88
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:14,750
Go away.

89
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:15,570
Mom.

90
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:17,070
Give me a kiss.

91
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,790
I missed you so much.

92
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:22,340
I missed you so much.

93
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:36,280
Alright.

94
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,310
Don't drink that.

95
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:38,290
Drink this.

96
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:40,600
What is this?

97
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:44,240
Poison.

98
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:46,260
It's not poison.

99
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,390
It's an aphrodisiac.

100
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:52,830
This

101
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,060
is useless to me.

102
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,440
I have the antidote.

103
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:00,190
This time,

104
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,550
I've seen that all your friends

105
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:03,880
truly care for you.

106
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:04,940
I'm relieved.

107
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:08,160
No wonder you won't leave the capital.

108
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:10,580
After I find the antidote and cure myself,

109
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:11,270
you should stay

110
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,530
in the capital with me.

111
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:14,410
Xinbai and I will take care of you.

112
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,890
I'm footloose and fancy-free.

113
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,480
I love roaming the world.

114
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:20,660
Why should I stay with you guys?

115
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:21,270
No need.

116
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:25,110
You don't mean that.

117
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,040
What?

118
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:32,159
Your heart

119
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:34,100
is already in Tingzhou, right?

120
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:35,620
Ms. Yen

121
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,070
is just an excuse.

122
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:38,590
Enough.

123
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:39,970
Don't say it out loud.

124
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:41,510
I have to say it out loud

125
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:42,909
to show I understand you.

126
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:46,590
Xing.

127
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:50,500
The journey to Tingzhou is dangerous.

128
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:51,800
You should

129
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:52,870
be careful.

130
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:54,790
Got it.

131
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:57,830
Mom, take good care of yourself.

132
00:05:57,909 --> 00:05:58,470
I can see

133
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:00,220
you're not as strong as before.

134
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:02,300
Stop running around.

135
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:03,710
Just stay at home.

136
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:05,460
In a while,

137
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:08,190
Xinbai and I will bring you back to the capital.

138
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,030
Fine, fine.

139
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:11,230
You just can't stop nagging.

140
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:11,870
Say goodbye here.

141
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:12,530
Go back now.

142
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:15,860
Go.

143
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:17,510
Go.

144
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,540
I'm leaving, then.

145
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:18,990
Okay.

146
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:22,030
Wait.

147
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:24,840
You already miss me?

148
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,180
My flask.

149
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,240
It's mine now!

150
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,310
Ride safe.

151
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:27,430
It's just you and me now.

152
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:30,540
Let's

153
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:32,720
find the antidote for Xing,

154
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:33,750
okay?

155
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,230
Jiang Xinbai.

156
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,280
Please stay safe.

157
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,490
I'm coming for you.

158
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:24,430
Sir.

159
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:27,370
How did she die?

160
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:28,810
She was poisoned.

161
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,120
Where is Yan Nanxing?

162
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,820
I've sent someone after her.

163
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:34,669
She's not home

164
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:35,990
or in her store.

165
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,080
Keep looking!

166
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:37,750
Yes.

167
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:43,409
Have you heard?

168
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,480
Beauty of the City

169
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:46,140
was cleaned out overnight.

170
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:46,950
Yeah.

171
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:47,990
Ms. Yen

172
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,630
just vanished.

173
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,250
Her store was busy just a few days ago.

174
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:52,890
Yes.

175
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,290
Isn't it strange?

176
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:55,410
What happened?

177
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,890
Life is unpredictable.

178
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:57,970
Be careful, madam.

179
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:58,750
Thank you.

Remember

181
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:00,550
to use the cream every day

182
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:02,030
to achieve the brightening effect.

183
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:02,360
Okay.

184
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:03,530
I'll keep using it.

185
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,040

What are you looking at?

188
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:13,260
It must be the one behind Ms. Yen

who cleaned her store out.

190

Tomorrow?

At noon?

204
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,470
Tingzhou is so big.

205

we have to set off today.

209
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:04,800
Prepare horses.

210
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,190
We'll set off instantly.

00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:42,440
I came to see you.

215
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:00,540
Mr. Yao,

216
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:02,870
are we still going to the Marshal's Residence?

217
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:03,940
It's still early.

218
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,360
What's the hurry?

219
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:06,670
Go back and rest.

220
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:07,710
Yes.

221
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,620
That's what happened.

222
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,480
I think those who traffic in Zornia

223
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,880
are not just after money.

224
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:16,580
They may

225
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,800
have a larger scheme.

226
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,660
You're too impulsive.

227
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:25,820
You came to Tingzhou

228
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:28,160
right after such a serious matter.

229
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:30,530
You could've been ambushed halfway.

230
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:34,070
Have you forgotten how General Nan died?

231
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,120
I just wanted you

232
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,480
to know about it sooner.

233
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,830

How can I put you at risk?

242
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:56,910
Since it's risky,

243
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,380
you shouldn't go either.

244
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:00,620
No.

Don't worry.

249
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,790

Ask the servants to keep an eye on Her Ladyship.

272

Without it,

No problem.

351

But before I find it,

352
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:16,350

00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,910
You haven't eaten for a day and a night.

357
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:33,910
His Lordship will blame us when he comes back.

358
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:34,770
Your Ladyship.

359
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:36,170
Your Ladyship.

360
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:37,030
Stop knocking.

361
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:39,510
Her Ladyship ran away through the dog door.

362
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:46,260
[Yunmu Market]

363
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:43,150
Buddy, buddy.

364
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:44,110
Come on. Okay.

365
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:47,040
Don't push. Don't push.

366
00:19:59,010 --> 00:19:59,870
Take a look.

367
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:01,390
Freshly cooked lamb skewers.

368
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:02,650
Take a look.

369
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:04,070
Take a look.

370
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,050
Please come in.

371
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:27,060
Sir.

372
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,020
I want a bowl of noodles.

373
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:28,590
Sure.

374
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:35,050
Get out.

375
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:36,460
Get out!

376
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:54,970
Bai Yuan.

377
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:57,450
I've delivered

378
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:58,950
the message.

379
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,500
I'm here today

380
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:03,350
to get your reply.

381
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:05,960
Will you marry me or not?

382
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,030
Miss Heiao.

383
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:13,840
You used to shiver with fear

384
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,900
when seeing Chief.

385
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:16,430
With a new backer,

386
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:19,290
you actually dare to talk to Chief like that.

387
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:20,800
None of your business.

388
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:25,510
Bai Yuan.

389
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:34,540
If you marry me,

390
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:36,430
we'll be family.

391
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:38,000
What's mine

392
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:39,310
will be yours.

393
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:42,320
You don't have to hijack my cargo anymore.

394
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:47,200
You're disrupting my meal.

395
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:47,870
Bai Yuan.

396
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:50,510
Don't make me go hard on you.

397
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:52,460
You burned my Zornia.

398
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:54,250
Do you know how much I lost?

399
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:57,030
He burned Zornia?

400
00:21:58,390 --> 00:21:59,920
A bandit with a conscience.

401
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:01,770
Your cargo,

402
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:03,410
we'll keep.

403
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:04,950
You? No.

404
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:06,790
You

405
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:08,870
are not Chief's type.

406
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:11,210
You one-eyed monster!

407
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:12,410
Don't push your luck.

408
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:27,430
Scared now?

409
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:29,910
Tell your boss,

410
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:32,190
I won't be his underling.

411
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:53,430
I really didn't see anything, sir.

412
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:54,070
Trust me.

413
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:54,950
I didn't see anything.

414
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:55,510
Speak.

415
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:56,960
Why did you stay there?

416
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:58,790
I wanted to leave.

417
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,290
I really wanted to leave,

418
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:01,700
but your men closed the door.

419
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,350
It's true.

420
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,130
What did you hear?

421
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:06,710
Nothing.

422
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,050
I didn't hear anything.

423
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:09,950
Sir, I really didn't hear anything.

424
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:11,210
Not telling the truth?

425
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:11,750
Fine.

426
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:13,530
Then never tell it.

427
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:15,190
Please. Please.

428
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:16,610
I didn't hear anything.

429
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,560
I'm just a hapless passerby.

430
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:19,840
Trust me.

431
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:20,570
I mean it.

432
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:22,280
I heard nothing.

433
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:24,470
Then you're too unlucky.

434
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:26,260
Wait.

435
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:30,460
I know you're a good man.

436
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:32,320
You're all good men.

437
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:34,110
People who burned Zornia

438
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:35,370
can't be real bandits.

439
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:36,840
You're good people.

440
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,180
Good people don't kill the innocent.

441
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:39,910
Sir.

442
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:40,510
Didn't you say

443
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:41,970
you didn't hear anything?

444
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:47,920
I heard that

445
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:49,400
recently,

446
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,630
a regional inspector

447
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:52,290
came from the capital, right?

448
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,120
If you

449
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:54,230
kill an innocent girl,

450
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:55,350
he'll arrest all of you

451
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,550
when he finds out.

452
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:58,430
Please let me go,

453
00:23:58,450 --> 00:23:58,950
sir.

454
00:23:58,950 --> 00:23:59,480
I'm begging you.

455
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,230
So you're some official's wife.

456
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:02,890
More reason for us to kill you!

457
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:06,070
Kill! Kill! Kill!

458
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:09,350
Kill! Kill! Kill!

459
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:10,790
I can fix your eye.

460
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:29,120
What did you say?

461
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:32,990
I can fix your eye.

462
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:35,270
I can put in an animal's eye

463
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:35,950
for you.

464
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,510
I promise it'll look real.

465
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:38,040
I mean it.

466
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:40,550
Are you mocking me?

467
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:42,350
No, I dare not.

468
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:44,390
I'm a doctor.

469
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,070
I'm really a doctor.

470
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:47,930
I used to be a traveling doctor.

471
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:49,420
I treated many patients.

472
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:50,470
Trust me.

473
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,750
Let me prove it.

474
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:54,030
What if I make it?

475
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:55,440
Besides,

476
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:56,640
if I failed,

477
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:58,060
you wouldn't lose anything.

478
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,550
You could kill me then.

479
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:11,150
What's your name?

480
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:17,070
Yan Nanxing.

481
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:33,330
It was so careless of me

482
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:36,360
to let that girl steal the official document.

483
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,160
They were prepared.

484
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,810
We didn't see it coming.

485
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:43,290
Besides, we're outnumbered.

486
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:46,570
We'd better play nice for now.

487
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:49,070
My lord,

488
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:51,700
why do you think

489
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:53,510
Yi Yuanshan detained us?

490
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:57,790
Yi Yuanshan

491
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,770
was sent to Tingzhou by Lu Dingzhao

492
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:01,170
to transport Zornia out.

493
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,220
Lu Dingzhao is dead,

494
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,770
but the Zornia business is still running.

495
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:07,830
He keeps us here

496
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:09,470
at this point

497
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:11,790
probably because

498
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:13,850
he needs to send Zornia out very soon.

499
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:16,720
Thankfully, he's not brainless.

500
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:18,630
If anything happens to you,

501
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:21,120
Yi Yuanshan can't get away with it.

502
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,760
We can't take any chances.

503
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:24,310
He may get too desperate.

504
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:26,920
We have to get out of here

505
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:28,730
to stop the transportation.

506
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:33,550
Even if he keeps us here,

507
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:36,870
he may still have trouble shipping Zornia out.

508
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,030
What do you mean?

509
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:41,130
I've heard something.

510
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:42,530
It's unverified,

511
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:43,550
so

512
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:45,310
I didn't report it to you.

513
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:46,230
Tell me.

514
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,460
Learning that Heiao Gang

515
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,990
has sided with Yi Yuanshan,

516
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,640
Bai Yuan has hijacked a lot of their cargo

517
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,190
in the past few months.

518
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:56,430
Bai Yuan?

519
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:57,710
Yes.

520
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:00,990
The two gangs are at odds,

521
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:03,670
but hijacking the other's cargo is too much.

522
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:05,060
So, that rumor

523
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,440
hasn't been confirmed.

524
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:10,510
If it's true,

525
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:12,990
the Zornia Bai Yuan hijacked

526
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:14,630
belonged to Yi Yuanshan.

527
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:17,430
What's more interesting is that

528
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:19,750
Bai Yuan didn't sell the Zornia he hijacked

529
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:20,550
but burned it.

530
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,270
Zornia?

531
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:27,520
If that's the case,

532
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:28,670
Bai Yuan

533
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:30,690
is a bandit with a conscience.

534
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:33,990
Yi Yuanshan, an official,

535
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:37,050
actually colluded with Heiao Gang, a bunch of bandits.

536
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:38,800
Then I…

537
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:43,150
My lord,

538
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:45,630
what are you thinking?

539
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:47,800
I'm thinking about

540
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:49,710
how we can get out of here.

541
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,540
Fire! Fire!

542
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:56,290
Marshal.

543
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:57,620
The backyard is on fire!

544
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:08,320
Marshal,

545
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:09,980
they escaped

546
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:10,980
from the window.

547
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:14,310
That window should be watched.

548
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:15,440
How did they escape?

549
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:16,930
Smoke came out.

550
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:17,700
The guards…

551
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:18,320
The guards

552
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:19,810
came in to put out the fire.

553
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:20,950
They were set up.

554
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:21,570
Go after them.

555
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:22,520
Go after them!

556
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:23,310
Yes.

557
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:57,110
Chief.

558
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:57,440
Chief.

559
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:57,920
Chief.

560
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:02,050
Chief is back!

561
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:03,540
Chief is back!

562
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:04,950
Chief! Chief!

563
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:06,670
Chief! Chief!

564
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:07,530
Chief is back!

565
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:08,670
Great!

566
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:09,910
Chief.

567
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:10,990
Chief.

568
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:11,590
Chief.

569
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:12,750
Chief is back!

570
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:13,630
Chief is back!

571
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:14,250
Hey, guys.

572
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:15,240
Chief. Chief.

573
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:15,830
Come.

574
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:16,870
Come.

575
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:18,950
Check what toys

576
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:20,150
I bought you in town.

577
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:22,510
No snatching.

578
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:24,770
Thank you, Chief.

579
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:26,160
No snatching. One at a time.

580
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,760
-Give me one.
-I want one too.

581
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:29,990
Thank you.

582
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:32,110
Take your time.

583
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:33,110
No rush. No rush.

584
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:34,080
Chief Bai.

585
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:35,510
You're back.

586
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:38,750
Chief Bai.

587
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,590
How is Bean doing with his asthma?

588
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:41,670
He's much better. Thank you.

589
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:42,130
Really?

590
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:42,870
I bought medicine for him

591
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:43,510
in town.

592
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:46,670
Here.

593
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:47,870
Thank you, Chief Bai.

594
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,430
Thank you.

595
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:49,630
Take medicine on time.

596
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:50,720
Go and play.

597
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:51,310
Go play.

598
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:52,080
Let's go.

599
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:52,630
Go. Go.

600
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:56,070
Chief Bai.

601
00:29:57,210 --> 00:29:58,230
I've never seen you

602
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:59,230
bring a girl back.

603
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:00,340
Who is she?

604
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:04,520
A doctor.

605
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,490
Come on, unload.

606
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:10,050
Come on.

607
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:11,230
Give me a hand.

608
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:11,750
Here.

609
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:15,300
Be careful.

610
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:16,480
This one.

611
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:17,790
Here.

612
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:18,770
Here, take this.

613
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:26,990
This place…

614
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:30,490
Yuan Village,

615
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:31,870
where I live.

616
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:37,930
So you live

617
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,490
just like us regular folks.

618
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:41,430
I thought you lived in a cave.

619
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:43,270
No need for the tea.

620
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:44,200
I'm not thirsty.

621
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:54,630
This.

622
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:56,840
What's the plan?

623
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:01,830
I need materials

624
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,810
and tools.

625
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:06,550
What are the chances of success?

626
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:08,990
Probably…

627
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:10,150
Probably?

628
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:12,350
I don't want an estimate.

629
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:14,790
If I'm not satisfied, you still have to die.

630
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:20,080
Then can you please

631
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:21,910
get me some medical books?

632
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:25,220
You need medical books now?

633
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:29,270
Well...

634
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,730
it never hurts to review.

[Notice of arrest]

637
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:53,590
My lord.

638
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:54,970
Her Ladyship is missing.

639
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:55,650
Missing?

640
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:01,370
Was Her Ladyship

641
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:02,330
taken by Heiao?

642
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:05,010
Search every inch of Tingzhou

643
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:06,630
to find her.

644
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,400
Will that work?

645
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:18,500
Since you want me to treat you,

646
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,320
you have to trust me completely.

647
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:21,150
Remember.

648
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,240
If I'm not satisfied,

649
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:24,690
you still have to die.

650
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:27,930
Die! Die!

651
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:31,750
Die! Die!

652
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,930
It's anesthetic. Drink it.

653
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,370
If I drink it,

654
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:54,020
my life will be in your hands.

655
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:55,650
If you don't drink it,

00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:57,180
how can I put the fake eye in?

657
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:57,810
Just do it.

658
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,770
Just do it?

659
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:01,230
Sir,

660
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,740
I'm going to use this

661
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,610
to cut open the tissues around your eye.

662
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:06,670
It'll hurt a lot without anesthesia.

663
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,500
Don't let me repeat it.

664
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:30,110
What's wrong?

665
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,480
Are you sure

666
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:33,510
you want all of them

667
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:35,110
to stare at us?

668
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:37,070
Of course!

669
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:39,060
Chief

670
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:41,270
is the most wanted man in the northwest.

671
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:43,040
His head is worth 500 taels of gold.

672
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,040
What do you think?

673
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:45,230
What do you think?

00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,560
What do you think?

675
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:49,679
Fine, fine.

676
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:52,230
Here we go.

677
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:14,310
Stop!

00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:18,140
Go out.

679
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:19,390
Go out.

680
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:20,230
Go out.

681
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:22,090
I'm here. Don't worry.

682
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:54,790
Ms. Yan.

683
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:56,420
I feel very uncomfortable.

684
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:58,150
I can't sleep well every night.

685
00:36:59,350 --> 00:36:59,950
Well,

686
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:02,440
am I seriously ill?

687
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,050
You have a condition

688
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,100
called huangjia.

689
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:07,500
You caught a cold

690
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,540
when you were still very weak

691
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:09,670
after giving birth.

692
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:11,680
I'll give you a prescription.

693
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,470
Go back and take the medicine.

694
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:14,650
Three times a day.

695
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:15,550
In three days,

696
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:16,890
you'll get better.

697
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:17,820
I can recover?

698
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:18,670
Yes.

Dr. Yan.

704
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:24,090
Have a seat.

705
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:27,350
I'll just stand.

706
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:28,830
Why won't you sit?

707
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:30,310
I can't.

708
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,030
What's wrong?

709
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:33,990
I…

710
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:35,790
I'm constipated.

711
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:38,910
Don't laugh.

712
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:41,880
I see.

713
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:42,920
Here.

714
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:44,970
I'll write you a prescription.

715
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:45,760
Go back,

716
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:46,590
buy the herbs,

717
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:47,520
and decoct them.

718
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,210
Drink the decoction twice a day.

719
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:49,870
Tonight,

720
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,880
your problem will be solved.

721
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:54,920
Thank you, Dr. Yan.

722
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:56,850
This is embarrassing.

723
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:01,190
Have a seat.

724
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:02,910
Ms. Yan.

725
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:04,590
Well,

726
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:05,400
I feel dizzy

727
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:06,890
and sweat a lot.

728
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:18,710
What do you want?

729
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,180
I want to see Chief Bai.

730
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:22,950
You again?

731
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,830
Chief Bai is not here.

732
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:25,510
Go out.

733
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:52,840
All right.

734
00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:55,510
Here.

735
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:56,710
Look in the mirror.

736
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,390
Take a look.

737
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,150
Why are you

738
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:03,220
so stubborn?

739
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:04,440
The other day,

740
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:06,780
you even refused to take the anesthetic.

741
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:08,000
Can you tell me

742
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,630
why you'd rather endure the pain

743
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:11,090
than take the anesthetic?

744
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:12,420
My eye was gouged out

745
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,820
when I was sober.

746
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,640
I wanted to be sober when you put it back.

747
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:17,610
Okay.

748
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:20,070
I really don't understand

749
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:21,200
tough guys like you.

750
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:24,400
Well,

751
00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:25,950
Chief Bai,

752
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,700
I've put in

753
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:28,690
a fake eye for you

754
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,150
and treated patients

755
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,120
in your village

756
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,020
for free.

757
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:35,210
I've cured them all.

758
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:41,230
Look.

759
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:44,150
Chief Bai,

760
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:47,230
when will you send me back?

761
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,000
We'll see.

762
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,800
What do you mean?

763
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:11,830
Chief.

764
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,850
You're not going to let go

765
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:15,510
of the woman you brought back?

766
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:19,760
She's met everyone

767
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:20,720
in Yuan Village.

768
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:21,800
If you let her go,

769
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:24,520
what if she reports us to the government?

770
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:26,390
Go find out

771
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:27,450
who Yan Nanxing is.

772
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:35,670
What are you looking at?

773
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:36,700
Chief,

774
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,350
I just want to take another look

775
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:39,280
at your fake eye.

776
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:43,150
Believe it or not,

777
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:44,550
I'll kick your ass.

778
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,520
I believe it.

779
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:48,520
I believe it.

780
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:49,660
Chief, I believe it.

781
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,270
The rhubarb you bought

782
00:40:58,640 --> 00:40:59,710
is not right.

783
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:01,890
You need to buy

784
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:02,990
processed rhubarb

785
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:04,600
which can help with his recovery.

786
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,010
The unprocessed one

787
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:07,190
is poisonous.

788
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:08,400
It's not medicinal.

789
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:10,810
You've already put in the fake eye for Chief.

790
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:12,670
What does he need to recover from?

791
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:14,240
The fake eye is in,

792
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:16,490
but the tissues around his eye were cut open.

793
00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:17,710
The wounds around his eye

794
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:19,050
need to be carefully treated.

795
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:20,290
If they become inflamed

796
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:21,090
or even bleed,

797
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:22,030
he may go blind.

798
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:22,790
Is it

799
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:23,740
that serious?

800
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:24,870
Of course.

801
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:25,750
Hurry.

802
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:26,920
Take me to the town.

803
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:28,400
I'll buy herbs for him myself.

804
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,860
Wait. We need to go to town?

805
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:30,870
Yes.

806
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:32,200
If he goes blind,

807
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:34,210
can you take the responsibility?

808
00:41:35,350 --> 00:41:36,280
Prepare horses.

809
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:38,920
I'll go with you.

810
00:41:59,390 --> 00:41:59,830
Chief.

811
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,790
Say it.

812
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:08,290
The Marshal Residence's guards

813
00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:09,670
made a scene at the casino,

814
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:11,930
saying that Yi Yuanshan wants to see you.

815
00:42:14,310 --> 00:42:15,940
His minion failed to get me,

816
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:18,130
so he's coming at me himself.

817
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:20,630
So the marshal

818
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:22,090
Jiang Xinbai mentioned

819
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,630
is Yi Yuanshan.

820
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:26,410
He went to meet him a few days ago.

821
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,050
Did everything go well?

822
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:28,550
Chief.

823
00:42:28,570 --> 00:42:29,430
One more thing.

824
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:37,910
Interesting.

825
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:40,990
Take the herbs back.

826
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:48,080
Jiang Xinbai is so smart,

827
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,280
and Yao went with him.

828
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,400
He'd be fine.

829
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:52,580
When he came back and found me missing,

830
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:54,150
he'd definitely look for me.

831
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:55,230
I have to escape.

832
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:57,160
What are you thinking?

833
00:42:57,230 --> 00:42:58,960
The noodles are too salty.

834
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:01,840
I need to have a word

835
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:02,670
with the cook.

836
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:03,580
Wait for me.

837
00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:07,640

Where are you going?

00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:16,610
I'm going to meet the cook.

840
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:18,470
Be honest with me.

841
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:22,210
Who's waiting for you outside?

842
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:23,870
How are you going to deal with me?

843
00:43:23,870 --> 00:43:24,230
I…

844
00:43:24,350 --> 00:43:26,280
I said I'm going to see the cook.

845
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:29,030
I don't understand what you're talking about.

846
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:38,630
Drop the act.

847
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:40,430
I'm not that strong.

848
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:44,320
My arm still hurts from your grab.

00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:51,120
Are you trying to blackmail me?

850
00:43:56,930 --> 00:43:57,860
It really hurts?

851
00:43:58,520 --> 00:43:59,320
Yes.

852
00:44:04,670 --> 00:44:06,990
Let me check on it for you.

00:44:07,350 --> 00:44:08,750
You're not running away?

I hurt you.

How can I leave now?

856
00:44:16,590 --> 00:44:17,670
I'm a doctor.

00:46:02,330 --> 00:46:03,060
Impossible.

885
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:08,310
Where is your family?

886
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:11,510
What do you want?

887
00:46:13,610 --> 00:46:14,540
Fetch them here.

888
00:46:15,630 --> 00:46:16,560
What do you mean?

889
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:20,020
From the moment

890
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:21,450
you fixed my eye,

891
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,020
I decided to keep you here.

892
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:28,740
Tonight,

893
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:31,390
I'll make you my woman.

894
00:46:32,070 --> 00:46:33,040
Are you crazy?

895
00:46:33,070 --> 00:46:33,870
Tonight it is.

896
00:46:35,010 --> 00:46:36,020
I'm married.

897
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:38,630
Then tell me,

898
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:40,470
who is he?

899
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:41,600
I'll kill him,

900
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:43,350
so you can stay here

901
00:46:43,350 --> 00:46:43,990
with me.

902
00:46:46,190 --> 00:46:47,170
I want you tonight.

903
00:46:47,170 --> 00:46:47,870
I agree!
