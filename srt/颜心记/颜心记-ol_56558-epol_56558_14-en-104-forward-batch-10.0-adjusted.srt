00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,440
Greetings, Your Highness.

7
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,570
It was you

8
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,710
who took the duke hostage?

9
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:29,079
Who are you?

10
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,350
Who do you work for?

11
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,760
How long has it been?

12
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,280
Now you're settling the score with me.

13
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:36,710
Your Highness,

14
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,790
it was a misunderstanding.

15
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:41,070
If I had really taken the duke hostage,

16
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:42,400
would he have let me off?

17
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,070
I'm asking you,

18
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:46,510
not the other way around.

19
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:48,150
Your Highness.

20
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,880
A word in private.

21
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,390
Actually,

22
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,180
I'm a temporary secret scout

23
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,640
of the Inspection Office.

24
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:00,880
I'm working on the Zornia case.

25
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,900
That day, I helped the duke seize Zornia

26
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,030
at the Ghost Market.

27
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:06,079
As for taking him hostage,

28
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:07,740
it was just for show.

29
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,280
I've never heard of the Inspection Office

30
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,810
hiring a girl scout before.

31
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,930
That's why it's called a secret scout.

32
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,210
Do you think I'll buy that?

33
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:20,790
W-Why not?

34
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,430
If you don't believe me,

35
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:27,470
there's nothing I can do.

36
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:28,340
Anyway,

37
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:29,950
you can't just tell me

38
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,770
to close down Blossom Beauty.

39
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,220
I don't mind bringing it up

40
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,079

44
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:41,950
You overestimate yourself!

45

53

just ask me.

54

Why make such a fuss?

55
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,470
Will you be honest with me?

56
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,880
Will you tell me anything

57
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,460
without reservation?

58
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:18,960
This is about a major case

59

Forgive me

61

for holding it out on you.

62

She's part of the case too?

63
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:29,070
Oh no.

64
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,730

65

68

helped me a lot

69

in finding Zornia.

70
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,100

71

Yes.

72
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,780
Then why did she take you hostage?

73
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,100
That day at the Ghost Market,

74
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:01,790
Ms. Yan noticed hidden Zornia

75
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:03,920
in the secret warehouse of a shop.

76
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:06,659
But at that time,

77
00:05:06,909 --> 00:05:08,510
the suspects were all there.

78
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,270
To avoid alerting them,

79
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:10,820
she

80
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,670
pretended to take me hostage

81
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:14,440
and took me into the warehouse.

82
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:18,500
In that case,

83
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:21,990
I wronged you, Ms. Yan.

00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:59,110
and may fall off it tomorrow.

353
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:00,880
Life is unpredictable.

354
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:04,950
Mr. Pei.

355
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:05,830
Mr. Lu.

356
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:08,150
Mr. Jiang.

357
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:09,110
Mr. Lu.

358
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,440
Congratulations, Mr. Jiang.

359
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:15,720
I want to invite you

360
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,950
to Jinchuan Restaurant

361
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:20,250
for a celebration tomorrow.

362
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:24,070
Mr. Lu.

363
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,150
Are you going to

364
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:28,390
exclude me?

365
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:34,070
I was just about to invite you.

366
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,670
Tomorrow, at Jinchuan Restaurant,

367
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:37,870
I'll wait for you two there.

368
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,230
No need.

369
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:44,520
I was just kidding.

370
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,950
Don't take it seriously.

371
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:47,090
Enjoy yourselves.

372
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:48,470
See you.

373
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:58,030
Mr. Jiang…

374
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:01,470
Mr. Lu,

375
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:05,150
I don't like the food at Jinchuan Restaurant.

376
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:06,590
How about

377
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:09,150
we meet

378
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:10,670
at Longxin Teahouse?

379
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:19,670
As you wish.

380
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:36,870
Mr. Jiang.

381
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:41,110
My lord,

382
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:42,870
Mr. Yao is not around.

383
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:43,770
It's not safe for you

384
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:45,550
to go to Longxin Teahouse alone.

385
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:47,550
How about bringing guards with you?

386
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:49,410
It's just a dinner.

387
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:51,510
Don't make a fuss.

388
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:54,030
Will you alert the targets

389
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:55,390
if you show up there?

390
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:58,070
I want to alert them

391
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:59,430
and make them scared.

392
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:06,400
Mr. Shang.

393
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:08,390
The man I sent to Heman

394
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:09,510
sent a letter back.

395
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,470
You won't believe that

396
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:13,590
Jiang Xinbai

397
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:15,800
actually got married in Heman.

398
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:18,510
Married?

399
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:24,290
Jiang Xinbai is so obnoxious.

400
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:26,250
He actually found a girl to marry.

401
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:27,790
The witnesses

402
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:30,250
were General Nan and his wife.

403
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,100
Nan and Gaya witnessed his wedding?

404
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:38,630
Who was the bride?

405
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:41,750
I guess it was Yan Nanxing.

406
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:45,110
Any evidence?

407
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:46,590
Not yet.

408
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,830
But I've sent my subordinate

409
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:49,550
to Heman

410
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,500
to draw the portrait of the bride.

411
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:53,650
After the portrait arrives,

412
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:55,770
my guess will be confirmed.

413
00:21:58,350 --> 00:21:59,150
However,

414
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:01,990
I can look for an opportunity

415
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,950
to test his bride.

416
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:05,950
Great.

417
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:08,550
The newlyweds

418
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:10,590
have worked together to fool me.

419
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:12,650
Shang,

420
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:14,870
have you crossed paths

421
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:16,150
with Yan Nanxing too?

422
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,160
Suoluo.

423
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:25,750
This is a serious matter.

424
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:28,710
No matter who in the Jiang family

425
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:30,070
wants to get married,

426
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,510
they must inform His Majesty

427
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:34,350
and get his approval.

428
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:40,630
Jiang Xinbai is overbearing.

429
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:42,070
He never cares

430
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,070
about our family.

431
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:45,950
Mr. Shang.

432
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:48,350
Will you…

433
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:49,230
No.

434
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:51,400
I wish

435
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,280
I could skin Jiang Xinbai alive,

436
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:55,190
but if reporting him

437
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,390
will hurt your family

438
00:22:57,970 --> 00:22:59,570
and our friendship,

439
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:02,590
I'll keep silent.

440
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:04,730
I won't report him.

441
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:09,390
Thank you.

442
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:11,950
Suoluo.

443
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:13,710
There is only one thing

444
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:15,150
you need to think about now.

445
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:16,550
If this matter is true,

446
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:19,570
you'll have something on him.

447
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:22,500
How will you use it against him?

448
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:26,160
He wants me to leave his girl alone.

449
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:28,410
No way.

450
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,530
I want him under my thumb

451
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,890
and never to disobey me.

452
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:35,880
I want him to renounce the succession

453
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,140
of his own accord

454
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:38,390
and be at my mercy

455
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:39,720
for the rest of his life.

456
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:48,960
Mr. Jiang, this way.

457
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:53,980
Jiang Xinbai?

458
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,590
He never deigns

459
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:02,790
to socialize.

460
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:04,440
Suoluo, go back.

461
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:05,990
Leave it to me.

462
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,460
I want to see

463
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:10,790
what tricks Jiang Xinbai has

464
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:12,430
up his sleeve.

465
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:23,110
Top-notch Moon River.

466
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,460
Please, enjoy.

467
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:33,850
[Li Jun, Vice Director of Personnel]

468
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:41,550
Moon River?

469
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,510
It does taste great to me.

470
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:49,260
But I wonder how it tasted

471
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:51,910
to the dead.

472
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:08,190
Mr. Jiang, what do you mean?

473
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:12,010
Yesterday,

474
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:14,110
a body was found

475
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:15,550
in a well.

476
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,740
The dead guy was Cao Wenquan,

477
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:20,470
a Zornia dealer who I'd been looking for for days.

478
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:27,030
This is the evidence

479
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:28,290
we found in his throat.

480
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:29,350
Li Wufang.

481
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:31,670
Take a look for me.

482
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:34,710
Is this Moon River?

483
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:57,750
Mr. Jiang.

484
00:25:58,590 --> 00:25:59,310
Many people

485
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:00,790
come here every day.

486
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,470
I can't remember

487
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:04,250
everyone who ordered tea.

488
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:05,670
Besides,

489
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:06,910
that man died

490
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:08,830
after leaving Longxin Teahouse.

491
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:10,430
His death

492
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:13,030
had nothing to do with us.

493
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,150
We don't know that

494
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:23,910
until an investigation is done.

495
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:36,670
Seems that Mr. Jiang

496
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:39,790
is not here to celebrate.

497
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:42,430
I planned

498
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:44,620
to use this dinner

499
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,500
to clear our misunderstanding

500
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,630
that has lasted for more than 20 years.

501
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:53,150
I'm deeply sorry

502
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,470
for what happened to Chief Constable Xi back then.

503
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:59,030
But under the order of His Majesty,

504
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:01,530
I had to put him on trial.

505
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:16,470
My lord.

506
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:18,310
Counting is done.

507
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:19,970
We've seized a total of

508
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:21,480
425 boxes of Zornia

509
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:23,020
and 31 suspects.

510
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:25,070
They've all been imprisoned,

511
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,970
awaiting your instructions.

512
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,350
The witness is already outside the capital.

513
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:32,920
I'll bring the witness to His Majesty tomorrow

514
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,150
and let him point out the culprit before everyone.

515
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:36,870
This time, we can definitely get rid of Zornia,

516
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:38,270
a scourge of our society,

517
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:39,950
to reassure our people.

518
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:40,990
Yes, my lord.

519
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:44,030
Qingyun,

520
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:46,000
after solving this case,

521
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:46,950
the Inspection Office

522
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:48,350
will have done a great service to Daqi.

523
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:50,430
We'll be remembered for generations to come.

524
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:51,690
You're right, my lord.

525
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:53,240
If I can follow you

526
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:54,530
to complete this task,

527
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:56,510
I'll have no regrets in my life.

528
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:58,230
Report!

529
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,540
Report!

530
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:01,150
My lord,

531
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:02,710
Zhu Village was attacked last night.

532
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:04,030
The witness and his family all died.

533
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:05,590
The whole house was burned down.

534
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:06,790
Where's the suspect?

535
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,220
We only found the victims' burnt bodies.

536
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,070
All traces of the crime were erased.

537
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:12,270
We have no clue at all.

538
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:14,870
Xi Zhaoming.

539
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:17,350
Your operation failed

540
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:18,890
and resulted in a tragedy.

541
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,030
Do you admit your dereliction of duty?

542
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:22,790
I failed in my duty.

543
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:25,710
I have nothing to say.

544
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:29,590
I, Xi Zhaoming,

545
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:32,950
should pay with my life.

546
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:37,910
Okay.

547
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,830
Xi Zhaoming neglected his duties,

548
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:43,350
caused innocent people to die,

549
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:45,670
and damaged the reputation of the court.

550
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:47,750
After our investigation,

551
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:50,470
his dereliction of duty is confirmed.

552
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,110
He's dismissed from his position as the chief constable

553
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:55,510
of the Inspection Office

554
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:57,030
and sentenced to death.

555
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:57,820
Wait!

556
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:04,750
Mr. Pei.

557
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,440
Mr. Pei.

558
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:10,400
Your Excellencies, you're conducting a trial.

559
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:13,230
The Censorate is not supposed to interfere.

560
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:13,790
However,

561
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,520
there's something

562
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:17,590
I have to say.

563
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:19,360
Go ahead.

564
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:21,000
I'm here

565
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,470
to plead for Chief Constable Xi.

566
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:24,990
I have three reasons.

567
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:25,960
First,

568
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,560
Chief Constable Xi did a great job in past cases,

569
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:31,390
and his investigation into Zornia

570
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:33,590
aligned with His Majesty's directives.

571
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:34,270
Second,

572
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:36,830
Zhu Village was slaughtered.

573
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:38,760
The one who should be executed

574
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,900
is the murderer.

575
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:42,880
Finding the culprit

576
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:44,440
is our priority now.

577
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:47,620
Killing the chief constable who made a mistake

578
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:50,300
can shut up the officials at court,

579
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:52,870
but killing a loyal official who doesn't deserve to die…

580
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:53,730
Think about it.

581
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:55,810
Will His Majesty

582
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,950
have regrets afterward?

583
00:29:59,190 --> 00:29:59,830
Third,

584
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:02,410
Chief Constable Xi

585
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:05,360
is Prince Weiding's son-in-law.

586
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:08,350
Prince Weiding is not a member of the royal family,

587
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:09,640
but in terms of military exploits,

588
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,310
no one can compete with him.

589
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:15,170
Besides, he's given the privilege of staying in the capital.

590
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:16,620
Shouldn't you

591
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:19,650
take him into consideration?

592
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:24,990
Since Xi Zhaoming

593
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:26,940
seized a large quantity of Zornia,

594
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:30,280
he'll receive a lighter sentence than the death penalty.

595
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,250
After careful consideration,

596
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:34,990
we decide to relieve him from his position

597
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:36,500
and banish him to Yazhou.

598
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,920
He must never return to the capital.

599
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:44,670
Don't be sorry, Mr. Lu.

600
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,090
I'll delve into the case

601
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:49,630
my father couldn't solve.

602
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,040
It seems that

603
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:57,370
it's too soon to celebrate today.

604
00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:00,430
We can wait until Zornia

605
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:02,350
is completely gotten rid of.

606
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:04,110
See you.

607
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:08,590
Mr. Jiang.

608
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:11,670
Mr. Jiang, you haven't eaten anything.

609
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:14,680
Father-in-law,

610
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,690
what did Jiang Xinbai mean?

611
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:18,870
Father.

612
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,990
Can't you take a hint?

613
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:23,870
Jiang Xinbai was warning us.

614
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:26,310
I was so scared just now.

615
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:27,960
Behave yourself.

616
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:30,750
Stop trading for now.

617
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:32,870
Then we'd take losses.

618
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:34,160
Short-sighted.

619
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:36,610
Just listen to your grandfather.

620
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:39,710
I outsmarted his father

621
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:40,790
back then.

622
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,310
It'll end the same way for him.

623
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:52,470
Mr. Jiang.

624
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:55,920
What a surprise to see you here.

625
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,530
Let's sit down and talk.

626
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:38,950
Mr. Shang.

627
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:42,150
You're doing business

628
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:44,160
with Longxin Teahouse too?

629
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:47,640
Aren't you here

630
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:49,710
exactly because

631
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:50,870
my business is here?

632
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:53,950
I'm curious.

633
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:55,950
Where do you get

634
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:57,990
Moon River?

635
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,350
Why do you only supply it to Longxin Teahouse?

636
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:06,310
Great! Great!

637
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,310
What did you say?

638
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:14,270
I didn't hear you.

639
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:19,940
I'm asking you why you only sell

640
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,470
Moon River to Longxin Teahouse

641
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:22,790
and where you get it.

642
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:26,580
No rush.

643
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:29,570
A question for a question.

644
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:31,080
I go first.

645
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,080
Where is Nan?

646
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:34,580
What has the guy

647
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:36,080
you sent out found?

648
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,620
He hasn't sent word back yet.

649
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:41,430
But my guess

650
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:43,200
is almost the same as yours.

651
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:45,980
Your brother didn't flee to avoid punishment.

652
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:47,620
I sent someone to look for him

653
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:48,870
to protect him.

654
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:53,000
You went to Heman not long ago.

655
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:55,530
What on earth happened there?

656
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:56,790
I've answered

657
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:57,800
your question.

658
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,900
It's your turn to answer mine.

659
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:07,480
Moon River

660
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:11,020
is produced in Mount Kunlun near the border.

661
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:13,390
It has a low yield.

662
00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:16,270
I promised Gaya

663
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:19,909
to find a sustainable source of livelihood

664
00:34:19,909 --> 00:34:21,659
for her tribe.

665
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,989
As for why I only sell it

666
00:34:24,989 --> 00:34:26,190
to Longxin Teahouse,

667
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,120
it's because I can raise the price.

668
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:30,590
There's value in rarity.

669
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:42,230
Wait.

670
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:51,260
You haven't answered

671
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:52,699
my second question.

672
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:58,360
The Zornia dealers in Heman

673
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:01,110
framed and coerced your brother.

674
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:02,429
Gaya

675
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:04,630
died to protect him.

676
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:11,110
Now you know.

677
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:34,510
It smells so good.

678
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,050
-Your Highness.
-So comfortable.

679
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:45,180
Yan Nanxing is here.

680
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:46,670
Greetings, Your Highness.

681
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:47,200
Nanxing,

682
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,030
did you bring me beauty creams?

683
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:50,260
I brought you many new products.

684
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:50,940
Let me apply one for you.

685
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:51,740
Okay. Come on.

686
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:52,830
No.

687
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:54,410
Your Highness.

688
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:55,760
Let me check them first.

689
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:56,870
No need.

690
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:59,120
I do know a thing or two

691
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:00,870
about beauty products.

692
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:03,810
Ms. Yan's creams

693
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,070
are made of herbs.

694
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,350
They're gentle and nourishing.

695
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:09,230
Even if the cream is slightly toxic,

696
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:10,710
it would require high doses

697
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,070
to be lethal.

698
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:15,150
I don't think I'd ever use that much.

699
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:17,670
You're brilliant, Your Highness.

700
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:19,080
The people's admiration for you

701
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,030
is like a river,

702
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:22,150
endless and unceasing.

703
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:23,280
Stop

704
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:24,510
flattering me.

705
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,030
Apply it for me now.

706
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:28,170
The rest of you,

707
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:30,230
leave.

708
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:34,660
Nanxing, hurry.

709
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:44,880
Miss Bai, you heard Her Highness…

710
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:46,430
I…

711
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:51,780
Should I leave too?

712
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:54,750
Suoluo.

713
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:55,310
You can stay.

714
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:56,110
Come here.

715
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:02,880
So comfortable.

716
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,650
Ms. Yan.

717
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:05,440
Nice to meet you.

718
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:17,910
Mother.

719
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:20,900
I heard that Blossom Beauty's cream

720
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,740
only works best

721
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,960
when combined

722
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:25,990
with Ms. Yan's special massage.

723
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:27,230
Since I'm here today,

724
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:28,150
Ms. Yan,

725
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:29,870
can you let me try it too?

726
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:32,110
Sure.

727
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:34,180
Look.

728
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:37,320
My skin is brighter than usual, isn't it?

729
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:39,350
Suoluo.

730
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:41,140
The hostage thing

731
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:43,180
at the Ghost Market

732
00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:44,730
was a misunderstanding.

733
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:46,670
Now, Ms. Yan

734
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:48,280
is your mother's friend.

735
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:51,140
You should be nice to each other in the future.

736
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:55,940
Sure enough, you snitched on me.

737
00:37:57,690 --> 00:37:58,850
Yesterday, you said

738
00:37:58,870 --> 00:38:01,440
Xinbai secretly got married in Heman.

739
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:03,710
How is the investigation going?

740
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:06,920
How come she knows everything?

741
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:08,150
What did Jiang Xinbai do

742
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:09,680
to make her hate him so much?

743
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:11,710
But her beef is with him.

744
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:13,390
Can't she leave me alone?

745
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:14,270
Your Highness.

746
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:14,960
Look.

747
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:17,190
You and the duchess are talking about family affairs.

748
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:18,050
I should leave.

749
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:19,000
No need.

750
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:21,550
You're my confidante.

751
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:23,430
I don't keep secrets from you.

752
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:26,140
Go on.

753
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:30,110
That woman has come to the capital too.

754
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:32,150
But Xinbai is very protective

755
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:33,220
of her.

756
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:34,730
No one has seen her yet.

757
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:37,970
You can't even find a girl in the capital.

758
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,760
I can find her.

759
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:41,090
I just need to do it secretly

760
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:42,590
to avoid upsetting Xinbai.

761
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:43,620
You have a point.

762
00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:46,550
Xinbai is always looking into other people.

763
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:48,590
If he knows we're secretly looking into him,

764
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:50,120
he'll definitely be angry.

765
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:57,400
Mother.

766
00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:01,510
That woman is infatuated with Xinbai.

767
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:04,390
Mother,

768
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:06,990
why don't you give them your approval?

769
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:09,750
Did I say I'd break them up?

770
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:12,250
Given Xinbai's personality,

771
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,280
I thought

772
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:14,910
he'd die alone.

773
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:17,560
Now that he's found himself a wife,

774
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:19,330
why should I turn her away?

775
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,810
I want you to look into her because I want

776
00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:23,090
to know who she is.

777
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:25,650
If she's from a good family,

778
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:27,550
I'll be elated.

779
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:29,510
Since Mother

780
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:30,990
wants to help them…

781
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:33,390
Ms. Yan.

782
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:36,390
Why don't you ask around for us?

783
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:40,230
I don't have the right.

784
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:41,660
You do.

785
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,630
You're my mother's friend

786
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:44,850
and Xinbai's friend.

787
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:47,430
You're the best one for this job.

788
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:49,360
But

789
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:51,250
if you're reluctant, forget it.

790
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:52,830
Yeah.

791
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:54,470
You're so smart, Suoluo.

792
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:55,690
Nanxing.

793
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:57,950
I can only ask you to do it

794
00:39:58,390 --> 00:39:59,230
without making Xinbai

795
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,750
mad at me.

796
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:02,720
I'll leave it to you.

797
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:03,610
Your Highness,

798
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:05,410
I'm just a businesswoman.

799
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:08,260
I'm not good at gathering information.

800
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:09,680
That's not true.

801
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:11,590
I think you're good at it.

802
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:12,230
Yes.

803
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:14,510
Isn't it the same as running a business?

804
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:16,670
You just need to plan it carefully.

805
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:20,350
It's settled then.
