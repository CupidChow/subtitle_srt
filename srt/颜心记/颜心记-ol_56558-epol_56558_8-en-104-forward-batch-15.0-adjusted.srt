Dismissed.

11
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:40,310
My lord,

12
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:41,910
I only heard that Shang Bieli

13
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,570
once worked under Nan Jifeng.

14
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:44,329
I didn't know

15
00:02:44,329 --> 00:02:45,790
they were sworn brothers.

16
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,230
That's not the point.

17
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:48,430
The point is

18
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:51,070
it took Shang Bieli so little time

19
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,870
to find out that we went to Heman.

20
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:53,990
That means

21
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:57,170
that batch of Zornia has arrived in the capital,

22
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,079
and

23
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:00,550

24

25
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:03,590
the lord who appeared in Heman

26
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:04,300
was me.

27
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,090
It was indeed fast.

28
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:08,070
I'm afraid His Majesty will soon

29
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:08,750
know it.

30
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,000
They spread the news

31
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,630
because they wanted me to be scolded by His Majesty

32
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,860
so that they could stop my investigation.

33
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:18,540
So,

34
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:20,450
we must find that batch of Zornia

35
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,990
and root out their contact in the capital

36
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:24,080
as soon as possible.

37
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:25,630
Only in this way

38
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:27,650
can we explain to His Majesty.

It's been a while.

53
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,110
How have you been?

54
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:06,890
This batch of Zornia was first transported by ship and then over land.

55
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:07,950
It should be

56
00:04:08,579 --> 00:04:09,870
in the capital by now.

57
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:11,210
Right, my lord.

58
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:12,980
Not long after they took the Zornia out of Heman,

59
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:15,120
they transferred it from the ship to a carriage.

60
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,390
They changed the carriage

61
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,550
every time they passed a checkpoint.

62
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:18,900
After arriving at the posthouse outside the capital,

63
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,190
they designed a cover-up

64
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:21,310
by driving three carriages

65
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:23,370
into the capital at different times.

66
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:24,550
Our men are trying to find out

67
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:25,740
which carriage they put the Zornia in.

68
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,110
Perhaps there's Zornia in all three carriages.

69
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:28,670
My lord,

70
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,730
after we locate the Zornia,

71
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:33,600
shall we seize it and arrest those men immediately?

72
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,910
Don't rush.

73
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,140
I deliberately let them take the Zornia out of Heman

74
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,590
to catch a big fish.

75
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,600
We just need to keep an eye on the bait

76
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:44,990
and see

77
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,550
who'll rise to it.

78
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,870
But the checkpoint through which the Zornia entered the capital

79
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,870
was controlled by the Jinwu Guards.

80
00:04:50,909 --> 00:04:52,610
If they had checked it thoroughly,

81
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:53,390
the Zornia

82
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,310
wouldn't have entered the capital.

83
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,909
Now that it's in the capital,

84
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:57,960
the Jinwu Guards

85
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:59,790
should be the first to be held accountable.

86
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:01,990
At least they're guilty of negligence.

87
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:02,950
I'm afraid

88
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:05,150
the Jinwu Guards will give us a hard time

89
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,840
in order to shift the blame.

90
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,430
They've already given us a lot of hard times!

91
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:10,830
What Mr. Fu said is right.

92
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:13,550
The Jinwu Guards failed to guard the city gate

93
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:15,410
and let Zornia enter the capital.

94
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:16,430
They

95
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:18,300
can't get away with it.

96
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:19,180
My lord,

97
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:21,830
did Shang Bieli pick a fight here this morning

98
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,510
to give us a hint?

99
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:25,360
My lord,

100
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:27,200
I'm still a little worried.

101
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:28,590
It was a risky move

102
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:30,670
to let them take the Zornia out of Heman.

103
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:32,000
If anything goes wrong,

104
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,110
we'll be guilty

105
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:35,110
of leading others to commit a crime.

106
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,440
The jurisdiction given by His Majesty

107
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:39,210
has made others jealous of us.

108
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,550
If we get caught,

109
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:42,630
it will cause a lot of trouble.

110
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,070
By then,

111
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:45,710
our mistake will be more serious

112
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:47,230
than the Jinwu Guards'.

113
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:53,630
The moment I let the Zornia out of Heman,

114
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:54,950
I knew

115
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,350
I must

116
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:58,670
succeed.

117
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,270

118
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,909

go to market.

120

-Yes.
-Yes.

Since I started to shapeshift,

122

I've been keeping records.

123

I will find you.

No matter what you look like by then,

129
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,550
I'll accept it.

130
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,080
I'll protect you.

What are you waiting for?

134

Well,

135
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:08,350
how did you see through my disguise again?

136
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:08,710
My lord,

137
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:10,070
you're so smart.

138
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:11,750
It's not because I'm smart,

139
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,150
but because you didn't pay enough attention to detail.

140
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:13,909
Right.

141
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:15,690
My lord, you're sharp.

142
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:17,810
But how did you

143
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:19,170
see through my disguise this time?

144
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:21,350
Last time, you said it was from my smell.

145
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:22,530
But this time, before I came out,

146
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:23,240
I burned incense,

147
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,230
and I'm wearing a sachet.

148
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,550
It can cover my smell.

149
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:28,350
What betrayed you was not your smell

150
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:29,500
but your hand.

151
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:30,800
My hand?

152
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,330
What was wrong with my hand?

153
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:35,850
The way you waved your fan

154
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:37,310
seemed very stiff.

155
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,180
Obviously, you don't use fans very often.

156
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:39,870
Besides,

157
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:42,850
although you're dressed like a playboy,

158
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:45,350
there are calluses on your hand,

159
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,860
which clearly shows you've practiced martial arts

160

I was careless.

165

I'll be more careful next time.

166
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,630
Let's go.

167

You never confuse them?

00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:42,870
got injured.

176
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:44,320
The rest are fine.

177
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:47,950
The pigeons

178
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:48,790
look so alike,

179
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,650
yet you can tell one from another.

180
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:53,010
How come you can't recognize people?

181
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:00,970
Because everyone has many faces,

182
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,120
and they may change it anytime.

183
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,070
That's right.

184
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,240
Most people

185
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,060
act in their self-interest.

186
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:08,480
They tend to change their attitude anytime.

187
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,860
The only forthright, sincere person

188
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,430
I've seen over the years

189
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:13,250
is the Poison Girl.

190
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:18,790
Her name is Yan Nanxing.

191
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:20,510
Okay.

192
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:21,590
Yan Nanxing.

193
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:22,950
My lord,

194
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,790
haven't you ever thought about

195
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:25,950
looking for Ms. Yan?

196
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:30,510
Where

197
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,160
are you going next?

198
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:36,230
Perhaps

199
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:39,870
I'll go to my mother

200
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:41,480
or

201
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,570
somewhere I've never been to.

202
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,060
If...

203
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:48,150
If I run into trouble,

204
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:50,170
I'll go to the capital to find you.

205
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:57,070
She didn't commit a crime.

206
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,910
Why should I look for her?

207
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:00,310
My lord,

208
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,520
you know

209
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:02,670
I didn't mean that.

210
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:04,080
Now that she's gone,

211
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:05,470
aren't you worried about her?

212
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:06,530
Don't you miss her?

213
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:12,910
Have you found out

214
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,370
where the goods from Heman

215
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:15,270
are?

216
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:16,550
My lord,

217
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:19,040
the goods were taken to Fanhou Street.

218
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:20,270
Fanhou Street?

219
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:22,390
The Ghost Market?

220
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,190
That's right.

221
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:27,550
No wonder

222
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:29,050
we didn't find any traces.

223
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:32,200
Turns out the Zornia was taken into the Ghost Market.

224
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:35,490
Which store in the market did they take it to?

225
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:37,400
We lost them.

226
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:39,590
You lost them?

227
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:41,830
Don't worry, my lord.

228
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:43,870
The Ghost Market's road network is complex.

229
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:44,470
Our men

230
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:46,110
lost them at the last moment.

231
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:48,390
The goods must be still in the market.

232
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:49,870
I've sent spies there.

233
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:51,310
If anything happens,

234
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,110
they'll report it immediately.

235
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:55,880
They were in such a hurry

236
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,890
to transport the Zornia from Heman to the capital.

237
00:11:58,890 --> 00:11:59,940
This batch of Zornia won't be kept

238
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,390
in the Ghost Market for long

239
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:03,350
and will soon go to market.

240
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:08,910
It seems

241
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:10,630
the big fish

242
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:12,390
is about to take the bait.

243
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,350
Don't worry, my lord.

244
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:16,010
Our men are watching closely.

245
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,310
Didn't you say there were three carriages?

246
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:20,550
What about the other two?

247
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:21,950
We've checked the other two.

248
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,270
One was hired by them randomly,

249
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:24,470
and there was nothing wrong with it.

250
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:26,160
The woman from Heman

251
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:27,610
was sitting in the other carriage.

252
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:29,070
Our men are following her.

253
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:31,070
My lord,

254
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:32,690
the woman who transported the Zornia from Heman to the capital

255
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:33,790
found out we were after her.

256
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,070
She went to Twelve Music House

257
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:37,470
and are now surrounded by the Jinwu Guards.

258
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:42,280
[Twelve Music House]

259
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:57,310
Move.

260
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:57,710
Make way.

261
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,230
Get out of the way.

262
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:00,960
The officers are here.

263
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,390
Yes.

264
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:11,510
Jiang Xinbai,

265
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:14,100
I didn't mean to do your job.

266
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:15,910
She came in herself.

267
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,270
I can't let her kill someone

268
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:19,070
under my nose.

269
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:22,520
The Inspection Office will take over now.

270
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:24,940
Please take your Jinwu Guards away.

271
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:29,550
Do you think we're

272
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:32,020
entertainers at Twelve Music House

273
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:34,120
who come and go

274
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,990
as you wish?

275
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:37,390
Let me go,

276
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:38,550
or

277
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:39,590
I'll cut her neck.

278
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:42,950
Mr. Shang,

279
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:45,470
we can talk about

280
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:47,200
our personal grudge later.

281
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:48,310
Now,

282
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:51,630
please take your Jinwu Guards away.

283
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,910
You don't know how to treat girls gently.

284
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:55,630
I'm afraid once you do something,

285
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:56,870
both girls

286
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:58,030
will die.

287
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:27,750
Why did you kill her?

288
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,070
I killed the suspect

289
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:33,930
to protect the victim.

290
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:35,290
Was that wrong?

291
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:39,770
You're not convinced?

292
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:42,030
Go impeach me.

293
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,230
Shang Bieli!

294
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:49,870
Jiang Xinbai,

295
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,430
since you came here to arrest the girl yourself,

296
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:53,950
it must be a big case.

297
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:55,230
What a pity!

298
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:57,750
She died.

299
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:02,370
You must be very upset.

300
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:07,380
Take your time.

301
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:15,500
The suspect attempted to murder a girl.

302
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,680
I had no choice

303
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,760
but to execute her on the spot.

304
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:21,090
Jinwu Guards, leave here.

305
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:22,270
Leave the rest

306
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:24,810
to the Inspection Office.

307
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:26,310
-Yes.
-Yes.

308
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,360
Take her body away first.

309
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,670
Shang Bieli was so cruel.

310
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:53,990
He killed her with a single blow.

311
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:55,870
He didn't give us a chance to ask her anything.

312
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,130
Another lead dried up.

313
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:59,530
When we want a lead, there will be one.

314
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,300
Ask the spies in Heman

315
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:03,550
to watch more closely.

316
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:05,240
If anyone suspicious

317
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,590
contacts someone in the capital,

318
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,670
let me know immediately.

319
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:08,410
Don't worry, my lord.

320
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:09,940
I've arranged everything.

321
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:13,950
Why did she go to Twelve Music House?

322
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:15,350
Did she enter by mistake,

323
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:16,470
or...

324
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,390
You mean

325
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:20,490
she went to Twelve Music House

326
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,680
to find her partner

327
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:22,620
or contact?

328
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:24,150
Aren't Zornia traders

329
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,410
all desperadoes

330
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,930
or men of sacrifice?

331
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,190
Why would she lead us

332
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:29,630
to her partner?

333
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:32,370
When someone's life is in danger,

334
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,590
it's their instinct to seek survival.

335
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:35,230
I see.

336
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:36,650
I'll send some men

337
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:38,030
to keep a close watch on Twelve Music House

338
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,870
and find out who entered or left there

339
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:41,470
in the past four hours.

340
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:43,590
The only way

341
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:45,990
is to lock the Ghost Market down.

342
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:47,410
My lord,

343
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:48,550
the Ghost Market is where minorities from the border

344
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,210
and foreign refugees gather.

345
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,410
Criminal cases involving foreigners

346
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,350
are handled by the Court of State Ceremonials.

347
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:54,790
The Inspection Office is not in charge of that.

348
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:55,520
Yes, my lord.

349
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:56,390
If we

350
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:58,190
barge into the Ghost Market rashly,

351
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:59,310
there might be trouble in the future.

352
00:16:59,310 --> 00:16:59,770
My lord,

353
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:01,150
I'll go to the Court of State Ceremonials

354
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,410
to apply for a document

355
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,590
in case we need it.

356
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:08,490
The Inspection Office

357
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:10,670
has never been to the Ghost Market for a case.

358
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:12,600
If you apply for a document rashly,

359
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:14,770
I'm afraid our secret will be leaked.

360
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:17,390
I'm going to

361
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:18,910
my grandfather's birthday banquet tonight.

362
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:20,460
If there's an emergency,

363
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,420
come to Western Suburb Mansion to find me.

364
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,680
Will anything happen?

365
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,990
Just

366
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:26,230
in case.

367
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:32,230
[Western Suburb Mansion]

368
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:34,790
[Yanzhu Hall]

369
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:53,860
[Duchess of Yuejiang, Jiang Suoluo]

370
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:13,860
[Yanzhu Hall]

371
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,270
Xinbai, you're still so arrogant

372
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,470
and full of yourself.

373
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:27,990
It's Suoluo,

374
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:29,430
not a female guest.

375
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:31,670
Suoluo.

376
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:36,830
Sorry.

377
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:39,270
I was thinking about something.

378
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:40,870
I didn't look carefully.

379
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,800
It was dark last time.

380
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,080
But we're in broad daylight now.

381
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,500
How do you explain it?

382
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:54,560
Why did you arrive so late, too?

383
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:56,820
The crown prince had a morning class today.

384
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,710
Her Majesty asked me to stay to have a chat.

385
00:18:58,710 --> 00:18:59,840
That's why I'm late.

386
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:02,290
What about you?

387
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:05,540
Why are you late?

388
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:09,450
I had work to do at the Inspection Office.

389
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,400
Right.

390
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:14,670
You never

391
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:16,070
care about socializing

392
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:17,200
or this family.

393
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:18,570
Grandfather is already very happy

394
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:20,120
that you agreed to come.

395
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:21,580
He won't care

396
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,660
whether you're late or not.

397
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:25,590
What?

398
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:27,560
You are not talking

399
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:29,790
because you don't want

400
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:31,520
to argue with your fake sister?

401
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:33,910
Suoluo,

402
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,080
we have the same mother.

403
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:37,890
What do you mean by "fake"?

404
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:39,830
Don't say this in front of

405
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:41,230
Mother and Grandfather.

406
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:45,400
You're so considerate towards Mother.

407
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,390
Are you determined

408
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:47,320
to get her title?

409
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,650
Are you interested in the succession,

410
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:52,590
or are you curious

411
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:54,650
about whether I'll be the successor?

412
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:58,040
Both.

413
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:01,020
Since Mother can be a princess,

414
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:02,150
why can't I?

415
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:08,420
Will you support me?

416
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:12,590
If I don't,

417
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,160
will you give up?

418
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:17,230
Of course not.

419
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:18,680
On the contrary,

420
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:20,350
if you support me,

421
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:22,230
I'll be more worried.

422
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:23,870
Because I don't know

423
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:25,350
what you will actually do

424
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:27,600
when you claim to support me.

425
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:32,570
It's getting late.

426
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:33,830
Don't keep Mother

427
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:35,290
and Grandfather waiting.

428
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:37,670
Xinbai.

429
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,260
I won't keep you waiting, too.

430
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:53,760
Nice to meet you.

431
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,350
My lords.

432
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,390
Grandfather.

433
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:00,710
My little granddaughter is here.

434
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:01,880
Let me look at you.

435
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:04,270
Greetings, Grandfather.

436
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:05,030
Good.

437
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:05,950
Did you miss me?

438
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:06,510
Yes.

439
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:07,670
Grandfather.

440
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:08,660
[Prince of Weiding]

441
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:10,430
Let me look at you.

442
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:12,110
Good.

443
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,030
Where is your father?

444
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:19,110
Xinbai,

445
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:20,190
you're here.

446
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,030
Mother.

447
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:22,650
Here's the thing.

448
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,190
My father said

449
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:25,630
many big shots

450
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:26,760
would be here today,

451
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:28,400
so he'd better not come.

452
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:29,910
Nonsense.

453
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:31,910
Your father and mother

454
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:34,070
are officially married.

455
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,780
Who dares to talk?

456
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:38,400
Your father

457
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:39,310
gave me

458
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:41,510
such a clever granddaughter.

459
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:43,070
I value you and your father

460
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:44,390
very much.

461
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:45,410
Ask him

462
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:46,720
to come here a few days later

463
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,760
to drink tea and play chess with me.

464
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:50,990
Okay, Grandfather.

465
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:51,790
Xinbai,

466
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,590
find a chance to propose a toast

467
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:55,670
to your grandfather later.

468
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:58,210
Mother, you know

469
00:21:58,390 --> 00:21:59,670
I don't drink.

470
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,050
A little.

471
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,150
Just a little.

472
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,580
We're family after all.

473
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:14,030
Father,

474
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,350
today is your 70th birthday.

475
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:17,480
I specially prepared

476
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,960
these fancy clothes.

477
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:20,290
Am I beautiful?

478
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:21,270
Of course.

479
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,780
My daughter

480
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:25,840
is always beautiful

481
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,110
and elegant.

482
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:29,630
The other day, she went to the palace to drink tea

483
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:31,590
in a gold-threaded dress.

484
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:34,070
Even Her Majesty praised her.

485
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:35,520
Mother,

486
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,910
let me wear the gold-threaded dress

487
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:37,750
someday

488
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,600
so I'll have a glorious moment, too.

489
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,840
You're so sweet.

490
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:41,930
I'll give it to you.

491
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:43,570
Thank you, Mother.

492
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:45,020
Grandfather,

493
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:45,990
Mother said she'll give the dress

494
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:46,830
to me.

495
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:48,160
Good.

496
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:55,720
Lord Lu, Lord Hu,

497
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:58,270
and Lord Yuan are here.

498
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:00,410
Your Highness, we wish you

499
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:02,240
happiness

500
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:03,750
and good health.

501
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:05,750
Thank you.

502
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:08,910
Your Highness, I knew you liked calligraphy works and paintings,

503
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:09,710
so

504
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:11,900
I went to Qiuci

505
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,920
[Assistant Minister of Rites, Lu Dingzhao]

506
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:14,000
to find this Flying Fairy painting

507
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,390
for you.

508
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:17,710
Thank you.

509
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:18,750
Thank you.

510
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:23,510
Suoluo.

511
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:24,890
This is Lord Lu,

512
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:27,790
who just got promoted from Assistant Imperial Censor

513
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:31,030
to Assistant Minister of Rites.

514
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:33,820
He is Lord Lu,

515
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:35,310
who handled my father's case

516
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:36,840
and sentenced him to exile.

517
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:37,500
Lord Lu,

518
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,630
it's a pleasure to meet you.

519
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:43,400
Your Grace, you're so kind.

520
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:45,630
You just started your political career.

521
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:46,830
If you need me

522
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:47,790
in the future,

523
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:49,060
just let me know.

524
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:53,450
You just started your political career?

525
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:04,180
Mother,

526
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,160
Grandfather,

527
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:07,080
I didn't have time to tell you.

528
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:09,310
Today, I've asked for His Majesty

529
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:11,190
and Her Majesty's permission to resign.

530
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:12,310
Starting next month,

531
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:13,270
I'll stop teaching

532
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:14,510
the crown prince.

533
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,720
His Majesty has allowed me

534
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:18,750
to transfer to the Imperial Academy

535
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:19,680
as a chancellor.

536
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,300
Chancellor? That's amazing. Right.

537
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:26,390
Although being the crown prince's teacher is an honor,

538
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:27,710
a chancellor at the Imperial Academy

539
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:29,110
is an official position.

540
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:30,920
I've studied hard for years.

541
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,720
I want to put my knowledge into use

542
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,000
to serve the court

543
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,920
and share my mother's burden.

544
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,550
Good.

545
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:39,190
Great!

546
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,920
This is the best gift

547
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:42,190
I've received today.

548
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:46,240
Every girl of the Jiang family

549
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:48,630
is a heroine.

550
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,190
My daughter

551
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:52,070
is the first princess

552
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:53,270
in this dynasty.

553
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:55,160
My granddaughter

554
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:56,430
is the first female chancellor

555
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:58,350
in this dynasty.

556
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:04,630
This shows His Majesty's wisdom and good judgment.

557
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:06,550
He strives for gender equality

558
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:07,790
and offers a position to anyone with talent.

559
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:09,960
His open-mindedness

560
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:12,480
is a blessing to the country.

561
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:13,070
Yes.

562
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:15,510
It's a blessing to the country.

563
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:17,260
It's a blessing to the country.

564
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:22,430
Mother.

565
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:23,430
Grandfather.

566
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:25,880
There's a report from the Inspection Office.

567
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,430
I need to deal with it at the gate.

568
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:28,490
I'll be right back.

569
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:41,030
My lord,

570
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:41,990
I just got

571
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:43,050
an important clue.

572
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,270
Previously, Zornia in the capital

573
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:46,550
was distributed on the 15th of every month.

574
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:47,190
The 15th?

575
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:48,790
It's today.

576
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:52,470
Is the news reliable?

577
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:52,950
Yes.

578
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,270
Just now, our spies reported

579
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:55,830
that they saw someone suspicious in the Ghost Market

580
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:57,550
who was probably there to pick up the goods.

581
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:58,590
I'll go in and say goodbye.

582
00:25:58,590 --> 00:25:59,590
Wait for me here.

583
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:00,350
Yes.

584
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:03,830
Mother.

585
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,360
Where are you going?

586
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:06,590
I...

587
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:15,720
It seems

588
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:18,030
you're leaving early again.

589
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,590
But today is your grandfather's

590
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:24,470
birthday.

591
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:26,710
It's inappropriate to leave early.

592
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,550
I let a batch of Zornia

593
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:36,720
out of Heman.

594
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:38,760
Now it has entered the capital.

595
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:42,090
So serious?

596
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,230
It has entered

597
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:46,350
the Ghost Market.

598
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,160
So, I can't let it

599
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:49,150
get out of the Ghost Market.

600
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:49,810
Otherwise,

601
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:51,870
what I did will be unforgivable.

602
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:53,470
So,

603
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:55,000
even if

604
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:56,550
I offend Grandfather today,

605
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:57,830
I have to leave.

606
00:26:58,470 --> 00:26:59,470
The Ghost Market?

607
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:00,910
Report.

608
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:03,100
The commander-in-chief of the Jinwu Guards,

609
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,410
Shang Bieli, is here.

610
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:07,770
Wait for me here.

611
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:08,290
Yes.

612
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:14,930
Your Highness.

613
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,350
Mr. Shang.

614
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:18,120
I didn't expect you

615
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:19,230
to come here today.

616
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,820
I thought the Jinwu Guards

617
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:22,380
were rushed off their feet.

618
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,020
Your Highness.

619
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:26,450
The duchess and I have known each other for years,

620
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:27,580
so I came uninvited.

621
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:28,970
Please forgive me.

622
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:31,470
That just means you're a man who follows his heart.

623
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:32,330
Please come in.

624
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:34,750
Mr. Jiang...

625
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:36,670
No.

626
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:38,680
You're a duke today.

627
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:42,310
It's rare for us to meet in private.

628
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:44,160
I have some doubts.

629
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:46,130
May I ask you a few questions?

630
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:51,230
Sure.

631
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:52,870
It's rare for us to meet.

632
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:54,330
We should have a good chat.

633
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:55,190
But

634
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:56,980
I want to take you

635
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,580
to see my grandfather first.

636
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:08,510
Grandfather.

637
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,430
I brought Mr. Shang here

638
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:12,030
to wish you a happy birthday.

639
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:13,870
Mr. Shang.

640
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:15,370
Your Highness,

641
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:17,510
I've prepared some gifts for you.

642
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:18,320
I wish you

643
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:19,750
happiness, good health,

644
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:20,670
and longevity.

645
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:22,750
Thank you, Mr. Shang.

646
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:28,800
This jade Ruyi scepter is from the state in the south.

647
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:32,210
It came to our country through Heman.

648
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:34,880
The quality is rare.

649
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:36,150
I hope you like it.

650
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:37,270
Good.

651
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:39,430
Grandfather,

652
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:41,400
there's one more thing.

653
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,040
The Jinwu Guards

654
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:44,390
are on patrol tonight.

655
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:46,030
They are short-handed.

656
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:46,790
So,

657
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:47,930
Mr. Shang

658
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:49,660
came here to ask for my help.

659
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:51,870
I need to go back to the Inspection Office now

660
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:53,530
and send some men to Mr. Shang.

661
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:55,830
Grandfather, please allow me to go.

662
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:56,710
-I…
-Mr. Shang.

663
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:58,070
Never mind.

664
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:00,690
My grandfather is a sensible man.

665
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:02,970
He won't blame you for taking me away.

666
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,710
Mr. Shang, turns out

667
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:06,830
you didn't come here

668
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:08,470
to celebrate my birthday.

669
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:09,770
Well, I…

670
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:11,190
Mr. Shang and Xinbai

671
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:12,270
are both working for the court

672
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:13,470
and the people.

673
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,940
Business comes first

674
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,270
rather than private matters.

675
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:17,310
It doesn't matter.

676
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:18,570
Go do your thing.

677
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:21,830
Then Mr. Shang and I

678
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,060
shall take our leave.

679
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:23,790
Go.

680
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:26,680
Your Highness.

681
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:27,590
I...

682
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:36,270
You wanted the old prince to think

683
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:37,400
I'm rude, right?

684
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:39,830
Everyone in the capital knows

685
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:41,240
you're a lunatic.

686
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:42,790
So what

687
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,580
if my grandfather thinks you're rude?

688
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:46,590
Your spies have been busy these days.

689
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:48,590
They even entered the Ghost Market.

690
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,430
Mr. Jiang,

691
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:52,270
what are you looking for?

692
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:56,640
Is it because the Jinwu Guards are well-informed,

693
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,040
or is it because you're keeping an eye on me?

694
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:01,370
What a bad memory you have!

695
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:04,310
You forgot what you owe me?

696
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:07,190
So, I will pay much attention

697
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:10,490
to everything related to the Inspection Office.

698
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:11,010
My lord.

699
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:16,740
I have something urgent to do.

700
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:18,450
Let's talk next time.

701
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:48,030
Bravo!

702
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:50,630
Bravo!

703
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:52,470
Knick-knacks and small pendants.

704
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:53,400
Come take a look.

705
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:54,550
Sachets.

706
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:55,830
Look at the sachets.

707
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:56,560
Hello, Miss.

708
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:00,270
Nv'er hong.

709
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:03,510
Bravo!

710
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:06,110
Miss, do you want a steamed stuffed bun?

711
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:12,470
Here are your dishes.

712
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,180
Take care.

713
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:18,270
Don't miss it.

714
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:20,370
Eat and drink to warm up your stomach.

715
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:23,870
Miss.

716
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:26,350
Although the restaurant is small, there's everything you want.

717
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:27,610
What do you want to eat?

718
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:34,110
Let's go.

719
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:36,960
Please sit down.

720
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:39,310
Do you want to have a meal

721
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,310
or get a room?

722
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:42,030
I'd like a cup of hot tea first

723
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:43,190
to relieve my fatigue.

724
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:44,750
Then, fill the table

725
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:45,700
with delicious food.

726
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,190
Okay.

727
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:48,970
Fill the table?

728
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:51,270
Are you eating alone?

729
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:53,640
Are you looking down on me?

730
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,420
I'm afraid you can't finish all the food.

731
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:59,090
The dishes will be ready soon.

732
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:17,120
Miss, you have a good appetite.

733
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:19,430
Have some soup.

734
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:20,950
Young man,

735
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:23,300
I like the food here.

736
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:25,750
I'll stay here for a few more days

737
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:27,050
for the food.

738
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:28,400
Get me a room

739
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:29,430
for two days.

740
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:30,450
Okay.

741
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:31,750
I'll arrange it now.

742
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:32,570
Wait.

743
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:35,110
Since this restaurant

744
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:36,750
is located in the capital

745
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:38,600
and packed with customers,

746
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,680
you must have seen a lot.

747
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:42,480
You look smart

748
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:43,870
and nice.

749
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:46,390
May I

750
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:48,550
ask you something?

751
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,700
Is now a good time?

752
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,240
You want to ask me something?

753
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:54,750
Now is not a good time.

754
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,670
What a pity!

755
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:02,150
Now is not a good time?

756
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:04,280
It is a good time.

757
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:06,110
Just ask.

758
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:07,070
I'll tell you

759
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:08,330
everything I know.

760
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:09,790
Here's the thing.

761
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:11,390
The Ghost Market?

762
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:12,580
Is it haunted?

763
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:16,690
The Ghost Market is located in Fanhou District.

764
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:17,930
There are many refugees from outside the capital.

765
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:19,970
All sorts of people gather there.

766
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,560
It's not regulated by the law of the capital.

767
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:25,790
Young man, you know a lot.

768
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:28,390
Tell me more.

769
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:30,770
As the saying goes,

770
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:32,390
both thieves and officials

771
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:34,320
have their own way of doing things.

772
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:35,230
Many shady trades

773
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:36,940
take place in the Ghost Market,

774
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:38,910
including the trading of information.

775
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:40,610
If you want to ask for information,

776
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:42,330
the best place in the capital

777
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:43,880
is the Ghost Market.

778

Who should I go to?

What's the man's name?

780
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,190
It's on the tip of my tongue.

781
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:52,990
I can't remember. His name is...

782

It's on the tip of my tongue. I can't remember...

What's his name?

00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,210

to do accounts.

796
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:40,510
You are the only slave who got admitted

Mr. Cao, I'm flattered.

But some items in the account book

802
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:51,850
don't match the actual goods.

803

is the account for yesterday.

Yesterday?

808
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:07,840
It should be tea.

We don't know what she's up to.

871
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:50,630
Their contact code today is

872
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:51,830
"There's a full moon tonight."

873
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:52,710
Besides the contact code,

874
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:53,790
the receiver and the holder

875
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:55,190
each have a special token,

876
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:58,790
which will be combined into one piece to confirm their identity.

877
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:04,110
If any new faces

878
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:05,830
come here after me,

879
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:07,000
keep an eye on them as well.

880
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,210
Okay. Enjoy your tea.

881
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:16,780
My lord,

882
00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:18,500
the woman is paying her full attention

883
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,580
to the dancer.

884
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:21,980
If she's here to pick up the goods,

885
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:24,110
she should be looking for her contact.

886
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:26,230
Not only isn't she looking for her contact,

887
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:27,090
but she might be

888
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:30,040
betting on how many spins the dancer can do.

889
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:32,180
You can even guess that?

890
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:35,700
I didn't guess.

891
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:38,110
Look at the drummer

892
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:39,420
next to her.

893
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:43,990
784.

894
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:48,110
You're amazing!

895
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:52,310
Let's go down and have a look.

896
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:53,870
My lord,

897
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:55,670
we've been followed all the way here.

898
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:56,390
Shall we...

899
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:57,800
Shake her off.

900
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:12,980
Why did Jiang Xinbai come to the Ghost Market?

901
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:15,370
Let me see

902
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:17,110
what you're up to.

903
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:20,520
Do you like this?

904
00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:32,670
I haven't found

905
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:33,790
any pawnshops.

906
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:35,830
No branches.

907
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:37,480
Is it so hard to find?

908
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:51,810
[Twelve Music House]

909
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:00,740
Stop it.

910
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,960
I don't want to listen to any music

911
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,420
or watch any dances today.

912
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:14,670
Mr. Shang.

913
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:17,030
Mr. Jiang has entered the Ghost Market.

914
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:19,330
Let's wait.

915
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:22,020
Only after Jiang Xinbai sets a "fire"

916
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:24,990
can we go there to put it out

917
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:27,230
and

918
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:30,230
catch the "arsonist."
