Ruoqian

5
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:05,270
really overreacted.

6
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,310
I thought I was menstruating.

7
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:09,310
Turned out, it was just an oil stain.

8
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:15,389
Were you scared just now?

9
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:16,990
Of course.

10
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:19,710
I don't know who I'll become every time.

11
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:21,200
Sometimes I'm an old man,

12
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,280
sometimes a child,

13
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,640
sometimes a man,

14
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:25,329
and sometimes a woman.

15
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:26,710
Of course I'm scared.

16
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:31,870
I didn't expect

17
00:02:32,829 --> 00:02:34,310
you to admit it to me.

18
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:36,790
I didn't expect

19
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,240
to ask for your help either.

20
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:58,829
It seems that since I met you,

21
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:00,870
you found me every time

22
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:02,550
I hid away in fear.

23
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:07,910
You also said that

24
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,570
no matter what I become,

25
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:10,950
you would recognize me.

26
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:11,590
Yes.

27
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:12,600
Lies.

28
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,390
But I believed you.

29
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:17,180
Maybe

30
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,870
it's because you don't remember people by their looks.

31
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,180
But it's strange.

32
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:22,950
Sometimes,

33
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,270
I was afraid that you would expose me.

34
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:26,090
Other times,

35
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:28,180
I hoped that you would expose me.

36
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:29,940
Why so?

37
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,230
Actually...

38
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,030
I want people

39
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:38,810
to see me.

40
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:40,829
Maybe

41
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,310
it's because I'm lonely.

42
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:46,070
Lonely?

43
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:57,720
I've told you the truth.

44
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,160
When will you tell me the truth?

45
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:06,000
This is your last chance.

46
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,150
We have to be frank with each other

47
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,150
so you can protect me

48
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,010
and vice versa.

49
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:13,050
You can protect me?

50
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,840
You're changing the subject again!

51
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:16,990
You lock

52
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,380
your heart away every time

53
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,910
you get the answer you want.

54
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:22,990
Can you tell me

55
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,589
what happened to you

56
00:04:24,589 --> 00:04:25,510
for you to

57
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,070
become like this?

58
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:30,280
Well,

59
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,640
it's a long and complicated story.

60
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:34,030
Anyway, I came to the capital

61
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,060
to find Young Sir

62
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,630
for the answer.

63
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,270
So,

64
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,510
this Young Sir of yours

65
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:47,110
can shapeshift too?

66
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,560
Maybe.

67
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,800
Maybe he is the only kin

68
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:53,480
of my kind in this world.

69
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:56,430
If that's the case,

70
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:58,180
have you ever considered that

71
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:58,930
although you cannot

72
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,590
control your shapeshifting,

73
00:05:00,909 --> 00:05:02,040
he might be able to?

74
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:05,220
What do you mean?

75
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:07,990
Think about it.

76
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,100
You've been in the capital for so long,

77
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,560
but you haven't found him.

78
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:13,320
Is there a possibility that

79
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,690
he is using shapeshifting

80
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:16,870
to avoid you?

81
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,300
Why would he do that?

82
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,590
He doesn't know I'm looking for him.

83
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:22,830
That's the key here.

84
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,650
You've been looking for him.

85
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:26,050
Why didn't he come to you?

86
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,090
How can you assume that?

87
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:29,910
Maybe he has been looking for me too.

88
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:30,630
Maybe he has been looking for me

89
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,870
for a long time to no avail.

90
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,390
Why are you saying all of this?

91
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,830
People change.

92
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:36,510

I see.

Are you here to perform?

153

What makes you think

00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,280
I'm here to perform?

Isn't it obvious?

How so?

157
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:20,350

00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:47,270
Mr. Li is here to save him.

351
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,790
Letting him go would be favoritism.

352
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:50,810
But if we lock him up,

353
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,170
this game will be over.

354
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:03,620
Grandfather!

355
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,790
I suffered a lot.

356
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:07,910
He...

357
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:08,390
Shut up!

358
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:11,260
This kid is ignorant.

359
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:13,790
Thank you for teaching him

360
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:15,450
a lesson for me, Mr. Jiang.

361
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:16,930
Don't say that, Mr. Lu.

362
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:18,550
We needed

363
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:21,300
Young Master Li's help with some cases.

364
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:23,030
It did inconvenience him.

365
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,010
Now that everything is fine,

366
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:27,290
please take Mr. Li

367
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,870
to rest at home.

368
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:31,010
Thank you, Your Highness.

369
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:31,750
Please.

370
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,430
Grandpa, let me tell you.

371
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,760
I told him in there.

372
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:38,350
I... I'm innocent.

373
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:39,590
Shut up. Stop talking.

374
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:40,590
He kept interrogating me

375
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:41,390
about things.

376
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:43,650

378
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,260
Grandfather.

379
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:04,960
Why were you here

380
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:06,070
with Mr. Li?

381
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:08,380
The Suburb Mansion is quiet and peaceful.

382
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:10,630
It's annoying to live alone there for too long.

383
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:12,360
I was taking a stroll in the city

384
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,230
and ran into Mr. Lu.

385
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:15,000
He said

386
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,560
his grandson

387
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,060
was detained by you.

388
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,040
So,

389
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:21,390
I followed him to have a look.

390
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,990
I see.

391
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:27,780
After so many years,

392
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:31,190
you still want to avenge your father?

393
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:37,620
I just want to fulfill

394
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:39,510
the duty of the Inspection Office

395
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:41,140
and have a clear conscience.

396
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:44,040
If you really want revenge,

397
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:45,200
you should

398
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,850
take revenge on me too.

399
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:49,310
Back then,

400
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,220
I forced

401
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:52,250
your parents to divorce each other.

402
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:55,680
I'm partly to be blamed

403
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:59,380
for your father's death in Yazhou.

404
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:02,580
I dare not.

405
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:03,830
You dare not?

406
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,750
Why not?

407
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:10,870
When your father

408
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:12,170
was sent to Yazhou,

409
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,800
you were only five years old.

410
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:15,710
You insisted on abandoning your grandfather

411
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:16,670
and your mother

412
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:18,510
to follow your father

413
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:20,070
and suffer in Yazhou.

414
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:24,390
No matter how I coaxed, pleaded,

415
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:26,670
or told you that you belonged with the Jiang family,

416
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:27,730
it was useless.

417
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:30,710
Do you know

418
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:32,040
what you said back then?

419
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:36,190
Just one sentence.

420
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,660
That you were Xi Zhaoming's son.

421
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,360
Ever since you left,

422
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,620
your mother cried for a long time.

423
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:48,600
I couldn't do anything but

424
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,260
cry with her.

425
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:52,470
I also

426
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:54,230
reflected on myself.

427
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:54,830
Was it

428
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,550
all my fault in the end?

429
00:24:58,750 --> 00:24:59,270
No.

430
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:02,230

431
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:03,490
you did nothing wrong.

Didn't I know that

433
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,860
your father was wronged

434

for the Zornia case?

437

His Majesty was wary of us.

438
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,180
How could I possibly defend him?

439
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:18,190
Yes.

440
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:21,750
Grandfather,

441
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:23,630

442

the safety and honor of the Jiang family.

443
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:29,420

444
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,590
you could only forsake

Chancellor,

497
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:57,580
in my opinion,

498
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,930
the admission qualification of the Imperial Academy

499
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:01,860
was only limited to the officials.

500
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:04,510
After that, the opportunity was extended to the rich families.

501
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:06,970
Now, even poor individuals may be admitted.

502
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:09,130
Although His Majesty meant well,

503
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,000
should we not

possibly teach us?

507
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:17,810
Since His Majesty allowed

508
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:19,690
the admission of poor students

509
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:22,080

Why are you back so soon?

524
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,470
Because I missed you dearly, Suoluo.

525
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,290
That's why I ended my trip ahead of time

526
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:04,750
and rushed back to see you.

527
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:08,110
This is the Imperial Academy.

528
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:08,710
Don't say such

529
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:09,710
unfitting words.

530
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:13,470
Just now,

531
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:15,330
I shouldn't have questioned

532
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:17,260
your authority in front of others.

533
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:18,330
Don't be angry.

534
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:20,190
I'm angry

535
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:22,140
because of your societal prejudice.

536
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:24,200
Since you have a societal prejudice,

537
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:26,030
do you have

538
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,060
gender prejudice as well?

539
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:29,600
Do you respect me

540
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:31,030
as the chancellor or not?

541
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:33,240
You misunderstood me, Suoluo.

542
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,410
I've always been proud of you,

543
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:35,400
you know that.

544
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:39,230
Alright.

545
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:40,950
Let's not talk about

546
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:42,410
those irrelevant things.

547
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:44,910
I'm here

548
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:46,430
to ask you

549
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:49,460
when would be a good time

550
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,260
to inform the elders

551
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,480
about our agreement?

552
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:03,090
Now's not the time yet.

553
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,270
Okay.

554
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:09,410
I'll listen to you.

555
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,750
Just remember and understand that

556
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:19,920
I can help you.

557
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:23,330
So you have to be on my side.

558
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,190
Boss, Ruoqian!

559
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:26,730
I'm going to deliver the goods!

560
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:27,250
Sai'er.

561
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:28,770
Sai'er!

562
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,500
Don’t get lost again!

563
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,390
I won't!

564
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:33,420
[Blossom Beauty]

565
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:37,910
I can finally go back and eat something delicious.

566
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:33,030
It’s her.

567
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:38,750
Commander Shang.

568
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,370
Why is it so hard to find

569
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:41,570
my way in the capital?

570
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:42,780
I get lost every time.

571
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,830
The capital has many streets and alleys,

572
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:46,230
not to mention two markets and hundreds of shops.

573
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:47,560
It’s normal to get lost.

574
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:50,710
By the way, Commander Shang,

575
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,960
have you figured out how

576
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,890
to use the three peach wood pieces?

577
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:55,180
Are you serious?

578
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:57,270
I'm serious.

579
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:03,960
Have you found your fiance?

580
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,880
I almost forgot about that.

581
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:09,690
Blossom Beauty's business is booming.

582
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:11,490
I'm too busy to do anything else.

583
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:12,550
Besides,

584
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:13,670
I don't know

585
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:15,000
where to start looking.

586
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:17,550
You should get started soon.

587
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:21,660
It's not a good idea

588
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:23,820
to keep working at Blossom Beauty.

589
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:24,550
Why can't I just

590
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:26,350
keep working at Blossom Beauty?

591
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:28,500
Because...

592
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:32,620
Because you can't forget your purpose.

593
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,920
You came to the capital to look for someone,

594
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,520
not to work for someone else.

595
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:38,230
Anyway,

596
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:40,550
staying with Blossom Beauty

597
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,360
is not a long-term solution.

598
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,640
Why not?

599
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:48,630
Because you have to get married eventually.

600
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:49,450
Even so, I can still

601
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:51,520
work at Blossom Beauty after marriage.

602
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,430
What if your future husband

603
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:53,270
disagrees?

604
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,060
Then I won’t marry him.

605
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,060
I want to be with Boss forever.

606
00:32:58,450 --> 00:32:59,010
Boss?

607
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:02,370
Yan Nanxing is that important

608
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:03,550
to you?

609
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:07,380
Commander Shang.

610
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,510
Do you have a family?

611
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:09,350
Family?

612
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:13,790
I don't have one.

613
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,240
So, Boss is my family.

614
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:16,670
And I’m happy

615
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:17,430
with her.

616
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:20,530
Commander Shang.

617
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:21,070
I’m here.

618
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:22,340
Thank you.

619
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:24,760
Here.

620
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:27,510
If you get lost again,

621
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,460
find the Jinwu Guards.

622
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:29,790
They will send you back.

623
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:31,110
Okay, I got it.

624
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:31,920
I’m leaving.

625
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:39,950
Commander Shang.

626
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:42,700
Remember the peach wood pieces.

627
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:44,760
Tell me when you've made up your mind.

628
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:54,750
I've heard about the minor mishap

629
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:56,450
at the public banquet.

630
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:01,910
Let's

631
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:03,480
forget about that matter.

632
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:05,210
Otherwise, it might affect

633
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:07,540
the duke's relationship with his family.

634
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:09,910
I think we better not make a fuss about it.

635
00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:11,510
If His Majesty hears about it,

636
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:13,510
our loss will be more than our gains.

637
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:16,630
That lady must be

638
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:17,670
unpresentable.

639
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:19,590
That's why my son

640
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:20,989
didn't tell me about her.

641
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,469
Maybe your son

642
00:34:22,469 --> 00:34:23,929
isn't good enough for her.

643
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:30,800
Greetings, Mother.

644
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:33,670
Ms. Yan, you're here too.

645
00:34:36,469 --> 00:34:37,060
Son,

646
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:40,510
I won't beat around the bush.

647
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:42,190
Let me ask you.

648
00:34:42,909 --> 00:34:44,550
Are you secretly married?

649
00:34:50,909 --> 00:34:51,360
Yes.

650
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:53,810
However,

651
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,179
I've divorced her.

652
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:01,949
Why?

653
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:03,830
It's complicated.

654
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:06,830
I can only say that

655
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:10,690
we were not fated to grow old together.

656
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:13,090
Still, I look back on our encounter fondly.

657
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:19,510
So

658
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:21,210
you don't plan to

659
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:22,340
reconcile with her?

660
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:28,960
My life is unpredictable.

661
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:30,270
I don't know

662
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:33,000
if I'm suitable for her.

663
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:39,070
No.

664
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:40,190
I mean

665
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,280
whether I'm suitable

666
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:43,470
for any woman

667
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:45,330
who wants to live a peaceful life.

668
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:53,850
So you left her

669
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:55,070
to protect her.

670
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:56,710
In that case,

671
00:35:56,850 --> 00:35:58,130
just forget about it.

672
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:19,090
Your Grace.

673
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:23,120
This voice is not familiar.

674
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:25,350
But he calls me your grace

675
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:26,590
instead of Mr. Jiang.

676
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:29,110
Then he's not a colleague of the imperial court.

677
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:29,970
Who could it be?

678
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:32,290
Where have I met him before?

679
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:39,270
Do you not recognize me?

680
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,370
A junior, maybe?

681
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,540
He's dressed as a scholar.

682
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:46,520
Is he the student of a minister?

683
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:51,030
You are indeed so busy

684
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:53,660
that you don't remember me anymore.

685
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:59,390
Greetings, I am Yan Nanxing from Blossom Beauty.

686
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:01,070
It's my first time seeing you.

687
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,800
How should I address you?

688
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,100
I'm Yan Biqing.

689
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:06,750
So you are Ms. Yan.

690
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:08,870
As soon as I returned to the capital,

691
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:09,820
your respectable name

692
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:11,080
was heard everywhere.

693
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:12,140
Seeing you today,

694
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:15,070
you're indeed as charming as they say.

695
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:16,790
You're too kind.

696
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:20,820
Mr. Yan, I see you have returned to the capital.

697
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:24,270
Your Grace, you still remember me?

698
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:25,340
I thought

699
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,260
you had completely forgotten me.

700
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:28,670
Of course not.

701
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,660
Back in the State of Miluo,

702
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:32,860
you took great care of my sister

703
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:33,700
Suoluo.

704
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:36,120
I heard that you are currently

705
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,980
working at the Imperial Academy.

706
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:38,910
Yes.

707
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:40,950
The semester just started at the Imperial Academy.

708
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:42,270
There are too many things to be done.

709
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:43,740
Today, under my father's order,

710
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:45,940
I'm here to pay respect to Her Highness.

711
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,660
How very polite of you.

712
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,200
I heard that you have some

713
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:56,030
disagreements with Her Grace.

714
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:59,040
Although I work at the Imperial Academy,

715
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,120
I wish to be friends with you.

716
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:02,830
I hope you won't

717
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:04,650
hold any grudges against me.

718
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:09,430
Next time,

719
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,720
I'll pay a visit to you.

720
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:42,270
Well...

721
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:45,130
I've reached my place.

722
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:53,470
If there's nothing else,

723
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:54,670
go back.

724
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:56,800
Yan Nanxing,

725
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:03,840
I have something to ask you.

726
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:18,260
Just now in front of Yan Biqing,

727
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:22,370
why didn't you take the chance to make things worse for me?

728
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:23,940
I'm not as bad as you think.

729
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:26,150
Although I can't cure you,

730
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:29,110
I don't want to see you suffer either.

731
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:35,200
You won't understand anyway.

732
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,870
Your life

733
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:39,310
is only filled with doubt and distrust.

734
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:43,800
Last time, you said

735
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:45,980
if I weren't honest with you,

736
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:48,280
I'd lose my chance to be protected.

737
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:50,380
Do I still have this chance?

738
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:53,290
You want me to protect you?

739
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:56,030
I hope

740
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:58,090
we can protect each other.

741
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,880
You just protected me.

742
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:01,950
Now,

743
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:03,500
it's my turn.

744
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:12,400
Tell me then.

745
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:14,750
How do you want to protect me?

746
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:17,830
As you said,

747
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:21,110
my lifestyle is to doubt people.

748
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:22,310
So,

749
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:25,830
let me witness

750
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:28,080
your shapeshifting process.

751
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:29,440
This way, I'll know

752
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:31,270
how to protect you.

753
00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:36,530
Seeing is believing.

754
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:40,870
But I mostly shapeshift

755
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,230
at night.

756
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:44,680
Sometimes, it happens in my sleep.

757
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:47,470
How will you witness it?

758
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:51,670
♫Sit with you at night and listen to the wind♫

759
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:55,100
♫When the wind flutters, the heart does too♫

760
00:40:55,770 --> 00:40:58,720
♫Step by step, no words are spoken♫

761
00:40:58,910 --> 00:41:02,690
♫Barged into sight♫

762
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:01,450
Then sleep with me.

763
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:06,160
♫When did your figure grow hazy?♫

764
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:09,810
♫And how clear is it?♫

765
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:10,320
Let me trust you for sure.

766
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,560
♫I don't intend to break your heart♫

767
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:15,790
♫Silently fall into my arms♫

768
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:19,350
♫The world is ever-changing♫

769
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:20,960
♫We still remember♫

770
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:22,110
♫To be the stars♫

771
00:41:22,130 --> 00:41:24,030
♫That light up each other's worlds♫

772
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:26,240
♫Don’t fear the night as dark as ink♫

773
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,120
♫Just take up your pen and sketch♫

774
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:31,440
♫You and I, recognizing each other with our hearts♫

775
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:33,680
♫Waiting for you in the blooming splendor♫

776
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:35,290
♫To pick the colors of spring for me♫

777
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:35,950
♫Waiting for the starry sky♫

778
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:38,390
♫To offer your dreams to me♫

779
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:41,200
♫I invite you♫

780
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:42,950
♫To hold a place in my heart♫

781
00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:45,200
♫Stay together forever♫
