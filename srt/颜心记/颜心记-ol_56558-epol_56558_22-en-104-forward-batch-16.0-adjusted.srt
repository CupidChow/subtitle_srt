4
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:40,630
Commander Shang,

5
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:41,700
you shouldn’t be like this.

6
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,620
Do you know how much

7
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,250
effort we put in

8
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:44,210
for your nose?

9
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:45,230
Sai'er, I...

10
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:45,870
Stop talking.

11
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:46,670
Let me finish.

12
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,120
I'm sure if Lady Gaya

13
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:48,750
and General Nan

14
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,510
see you like this,

15
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:50,790
they'd be very sad too.

16
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,550
We all want you to be well.

17
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,310
Why can't you

18
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,270
be brave?

19
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:00,550
Commander Shang.

20
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:02,190
Trust me.

21
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:03,370
You look really good

22
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:04,570
with a nose.

23
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:08,550
I won't lie to you.

24
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,220
All right.

25
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:35,990
To celebrate today,

26
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,520
I’ve decided to cook you

27
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:39,850
a new dish I just learned.

28
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:40,630
Wait for me.

29
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,579
Don't you think it smells great?

30
00:04:03,579 --> 00:04:04,630
Let me tell you,

31
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:05,960
it's also super crispy.

32
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:13,320
It's crispy. Try it.

33
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,020
Is it good?

34
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:23,410
It is, isn't it?

35
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,220
Then I'll leave this for you.

36
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,390
No one else has it.

37
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:48,330
Not bad, right?

38
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:53,550
Are you not used to it?

39
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:55,070
I'm not used to it either.

40
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:57,409
Regardless, this is a good thing.

41
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,290
Congratulations, Shang.

42
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:01,050
Thank you, Suoluo.

43
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:01,950
But,

44
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,670
it would be nice if it were

45
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:04,930
as pretty as your nose.

46
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:06,790
I'm curious.

47
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:09,190
Which miracle worker

48
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,470
managed to restore your nose

49
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,950
to what it was before?

50
00:05:14,909 --> 00:05:16,630
This miracle worker...

51
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:19,970
This...

52
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:21,990
Is it Yan Nanxing?

53
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:26,790
We are sort of like

54
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:28,910
friends now.

55
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,110
In just a few days,

56
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:33,190
you two became good friends?

57
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,590
What about Jiang Xinbai?

58
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:36,560
Jiang Xinbai...

59
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:39,670
Jiang Xinbai

60
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:41,670
and I are also kind of

61
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:42,950
on the same side now.

62
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:44,800
What?

63
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,140
When did you form an alliance?

64
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:50,159
Half a month ago,

65
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,110
His Majesty summoned me.

66
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,550
Jiang Xinbai saved me

67
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:54,480
and my brother.

68
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:56,030
His Majesty

69
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:58,550
ordered me to investigate the Zornia case with him.

70
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:59,480
Half a month ago?

71
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:02,550
He came to my house five days ago

72
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:04,050
and asked for Blossom Beauty's title deed.

73
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:06,030
Why didn't he mention anything about it?

74
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:06,470
Did you guys

75
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:07,350
decide on everything

76
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:08,880
before telling me about it?

77
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:11,070
I knew it. As long as Jiang Xinbai is involved,

78
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,870
I will be treated as an outsider.

79
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:13,950
Suoluo.

80
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:16,030
Suoluo...

81
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:20,750
In the end,

82
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,100
you and Jiang Xinbai are family.

83
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:25,060
I think he’s devoted to investigating the Zornia case

84
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:28,520
and has no intention of competing for the succession with you.

85
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:29,870
Do you mean to say that

86
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,270
he doesn't care about me?

87
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,410
That's not what I mean.

88
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,360
I just suddenly find

89
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,310
your conflict

90
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,350
meaningless.

91
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,070
What do you mean?

92
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:42,510
Am I just

93
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,380
a willful child

94
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:44,520
in your eyes?

95
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:48,070
That's not what I meant.

96
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:48,710
Shang,

97
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:50,310
are you still my ally?

98
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:54,090
As long as you're willing,

99
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:56,030
we'll always be confidants.

100
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,030
I see.

101
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,200
No matter what you do,

102
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,159
it won't hurt our friendship.

103
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:03,230
Suoluo.

104
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:04,909
Suoluo!

[Blossom Beauty]

106
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:19,190
Mrs. Bao.

107
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,040
Aren't you good at gathering information?

108
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,030
Ask her about it.

109
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:24,360
Is it true between her and the Duke?

110
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:26,350
I'm also good at curing all sickness

111
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:27,750
and keeping you content.

112
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:29,940
You are closest to Ms. Yan.

113
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:30,630
You're most suited

114
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:31,550
to ask her.

115
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:32,950
That's right, Mrs. Bao.

116
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:33,670
Go ask her

117
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:35,190
about her relationship with the Duke.

118
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:35,910
What's their relationship?

119
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:36,390
Ask her.

120
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,270
You can ask her yourself.

121
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:40,180
You're already filled to the brim with gossip.

122
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:40,820
Quit it.

123
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:42,390
Get up.

124
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:43,990
Fine, we'll stop.

125
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:49,990
Boss,

126
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:52,790
are they talking about you?

127
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,140
I feel that they are afraid of you.

128
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:59,480
Good news never spread,

129
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:00,720
gossips never stop.

130
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,690
I guess they heard that

131
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:03,790
I'm the ex-daughter-in-law

132
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:04,920
of the Jiang family,

133
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,260
so they are treating me differently.

134
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,870
They've heard about it already?

135
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:14,560
Of course they have.

136
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,310
Why are you here?

137
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:18,150
Don't you have school today?

138
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:19,870
Today, the ex-chancellor

139
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,390
is teaching at the Imperial Academy.

140
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:23,110
He has always had societal prejudice

141
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:24,910
and wouldn't let me attend class

142
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,800
because I'm from the slave class.

143
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,790
Just because he said so, you relented?

144
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:30,450
What did your chancellor say?

145
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:31,910
You're right.

146
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:34,450
I answer to my chancellor.

147
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:54,570
[Master for all ages]

148
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,350
You are now

149
00:08:49,909 --> 00:08:51,390
the chancellor.

150
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:53,230
I am

151
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:54,500
proud of you.

152
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:57,679
You taught me well, Sir.

153
00:08:57,909 --> 00:08:59,909
My achievements are thanks to you.

154
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:03,990
Everyone,

155
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,100
as the old saying goes,

156
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,650
the husband advocates

157
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,030
and the wife follows.

158
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,510
A woman

159
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:13,190
should obey her husband

160
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,480
and take care of her family.

161
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:19,050
But nowadays, improper trends in society

162
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,790
make women show themselves in public.

163
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,220
What do you call this?

164
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:26,440
Turning the world upside down!

165
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:28,840
In my opinion...

166
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:29,870
Mr. Cui.

167
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,860
I would like to ask a question.

168
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:49,950
Go ahead.

169
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:52,080
I don't understand.

170
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,380
Since His Majesty has appointed the worthy,

171
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,550
there is no distinction between classes

172
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:56,500
and gender.

173
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:58,690
So, how can you call it improper?

174
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:01,030
A woman is as knowledgeable as a man.

175
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,300
So why must she blindly obey her husband?

176
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:09,790
You have no right to speak.

177
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:10,350
Leave.

178
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:11,690
It doesn't matter.

179
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:17,350
Which family are you from, young man?

180
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:18,950
I'm Liu Ruoqian.

181
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:20,630
I was born into a slave family,

182
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:22,030
not an aristocratic family.

183
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:22,990
A slave family?

184
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,110
A slave family!

185
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,960
It has been barely

186
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:30,850
two years since I left.

187
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:33,530
When did the Imperial Academy

188
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:36,020
start recruiting from the slave class?

189
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:42,850
His Majesty is a wise emperor of Daqi.

190
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,050
I may be born a slave,

191
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:46,270
but after studying at the Imperial Academy,

192
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,830
I can be a teacher or an official

193
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:48,630
in the future.

194
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:51,120
It is all thanks to His Majesty.

195
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:51,960
Mr. Cui,

196
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:55,400
are you questioning His Majesty's decision?

197
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:07,070
Mr. Cui.

198
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:13,790
The disciples I taught

199
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,480
were familiar with the etiquette of the emperor-subject relationship

200
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,700
but didn’t learn the etiquette of the teacher-student relationship.

201
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,830
Please forgive him.

202
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:25,030
It's fine.

203
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:26,070
It's fine.

204
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,130
Do you admit your mistake?

205
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:47,710
I was just discussing knowledge

206
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:48,440
with Mr. Cui.

207
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,510
The chancellor didn't blame me for that.

208
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:54,040
Don't try to save yourself by mentioning her.

209
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:00,600
I told you to go away.

210
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:02,170
How dare you come back?

211
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:05,350
The Imperial Academy recruited a slave

212
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:07,270
like you to put up a display.

213
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:10,630
Do you really think

214
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,440
you can be a teacher

215
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,330
or official in the future?

216
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:17,480
Dream on!

217
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:22,110
Whether I stay or not

218
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,480
depends on the chancellor.

219
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:26,150
How dare you dodge?

220
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:27,930
Hold out your hand!

221
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:34,260
Stop!

222
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:42,080
Chancellor.

223
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,070
Dean Yan,

224
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:44,470
the ruler in your hand

225
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:46,290
is for upholding the rules of the academy.

226
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:48,150
How dare you disregard the rules?

227
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,160
Hand over the ruler.

228
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:58,870
I was too angry

229
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,030
and offended you.

230
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:09,310
Ruoqian,

231
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:10,750
I'm sorry.

232
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:13,840
Chancellor,

233
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:16,850
I'll accept my punishment

234
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:19,670
and copy the student handbook a hundred times.

235
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:21,690
I'll take my leave.

236
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:39,000
Thank you.

237
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:46,850
From today onwards, come to my class.

238
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:48,750
Thank you, Chancellor.

239
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:49,630
You

240
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:51,840
irritated Dean Yan on purpose, right?

241
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,190
You seem gentle and weak,

242
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:57,880
but you are quite scheming.

243
00:13:58,980 --> 00:13:59,830
Do I seem weak?

244
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:02,390
Chancellor, have you forgotten?

245
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:04,320
My family members are ironsmiths.

246
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:05,940
I really forgot.

247
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:09,550
You provoked

248
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:11,030
Mr. Cui today.

249
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:12,920
Weren't you afraid?

250
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:14,190
For you,

251
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:15,450
I'm not afraid.

252
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:17,830
Why?

253
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:20,350
Because I'm on your side.

254
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:23,830
You...

255
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:28,000
You're good at saying nice things.

256
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:38,550
It's my honor to be able to

257
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:40,570
listen in at your classes.

258
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:42,600
I won't let you down.

259
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:54,250
I'll take my leave.

260
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,410
[Assistant Minister of Revenue, Yan Jinglun]

261
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:21,900
Biqing,

262
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,170
your chess moves are messed up.

263
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:27,950
Why go that far

264
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:29,380
for a woman?

265
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:33,310
Father.

266
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:34,740
I...

267
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:37,520
Tomorrow night,

268
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:41,480
the Yuejiang's Residence is holding an appreciation banquet.

269
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,750
Wasn't Mr. Cui your mentor

270
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:43,680
for a few months?

271
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,440
You're considered his student, then.

272
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,700
You should attend it.

273
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:49,250
How about this?

274
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:52,040
I'll accompany you to the banquet.

275
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:54,550
Let's fix

276
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:57,150
the situation.

277
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,400
[Shang Residence]

278
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:30,930
Commander Shang!

279
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:31,730
Commander...

280
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:32,610
Ms. Sai'er.

281
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:33,270
It's late.

282
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:34,200
You're still up?

283
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:36,150
Well,

284
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:37,190
why hasn't Commander Shang

285
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:38,470
returned yet?

286
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:40,910
Commander Shang has something important to do today.

287
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,370
He may be coming back late.

288
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:57,870
You're an hour late.

289
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,450
You'll know soon

290
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:08,390
how worth it it was

291
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:10,370
for you to wait for an hour.

292
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:14,520
Li Wufang mentioned

293
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:16,550
an agent for the fake calligraphy and paintings.

294
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:17,210
I found him.

295
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:21,109
How?

296
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:23,750
I found a friend who knows calligraphy and painting

297
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,280
to examine the works for me.

298
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:26,800
We found that

299
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:28,349
those fake calligraphy and paintings

300
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:29,950
were made by the same person.

301
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,630
Then I found

302
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:33,710
the painter behind those fake works

303
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:36,200
and got his ledger.

304
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:39,230
Commander Shang's efficiency

305
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,430
is truly formidable.

306
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,950
Mr. Jiang is taking his time with recovery.

307
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:49,350
Someone has to do the work in the meanwhile.

308
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:52,690
The results of the work

309
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:53,750
have yet to be seen.

310
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:57,050
Fine. It's okay if you don't want to take a look.

311
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:58,590
You see?

312
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:00,330
He's jealous of me.

313
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:01,790
I can do

314
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:03,230
what he can't.

315
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:04,650
I'm jealous of you?

316
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,800
Why would I be jealous of you?

317
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:08,690
That your nose is fake?

318
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:13,710
It may be fake, but it is perfect.

319
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,480
Can you smell anything with it?

320
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:20,990
Of course he can.

321
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:22,070
I'm working on it.

322
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:23,220
He'll be able to smell things in the future.

323
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:23,800
No hurry.

324
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:25,640
Let's get down to business.

325
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:26,630
You're right.

326
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:27,910
You two...

327
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:29,750
Let's get down to business.

328
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:30,480
Give it to me.

329
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:35,710
Lu Bo'an.

330
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:38,910
He is Li Wufang's agent.

331
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:40,350
Lu Bo'an?

332
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,470
Lu Dingzhao's grandson.

333
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:43,470
That's right.

334
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:44,950
He is also

335
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,680
a student of the Imperial Academy.

336
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,790
One grandson sold fake paintings.

337
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,950
The other grandson secretly embezzled money.

338
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:56,740
Lu

339
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,200
is going all out.

340
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:06,630
Lu Dingzhao

341
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:09,480
never personally participates in Zornia trading.

342
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,230
If anything happens,

343
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,430
he can completely distance himself

344
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:13,630
from the situation.

345
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,000
In the end,

346
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,120
we still have no evidence.

347
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:25,310
You're holding the ledger in your hand.

348
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,830
What more do you need?

349
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:28,670
This can only prove that

350
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:30,130
our deduction is correct.

351
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:31,770
What else can it prove?

352
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,140
In my opinion,

353
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,310
we should arrest

354
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:37,970
Lu Dingzhao

355
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:38,870
and beat him up

356
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:40,790
until he fesses up to his crimes.

357
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:42,350
Kidnapping an imperial official

358
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:43,850
and torturing him without permission.

359
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,720
How many heads do you have for something as risky as that?

360
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,520
Find clues

361
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:47,620
and evidence.

362
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,180
How much time do you have for that?

363
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:50,840
Two months?

364
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:53,240
We don't have that luxury anymore.

365
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,070
Two months?

366
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:55,630
What two months?

367
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,760
If we can't make Lu budge,

368
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,560
we'll start with his grandsons.

369
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:03,380
I'll find a way

370
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:05,440
to arrest Lu Bo'an.

371
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:07,830
Lu Bo'an is a student of the Imperial Academy.

372
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:09,070
He did nothing.

373
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,130
What right do you have to arrest him at the Imperial Academy?

374
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:13,190
Do you have an idea?

375
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:14,270
Tell me.

376
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:19,320
You have no idea either.

377
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:24,550
Mr. Jiang.

378
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,270
Is anything happening

379
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:28,800
in the court lately?

380
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:31,970
Especially regarding the Ministry of Personnel.

381
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:37,860
The officials assigned by the Ministry of Personnel

382
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:40,120
were all sent to the northwest recently.

383
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:42,740
It's such an important news.

384
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,600
Why didn't you mention it before?

385
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:48,440
There is a general outside the Pass

386
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,570
called Yi Yuanshan.

387
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,390
He contributed to eliminating the bandits.

388
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:52,650
Originally, Li Jun recommended him

389
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:53,570
to Heman

390
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:54,710
to replace you.

391
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:57,670
But after the dispatch notice was sent,

392
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:58,790
Yi Yuanshan

393
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,660
took office in Tingzhou instead.

394
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,910
So for them,

395
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:04,230
Tingzhou

396
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:05,950
is more important than Heman.

397
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:06,810
It's possible.

398
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:09,880
But we know nothing

399
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:10,840
about Tingzhou.

400
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:14,830
Mr. Jiang,

401
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:17,960
it's inconvenient for you and Bieli to leave the capital.

402
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,510
Why don't I go to Tingzhou

403
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:20,790
and find out

404
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,070
what they are up to?

405
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:24,520
It's a good idea.

406
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:25,710
Brother,

407
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:27,950
it's not safe for you to go alone.

408
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:29,750
I'll send some Jinwu Guards

409
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:30,750
to accompany you.

410
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:33,510
The Jinwu Guards take attendance regularly.

411
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:34,790
Once they find a member missing,

412
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:36,590
it'll be hard for you to explain.

413
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:38,030
Why don't you let Yao Qianshu

414
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,150
go with you?

415
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:41,570
You can take care of each other on the way.

416
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:44,960
There's no time to lose.

417
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,690
General Nan,

418
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:48,630
leave with Yao Qianshu as soon as possible.

419
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:50,070
As for Lu Bo'an,

420
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:53,750
I'll talk to Suoluo

421
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,340
and see what I can find

422
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:57,070
before we make the next plan.

423
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:10,710
Tonight,

424
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:13,210
the Yuejiang's Residence is holding an appreciation banquet.

425
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:14,610
Suoluo will be there too.

426
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:16,250
I'll make a trip back home.

427
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:20,020
Wait for me here.

428
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:22,850
I have something to tell you when I come back.

429
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:23,590
Okay.

430
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:25,710
See you.

431
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:35,950
Dr. Yan.

432
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:38,000
I have some progress regarding the person

433
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,130
you asked me to find.

434
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:40,250
How is it going?

435
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:41,590
I'll tell you about it

436
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:43,250
when I make more progress.

437
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:54,820
[Yuejiang's Residence]

438
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,470
Greetings, Your Grace.

439
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:00,690
Thank you, Your Grace.

440
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,370
I can't drink much.

441
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:05,150
I can't drink anymore.

442
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:07,950
Tonight is the appreciation banquet.

443
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:10,410
How can you not drink the appreciation wine?

444
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:11,790
Thank you.

445
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:17,670
Mr. Cui, please.

446
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:20,150
Thank you.

447
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:28,770
Your Highness.

448
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:30,090
I...

449
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:35,690
Are you drunk already?

450
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:38,160
You haven't eaten much yet.

451
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,160
The wife must follow the husband?

452
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,930
How dare you bully my daughter?

453
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:46,950
I'll show him.

454
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:59,400
Congratulations, Your Highness.

455
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,720
The Duke and Duchess are both trusted and valued

456
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,750
individuals of Daqi.

457
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:04,850
His Majesty thinks highly of you.

458
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:08,200
The Yan family is so fortunate

459
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:10,310
-to be in-laws with...
-Father.

460
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:11,430
You're drunk.

461
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:13,190
I'm drunk?

462
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:15,530
Am I drunk?

463
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:17,190
Didn't you say

464
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:19,230
you are preparing the

465
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:22,070
betrothal gift for Her Grace?

466
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:24,840
Mr. Yan,

467
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:27,260
you are really drunk.

468
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:29,710
What nonsense are you talking about?

469
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:35,230
At this point,

470
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,100
hiding it any further

471
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,450
would be an act of disrespect

472
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:39,510
to the elders here.

473
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:41,090
Your Highness.

474
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:43,360
Three years ago,

475
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:46,270
Suoluo came to the State of Miluo to study.

476
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:48,190
We fell in love with each other,

477
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:50,550
so we got engaged there.

478
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:51,470
Nice!

479
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:54,110
What?

480
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:58,190
Is that true?

481
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:01,670
You...

482
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,580
Why didn't you tell me

483
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,310
such big news?

484
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:10,490
Your Highness.

485
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:12,220
It's not Suoluo's fault.

486
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:14,190
It's because I just came back

487
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:17,110
and haven't established a foothold in the court.

488
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:18,640
So we discussed and decided

489
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:21,000
to keep this secret for now.

490
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,350
How considerate of you, Mr. Yan.

491
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,500
Yan.

492
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:36,850
Your Highness.

493
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:39,320
For now, only our two families

494
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:40,680
know about this matter.

495
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,190
Please don't speak of this

496
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:43,390
to the outsiders.

497
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:44,230
Because

498
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:47,030
getting engaged without the parents' knowledge

499
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:48,910
is not quite a glorious matter.

500
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,550
Your Highness is right.

501
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,560
Since it's a happy event,

502
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:55,830
let's have a toast!

503
00:25:59,150 --> 00:25:59,870
Biqing!

504
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:07,370
Thank you, Your Grace and Your Highness.

505
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:39,310
Mr. Yan.

506
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:42,030
Xinbai?

507
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:44,030
Didn't you say you had work tonight

508
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:44,870
and couldn't come back?

509
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:45,630
I'm here

510
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:47,630
to ask Suoluo about something.

511
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:48,150
Xinbai,

512
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:49,690
I'm afraid tonight

513
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:51,030
is a bad time.

514
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:53,640
Something bad happened to Suoluo.

515
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:03,110
Say it!

516
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:07,130
Mother, I know I was wrong.

517
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:08,750
You're wrong?

518
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:10,670
You're only quick to admit it!

519
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,150
-Do you know...
-I know.

520
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:13,740
I shouldn't have been engaged

521
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:14,940
without permission.

522
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:17,750
I shouldn't have hidden it from you either.

523
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:19,590
It's not about hiding the matter or not.

524
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:20,190
Do you know...

525
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:21,710
I know I'm immature.

526
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:24,320
I didn't get along with Xinbai,

527
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:25,430
so I

528
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:26,710
went to the State of Miluo

529
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:27,640
alone back then.

530
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:30,070
I studied alone in a foreign state

531
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:31,530
and had no help or support.

532
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:34,110
Yan Biqing

533
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:36,520
took great care of me back then.

534
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:38,270
He also promised me the support

535
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:40,870
of the capital and the noble families when I returned.

536
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:41,260
I...

537
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,100
I made a mistake.

538
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:47,870
It's not just a

539
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:49,190
simple mistake!

540
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:51,440
It's called being foolish!

541
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,770
I know I was wrong.

542
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:54,870
You know?

543
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,370
What do you know?

544
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:58,720
The Yans are nothing.

545
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:01,390
He doesn’t deserve you!

546
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:05,990
The Yans are not

547
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:06,990
a wealthy family,

548
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,110
But because of that,

549
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:13,410
our engagement

550
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:15,920
will reassure His Majesty.

551
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:19,890
Aren't you thinking ahead of yourself?

552
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,850
His Majesty might be satisfied.

553
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:23,360
But am I, your mother, satisfied?

554
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,350
You can marry anyone

555
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:25,750
except for that vile man!

556
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:28,850
You think Yan Biqing is a vile man?

557
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,830
It's written all over his face!

558
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:31,830
His father

559
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,960
buttered up to authority and went from

560
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,810
a low-ranking official in the Ministry of Justice

561
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:36,940
to where he is today.

562
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,940
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

563
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:39,700
That brat

564
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:40,750
only stayed in the

565
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:42,080
deserted State of Miluo

566
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:44,690
for a decade or two

567
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:46,670
and dared to brag about how well-read

568
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:47,510
and knowledgeable he was.

569
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:48,390
Shameless!

570
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:49,320
Shameless!

571
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,120
Mother, don't be angry.

572
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,520
It's bad for your health.

573
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:54,400
How can I not be angry?

574
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:56,510
Xinbai

575
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:59,590
got married secretly in Heman.

576
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:00,470
And you...

577
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:03,230
got engaged secretly in Miluo.

578
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,310
Who exactly do you two

579
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:06,310
take after?

580
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:11,230
Since Xinbai

581
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:12,510
can get married in Heman

582
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:14,040
before divorcing his wife,

583
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:15,750
at worse,

584
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,260
I'll divorce Yan Biqing after our marriage

585
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,470
and remarry.

586
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:19,400
Nonsense!

587
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:23,090
Marriage is a major milestone in life.

588
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:25,300
You're already thinking about divorce before marriage?

589
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:27,040
Isn't that a joke?

590
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:29,670
You are the princess's daughter! My daughter!

591
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:43,710
Suoluo.

592
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:44,990
Tell me.

593
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,010
Do you really like

594
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,070
Yan Biqing?

595
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:56,270
That's great.

596
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:59,660
Remember.

597
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:03,640
A good marriage is hard to come by.

598
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:05,200
You must

599
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:07,030
choose a man

600
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:08,670
you genuinely love.

601
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:12,370
If you don't want to marry,

602
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:14,020
no one can force you.

603
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:18,270
Mother.

604
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:25,310
No one can force you

605
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:27,310
to marry anyone.

606
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:29,830
You must treasure yourself.

607
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:31,880
Don't make me worry.

608
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:34,910
Don't let me down again.

609
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:51,310
Suoluo?

610
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:57,230
Suoluo.

611
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:00,630
You didn't have time to attend the banquet,

612
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:01,670
but you have time

613
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:03,200
to rush here and lecture me?

614
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,720
I've been lectured enough

615
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,470
today.

616
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,240
I don't want to hear it anymore.

617
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:08,830
Suoluo.

618
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,410
I've heard about it.

619
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:16,470
If you are doing this

620
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,030
just to spite me,

621
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:19,600
there is no need.

622
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:21,930
I hope you understand.

623
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:24,040
Don't do anything

624
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:25,470
you'd regret.

625
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:27,400
I never regret what I do.

626
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:29,720
Neither do I need anyone's advice.

627
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,470
If there's

628
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:32,290
nothing else,

629
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:34,170
I'll take my leave.

630
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,590
Suoluo!

631
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:49,240
How did it go?

632
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:50,880
How was your talk with Suoluo?

633
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,110
She has her own matters to worry about.

634
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,640
Let's think of another way.

635
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:58,440
You told me to wait for you.

636
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:01,010
What were you going to tell me?

637
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:05,790
The moon is full tonight.

638
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:08,990
Yes, what about it?

639
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:14,310
Come home with me.

640
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:16,310
We'll sleep together.

641
00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:21,870
Have you forgotten

642
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,150
our promise?

643
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:25,560
I'll watch you shapeshift.

644
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:37,230
You once said

645
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:39,390
you didn't know

646
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:41,190
what you would shapeshift into.

647
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:42,750
You didn't know

648
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:45,630
what kind of danger you would be facing.

649
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:47,330
I want to be with you

650
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:50,210
so that you won't be lonely

651
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:51,970
or afraid anymore.

652
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:05,990
Well?

653
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:08,650
Are you going back with me?

654
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,460
This is what you meant

655
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:35,850
by sleeping together?

656
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:38,390
What else?

657
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:44,170
Then...

658
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:47,250
You're just gonna sit there and watch me?

659
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:48,750
Yes.

660
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:53,170
Go to sleep.

661
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,760
Are you really going to

662
00:33:57,930 --> 00:33:59,390
sit and watch me all night?

663
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:04,870
But I don't think it's appropriate.

664
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:06,530
I can't bear to let you do that.

665
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:07,760
This is your bed.

666
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,640
But I'm lying here and you're sitting there.

667
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:10,970
That's inappropriate.

668
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:12,170
How about this?

669
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,390
We'll each take

670
00:34:13,390 --> 00:34:14,250
half of the bed.

671
00:34:14,410 --> 00:34:15,670
We'll sleep together.

672
00:34:37,989 --> 00:34:38,790
This can't do.

673
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:41,330
I have to keep an eye on you.

674
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:41,950
Zhiyi.

675
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:46,050
You didn't sleep well again, did you?

676
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,490
Have some ginseng soup.

677
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:48,510
Here.

678
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,390
My two kids

679
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:55,230
are taking turns to worry me.

680
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:00,200
How can I be fine?

681
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:06,070
Honey.

682
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:08,270
I asked you

683
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:09,620
to keep an eye on Xinbai.

684
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:10,470
Is he

685
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:11,730
up to anything lately?

686
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:13,510
Don't cry.

687
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:16,310
Xinbai

688
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:18,470
has grown up.

689
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:23,280
Is Yan Nanxing staying at his place again?

690
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:24,870
Is she?

691
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:29,850
Yan Nanxing...

692
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,330
You didn't shapeshift.

693
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:40,150
If not today,

694
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:41,670
it'll happen tomorrow.

695
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:44,940
It's either before or after the full moon anyway.

696
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:47,590
Really?

697
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:49,230
Yes.

698
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:54,070
Well...

699
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:56,270
Since I haven't shapeshifted,

700
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:59,400
I'm going back to Blossom Beauty first.

701
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,600
I'll be back tonight.

702
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:02,390
Again?

703
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:04,070
Yes.

704
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:19,030
Yan Nanxing!

705
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:22,750
What's wrong?

706
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:24,190
Your mother!

707
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,040
My mother?

708
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:25,670
Hurry up.

709
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:26,510
Come on.

710
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:29,350
Why is my mother here?

711
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:30,300
How would I know?

712
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,480
Hurry up.

713
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:33,440
Where do I go?

714
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:34,230
Hurry.

715
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:35,340
Coming, Mother!

716
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:39,590
Close the door for me.

717
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:40,710
Coming, Mother!

718
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,800
Where is Yan Nanxing?

719
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:47,190
Where is Yan Nanxing?

720
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:47,630
She...

721
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:49,110
I saw her open the door.

722
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:50,070
Where is she?

723
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:51,390
No, she...

724
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,350
Calm down.

725
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:56,670
Were you sleeping together?

726
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:01,210
I agreed to let you run Blossom Beauty together,

727
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:03,070
but I didn't say you could sleep together!

728
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:05,150
We did sleep together,

729
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:06,700
but it's not what you think!

730
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:08,410
How else do you want to sleep?

731
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:09,960
Why couldn't you control yourself?

732
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,290
What do you mean by that?

733
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:12,350
It's not like that!

734
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:18,990
Mother.

735
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:20,310
Mother!

736
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:21,190
Yan Nanxing!

737
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:24,210
Mother...

738
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:36,200
I can explain...

739
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:43,310
You...

740
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,270
He... He!

741
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:48,860
You!

742
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:49,600
You are...

743
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,710
I'm not.

744
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:51,930
He's not...

745
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:53,350
I am.

746
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:55,030
He is...

747
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:56,630
He's not...

748
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:57,390
You...

749
00:39:59,150 --> 00:39:59,630
Mother.

750
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:00,710
It's not like that.

751
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,050
He...

752
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:03,590
He...
