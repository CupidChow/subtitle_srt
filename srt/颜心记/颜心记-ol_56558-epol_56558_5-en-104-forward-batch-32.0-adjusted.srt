4
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:00,650
Madam.

5
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:03,390
What are you doing?

6
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,070
My tribe

7
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,930
is known for its snake legends.

8
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:10,030
So it's not wrong for people

9
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:11,880
to call me a snake demon.

10
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:15,350
So I prayed.

11
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:17,670
I prayed sincerely to God.

12
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:19,910
No matter what it takes,

13
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,420
I want to be with him forever.

14
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:25,070
I've cut ties with my family

15
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,230
and swore that I would never mention the tribe.

16
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,590
But I didn't expect

17
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,870
the price I had to pay

18
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:35,150
to be his life.

19
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,370
It was just an accident.

20
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:37,990
No.

21
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:39,940
I forced God to give me

22
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,430
something that didn't belong to me.

23
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,550
My husband is being punished for that.

24
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:44,070
Madam.

25
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,490
General loves you.

26
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:46,710
He has a strong will to survive.

27
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,070
He will wake up for sure.

28
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:49,829
Madam!

29
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,470
The general is awake.

30
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:52,790
Really?

31
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:54,940
I told you.

32
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:55,670
Go.

33
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:57,430
Thank you.

34
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:59,170
No need to thank me.

35
00:03:59,190 --> 00:03:59,870
Go see him.

36
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:01,350
Go.

37
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:23,470
They bribed me with these.

38
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:25,650
I didn't touch them at all.

39
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:31,780
The Zornia crisis

40
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,400
is rising in several

41
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,760
prefectures recently.

42
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:36,550
The root of the cause

43
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,120
is in Heman.

44
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:39,990
I once thought

45
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:42,290
you colluded with them

46
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,750
and helped them

47
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:45,470
import the Zornia.

48
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:48,100
I came to Heman this time

49
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,980
to find evidence

50
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:51,870
and arrest you.

51
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:56,510
But that day,

52
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:59,470
you almost died.

53
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:01,920
It didn't seem like a trick.

54
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:04,110
That was when I suspected

55
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:06,510
there might be more to it.

56
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:14,080
When did you find out

57
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,140
about my identity?

58
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:18,110
I once had the fate of

59
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,310
meeting a great detective,

60
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:22,390
Xi Zhaoming.

61
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:25,520
You called yourself Xi

62
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:27,570
and you came from Yazhou.

63
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:30,390
Let me ask you.

64
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,090
Who do you think

65
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:35,630
attacked me previously?

66
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:37,090
Tumen,

67
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,060
Gongye,

68
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:39,260
and Moqi.

69
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:45,120
I underestimated them.

70
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:49,410
Maybe they already had

71
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,150
their eyes on me when I was

72
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,370
surveying the city a few days ago.

73
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:54,660
But I didn't expect them

74
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,220
to bribe my lieutenant.

75
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,920
They did to me

76
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:00,550
what I did to them.

77
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:02,460
I was careless.

78
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,900
What do you mean?

79
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,510
I once sent five of my trusted

80
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,440
subordinates to their territories

81
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,570
as my eyes and ears.

82
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,310
But they came back to me

83
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,550
as five cold bodies.

84
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,470
No wonder when Dr. Yan

85
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:20,740
wanted to treat you

86
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,750
with the Zornia,

87
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,440
you strongly refused.

88
00:06:23,909 --> 00:06:26,070
They wanted to poison and

89
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:28,240
control me with the Zornia.

90
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,870
If my wife hadn't saved me,

91
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:33,950
I would have been ruined.

92
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:37,360
Why didn't you take the initiative to attack?

93
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:39,480
Were you scared?

94
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,070
No.

95
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:44,150
After I recovered,

96
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:45,940
I pretended

97
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:48,400
to be drunk and turned away guests.

98
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:49,980
Only this way

99
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:51,870
could I

100
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:53,530
investigate the clues

101
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:55,430
and collect evidence in peace.

102
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:56,240
Ridiculous!

103
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,130
If what you said is true

104
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,820
and the three big families call the shots here,

105
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,150
where were you planning

106
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:03,630
to submit your evidence?

107
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:06,120
If I hadnâ€™t come to Heman,

108
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,670
how would the capital have known about this?

109
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:09,590
Nan Jifeng.

110
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:11,510
You've been a general for years.

111
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:12,870
You should be brave.

112
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:15,310
But now you allow the Zornia crisis to spread.

113
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,110
Do you know why

114
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,510
you've become like this?

115
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,590
First,

116
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,900
you have attachments.

117
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:22,740
You're worried that

118
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,150
your wife will be killed.

119
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,270
Second,

120
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,470
you were once harmed by the Zornia.

121
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:30,210
Although you've recovered now,

122
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:31,740
they have something on you.

123
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:33,430
Once that is exposed,

124
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:35,390
your reputation

125
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,180
will be gone.

126
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:40,670
In the end,

127
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:43,130
you only care about your reputation.

128
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,550
I deserve

129
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:55,710
it.

130
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,190
Get up.

131
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:03,990
Let me ask you.

132
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:07,340
Have you seen the master of the Moqi family in person?

133
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,010
Yes

134
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:09,950
and no.

135
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,530
What do you mean?

136
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:14,350
I once met

137
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:15,950
Gongye

138
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:17,920
and Tumen alone.

139
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:19,909
But Moqi didn't come.

140
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:21,230
When they showed me

141
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:22,430
the five bodies,

142
00:08:22,909 --> 00:08:23,990
Moqi was there.

143
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,880
But he was sitting

144
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:27,050
behind the curtain

145
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:28,970
and didn't say a thing.

146
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:30,360
That means

147
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:34,790
Moqi is the master of the three major families.

148
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:45,030
Nan Jifeng.

149
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:49,430
Even if I believe

150
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,940
you are not their accomplice,

151
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:53,770
when you go to His Majesty,

152
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:56,160
you won't be able to explain yourself.

153
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:00,150
I hope you can

154
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,950
leave Heman as soon as possible.

155
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,360
If you can take my wife

156
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:04,230
with you,

157
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:06,909
I will do my best to...

158
00:09:06,909 --> 00:09:07,419
No.

159
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:11,450
The only way for you

160
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:13,309
to turn the tide now

161
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:15,730
is to make a strong statement.

162
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:19,180
Nan Jifeng.

163
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:22,490
You must show the people of Heman that

164
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,630
you are the God of War sent by His Majesty

165
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,710
to protect this land.

166
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:28,030
You...

167
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,310
are fearless.

168
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,830
Those who make a profit from Zornia

169
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:37,140
will receive caning and be sentenced to physical labor

170
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,740
according to the law of Daqi.

171
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,880
If you know but don't report it,

172
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,510
according to the Law of Daqi,

173
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:43,990
you will be sentenced to ten days of labor

174
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:45,790
and a fine of 300 taels of silver.

175
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:49,470
Let go of me!

176
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,390
Bravo! Bravo!

177
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:55,460

The shrimp is very good.

I think Dr. Yan

188

would like the meatballs.

want to eat these pork slices.

Don't go.

217
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:07,750

218
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:09,350
two friends to Mr. Xi.

219

They're so welcoming.

I have no reason to refuse.

223

Carry this knife with you.

For self-defense.

225

I'm afraid this visit

226

is not that simple.

227
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:41,990
Sounds like you'd be in more danger.

228
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:42,830
Keep it.

229
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,150

you won't be able to fend off danger.

234
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:52,890
If you keep it with you,

235
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,220

238

I think it's better

239
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:06,830

Keep Yan Nanxing safe too.

I'm not afraid of a confrontation.

248
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:23,110
But I'm afraid it might be a trick to lure us away.

look so grand?

Mr. Xi, right?

296
00:17:46,349 --> 00:17:48,280
You must be the county lieutenant,

the county magistrate, Tumen.

00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:55,930
Mr. Xi, you have a good eye.

301
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:58,380
I'm a little older than Tumen.

302
00:17:58,589 --> 00:17:59,490
Whenever we meet someone new,

303
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:01,560
most people would mistake me for the county magistrate.

304
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,540
I do business in Yazhou

305
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:06,430
and often come into contact with officials.

306
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:07,990
As such, I learned a trick or two

307
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:10,050
about observing and reading people.

308
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:11,230
It's nothing much.

309
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,110
Mr. Xi, you spoke your judgment

310
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:16,990
without hesitation.

311
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,900
Your thoughts and certainty

312
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,060
are different from ordinary people.

313
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:23,320
If I weren't brave enough,

314
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:24,970
I would not have come all the way

315
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,470
to do business in Heman.

316
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:28,040
Don't you agree?

317
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:40,510
She said she would

318
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:42,240
never mention the tribe again.

319
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:44,450
But isn't she always mentioning it?

320
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:49,300
Is it over?

321
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:52,650
Madam.

322
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:55,360
What did you do today?

323
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,690
This is a toxic oath.

324
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:00,400
A toxic oath?

325
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:03,510
I've vowed to live and die with my husband.

326
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:05,970
So I set up the altar to make the oath tonight.

327
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:17,960
Mr. Xi, so you're

328
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,950
General Nan's distant cousin.

329
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:23,390
You're here to do tea business?

330
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:25,230
Yes.

331
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:27,670
Yazhou is a place for the demoted.

332
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:29,590
Those old ex-officials

333
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:32,270
can't get used to a downgrade in lifestyle.

334
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:33,510
Good wine and tea

335
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:34,970
are essential to them.

336
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:37,180
All the flower tea businesses in the county

337
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,780
are under the Gongye family.

338
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:40,720
I'll let you in on the business.

339
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:45,210
Then I'll drink tea instead of wine

340
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:46,890
to thank you, Lord Gongye.

341
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:53,100
On the 13th of last month,

342
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:56,150
two people died accidentally in the city.

343
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,550
It seems to have implicated you.

344
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:00,830
What happened?

345
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:02,780
About that...

346
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:07,130
That was my first day in Heman.

347
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:08,470
I met two people

348
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,100
who claimed to be tea merchants.

349
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,710
They said they wanted to show me some tea leaves.

350
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:13,550
In the end,

351
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:15,950
they showed me Zornia.

352
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,370
There was a miscommunication between us

353
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:22,470
which resulted in a misunderstanding.

354
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:23,110
Later,

355
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:24,500
those two

356
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,230
mysteriously died.

357
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:27,750
It made me

358
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,070
really helpless.

359
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:34,510
I see.

360
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:35,510
Yes.

361
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:37,240
I was scared,

362
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,880
so I left the city to hide for a few days.

363
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,360
But I didn't know the way

364
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:43,930
and accidentally entered a village.

365
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,910
Somehow, I ended up

366
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:48,750
burning their field.

367
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:50,910
After that, I found out

368
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:53,030
that it was a Zornia field.

369
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:56,770
Don't you think

370
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:58,190
it's funny?

371
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:12,390
Is it that funny?

372
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:29,910
Dr. Yan,

373
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:31,550
what are you doing?

374
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,860
I'm setting up a trap.

375
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:35,070
Madam.

376
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:36,760
Don't touch this powder.

377
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,690
It's poisonous.

378
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:38,910
Do you know what is

379
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:40,040
happening tonight?

380
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:43,230
I know.

381
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:45,800
They want to take us hostage

382
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:46,870
and use us to threaten Mr. Xi

383
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:47,800
and General Nan.

384
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:49,400
Madam, don't worry.

385
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:50,910
I won't let them succeed.

386
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:15,630
What a beautiful night

387
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,020
for murder.

388
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:53,040
Dr. Yan.

389
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:53,870
Whatâ€™s going on outside?

390
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:54,670
Don't be afraid, Madam.

391
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:55,470
It'll be fine.

392
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,710
Everything will be fine.

393
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:57,390
I'll stay here.

394
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:58,230
You go in first.

395
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:58,830
Go.

396
00:22:59,110 --> 00:22:59,710
Go.

397
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:13,630
Jiang Xinbai.

398
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,000
You must come back safely.

399
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,210
Why did the music stop?

400
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:32,710
Keep playing.

401
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:33,780
Continue.

402
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:35,710
Dance.

403
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:41,490
Why are you serving tea for General Nan?

404
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:42,650
Where's the wine?

405
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:45,550
To be honest,

406
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:49,240
an assassin attacked me a few days ago.

407
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,990
I almost died.

408
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:54,440
Luckily, my cousin risked his life

409
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,950
to save me.

410
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:58,660
The wound has recovered recently.

411
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:00,350
I can't drink these days.

412
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:03,610
That happened?

413
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,300
Haven't you

414
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:06,830
heard about it?

415
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:09,950
I did not know.

416
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:12,390
Did you catch the assassin?

417
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:14,850
He committed suicide to escape punishment.

418
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,800
Did you

419
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,550
offend someone?

420
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:21,190
Do you remember?

421
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:23,310
One year ago,

422
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:24,670
I sent

423
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:27,800
five trusted subordinates

424
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:29,830
into the heart of danger.

425
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:32,750
They were all brutally killed.

426
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:34,590
It was thanks to you two

427
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:36,710
that my men's bodies were recovered.

428
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:38,920
This year,

429
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:41,170
I dreamed of them every night.

430
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:44,510
They asked me to avenge them.

431
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:11,790
The Zornia crisis is severe in Heman.

432
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:13,240
Who is the biggest force driving it?

433
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,040
Who is the mastermind behind it?

434
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:15,830
My lords,

435
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:17,630
don't you

436
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:19,030
want to know the truth?

437
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,180
General Nan.

438
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:24,190
You're drunk before you drink.

439
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:27,270
Today's party is for us old friends to meet.

440
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:29,070
The people of the past are gone.

441
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:31,230
General, please look ahead

442
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:34,360
and cherish the people around you.

443
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:37,670
Cousin.

444
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:42,320
Don't make things difficult for them.

445
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:45,150
Actually,

446
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:48,310
Lord Gongye and Lord Tumen

447
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:50,830
are also at their superior's disposal.

448
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:51,920
There are many things

449
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,520
they have no power to decide.

450
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,980
If we have important questions,

451
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:57,910
why don't we ask the real master?

452
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:01,870
Right?

453
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:04,990
Mr. Moqi?

454
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,270
Or should I call you

455
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,020
Ms. Moqi?

456
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,430
[Moqi]

457
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,400
You were very careful.

458
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:58,160
But you forgot to disguise your hands.

459
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:00,070
It's an important occasion,

460
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:01,390
but a woman managed to disguise

461
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:03,470
herself as a male musician and mix into the venue.

462
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:04,640
Apart from Ms. Moqi,

463
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:06,750
I can't think of anyone else.

464
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:09,790
Plus, my cousin once said

465
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:12,790
he had never seen the master of the Moqi family in person.

466
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:13,670
I wondered

467
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:15,650
if that was because

468
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:17,550
the master of the Moqi family

469
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:19,000
was a lady.

470
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:23,670
Mr. Xi.

471
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,230
You have sharp eyes.

472
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,630
It's been a few days.

473
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:30,910
You look better than before.

474
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:31,920
Who is she?

475
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:33,910
When did she see me?

476
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:39,800
You know each other?

477
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:41,420
Not only does Mr. Xi

478
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:43,320
know Ms. Moqi,

479
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:45,070
they go way back.

480
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:52,190
What's wrong, Mr. Xi?

481
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,750
Don't you recognize me?

482
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,370
Who was she?

483
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:03,430
So you're the

484
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:05,660
female doctor giving free treatment.

485
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:08,070
It's her.

486
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:11,710
Mr. Xi, I've checked.

487
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:13,240
There's no ambush outside.

488
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:21,630
Whose side are you on?

489
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:25,270
Right back at you.

490
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:26,540
Nan Jifeng.

491
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,070
Aren't all the water transport in Heman

492
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:29,200
under your control?

493
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:31,830
Why was the pleasure boat I rented

494
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:33,690
under the Moqi family's control?

495
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:36,230
Whose side are you on?

496
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:38,470
What do you mean?

497
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:43,950
Are you pretending or are you actually stupid?

498
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:45,160
Ms. Moqi

499
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:47,070
owns the pleasure boat I rented.

500
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:49,420
I think

501
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:51,800
all the pleasure boat businesses in Heman

502
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:53,510
should be under her name.

503
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,310
Just now,

504
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:00,410
you were silent for so long

505
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:02,030
because you were thinking about that?

506
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:02,750
What else?

507
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:06,230
So,

508
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,720
since my first day

509
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:09,510
in Heman,

510
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:10,880
Ms. Moqi

511
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:12,600
has had her eyes on me.

512
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:16,470
You're exaggerating.

513
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:19,140
A new guest is here in Heman.

514
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:22,020
As the host, I must do my part.

515
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,110
I just didn't expect

516
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:24,670
you to be so rude.

517
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,510
You killed two of my men

518
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:28,430
at the first sign of conflict

519
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:30,180
and burned my fields.

520
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:33,190
Sorry about that.

521
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,900
The ignorant is innocent.

522
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:38,390
From today onwards, as long as

523
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:40,270
General Nan

524
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:41,830
and Mr. Xi

525
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,110
are on the same side as us,

526
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:46,590
everything shall be forgotten.

527
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:54,430
Judging from the current situation,

528
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:55,510
it's hard

529
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:57,800
for us to choose otherwise.

530
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:00,510
Mr. Xi, you're a smart man.

531
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:02,640
Smart people should be sincere

532
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:04,710
when making friends.

533
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:08,310
I sent someone to watch your pleasure boat.

534
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:09,830
They said

535
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:11,230
your attendant

536
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,790
called you 'my lord'.

537
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:17,030
My lord.

538
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,790
What kind of lord are you?

539
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:26,630
If you don't reveal your identity,

540
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:29,520
things might look bad for you.

541
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,990
Those young people from Lanna Village

542
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:45,700
who were forced away by you.

543
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:47,630
Those poor children who died

544
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:50,970
and the elderly who have no one to rely on.

545
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:53,510
Do you dare to reveal your identity to them?

546
00:30:57,910 --> 00:31:00,110
A bunch of low-life profiteers like you

547
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:02,130
have no right to ask me.

548
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:04,100
Since we're not friends,

549
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:05,590
today,

550
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:06,990
you'll die here!

551
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:38,150
My lords,

552
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,070
do you think

553
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:41,850
you can leave Heman?

554
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,500
We don't have to leave.

555
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:45,490
We just need to arrest you.

556
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:04,660
How dare you try to

557
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:06,870
assassinate an imperial official?

558
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:07,720
You...

559
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:09,790
You set me up!

560
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,760
Didn't you do the same before?

561
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,100
The Moqi family profited off Zornia.

562
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:29,230
I'll investigate according to the law.

563
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:31,830
In order to protect herself,

564
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:34,430
Moqi confessed that the Heman county magistrate,

565
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:35,430
Tumen family, and

566
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,950
the county lieutenant, Gongye family,

567
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,470
received bribes

568
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:42,150
and had been secretly supporting the Moqi family.

569
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:43,630
Tumen and Gongye

570
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,400
refused to plead guilty.

571
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:47,730
Furious, Moqi personally

572
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:49,590
killed Tumen.

573
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:52,150
Under the order of the Emperor,

574
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:54,160
I've detained Moqi and Gongye.

575
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,150
The trial will be held on another day!

576
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:58,830
Bravo! Bravo!

577
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:03,190
Bravo!

578
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:07,070
Bravo!

579
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:11,620
They called the shots for so many years.

580
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:12,590
They must have never thought that

581
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:13,770
they would suffer defeat

582
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:15,100
in their own territory.

583
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:19,170
How was the General's Residence?

584
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:20,150
As you expected,

585
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:21,560
I've handled things there.

586
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,510
Madam and Miss Yan

587
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:23,630
are safe and sound.

588
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:24,390
My lord,

589
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:26,480
your plan of capturing the leader first

590
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,540
is really amazing.

591
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:31,350
Unfortunately, this leader

592
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:32,790
is not the true leader.

593
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:54,630
Madam.

594
00:34:57,350 --> 00:34:58,070
Madam.

595
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:01,070
This stall's tea

596
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:01,630
is very fragrant.

597
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:02,190
Try it.

598
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:05,179
Don't call me Madam anymore.

599
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:06,429
Just call me Gaya.

600
00:35:09,949 --> 00:35:10,469
Okay.

601
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:11,790
Gaya.

602
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:15,310
We finally got out of the General's Residence

603
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:16,510
to get some fresh air.

604
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:17,830
Cheer up.

605
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:22,070
General asked me to go to the capital

606
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:22,989
with Mr. Xi.

607
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:25,469
Dr. Yan,

608
00:35:26,139 --> 00:35:27,150
what is Mr. Xi's

609
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:28,400
real identity?

610
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,390
How can General be at ease

611
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:31,520
leaving me with him?

612
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:33,440
I don't know.

613
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:34,580
But he must be someone

614
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:35,710
who can protect you.

615
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:38,050
You don't know?

616
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:42,110
Don't you love each other?

617
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:49,950
It's a brief thing.

618
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:51,150
I was just

619
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:52,990
passing by

620
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:54,950
without real attachment.

621
00:35:57,310 --> 00:35:58,230
I'm different.

622
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,390
I swore to God

623
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:03,040
to never be apart from my husband.

624
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:04,630
Alright.

625
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:08,320
Madam.

626
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:11,090
Speaking of leaving,

627
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:13,510
I have a request.

628
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:15,600
Please go ahead.

629
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:16,870
We're friends.

630
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:17,830
I'll complete

631
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:18,910
your request.

632
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:21,080
I want to see your magical medicine.

633
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,340
Our tribe is known for its snake legends.

634
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:24,710
The magical medicine

635
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:26,390
is used to cure snake venom.

636
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:28,470
To cure snake venom only?

637
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:33,180
This medicine can cure all poisons,

638
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,800
but only for snake venom.

639
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:39,350
Dr. Yan.

640
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:41,430
Are you alright?

641
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:44,590
I'm fine.

642
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:55,350
What a special tune.

643
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:57,450
I can't tell if it's a flute

644
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:58,720
or a vertical flute.

645
00:36:58,790 --> 00:36:59,630
Li flute.

646
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:03,070
It's a Li flute.

647
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:07,400
Jiang Xinbai's pleasure boat is right there.

648
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:09,350
Go ahead.

649
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:41,960
You came uninvited.

650
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,510
It's not a lady's doing.

651
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:45,750
You are not a gentleman to me

652
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:46,620
anyway.

653
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:51,390
Why are you here?

654
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:55,000
Why am I here?

655
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:57,810
I took Lady Gaya out

656
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:58,840
for a stroll.

657
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:06,180
Arenâ€™t you

658
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,330
leaving Heman soon?

659
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:09,720
She's not happy with the thought of

660
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:11,290
parting with her husband.

661
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:12,770
What about you?

662
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:15,000
When are you leaving?

663
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:20,600
After the full moon.

664
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:23,330
You haven't entered

665
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:24,730
the general's study yet.

666
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:26,320
You're leaving so soon?

667
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:30,190
I'm not going there anymore.

668
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:32,620
Aren't you looking for your item anymore?

669
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:33,390
No.

670
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,250
Then why did you come back to Heman?

671
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:40,150
Yeah.

672
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:42,710
Why did I come back here?

673
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:48,110
Forget it.

674
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:50,750
At least I witnessed a good show

675
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,400
without dying.

676
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:54,590
By the way,

677
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:58,280
I'm giving this back to you.

678
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:02,160
You promised me

679
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:03,550
you'd tell me your real identity

680
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:04,390
before you leave

681
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:05,070
Heman.

682
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:10,940
Wait till when I'm sure

683
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:12,490
I can leave Heman safely.

684
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:13,640
Excuses.

685
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:14,880
Take it.

686
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:22,030
Don't leave without saying goodbye

687
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:23,360
and break your promise.

688
00:39:25,350 --> 00:39:26,510
If I do,

689
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:28,970
you can come to the capital to find me.

690
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:39,670
I mean,

691
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:41,110
if

692
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:42,310
you're ever in trouble in the future

693
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:43,840
or need help with anything.

694
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:46,720
Don't make a promise so easily.

695
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,400
Be careful.

696
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,900
I might actually look for you in the capital.

697
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:17,200
This is the address.

698
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,840
[No. 4 Taiping Alley, Nanhua District]

699
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:20,470
Why is there only the district number

700
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:21,870
and no location name?

701
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:24,920
You'll know when you get there.

702
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,030
â™«I'll fetch you the moon in my heartâ™«

703
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:48,950
Next,

704
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,300
â™«I dream of the courtyardâ™«

705
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:50,550
where will you go?

706
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:53,490
â™«It knows my heartâ™«

707
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:54,540
I...

708
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:56,420
â™«I want to return triumphantly with youâ™«

709
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:58,210
I may go to my mother.

710
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:58,520
â™«We can listen to the rainâ™«

711
00:40:58,940 --> 00:40:59,780
Maybe

712
00:40:59,410 --> 00:41:02,660
â™«And watch the snowfall in the west hillsâ™«

713
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:01,810
I'll go somewhere new.

714
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:05,800
â™«On the streets, the alleys, and the palaceâ™«

715
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:04,270
Maybe...

716
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,430
Maybe I'll really run into trouble.

717
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:07,930
â™«We shall always meetâ™«

718
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:08,290
Then I'll go to the capital to find you.

719
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:11,840
â™«I only hope you fall into my heartâ™«

720
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:14,270
â™«The fire warms winter daysâ™«

721
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:16,890
â™«Spring can take its timeâ™«

722
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,750
â™«Everything is as you wishâ™«

723
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,060
This batch of goods

724
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,600
must leave Heman within ten days.

725
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:35,000
The general has sealed all the water ports.

726
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,710
He's also investigating the remnants of the three families.

727
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:37,770
Within this month,

728
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:40,230
no ship is allowed to go in or out.

729
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:41,650
Within ten days

730
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:43,110
is impossible.

731
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:45,310
I'm just informing you,

732
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:47,600
not discussing it with you.

733
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:49,430
Don't push me too far.

734
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:52,030
This batch of cargo ships must leave

735
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:53,430
Heman within this month.

736
00:41:53,950 --> 00:41:55,190
Do what you must.

737
00:41:56,310 --> 00:41:58,110
If you can't deliver it,

738
00:41:58,830 --> 00:42:00,470
you and your general

739
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:03,320
will both die.

740
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:09,220
That man named Xi

741
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:10,750
and that female traveling doctor named Yan

742
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:11,990
must both die as well.

743
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:13,630
Yan Nanxing has nothing

744
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:14,490
to do with this.

745
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:17,030
She has a special relationship with Xi.

746
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:18,670
Xi's identity is unknown.

747
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:20,190
Maybe Yan Nanxing also

748
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:22,390
approached you with ulterior motives.

749
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,270
We can't risk it.
