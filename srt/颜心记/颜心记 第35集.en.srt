Suoluo, you're getting married?

I have to bear the consequences

7
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:05,750

I don't think so.

Apologize to Dean Yan.

169
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:11,720

00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:04,030
Yan Biqing deliberately provoked you to make a mistake.

179
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:05,390
I hit you in public—

180
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:06,190
I understand.

181
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:07,030
You hit me

182
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,970
because you wanted to de-escalate things

183
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:09,830
and protect me.

184
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,920
But I don't want to thank you.

185
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:21,810
Anyway, you can't leave the Imperial Academy.

186
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:23,830
You can't give up on your dreams

187
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:24,690
and ambitions.

188
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:25,670
I can give up.

189
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:26,740
Liu Ruoqian.

190
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:32,880
Mr. Cui asked me to teach in Yizhou.

191
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:34,780
I've made up my mind.

192
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:36,780
I'll leave in a few days.

193
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:43,720
Yizhou is far away.

194
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:48,650
It will take a long time

195
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:50,440
to come back.

196
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:52,450
Then I won't come back.

197
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:29,890
You sinister villain.

198
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,310
I’ll teach you a lesson.

199
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:32,630
Mr. Yan,

200
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,570
how did you get hurt?

201
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:40,410
It's just a trick.

202
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:42,480
Why are you here?

203
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:43,850
Is it an emergency?

204
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:45,740
Here's the thing.

205
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:46,910
The next batch of goods

206
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:48,240
need your help.

207
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:49,230
Goods?

208
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:50,590
What goods?

209
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:50,990
Okay.

210
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:52,200
I got it.

211
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:54,710
Before I get married,

212
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:57,350
don't let Jiang Xinbai get any leverage on me,

213
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:57,870
or else

214
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:00,130
the outcome will be worse than death.

215
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:01,310
It's him?

216
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:03,190
You won't tell the truth?

217
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:03,630
Fine.

218
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:05,450
Then don't talk anymore.

219
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,200
Bai Yuan said he dismissed

220
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,070
all his men.

221
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:10,630
Why did this person

222
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:12,430
appear in the Imperial Academy?

223
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,320
What's his relationship

224
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:15,870
with Yan Biqing?

225
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:17,880
Don't worry.

226
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:19,610
Our chief has his own plan.

227
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:25,000
Suoluo,

228
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:27,390
come with me!

229
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,510
Hurry up!

230
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,320
Go.

231
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,630
I want to be alone.

232
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:35,260
Go out and play by yourself.

233
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,790
Take me to the Jiang Xinbai's house right now!

234
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:38,670
I said

235
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:40,090
I want to be alone.

236
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,500
You're really...

237
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:43,350
Jiang Suoluo,

238
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,030
if you don't want to marry

239
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:46,400
a Zornia boss,

240
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,770
hurry and take me there!

241
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:49,320
What did you say?

242
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,330
Who are you?

243
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:56,510
Jiang Xinbai?

244
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:58,750
Jiang Xinbai!

245
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,230
What are you doing?

246
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:03,550
Jiang Xinbai?

247
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,260
What—

248
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:16,750
I don't have time to play hide-and-seek with you.

249
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:18,360
Hey!

250
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:21,880
You...

251
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:26,390
Brat.

252
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:29,510
Are you okay?

253
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,990
You're at home?

254
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:49,970
I need to find someone.

255
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:51,990
Brat?

256
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,310
Did you see the kid

257
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:57,240
who just came in?

258
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:00,510
Stop looking.

259
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:01,990
That was me.

260
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,550
What?

261
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,550
That kid.

262
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:07,820
Are you kidding me?

263
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,580
How could you be a child?

264
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:11,790
Not only was I that child,

265
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,200
but also your nephew.

266
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:17,560
Greetings, Aunt.

267
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,190
Which part of the Jiang family are you from?

268
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:21,230
Uncle, Aunt.

269
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:22,440
I'll visit you

270
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,110
some other time.

271
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:23,590
See you.

272
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:27,110
Aunt.

273
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:36,630
Could it be...

274
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:38,370
Come in.

275
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:40,670
Stay outside.

276
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:41,950
No need to come in.

277
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:42,630
-Yes.
-Yes.

278
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,760
When we first met at the Ghost Market,

279
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,880
did you also...

280
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:55,470
That's right.

281
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,910
I was shapeshifting.

282
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:00,480
Jiang Xinbai escorted me out.

283
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,000
Shapeshift?

284
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:04,590
You...

285
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:06,910
You can shapeshift?

286
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:13,460
Zornia

287
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,460
can really make people shapeshift?

288
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,210
How could this happen?

289
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:22,160
I've tried all kinds of herbs since I was a kid,

290
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:23,630
so I'm immune to all poisons.

291
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:25,310
If someone else ate Zornia,

292
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:26,590
they would have died.

293
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,390
Although I survived,

294
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,630
I got this strange disease.

295
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:33,110
Since you were poisoned,

296
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,820
there must be a cure.

297
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,790
How about I take you back to the palace

298
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:38,190
to see an imperial doctor?

299
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:38,990
It's useless.

300
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:42,470
My mother went through all the medical books

301
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:44,260
and took me to doctors for so many years

302
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,110
to no avail.

303
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:47,790
This strange disease

304
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,870
must have made you suffer a lot.

305
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:56,230
You...

306
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:00,950
You don't think I'm weird?

307
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:04,030
To be honest,

308
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:05,430
I did

309
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:07,440
think you were strange before.

310
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:10,090
I thought that was your personality.

311
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,230
I didn't know

312
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:13,880
you became like this

313
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,300
because you were framed.

314
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:21,000
Nanxing,

315
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,090
don't worry.

316
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:23,990
There must be a solution.

317
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,380
After these treacherous people

318
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,430
are eliminated,

319
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,430
I will find a solution

320
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:31,830
with Xinbai.

321
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:35,860
Why

322
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:37,960
are you two here?

323
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:48,860
Xinbai,

324
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:50,510
if I hadn't found out

325
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,710
accidentally today,

326
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:54,370
how long were you going to hide it from me?

327
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:57,310
Suoluo,

328
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,940
since you already know

329
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,770
this secret,

330
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,350
how long do you plan on

331
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:04,550
keeping it a secret for Yan Nanxing?

332
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:07,670
My sister-in-law's secret

333
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:08,589
is my secret.

334
00:17:08,869 --> 00:17:10,310
I won't say anything

335
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:11,859
even if my life is in danger.

336
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:15,369
Enough, stop teasing her.

337
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:16,730
I have something important

338
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:17,569
to tell you.

339
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,349
Mr. Yao!

340
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,040
Mr. Yao.

341
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:35,210
What's wrong with him?

342
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:36,550
We received a report this morning

343
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:38,050
a merchant in the south of the city had a poison attack

344
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:39,580
and injured his wife badly.

345
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:40,430
Yes.

346
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,370
Someone reported him to the Inspection Office

347
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:43,500
and we arrested him.

348
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:47,270
People in the capital are buying Zornia again?

349
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:48,870
Ask our men

350
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:50,550
to the south of the city with me.

351
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:51,030
Yes.

352
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:54,990

Where did you buy the Zornia?

361
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:23,490
I didn’t expect

362
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:26,190
the Baiyuan Gang to be involved

363
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:27,360
with Yan Biqing.

364
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:28,690
It seems

365
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:31,290
that the mastermind

366
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:33,220
behind the people chasing after us

367
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,700
in Yazhou

368
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,450
was Yan Biqing.

369
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:39,580
Not only that,

370
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:42,890
but Yan Biqing and his father

371
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:45,790
were also the ones who killed my father.

372
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,830
No wonder

373
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:49,830
Yan Biqing went to the State of Miluo

374
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:51,900
as soon as Xinbai returned to the capital.

375
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,320
Turns out he was afraid you would accuse him.

376
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,520
That's why he ran away to avoid trouble.

377

Suoluo,

379
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:01,360
Yan Biqing is sinister, vicious,

380
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,220
and ambitious.

381
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,180

Tomorrow,

384
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,140
I will ask

385
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:12,550
His Majesty to cancel your engagement.

386
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:13,910
You can't do that now.

387
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:15,300
If we force His Majesty

388
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:15,830
to break off

389
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:17,310

390

we will alert them.

391
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,620
I'm afraid Yan Biqing and his father

will get desperate.

This might be worse for you two.

Xinbai, don't worry.

399

In the Imperial Academy,

400
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,950
he's still a little afraid of me.

401
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:37,880

Chancellor,

528
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,420
are you hungry?

529
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,560
I'll cook for you.

530
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,620
♫Same dream and person in front of me♫

531
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:28,600
♫Abrupt ending on the cusp of fruition♫

532
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,740
♫I'm left behind♫

533
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,970
♫No traces of you♫

534
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:36,830
♫Where are you?♫

535
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:43,100
♫I can't find you amidst my yearning♫

00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:46,720

537

You're back.

542
00:27:57,810 --> 00:27:58,570

♫Our past is eternal♫

544
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:00,880
I saw it again today,

545
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:02,190
so I picked one for you

546
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:04,230
♫All my time♫

547
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:03,910

Didn't you say

560
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:39,140
♫Past, present, and future♫

561
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,030
you're mine?

562
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:37,790
Yes.

563
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,140
I belong to Suoluo,

564
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:47,390
but Suoluo never said

565
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:49,390
that you're mine.

566
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:54,830
Liu Ruoqian,

567
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:57,870
you're mine.

568
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:06,960
Ruoqian,

569
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:08,550
I know

570
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,750
you didn't say goodbye to your parents

571
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,810
because you don't want them to be sad.

572
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:14,430
But they told me

573
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:16,070
that as long as you are

574
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:16,910
safe there,

575
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:18,070
write to them.

576
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:20,170
Let them know how you are doing

577
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:21,610
and they will be happy.

578
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:23,790
After I leave,

579
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,900
I'll need to ask you

580
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,620
to take care of my parents.

581
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:29,030
Of course.

582
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:30,730
When you get there,

583
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:32,870
you must write to me and Sai'er often.

584
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:34,190
Please help me

585
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:35,270
explain to Sai'er.

586
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:37,210
She will cry because I left

587
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:38,710
without saying goodbye.

588
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:51,720
Sir, it's getting late.

589
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:52,690
It's time to go.

590
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:54,920
Ruoqian,

591
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:57,040
go ahead.

592
00:29:57,390 --> 00:29:58,390
Let me see you off.

593
00:29:58,590 --> 00:29:59,110
Okay.

00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:26,570
Are we still leaving?

618
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:29,050
He can't leave.

619
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,980
He'll never leave.

620
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:33,460
Why don't you send me home?

621
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:34,550
Okay.

622
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:12,470
Aren't we a bit

623
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:13,440
too high-profile today?

624
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:13,880
No.

625
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:15,090
I want everyone in the capital

626
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:16,250
know that

627
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:22,220
[Shanli Hall]

628
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:19,430
Liu Ruoqian is mine.

629
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:23,550
Wait for me.

630
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:24,630
After I

631
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:26,030
take care of everything,

632
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,390
I'll propose to you

633
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:28,250
legitimately.

634
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:30,270
Okay.

635
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:31,790
I'll wait for you.

636
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,100
By the way, Sai'er,

637
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,550
has anyone said

638
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,020
you carry the scent of the seedlings?

639
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:50,770
My mother gave birth to me

640
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:51,920
in a seedling field.

641
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,910
So since I was young, I...

642
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:00,390
You can smell now?

643
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,900
I think my sense of smell is recovering slowly.

644
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:09,230
Well,

645
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,300
let’s go back and tell Ms. Yan.

646
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:12,880
She will be happy for you.

647
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:14,520
Let's go.

648
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:21,390
Shang,

649
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:23,830
I think I smell

650
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:24,720
Zornia.

651
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,320
Wait.

652
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:36,430
Bro,

653
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:37,730
what's the matter?

654
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:42,720
Commander of the Jinwu Guards.

655
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:44,550
Officer.

656
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,780
Open the box. I need to inspect it.

657
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:47,760
The goods we're transporting

658
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,070
are tributes from the Western Region.

659
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:51,950
This is the document from the Court of State Ceremonial.

660
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:52,710
Cut the crap.

661
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:53,860
Open it.

662
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:02,630
My lord,

663
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:04,550
there's nothing, right?

664
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:06,510
Can we go now?

665
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:10,420
No, my lord.

666
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:12,550
Please don't make it difficult for us.

667
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:13,870
If we're delayed,

668
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:17,840
the Court of State Ceremonial will punish us.

669
00:34:21,909 --> 00:34:22,639
Body search.

670
00:34:52,219 --> 00:34:52,830
Chief!

671
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:57,050
What happened?

672
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:58,880
Our men were caught.

673
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:03,250
The tributes to the capital

674
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:04,520
from the Western Regions

675
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,130
are handled by Yan Biqing.

676
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:07,280
Why did things go wrong

677
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:07,950
with him?

678
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:10,550
The tribute was supposed to be transported to the capital,

679
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:11,030
but

680
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:12,890
they ran into a man and a woman.

681
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,510
This man was quite powerful.

682
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:15,310
He was some

683
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:17,050
commander-in-chief.

684
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:18,630
Shang Bieli?

685
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:20,390
You know him?

686
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:23,910
He's friends with Jiang Xinbai.

687
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,680
It seems that

688
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:26,550
Jiang Xinbai will find out soon

689
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:27,310
about this.

690
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:28,750
Jiang Xinbai has always been

691
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:29,680
cautious of you.

692
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:30,990
If the Inspection Office

693
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:32,250
gets involved in this,

694
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,390
it won't be good for you.

695
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:34,120
Ridiculous.

696
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:35,950
I'm not afraid of him.

697
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:37,070
Chief,

698
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:38,510
now is not the time

699
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:39,790
to act on impulse.

700
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:42,800
The whole Baiyuan Gang is counting on you.

701
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:43,750
Er,

702
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:44,920
how about this?

703
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:46,570
You and the rest of the gang

704
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:48,450
go back to Tingzhou first.

705
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:51,130
You won't come with us?

706
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:52,830
I have other things to do.

707
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:54,880
Wait for me in Tingzhou.

708
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:56,190
Chief!

709
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:59,190
Yan Nanxing

710
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:00,540
doesn't love you at all.

711
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:02,320
No matter how much you do for her,

712
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,720
she won't appreciate it.

713
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:06,280
A great man doesn't need a wife.

714
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:08,440
You are the leader of a gang.

715
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:09,710
Don’t let Yan Nanxing

716
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:10,590
disrupt you.

717
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:13,450
If you don’t leave with us,

718
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:15,310
I’ll kill Yan Nanxing now.

719
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:16,310
How dare you!

720
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:17,950
I'll do anything for you.

721
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:22,550
Er,

722
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:24,310
I came to the capital

723
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:25,670
just for her.

724
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,060
Zornia is second.

725
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:28,750
Chief.

726
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:30,080
Don't worry.

727
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:32,980
I won't get caught.

728
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:34,910
Wait for me in Tingzhou.

729
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:38,760
Chief!

730
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:40,760
At this time tomorrow,

731
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,020
I'll wait for you here.

732
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,670
Whether you're alive or dead,

733
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:44,800
I'll accompany you.

734
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:02,890
[Jinwu Guards]

735
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:17,810
These people

736
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:19,830
hid Zornia on themselves

737
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,860
and disguised as drivers to sneak into the city.

738
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:34,630
It's you?

739
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:37,610
You're from the Baiyuan Gang?

740
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:38,830
Bai Yuan?

741
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:39,910
Tell me.

742
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:41,670
Where is your

743
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:43,670
distribution point in the capital?

744
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:44,670
Speak!

745
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:47,080
I'll kill you if you don't!

746
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:51,310
Kill me if you want.

747
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:00,590
Where is Bai Yuan now?

748
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:03,470
Mr. Jiang went to investigate personally.

749
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:04,470
Commander Shang,

750
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:05,920
I'll return to the Inspection Office

751
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:06,740
and send men

752
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:08,120
to capture Bai Yuan.

753
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:10,350
Also, the clue of the tribute

754
00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:12,710
definitely has something to do with the Yan father and son.

755
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:14,950
Commander Shang, please investigate it.

756
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:15,810
The Yan family?

757
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:17,260
Yan Biqing?

758
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:19,310
Bai Yuan came to the capital

759
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:21,030
to cooperate with Yan Biqing.

760
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:25,410
Leave it to me.

761
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:27,910
This time, I will capture

762
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,760
all these criminals.

763
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:43,970
[Notice of arrest]

764
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,380
Have the guys watch carefully.

765
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:45,490
All pedestrians and wagons

766
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:46,410
must be checked.

767
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:47,580
Don't let anyone go unchecked.

768
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:48,630
The city gate is already closed.

769
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:49,190
Bai Yuan's group

770
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:50,030
can't escape.

771
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:51,300
The rest of you,

772
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:51,990
split up!

773
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:20,020
Are you crazy?

774
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,500
How dare you come here?

775
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:22,740
Don't you know that the whole city

776
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:23,940
is searching for you?

777
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,780
They're after me, not you.

778
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:28,010
What are you afraid of?

779
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:29,070
What am I afraid of?

780
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:32,040
Your men and goods

781
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:33,870
are now in Jiang Xinbai's hands.

782
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:35,060
Just in case,

783
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:38,100
I can help you get rid of them.

784
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:46,310
My men

785
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:48,360
won't betray me.

786
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,590
Even in death.

787
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:54,910
I won't betray you either.

788
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:57,450
What are you afraid of?

789
00:39:57,690 --> 00:39:59,190
It better be like this.

790
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,070
I'm here to tell you

791
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,240
I have my own plan.

792
00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:10,260
Just stand by and watch.

793
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:13,190
Chief Bai, you're a good friend.

794
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:14,830
In that case,

795
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:17,300
give me the rest of the goods.

796
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:21,320
I can help you sell them.

797
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:24,830
Help me?

798
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:28,050
Do you believe yourself?

799
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:30,990
I...

800
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:34,080
I'm really worried

801
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:35,170
about your safety.

802
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:38,580
If you don't want to leave the capital,

803
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:40,310
I can find you

804
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:41,150
a safe place

805
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:42,830
to hide in.

806
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:51,720
Yan Biqing.

807
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:53,510
Remember.

808
00:40:54,810 --> 00:40:55,800
Before I die,

809
00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:58,230
I'll definitely kill you first.

810
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:00,270
Also,

811
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:03,050
don't touch my people,

812
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:04,800
including Yan Nanxing.

813
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,090
Got it.

814
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:09,710
I won't touch them.

815
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:10,460
You got it?

816
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:12,760
Yes.

817
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:35,920
Threatening me?

818
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:39,190
How dare you!

819
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:43,150
You're like a dying fish,

820
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:48,450
but you still dare to stroll through the capital.

821
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,150
I'd like to see

822
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:53,480
how you get scaled and skinned.

823
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:34,190
Split up!

824
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:35,230
Yes.
