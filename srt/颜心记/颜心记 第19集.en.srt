Yes.

Fine.

You can keep comforting me.

181
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:02,320
Well,

182
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,360
what do you want to hear?

183
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:07,950
I'm kidding.

184
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:09,490
I'm not that petty.

185
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:15,410
Put on your hat first.

186
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:16,430
No.

187
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:18,230
Why should I listen to you?

188
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:19,560
What if there are spies?

189
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:20,470
No!

190
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:21,070
Be good.

191
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,500
-Put on your hat first.
-Comfort me.

192
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,750
I'll wear it when I'm happy.

193
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:24,780
No.

194
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,110
Be good.

195
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,030
-There are people everywhere.
-I don't want to.

196
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:28,830
Yan Nanxing.

197
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:50,550
Shang...

198
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:52,790
I know him.

199
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:54,670
Commander Shang.

200
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:56,410
You brought so many people

201
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:57,750
to have fun here?

202
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:04,030
Search!

203
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:06,270
Mr. Shang.

204
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:07,560
Just let me know

205
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,190
what you're looking for.

206
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:10,530
We're friends.

207
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,440
Zornia.

208
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,550
Mr. Shang.

209
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:20,070
Most of my customers

210
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:21,470
are your Jinwu Guards.

211
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:26,330
They are my target.

212
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:42,710
Search!

213
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,320
Mr. Shang?

214
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:47,600
Tong Sai'er.

215
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:49,240
Why are you here?

216
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,200
Blossom Beauty's closed down.

217
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,550
I'm working part-time here.

218
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:53,240
Let go of me!

219
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,010
Let go!

220
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:58,440
My lord, we didnâ€™t find Zornia.

221
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:00,270
Mr. Shang.

222
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:01,630
I told you.

223
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:02,720
Jinwu Guards

224
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,080
wouldn't touch Zornia.

225
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,470
You scared them.

226
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:10,800
Wait, Mr. Shang.

227
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:11,550
I just smelled

228
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:12,190
Zornia.

229
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,430
What does a girl know?

230
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:15,670
Don't talk nonsense!

231
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:16,990
I have a keen sense of smell.

232
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:17,950
My mother always said

233
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:18,530
I have a dog's nose.

234
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:19,570
I can't be wrong.

235
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:22,240
Raise your hand.

236
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:36,500
Mr. Shang!

237
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,020
Thereâ€™s no evidence.

238
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:39,750
Don't be

239
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:41,050
deceived by a girl

240
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:42,560
and wrong your comrade.

241
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:43,710
Iâ€™m not lying!

242
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,360
Mr. Shang.

243
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:47,690
If you donâ€™t believe me,

244
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:49,090
I'll sniff it out for you.

245
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,530
Let go!

246
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,350
Mr. Shang, look.

247
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:22,120
There's really Zornia?

248
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,280
Mr. Shang.

249
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:25,590
I have nothing to do with it.

250
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:26,990
Why did your men

251
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:28,510
bring such stuff to

252
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:29,390
my music house?

253
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:31,070
I'm so unlucky!

254
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,360
I'll kill you!

255
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,270
Are you okay?

256
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:41,190
I'm fine.

257
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,830
It's not my first day in the martial world.

258
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:45,830
Take him away.

259
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:49,310
Seal off Twelve Music House!

260
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:51,350
Mr. Shang, Iâ€™m innocent!

261
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:52,750
We'll investigate it!

262
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,000
How's this fine?

263
00:13:58,630 --> 00:13:59,360
Come with me.

264
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,320
Why did you help me?

265
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:10,970
It's everyone's responsibility to combat Zornia use.

266
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:13,860
Why do you sound like Jiang Xinbai?

267
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:18,950
Jinwu Guards are using Zornia,

268
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:20,690
yet I only found out today.

269
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,510
I don't deserve to be the Jinwu Guards'

270
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:24,770
commander-in-chief.

271
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:26,950
Mr. Shang.

272
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:28,880
You're not to blame.

273
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:31,110
There are so many Jinwu Guards.

274
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:32,260
How can you manage

275
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:33,250
all of them?

276
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:36,130
Ruoqian often said

277
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:38,430
it's never too late to fix things.

278
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:40,550
If you really think you're wrong,

279
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:42,080
itâ€™s not too late to change.

280
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:48,320
Mr. Shang.

281
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:51,230
My wound's bandaged.

282
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:53,290
It's late. I'm leaving.

283
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:54,350
Wait.

284
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,300
Both Blossom Beauty

285
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,960
and Twelve Music House have closed down.

286
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,160
Where else can you go?

287
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:02,590
Well...

288
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,910
I'll get another part-time job.

289
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,820
If you really have nowhere to go,

290
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:14,310
just...

291
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:17,030
stay here to work.

292
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:18,990
No.

293
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:20,190
Why?

294
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:22,730
You're at odds with Mr. Jiang,

295
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:23,960
who is my boss'

296
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,710
good friend.

297
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:26,480
It will inconvenience

298
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,780
my boss.

299
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:28,670
Bye.

300
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:29,680
Tong Sai'er.

301
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:34,230
Do you recall

302
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:36,510
giving me three peach wood chips

303
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:38,150
as three promises to me?

304
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:40,840
Of course I do.

305
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:43,020
I'll redeem the first chip now.

306
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:45,190
You...

307
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:46,760
Stay here.

308
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:05,830
Sorry.

309
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:32,930
Lift your feet.

310
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:44,120
Stand still.

311
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:50,990
Tong Sai'er.

312
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:54,230
Can you leave me alone for a while?

313
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:25,770
[Peace Reigns]

314
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:46,350
Shang Bieli sealed off Twelve Music House.

315
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:47,070
Will he keep

316
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,000
investigating?

317
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,270
To think Shang Bieli's

318
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:50,830
also investigating about Zornia.

319
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:51,700
That ingrate

320
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,330
took so much money from us,

321
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,640
but he's turned on us.

322
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:56,270
What should we do?

323
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,540
No matter what he wants to do,

324
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,280
I won't

325
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:05,230
give him the chance.

326
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:08,070
What should we do now?

327
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:14,670
Wait.

328
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:16,230
Grandfather.

329
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:19,160
Why are you looking at me like that?

330
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,510
You'll have to suffer a little this time.

331
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:26,350
But

332
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:28,110
I will

333
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:31,340
never abandon you.

334
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:32,950
Grandfather.

335
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:35,950
W-What do you want me to do?

336
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,310
Apart from Twelve Music House,

337
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:50,030
I also raided

338
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:51,630
all Jinwu Guards' barracks.

339
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:53,850
They insist they got it

340
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,310
from some bulk cargo

341
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:57,040
in Ghost Market a long time ago.

342
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:58,340
So

343
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:00,870
it's hard to find the source.

344
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:03,470
So Mr. Jiang

345
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:05,310
didn't wrong Jinwu Guards.

346
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:08,790
Brother.

347
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:10,490
Instead of someone

348
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:12,450
taking advantage of the fact that

349
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,750
we're embroiled

350
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,500
in the Zornia case,

351
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:19,130
why don't I meet His Majesty to explain things?

352
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:21,200
But Mr. Jiang said

353
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,230
we shouldn't meet

354
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:24,680
His Majesty without evidence.

355
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:25,480
Brother.

356
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,470
Ignore Jiang Xinbai.

357
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:30,710
I don't trust him.

358
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:34,080
His Majesty's wise.

359
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:35,550
He'll believe me.

360
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:42,040
I'll go with you then.

361
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:42,630
No.

362
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,110
It's still risky to take you there.

363
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,310
But if you go alone...

364
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:48,950
Brother.

365
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:52,310
Wait for my news.

366
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,710
If I don't come back tonight,

367
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:56,690
leave the capital.

368
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:22,710
[Zhaode Hall]

369
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:26,190
Mr. Shang.

370
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,780
His Majesty summons you.

371
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:49,890
Greetings, Your Majesty.

372
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:53,670
Shang Bieli.

373
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:56,140
I entrusted the city's safety

374
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,060
to you.

375
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:59,350
What have you done?

376
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,300
My lord, General Nan is here.

377
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:18,550
Mr. Jiang.

378
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:20,830
Please save Bieli.

379
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:26,110
Your Majesty.

380
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,760
I was just running

381
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:28,790
a small business.

382
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:30,650
I'm thankful for Jinwu Guards'

383
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:32,380
frequent patronage to my shop.

384
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:35,090
I've been serving them wholeheartedly.

385
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:36,240
As for

386
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,410
what they did in the rooms,

387
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,230
how'd I dare question them?

388
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:41,830
Besides,

389
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,550
I've been paying Mr. Shang well

390
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:44,480
all these years.

391
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:45,630
How did my shop

392
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,470
become a Zornia den?

393
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:48,950
Your Majesty.

394
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:51,550
Even if you give me ten lives,

395
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:53,220
I'd never dare touch Zornia,

396
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:55,990
let alone deal it, Your Majesty.

397
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,040
Your Majesty.

398
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:01,250
It's everyone's responsibility to combat Zornia use.

399
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:03,270
I swear on the lives of my Li family

400
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:04,870
that my son

401
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:07,120
would never dare deal with Zornia.

402
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:10,190
Or I'd receive punishment with him.

403
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:11,830
I'm afraid

404
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:15,270
someone's framing him.

405
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,550
I'll enter the palace now.

406
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,110
Wait.

407
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:28,430
You're a fugitive.

408
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:29,880
Before you get to the gate,

409
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,000
you'll be arrested

410
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:32,290
and executed on the spot.

411
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:33,620
What else can I do?

412
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:41,340
Bravo.

413
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:43,950
Bravo, Shang Bieli.

414
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:46,930
To think you'd use the power I gave you

415
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:49,420
to make money!

416
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:50,870
Do you know

417
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,550
the public will ultimately

418
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:54,150
hold me accountable

419
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:55,310
for the dirty money

420
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,510
you took?

421
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:04,430
Y-Your Majesty.

422
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:07,970
I only paid him. I never questioned things.

423
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:09,420
But...

424
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:11,870
I-I'm afraid

425
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,520
we can't get the money back.

426
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:14,250
After all,

427
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:17,390
Mr. Shang needs to take care of many people.

428
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:21,050
Take care of many people?

429
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,440
Shang Bieli.

430
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:27,270
I'm very interested now.

431
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:30,190
Who are you taking care

432
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:32,670
of?

433
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:43,790
Mr. Jiang.

434
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,590
His Majesty's summoned you

435
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,230
to the palace to meet him.

436
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,040
Yes.

437
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:57,470
[Taiji Hall]

438
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:01,510
Your Majesty,

439
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:03,990
you want me to interrogate Shang Bieli?

440
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:05,670
You have two hours

441
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:07,530
to make him confess.

442
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:10,030
If he still remains silent,

443
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:11,980
I'll allow you

444
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,440
to execute him on the spot.

445
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,790
In your opinion,

446
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:21,670
where could the money

447
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:23,560
Shang Bieli took have gone?

448
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:25,510
He and Nan Jifeng were once

449
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:26,950
military comrades.

450
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:30,030
Nan Jifeng's fled the country.

451
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:32,060
Who knows if he has

452
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:33,390
defected?

453
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:36,430
If they're working together,

454
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,150
the flow of the money

455
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:39,470
is very suspicious.

456
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:41,990
Do you get me?

457
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:44,990
Yes.

458
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:05,990
I have nothing to say.

459
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:07,930
You can kill me

460
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:09,330
as you wish.

461
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,210
Do you think

462
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:12,710
it'll just be you dying?

463
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,760
If you're so stubborn,

464
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,430
you'll drag others

465
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:18,470
to death with you.

466
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,390
What do you mean?

467
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:24,110
Brother?

468
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,810
What do you have against us?

469
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:32,110
Why won't you let my brother go?

470
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,310
Bieli, calm down.

471
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:36,250
I begged Mr. Jiang to bring me here.

472
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:37,270
Only Mr. Jiang

473
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:38,600
can solve this problem.

474
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:40,550
Brother, you still believe him?

475
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:45,350
You're stupid enough

476
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:47,720
to let a loser like Li Wufang

477
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,070
cause a scene.

478
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:51,070
Who are you scolding?

479
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:52,190
Am I wrong?

480
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:52,980
All right.

481
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:56,550
Why don't you think about it?

482
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:58,230
His Majesty can kill you easily

483
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:59,310
by asking the Ministry of Justice

484
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:00,710
or Ministry of Personnel

485
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,760
to go through the motions.

486
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:04,470
He knows

487
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,510
we're enemies,

488
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:08,230
so why did he send me to interrogate you?

489
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:13,870
Does His Majesty know you've been there?

490
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,360
Anyway,

491
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:18,780
our fates are

492
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,110
linked now.

493
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,320
If my interrogation goes wrong,

494
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:23,470
no one

495
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:25,770
can leave the palace tonight.

496
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:26,750
Bieli.

497
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:30,340
You're not a greedy person.

498
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:31,790
What did you

499
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:32,830
use the money for?

500
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:34,230
Tell me.

501
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:42,550
Shang Bieli.

502
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,320
I don't care if

503
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:46,470
you distrusted me,

504
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:48,830
but at this moment,

505
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:50,230
you have to trust me.

506
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:53,710
Just two hours.

507
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:55,950
Whether we'll die

508
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:57,710
or live together

509
00:26:58,510 --> 00:26:59,950
depends on your choice.

510
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:07,070
Shang Bieli

511
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:09,140
wouldn't dare confess.

512
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:12,410
Grandfather, why are you so sure?

513
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,830
Since he took the first fee

514
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:16,830
from us,

515
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,790
he's already become

516
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:22,390
our caged bird.

517
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:28,130
Father-in-law, you're the best.

518
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:29,470
Back then,

519
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:32,050
the Ministry of Defense didn't pay much.

520
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:33,810
His comrades who came back

521
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,270
from the battlefield

522
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:37,590
either died or struggled with injuries.

523
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:39,710
I heard many of their families

524
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,390
were starving to death.

525
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:42,270
This guy

526
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:44,030
took our money

527
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:45,890
to support them.

528
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:47,630
If he tells the truth

529
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:48,470
in front of His Majesty,

530
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:50,750
he'll be accusing His Majesty of neglecting the soldiers.

531
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:52,280
People are unpredictable.

532
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:54,670
No one knows if

533
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:56,870
it will infuriate His Majesty.

534
00:27:57,350 --> 00:28:00,350
Once His Majesty is unhappy,

535
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,910
he and his comrades

536
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:05,030
will be in trouble.

537
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:09,240
Grandfather, you're wise.

538
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:11,350
I lost my businesses,

539
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:12,830
but I

540
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:15,010
earned some merit for you.

541
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:17,430
Look at you.

542
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,310
You'll be rewarded.

543
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,100
Why did you bear the burden alone

544
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:30,750
without telling me?

545
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,170
Brother, you were far away in Heman

546
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:43,990
and plagued with difficulties.

547
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,530
I didn't want to worry you any more.

548
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:51,030
Mr. Jiang.

549
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,870
Let's go to His Majesty

550
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:55,350
and explain things.

551
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:55,960
No.

552
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:57,030
Why?

553
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:01,230
Did you just say

554
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:03,720
you haven't confessed to His Majesty?

555
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:06,190
I haven't.

556
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:10,670
Your stupid brother

557
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:13,500
finally did one smart thing.

558
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,980
About this matter,

559
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:19,800
you mustn't tell the truth.

560
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:21,270
But we can't

561
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:22,530
just wait for our doom.

562
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:23,240
Brother.

563
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:25,870
You canâ€™t be implicated in this.

564
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:27,870
Jiang Xinbai.

565
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:29,740
Take my brother away.

566
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:30,910
I'll confess it myself.

567
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:32,080
Did I say all that

568
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:32,810
for nothing?

569
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:35,980
If we don't get interrogation results today,

570
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:38,830
the three of us will suffer.

571
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:41,850
Then what should we do?

572
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:47,330
Let's rely on the glimmer of hope.

573
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:48,800
What is that?

574
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:57,550
Nan Jifeng?

575
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:02,830
Your Majesty.

576
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:04,790
Please allow me to report it.

577
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:05,990
Report what?

578
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,620
You made a huge mess

579
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,980
in Heman

580
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:11,410
which you didn't report,

581
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,320
but I just

582
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:14,630
turned a blind eye.

583
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:16,800
How dare you keep it from me

584
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:18,720
that Nan Jifeng's here?

585
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:20,310
Your Majesty.

586
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:21,860
Due to investigating

587
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:23,150
Zornia in Heman,

588
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:25,830
General Nan was blackmailed and slandered.

589
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:27,190
It's a false accusation

590
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,430
that he took bribes.

591
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,950
General Nan couldn't defend himself,

592
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:33,810
so he pretended to escape and return to the capital.

593
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:36,590
He's eager to report

594
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:37,640
the truth to you.

595
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:38,910
He just

596
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,640
hasn't found

597
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:41,750
the right time.

598
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,740
Please forgive me.

599
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:47,750
Your Majesty.

600
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,990
Mr. Shang is the same.

601
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:53,350
The two of them are in sync,

602
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:54,610
working together

603
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:56,550
and pretending to take bribes

604
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:57,350
to

605
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,790
play the long game and catch big fish.

606
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:01,160
Is that why

607
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,110
you didn't say anything just now?

608
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:04,850
Please forgive me.

609
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:07,110
So what fish did you catch?

610
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:08,950
No...

611
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:10,990
Nothing yet.

612
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:13,830
Your Majesty.

613
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,250
The criminal's too cunning.

614
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:17,850
Our clues keep being cut off.

615
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:19,240
Actually,

616
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:21,390
I had no choice.

617
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:24,800
There's no progress after the Ghost Market case.

618
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:27,770
And you just believed in

619
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:29,850
Shang Bieli's scheme?

620
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:32,150
Yes.

621
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:39,710
A wise emperor has loyal subjects.

622
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,860
An upright leader has upright subjects.

623
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:43,950
You

624
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:45,630
are the one I trust.

625
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:47,780
But I don't trust you!

626
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:52,190
I entrusted you with the Inspection Office

627
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:54,320
and the highest investigative right.

628
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:56,710
But what've you reported in return?

629
00:31:58,670 --> 00:31:59,470
Your Majesty!

630
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:00,630
Mr. Jiang had

631
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:01,980
reminded me many times.

632
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:02,950
I was stupid.

633
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:05,240
It's not your turn to speak.

634
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,270
Your life

635
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:08,290
is still

636
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:09,790
on the line!

637
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:11,470
Your Majesty.

638
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:13,510
To eradicate Zornia,

639
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:15,260
the three of us will

640
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:17,550
put our lives and prides on the line.

641
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:18,900
Please

642
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,230
give us another chance.

643
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:22,830
Give you a chance?

644
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:29,400
What if I don't?

645
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:34,230
Your Majesty.

646
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:36,550
Dare I guess

647
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:38,730
that you secretly summoned us

648
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:41,110
as you planned not to convict us

649
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:43,190
but

650
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,630
to give us this chance?

651
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:51,250
Thank you, Your Majesty.

652
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:54,420
-Thank you, Your Majesty.
-Thank you, Your Majesty.

653
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:59,270
If there aren't results in two months,

654
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:00,870
all of you

655
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:03,910
will be beheaded.

656
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:07,490
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

657
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:29,630
Jiang Xinbai!

658
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:31,270
I have something to tell you.

659
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:31,870
Bieli.

660
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:33,280
Let's talk later.

661
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,110
This is the palace.

662
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:34,660
Brother.

663
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,490
I was too impulsive before.

664
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:38,460
I wrecked the Inspection Office,

665
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:39,750
kidnapped Yan Nanxing,

666
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:40,510
and endangered you

667
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:41,680
by taking my brother away.

668
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,340
I offended you three times...

669
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,870
So hit me three times!

670
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:46,200
Consider it my apology!

671
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:47,850
Are you crazy?

672
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:04,110
To think

673
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:06,230
your apology would be

674
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:08,830
so original.

675
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:11,510
If I go along with it, I'm afraid

676
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:13,530
I might be punished for it.

677
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:15,280
Then...

678
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:17,360
I'll make amends to you.

679
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:20,790
That's

680
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,710
possible too.

681
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:25,340
Enough.

682
00:34:26,429 --> 00:34:27,860
Mr. Jiang is joking.

683
00:34:28,889 --> 00:34:30,350
The magnanimous Mr. Jiang

684
00:34:30,429 --> 00:34:31,770
will let bygones be bygones.

685
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:33,139
From now on,

686
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:35,480
the two of us will be

687
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:37,350
at your disposal.

688
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:41,270
Be at my disposal?

689
00:34:41,989 --> 00:34:42,830
Will he agree?

690
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:44,710
I...

691
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:47,090
I'll listen to my brother.

692
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,510
Okay.

693
00:34:57,990 --> 00:34:59,630
You and Mr. Jiang

694
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:01,630
are so different.

695
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:04,390
But one thing's very similar.

696
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:06,460
Stubborn.

697
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:09,910
Can't you talk nicely?

698
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:18,390
I already apologized.

699
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,410
My goodness.

700
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:30,830
Why did you break

701
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:31,830
this plate again?

702
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:32,790
Ms. Sai'er.

703
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:34,110
I'm begging you.

704
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:35,590
Just rest well.

705
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,230
In just a few days,

706
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:38,350
you broke

707
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:39,700
ten bowls in the kitchen

708
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:41,750
and killed six pots of flowers in the yard.

709
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:43,840
Even... Even Commanderâ€™s clothes

710
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:44,730
are ruined.

711
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:47,510
Well...

712
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:50,310
Is there anything I can do?

713
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:51,360
Not helping

714
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:52,230
is the greatest help

715
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:53,160
you can offer us.

716
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,520
Mr. Shang.

717
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:00,960
Mr. Shang!

718
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:04,150
Mr. Shang, Ms. Sai'erâ€¦

719
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:05,470
It's fine.

720
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:06,870
You may leave.

721
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:07,950
Yes.

722
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:15,430
Sorry, Mr. Shang.

723
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:17,380
I'm of no help

724
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:19,090
in your residence.

725
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:21,550
I'm even inconveniencing everyone.

726
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:24,070
What else can you do

727
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:25,560
besides housework?

728
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:29,630
I can do a lot.

729
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:31,870
I can hunt in the mountains

730
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:32,950
and fish in the water.

731
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:33,750
I can catch snakes

732
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:34,750
to make snake gallbladder wine.

733
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:35,430
I don't

734
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:36,310
want to brag,

735
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:37,270
but my snake gallbladder wine

736
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:38,680
is very effective.

737
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:39,840
Do you want to try it?

738
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:41,110
Good.

739
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:42,930
But I don't need it.

740
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:45,390
Well,

741
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:47,400
after I came to the capital,

742
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:49,430
I learned how to make beauty creams.

743
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:50,750
You don't need it too?

744
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:54,370
I just escaped death.

745
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,440
I want to have a good meal.

746
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:58,220
Escaped death?

747
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,800
It's nothing.

748
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:02,540
I'm hungry.

749
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:03,380
Can you cook?

750
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:05,950
I can cook.

751
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:08,790
But do you dare eat it?

752
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:10,310
Are you kidding me?

753
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:12,410
Soldiers live and eat in the wild.

754
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:13,740
I've eaten everything.

755
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:15,610
Would your cooking scare me?

756
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:20,190
Mr. Shang, please enjoy.

757
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:22,190
What are...

758
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:23,230
all these?

759
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:24,550
This is

760
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:25,750
steamed ribs.

761
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:31,270
Steamed?

762
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:36,520
What about this?

763
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:37,230
This?

764
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:38,690
This is tender tofu.

765
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:39,510
Tender?

766
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:45,060
What about this?

767
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:48,030
This is roasted yellow fish with potatoes.

768
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:53,260
Where's the fish?

769
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,240
They're mixed together.

770
00:37:58,190 --> 00:37:59,310
Then this...

771
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:01,790
This?

772
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:03,350
This is a specialty

773
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:04,390
of the mountains.

774
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:05,670
It's very nutritious.

775
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:09,960
Have a try.

776
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:11,150
Here.

777
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:12,750
No thanks.

778
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:17,900
The purple one...

779
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:18,860
This

780
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,320
is my signature dish,

781
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:22,150
meatball soup with blue pea flowers.

782
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:23,400
Isn't it beautiful?

783
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:25,240
Signature dish?

784
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:27,890
Mr. Shang.

785
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:29,750
Care to have a try?

786
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:31,830
Me?

787
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:33,030
I...

788
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:34,420
Come on.

789
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:36,860
Let's try this first...

790
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:39,230
Steamed eggplants.

791
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:41,150
Here.

792
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:43,210
It's delicious.

793
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:43,810
Trust me.

794
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:50,550
How is it?

795
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:54,230
It's...

796
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:55,850
delicious.

797
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,490
Try something else.

798
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:13,920
This is also delicious.

799
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:15,190
Wellâ€¦

800
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:28,500
Here, Mr. Shang.

801
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,390
Try this.

802
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:31,040
It may stink,

803
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:32,120
but it tastes good.

804
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:34,520
It's okay. I can't smell it.

805
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:40,000
My nose is broken. I have no sense of smell.

806
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:42,240
I can't smell it,

807
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:43,510
but

808
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,820
I can taste its deliciousness.

809
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:34,010
â™«Pretty faces and illusions dazzle my eyesâ™«

810
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:37,480
â™«How can I recognize your original selfâ™«

811
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:43,180
â™«I cannot betray my dutiesâ™«

812
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,210
To have someone

813
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:43,280
waiting for me to come home with food

814
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:49,830
â™«The sky changes, but hearts are hard to betrayâ™«

815
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:45,050
is great.

816
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:55,140
â™«Using time as my last betâ™«

817
00:40:55,380 --> 00:41:03,180
â™«I allow you into my dreams, don't prove me wrongâ™«

818
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:05,250
â™«Stars in the mirrorâ™«

819
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:07,580
â™«Give me emptinessâ™«

820
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:10,470
â™«Three thousand drunken glances are not worthâ™«

821
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,910
â™«A single look at youâ™«

822
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:14,880
â™«Even if deeply understanding your heartâ™«

823
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:17,390
â™«Is my delusionâ™«

824
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:21,890
â™«I'll still wholeheartedly pursue itâ™«

825
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:24,570
â™«Only for you to stay in my heartâ™«

826
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:26,880
â™«For a brief momentâ™«

827
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:29,150
â™«The road is long and farâ™«

828
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:34,280
â™«Even so, I rush forward on my horse and boatâ™«

829
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:44,670
They actually

830
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:46,000
left the palace safely?

831
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:46,950
Nan Jifeng too?

832
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:48,490
What happened?

833
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:50,010
I didn't expect Jiang Xinbai

834
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:51,150
to have Nan Jifeng.

835
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:52,470
It was all in vain.

836
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:54,960
The shops are gone and the money is gone.

837
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:55,950
That's nothing.

838
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:56,950
Nothing?

839
00:41:57,530 --> 00:41:58,080
Father.

840
00:41:58,430 --> 00:42:00,140
You're not the head of the household,

841
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:01,870
so you don't know how costly necessities are.

842
00:42:01,870 --> 00:42:02,630
Shut up!

843
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:09,430
If the Jinwu Guards and Inspection Office

844
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:10,830
join forces from now on,

845
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:14,210
we'll be attacked from both sides

846
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:15,620
and in deep trouble.

847
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:19,380
Looks like

848
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:23,390
we'll have to move our businesses out of the capital.

849
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:25,510
Grandfather.

850
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,020
You can't ignore me.

851
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,270
Jiang Xinbai's started

852
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:29,070
bullying me.

853
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:30,150
All my businesses

854
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:31,170
have gone bust.

855
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:33,160
A small leak will sink a great ship.

856
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:34,390
What else do you want?

857
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:35,590
Kill or set fire?

858
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:39,730
How's the road coming along?

859
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:42,800
Father-in-law.

860
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:44,570
The road's been paved.

861
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:47,710
We've also assigned our own men.

862
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:49,550
Good.

863
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:51,590
This time,

864
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,530
we can't make

865
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:56,930
any mistake again.

866
00:42:58,890 --> 00:42:59,410
Yes.

867
00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:09,990
I've lost a lot this time.

868
00:43:10,910 --> 00:43:12,150
Bribery isn't serious enough

869
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:13,350
to warrant jailtime,

870
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:15,010
but within three days,

871
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:16,150
I've to close down all my shops

872
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:16,710
in my name

873
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:18,710
and I'm banned from doing business.

874
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:22,560
If Jiang Xinbai

875
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:23,840
keeps investigating,

876
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:25,030
once he finds...

877
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:30,550
Before he can kill me,

878
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:32,920
my grandfather would skin me alive.

879
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:35,110
That serious?

880
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:36,310
So,

881
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:38,630
Jiang Xinbai can't live.

882
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:40,790
Everything will only be over

883
00:43:41,390 --> 00:43:42,350
if he's dead.

884
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:43,950
Then...

885
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:46,280
Grandfather will think highly of me.

886
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:47,360
Then...

887
00:43:48,590 --> 00:43:49,920
What are you going to do?

888
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:52,840
Didn't you say

889
00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:54,750
this flyer looks like

890
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:56,480
a missing person's notice?

891
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:09,000
[Are you cold?]

892
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:09,000
