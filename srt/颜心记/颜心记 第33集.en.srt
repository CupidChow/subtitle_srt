Your Grace, let's talk inside.

178
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,820
His Lordship is waiting for you.

179
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:26,990
What?

180
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:28,330
You want me to hide?

181
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:29,230
Yes.

182
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,790
Tell the public that you're sick

183
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:33,670
to postpone the wedding.

184
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:36,150
Then, hide away from the capital for a few years.

185
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:38,030
Later, we'll find an excuse

186
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:39,480
to resolve this.

187
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:41,550
No way.

188
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:43,020
If I leave the capital now,

189
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:43,670
my career

190
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,650
will be ruined.

191
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:46,710
If you disagree,

192
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,180
we'll have to do something else.

193
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,660
Your job has been reinstated

194
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,310
and you have a beautiful wife.

195
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:55,750
So you're ignoring your sister's predicament

196
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,880
just because your life is perfect now?

197
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:59,270
I was a fool to believe Mother

198
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:00,390
when she said that

199
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:01,520
you would find a way.

200
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:03,790
Her Majesty personally

201
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:05,230
granted this marriage.

202
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:06,790
What else can I do?

203
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,760
Are you really going to get married?

204
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:13,510
Why not?

205
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:15,770
I'll just divorce him after that.

206
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:17,190
Don't be ridiculous.

207
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:18,510
I'm not.

208
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:19,670
Isn't divorce

209
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:20,930
our family tradition?

210
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,470
Jiang Suoluo.

211
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,230
If Mother hadn't divorced,

212
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:28,670
how could she have married your father?

213
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:29,950
How would you have been born?

214
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:30,810
What about you?

215
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:32,840
Didn't you divorce before too?

216
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:35,490
I'm different.

217
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:37,510
Yan Nanxing and I

218
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,950
are destined.

219
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:44,110
Destined?

220
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,150
I think you should keep

221
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,640
your confidence in check.

222
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:51,360
You've been busy with work these days.

223
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:53,470
I'm sure you didn't go home recently.

224
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:54,750
You don't even know that someone

225
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,830
has already infiltrated Blossom Beauty, do you?

226
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:57,470
Who is it?

227
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:59,720
An old friend of Yan Nanxing.

228
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:02,110
You'd better be careful.

229
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,590
Nothing is more worrying

230
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,190
than a thief who is plotting.

231
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:06,550
Bye.

232
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:17,810
[Blossom Beauty]

233
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:33,700
Young man,

234
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,360
are you new here?

235
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,560
What new product is this?

236
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:47,150
This.

237
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:50,680
I don't know.

238
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:55,230
Ms. Yan.

239
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:58,390
Where did you get this new employee?

240
00:12:58,390 --> 00:12:59,550
He doesn't seem to know

241
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:00,470
anything.

242
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:02,190
He's so distant, too.

243
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:03,510
Don't be mad.

244
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:04,510
Later,

245
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,630
I'll teach him a lesson.

246
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:06,470
Give him a good scolding.

247
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:07,870
Fix that attitude of his.

248
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:11,790
What are you doing?

249
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:14,270
You work here.

250
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,140
Can you be more enthusiastic

251
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:17,470
towards the customers?

252
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:19,420
Smile.

253
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:21,270
Smile.

254
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,640
Nevermind...

255
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:30,510
You money-wasting wretch.

256
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,770
You're here to buy this junk again.

257
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:32,690
Go home with me!

258
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,470
What's going on?

259
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:34,000
Let's go!

260
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,100
Who is this?

261
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:36,600
It's fine.

262
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:37,990
It's fine.

263
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:39,170
Just a misunderstanding.

264
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:40,110
Just a misunderstanding.

265
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:40,590
It's fine.

266
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:41,430
Don't let them bother you.

267
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:42,160
How dare you?

268
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:44,180
You're talking back to me now?

269
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,260
I'll kill you!

270
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,510
Who are you?

271
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,390
Mind your own business.

272
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:57,910
Let go.

273
00:13:58,670 --> 00:13:59,600
You won't let go?

274
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:00,550
Fine.

275
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:02,740
Go to hell!

276
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:29,620
The pearl powder has been spilled

277
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:30,880
and your anger is gone.

278
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:37,810
Shouldn't you go back now?

279
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:39,460
I'll go...

280
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,070
I'll go back.

281
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:41,790
I'll go!

282
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:42,830
I'll go...

283
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,690
I'll go back.

284
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,010
I'll go back...

285
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:46,880
You wretch.

286
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,940
I'll teach you a lesson later at home.

287
00:14:58,630 --> 00:14:59,230
Ms. Yan,

288
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:01,070
forget about lecturing him.

289
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,170
Although he's not good at talking,

290
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:04,620
he's pretty kind.

291
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:06,990
Of course.

292
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:08,490
I hired him.

293
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:09,480
Good taste.

294
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:20,990
Wipe it.

295
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:24,880
You did well.

296
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:27,190
It's hard to be a good person,

297
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:28,970
but it's worth the effort.

298
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:29,670
Keep it up.

299
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:30,760
Yan Nanxing.

300
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,760
Are you going to keep me?

301
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:38,270
Three months.

302
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:40,100
As long as you pass

303
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,630
three months of probation,

304
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,130
if you want to continue...

305
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:43,930
There's no if.

306
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:45,670
Are you sure?

307
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:47,810
There are things

308
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:49,410
that you'll lose if you don't

309
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:50,850
fight for them.

310
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:52,700
What I want

311
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,240
will be mine sooner or later.

312
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,900
Thank you for helping me out.

313
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:13,530
I hope you don't mind

314
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:15,010
my husband's bad temper.

315
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:16,240
No need to thank him,

316
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:17,700
it's part of his duty,

317
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:18,230
right?

318
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:20,870
Bai, from now on,

319
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:21,510
take this place

320
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:22,510
as your home.

321
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:25,010
Ask me if you don't understand anything.

322
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:26,230
Young sir,

323
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:27,890
you were so handsome just now.

324
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:28,750
Yes.

325
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:31,450
He looks handsome even when he doesn't talk.

326
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:38,870
Bai Yuan.

327
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:46,760
Long time no see.

328
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,090
How have you been?

329
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:51,880
Long time no see.

330
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:55,570
Chief Bai.

331
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:57,810
You came all the way from Tingzhou

332
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:58,760
to the capital.

333
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:00,350
Is something the matter?

334
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:03,880
You know the answer.

335
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,790
You should turn yourself in,

336
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:08,960
confess and explain

337
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,349
everything you've done,

338
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:11,609
and turn over a new leaf

339
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:13,430
so you can be a better person.

340
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:18,900
In your eyes,

341
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,349
can't a bandit

342
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,380
change for the better?

343
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,030
You know the answer.

344
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:30,870
What a pity.

345
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:33,470
What?

346
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:35,520
It's a pity for Yan Nanxing.

347
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,240
She trusts me.

348
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:39,630
I don't care

349
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:41,910
about what others think.

350
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:43,750
Bai Yuan,

351
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,100
you don't know Yan Nanxing at all.

352

how much do you know about her?

[No. 4 Taiping Alley, Nanhua District]

355
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:14,080
Why are you back so early today?

356
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,710
You even finished cooking.

357
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,240
Why is it all fish?

358
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:23,750
Madam, please have a seat.

359
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:28,070
We're having a fish feast today.

360
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:30,030
This is fried fish.

361
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,590
This is tofu fish soup.

362
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,380
This is fried yellow croaker.

363

The one closest to you

is braised mackerel.

Eat up.

366
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:47,480
Well, about that.

367
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,370
Are we lacking vinegar?

368
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:55,240
There's more than enough of that.

369
00:18:58,670 --> 00:18:59,550
Are you upset?

370
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:02,710
Do you already know that Bai Yuan

371
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:03,710
is in the capital?

372
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:07,670
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

373
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,310
I just came home.

How about we talk now?

Let's not talk about business at home.

376

Let's eat, Madam.

377
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:21,750
Don't be angry.

378
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:22,630
Okay?

379
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:24,250
I know.

380
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:25,720
I didn't do the right thing this time.

381
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,540
I was wrong.

382
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:27,670
I won't do it again.

383
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:28,130
Really.

384
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:29,390
I'll never do it again.

Don't be angry.

Don't be angry.

387
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:39,890
No need to apologize.

388
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:41,360
You are the boss.

389
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,910
You have the right to decide

390
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:43,870
who to hire.

391

Honey, don't be angry.

Honey, don't be angry...

Alright.

I'm not angry.

397

Recently,

398

you've been busy with your business.

399
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:08,950
I should be more considerate of you.

400
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,520
From now on,

401
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,290
I'll walk you home from work every day.

402

I'd love that.

403

Eat.

404
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:21,950
I worked very hard

405
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,370
for the fish feast today.

406
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:24,550
Finish it all.

Here.

410

You like vinegar.

411
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:33,390
I'll get you some vinegar.

412
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:34,320
That's too much!

413
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:35,400
Eat.

414
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:36,160

Yes.

419
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:08,470
You're quite bold

420
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,560
to come to see me alone.

421
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,380
Wasn't it Mr. Yan who invited me?

422
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:17,360
When I sent someone to look for you,

423
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,690
I only knew that you killed Yi Yuanshan.

424

But I didn't know

425

you even burned my Zornia.

Out with the old, in with the new.

427

Why should I work with you?

428

I have Zornia.

429
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:39,460
I have my own Zornia fields

in more than one area.

431
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,470
You burnt my goods

to cut off my supplies.

433
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:50,550
You're forcing me to buy your Zornia!

Only when the strong work together

reaching the capital soon.

440
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:04,990
You can check the goods then.

As for how to get it into the capital.

I'm not.

sincere enough.

She killed one of my men.

You're not allowed

Isn't she...

461
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:57,990
You should think about

462
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:00,320
how to transport the Zornia into the city.

463
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:02,780
If you don't want to,

I want to ask you something.

00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:21,270
About the product you recommended to me,

468
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:22,670
do you use it yourself?

469
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:24,140
Your skin is so good.

Ms. Yan.

471
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:28,670
I solved the case.

472
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:30,470
I found that my husband

473
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,560
was sneakily using my beauty cream.

474
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:34,720
I'll buy two bottles for him today.

475

Please collate them and pass them to me.

Let me tell you.

00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:02,580
This beauty cream

483
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:03,590
is so good,

484
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:04,790
you'd be shocked by its effect.

485
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:05,430
Let me try.

486
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:06,670
It's super effective.

Look.

488
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:09,470
It's so fragrant!

489
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:10,750
Such a comforting scent.

490
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:11,710
It's very delicate.

491
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:12,310
Yes.

492
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,760
A doctor must be benevolent

493
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,780
and her skills are for curing diseases.

494
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:20,770
You've put the cart before the horse.

495
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:21,630
Now,

496
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:24,720
have you abandoned the way of medicine to earn money?

497
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:28,510
Regardless of appearance, everyone's the same under the skin.

498
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:30,440
If you judge people by their looks,

499
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:31,830
isn't it against

500
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:34,590
our original intention as doctors?

501
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:36,910
Am I right,

502
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:39,030
Your Grace?

503
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:52,490
What are you doing?

504
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:54,140
Your eye is fake?

505
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:58,590
Someone poked my real eye out

506
00:24:58,900 --> 00:24:59,870
when I was nine.

507
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:02,990
When you were nine?

508
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,210
So young!

509
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,740
What about your parents?

510
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:06,720
They died early.

511
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:08,870
I was only five or six when they died.

512
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:11,150
I only remember them calling me a bastard,

513
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:11,830
a blind man,

514
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:14,190
and the bandit chief.

515
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:17,560
Why are you saying this?

516
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:19,630
As the bandit chief,

517
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:20,670
I almost killed

518
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:21,930
Yan Nanxing back then.

519
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:25,460
But she gave me this eye

520
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:28,200
so I can be a good person.

521
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,310
Now, do you still think

522
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:29,870
she is someone who

523
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:31,530
judges people by their looks?

524
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:35,640
Great. Great.

525
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,860
Not only can Ms. Yan cure illnesses, but

526
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,950
she can also help people turn over a new leaf.

527
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:40,950
It's is really...

528
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:42,930
-So impressive.
-So impressive.

529
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:44,150
It's nothing.

530
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:58,470
These are

531
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:01,440
the beauty creams Her Highness asked for.

532
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,470
And this.

533
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,310
This rose dew

534
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:08,870
is a free gift for you.

535
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:12,510
Take it as my thanks

536
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,780
for getting hit for me last time.

537
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,190
You always have men

538
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:19,790
wrapped around your finger.

539
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:20,910
Duchess,

540
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:22,780
don't forget who you are.

541
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:25,280
Don't go.

542
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,640
Who do you think you are?

543
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:27,990
Make it clear.

544
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:28,520
Exactly.

545
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:29,090
This...

546
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:30,790
Who does she think she is?

547
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:39,470
The beauty cream

548
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:40,930
you brought back this time

549
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,760
seems to be extra effective.

550
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:44,870
Of course.

551
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,170
Your Highness.

552
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:51,870
The duchess did such an outrageous thing

553
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:53,350
in public.

554
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:55,990
I wonder if His Grace knows.

555
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:59,510
If he doesn't, I'm afraid there will be trouble.

556
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:00,640
You must be careful.

557
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:02,910
For what?

558
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:04,910
If you ask me, I think Bai Yuan

559
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:06,570
should have appeared sooner.

560
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:08,190
You're not married yet.

561
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:10,630
Naturally, you don't understand

562
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:12,630
the little tricks between couples.

563
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:15,630
It's good to make my son jealous.

564
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,470
It's a good reminder for him that

565
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:19,130
he has two major tasks in life.

566
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:20,720
One is to eradicate Zornia.

567
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:22,570
The other is to live a good life

568
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:23,700
with Nanxing.

569
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,430
I really want to see

570
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:28,360
his expression when he's jealous.

571
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:36,430
Your Highness, your foresight is impressive.

572
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:06,210
Thank you for helping me yesterday.

573
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:08,600
But don't reveal your scars

574
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:09,800
like that again.

575
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:13,410
No need to thank me.

576
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,560
I'm just glad that it helped.

577
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,830
Am I

578
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:25,670
a good person now?

579
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:27,590
Yes.

580
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:31,060
But you're being a good person

581
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:31,990
for yourself,

582
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:33,580
not to please me.

583
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:38,630
If it weren't for you,

584
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:40,150
I wouldn't even care

585
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:41,610
about being a good person.

586
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:46,800
Yan Nanxing.

587
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:49,700
I won't give up on you

588
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,630
as long as I have a sliver of chance.

589
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:53,150
Bai Yuan.

590
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,470
Please don't waste

591
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:56,230
any of your feelings

592
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:57,030
on me anymore.

593
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:58,830
If you can't do it,

594
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:01,210
please leave Blossom Beauty.

595
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:06,310
Mr. Jiang,

596
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:07,680
you're here.

597
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:09,470
Where is Yan Nanxing?

598
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:10,730
I'm here to pick her up.

599
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:11,950
Mr. Jiang.

600
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:14,400
Are you looking for Boss?

601
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,130
She is in the backyard with Bai.

602
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,510
Bai Yuan?

603
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:31,160
Sai'er...

604
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,200
You're such a troublemaker.

605
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:39,320
Come with me now.

606
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:40,630
Let go!

607
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:46,060
Bai Yuan.

608
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,350
Yan Nanxing is my wife.

609
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:49,980
Please behave yourself.

610
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:55,540
Jiang Xinbai.

611
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:58,450
You just knew her earlier than me.

612
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,980
If she gets married again,

613
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:01,430
she might not choose you.

614
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:03,610
No matter who is earlier or later,

615
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:04,790
only I

616
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:06,550
am destined to be with her.

617
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:14,820
I don't believe it.

618
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:15,880
Bai Yuan.

619
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:18,890
If I had to choose a thousand times more,

620
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:20,820
I would still choose Jiang Xinbai.

621
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:24,680
Let's go.

622
00:30:58,710 --> 00:30:59,350
You...

623
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,490
Are you mad at me?

624
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:07,570
Why would I be mad?

625
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:11,590
Actually, I made it

626
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:12,910
very clear to him.

627
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:15,340
I don't know why

628
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:17,270
he is so obsessed.

629
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:24,270
The Yan Nanxing I know

630
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:26,800
wouldn't let anyone in need

631
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,950
of rescue go.

632
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:29,800
Saving eyes,

633
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:31,890
saving hearts,

634
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:33,510
it's all you.

635
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:35,960
I trust you.

636
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:45,070
Thank you.

637
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:47,630
Thank you for

638
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:49,330
trusting me wholeheartedly.

639
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:55,340
But Yan Nanxing,

640
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:57,880
human nature is hard to change.

641
00:31:57,990 --> 00:31:58,670
Not everyone

642
00:31:58,670 --> 00:31:59,750
will look forward.

643
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:09,110
Chief Bai.

644
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,500
He's the second chief of my gang.

645
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:16,950
If you can't find me in the future,

646
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:17,750
just go to him.

647
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:19,390
Mr. Yan.

648
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:25,830
Chief Bai,

649
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,590
you seem to be enjoying your work

650
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:29,050
at Blossom Beauty lately.

651
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:31,550
Where are the goods?

652
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:32,110
Chief,

653
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:33,870
the goods are ready.

654
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:36,990
Have the goods arrived?

655
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:38,850
It's up to you now.

656
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:40,170
Wait.

657
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,390
Since you can grow Zornia,

658
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:48,750
why don't you plant it directly in the capital?

659
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:49,280
No hurry.

660
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:52,330
Wait till I deplete my stock in Tingzhou.

661
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,650
Where is the Zornia field in Tingzhou?

662
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,180
I can help you

663
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,880
make the business in Tingzhou bigger.

664
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,100
You just need to tell me

665
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,560
where the Zornia field is.

666
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:06,830
Listen.

667
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:08,310
Know when

668
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:11,590
to ask questions and when to shut up.

669
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,650
[Guangde Gate]

670
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:28,990
Officer,

671
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:31,670
these are all tributes.

672
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,570
[Tributes]

673
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:34,190
Don't you skip checking tributes in the past?

674
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:35,590
If anything goes wrong,

675
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,230
it'll be hard to explain to the higher-ups.

676
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:38,270
Why don't you let us go?

677
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:39,870
We are just following orders.

678
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:41,070
The Inspection Office has issued a document.

679
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:43,070
Carriages entering the capital must be thoroughly checked.

680
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:43,600
Officer,

681
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:44,390
we...

682
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:45,590
Really...

683
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:47,090
What are you doing?

684
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,270
There are so many people

685
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:49,300
waiting to enter the city.

686
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,760
Why are you blocking here?

687
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:51,750
Besides,

688
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:54,270
what could possibly be wrong

689
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:56,200
with the tributes for the capital?

690
00:33:57,150 --> 00:33:59,220
This is the son of Mr. Yan of the Ministry of Justice.

691
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,420
Why don't we leave it?

692
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:03,670
Alright.

693
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:04,970
Let them go.

694
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:06,920
Thank you, Officer.

695
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:09,650
Come on, guys.

696
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:10,179
Let's go.

697
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:37,429
Chief.

698
00:34:38,469 --> 00:34:39,360
Are you sure

699
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:42,750
you want to use Blossom Beauty to distribute the goods?

700
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:46,630
There's no better option

701
00:34:46,929 --> 00:34:48,170
than Blossom Beauty.

702
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,320
But

703
00:34:50,949 --> 00:34:52,590
Yan Nanxing

704
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:54,070
is Jiang Xinbai's woman.

705
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:58,350
So what?

706
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:02,910
It's a good

707
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:04,820
blindspot.

708
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:06,580
Don't you

709
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:08,500
like Yan Nanxing?

710
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:09,850
How will you

711
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:11,790
explain it to her in the future?

712
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:12,470
Explain?

713
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:15,590
Explain what?

714
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:23,990
Jiang Xinbai wants to eradicate Zornia.

715
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:26,230
If Blossom Beauty is now

716
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:27,510
involved with Zornia,

717
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:29,580
Yan Nanxing and Jiang Xinbai

718
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,930
can’t be together anymore.

719
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:33,990
I understand.

720
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:36,710
This way,

721
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,220
Yan Nanxing will be yours.

722
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:42,020
Brilliant.

723
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:53,850
To think Bai Yuan

724
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:56,950
would use this method

725
00:35:56,970 --> 00:35:58,790
to distribute goods in the capital.

726
00:35:58,790 --> 00:35:59,590
Interesting,

727
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,580
but also detestable.

728
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:09,740
Now that Blossom Beauty is related to Zornia,

729
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,260
Jiang Xinbai will have

730
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:15,470
a hard time investigating things.

731
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:16,720
Even so,

732
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:19,540
if Jiang Xinbai really sacrifices

733
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:22,710
Yan Nanxing for the greater good, what will we do?

734
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:23,270
Father.

735
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:24,830
Isn't there

736
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:26,630
still my and Suoluo's marriage?

737
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:30,310
Only by getting married

738
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:33,760
and becoming one with the Jiang family

739
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:36,150
can our business

740
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:38,750
be truly freed from danger.

741
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:42,190
Anyone who distributes Zornia will be executed.

742
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:44,640
If a noble family distributes Zornia,

743
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,730
its nine extended families will also be executed.

744
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:47,860
Once we get married,

745
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:50,070
I want to see if Jiang Xinbai

746
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:52,840
dares to execute his nine extended families.

747
00:36:59,030 --> 00:36:59,550
Great.

748
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:03,630
I didn't expect Bai's background

749
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:04,690
to be so miserable.

750
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:05,670
So he came to the capital

751
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:06,910
to repay Boss.

752
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:09,310
Don’t be so easily bribed

753
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:10,230
by his words.

754
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,210
That's prejudice.

755
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:14,790
You don't understand a man's heart.

756
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:15,750
Why not?

757
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:16,440
I know...

758
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:16,930
Sai'er.

759
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:26,670
Mr. Shang.

760
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:27,800
You are here too.

761
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,670
Are you purposely

762
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:57,200
avoiding your chancellor?

763
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:01,510
Recently, you came to the shop as soon as school was over

764
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:02,710
and went back only when it was late.

765
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:04,240
I knew something was wrong.

766
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:05,980
What about you?

767
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:08,740
Why are you avoiding Commander Shang?

768
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:12,070
I don’t know.

769
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:14,390
I feel uncomfortable

770
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:15,550
when I see him,

771
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,590
as if a pair of

772
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:18,520
invisible hands

773
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:19,860
are tickling me.

774
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:25,230
Sai'er.

775
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,310
You really don't know

776
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:28,710
what's happening to you?

777
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:35,710
Actually, we are both

778
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:36,860
fooling ourselves.

779
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,690
It's reasonable

780
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:40,930
for me to avoid her.

781
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:42,710
But you have no reason to.

782
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:44,430
Commander Shang is not

783
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:45,960
someone out of your league.

784
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:47,660
You should cherish him.

785
00:38:55,970 --> 00:38:57,150
But I'm just

786
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:58,010
a country girl.

787
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:01,610
I can't compare to those

788
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:04,320
sensible and gentle girls from good families

789
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:05,950
in the capital.

790
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:08,310
The capital is filled with sensible and gentle girls

791
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:09,630
from good families.

792
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:11,000
But Sai'er,

793
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:12,290
you're unique.

794
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:14,990
Ruoqian,

795
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:17,030
you are also unique.

796
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,260
So you don't have to avoid her either.

797
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:48,430
I...

798
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:52,440
You go first.

799
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:55,450
Congratulations.

800
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:56,050
Mr. Shang.

801
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,500
Congratulations?

802
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:00,110
Although Ms. Sai'er

803
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:01,240
is ignoring you now,

804
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:02,060
you both

805
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:03,670
love each other.

806
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:04,550
I believe

807
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,890
she will figure it out sooner or later.

808
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:09,470
I hope so.

809
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:12,010
What about you?

810
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:13,160
What's going on?

811
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,500
Since you like each other,

812
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,680
why don't you fight for it?

813
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,190
There are too many obstacles

814
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:31,520
between me and Ruoqian.

815
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:34,140
Her Majesty personally granted the marriage.

816
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,070
How can I refuse?

817
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:36,790
Besides,

818
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:40,250
if I really want to break off the engagement,

819
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:43,350
even if Her Majesty

820
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:45,910
doesn't mind,

821
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:46,790
what if

822
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:48,430
Yan Biqing

823
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:49,510
hurts Ruoqian?

824
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,910
In the past, when I wanted something,

825
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:56,070
I always tried my best

826
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:56,930
to fight for it.

827
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:58,590
But now,

828
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:01,190
I can't do anything.

829
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:19,670
[Duchess' Mansion]

830
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:26,320
Are you happy today?

831
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:31,230
Do you want to be happier?

832
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:33,150
Yes.

833
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:35,320
Let's go.

834
00:42:08,490 --> 00:42:09,020
Ruoqian.

835
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:11,230
Be brave.

836
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,620
Weren't you just avoiding me yesterday?

837
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:40,550
Why aren't you

838
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:42,840
avoiding me now?

839
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:46,650
I’ve been telling Sai'er to be brave.

840
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:47,800
So,

841
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,640
I don't want to run away anymore.

842
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:51,710
Suoluo.

843
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:55,190
Are you really going to get married?

844
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:58,620
This is Her Majesty's order.

845
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:06,490
I want you to be happy.

846
00:43:07,610 --> 00:43:09,070
I don't want you to suffer.

847
00:43:12,370 --> 00:43:14,170
I know you don't like Yan Biqing.

848
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:15,990
How do you know I don't like him?

849
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:16,740
I just know.

850
00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:19,510
If I don't like him, who do I like?

851
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:20,790
Tell me.

852
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:27,230
Didn't you just say

853
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:28,490
you wouldn't avoid it?

854
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:32,270
Look at me!

855
00:43:54,350 --> 00:43:55,030
Suoluo.

856
00:43:57,570 --> 00:43:58,900
I'm different from him.

857
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:01,940
I won't force you.

858
00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:05,810
I understand your helplessness.

859
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:09,310
I can only blame myself

860
00:44:10,530 --> 00:44:11,350
for being so powerless.
