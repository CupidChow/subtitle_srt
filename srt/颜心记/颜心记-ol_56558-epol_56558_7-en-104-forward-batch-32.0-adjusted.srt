[Episode 7]

4
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:39,840
Since you knew

5
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,199
my identity and motive,

6
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,450
why didn't you expose me earlier?

7
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,330
It wasn't time yet.

8
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:49,820
Gaya!

9
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:51,630
Gaya!

10
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:55,870
Hubby.

11
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:00,829
Gaya.

12
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:02,960
What's going on?

13
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:04,990
I...

14
00:03:07,079 --> 00:03:09,340
Since Her Ladyship doesn't want to talk,

15
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,070
why don't

16
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,550
I start this off?

17
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:14,020
General Nan.

18
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,900
I once asked you why

19
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:18,850
the three clans left you alone even when

20
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,310
the job they paid you for

21
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,230
was undone.

22
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:23,190
The real reason is...

23
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:27,350
your wife acted on your behalf.

24
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:35,770
It's you...

25
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:40,530
who relayed all my deployment plans

26
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:42,950
to the three clans?

27
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:44,420
Yes.

28
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,600
You also leaked the identities and whereabouts

29
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:49,790
of the five men

30
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:52,030
I assigned as spies,

31
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:54,620
such that they

32
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,590
never came back?

33
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:58,190
Yes.

34
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:03,750
Why?

35
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:05,740
Why?

36
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,400
Because I want you to live!

37
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,230
What did I do to deserve this?

38
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,150
Hubby.

39
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:32,550
Jiang Xinbai.

40
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,070
When did you notice

41
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:34,950
Gaya's off?

42
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:39,570
That night,

43
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:41,730
Lieutenant General Li

44
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,710
noticed I've been

45
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:44,240
to your study's secret room

46
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,710
and tried to kill me.

47
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:48,630
He failed

48
00:04:50,029 --> 00:04:51,269
and I brought Mr. Li back

49
00:04:51,269 --> 00:04:52,390
to confront him.

50
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:53,790
So,

51
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,000
Her Ladyship

52
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:56,930
and Lieutenant General Li

53
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:59,420
came up with a sympathy ploy.

54
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:08,010
Hubby, watch out!

55
00:05:12,909 --> 00:05:13,590
Hubby!

56
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:14,750
Hubby!

57
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:21,270
I guess

58
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:22,870
your original plan

59
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,720
was to let Mr. Li

60
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,210
assassinate General Nan.

61
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:27,909
When you take the stab for him,

62
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,190
he can be

63
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:30,350
cleared of

64
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:31,550
suspicions.

65
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,590
But you didn't expect

66
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:35,710
General Nan to take the stab for you.

67
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,280
For a period after that,

68
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:38,590
I really

69
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,230
didn't quite doubt you.

70
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:43,240
Until the three clans were taken down.

71
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:44,360
I always felt

72
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:47,520
they were taken down too fast.

73
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:49,910
But Heman's cartel

74
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:51,570
isn't that simple.

75
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:52,990
So I guess

76
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:55,030
there must be

77
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,410
a mastermind behind them.

78
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:59,750
When they were taken down,

79
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,210
General Nan enacted a nationwide lockdown.

80
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:04,430
No boats were allowed to enter or leave.

81
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:06,230
But at that very moment,

82
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:07,900
you claimed Nanxing and I are fated

83
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,180
to have three marriages

84
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,190
and suggested

85
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,840
to hold a wedding for us.

86
00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:13,310
You wanted to leave Heman

87
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:14,750
on the wedding night.

88
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,400
You wanted to transport

89
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:17,750
Zornia out

90
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,530
with the wedding ship.

91
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:22,190
That's when I knew

92
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:23,920
you

93
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:25,860
were the mastermind.

94
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:30,110
At this point,

95
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:33,750
punish me however you want.

96
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:35,680
Gaya.

97
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,520
Stop being stubborn,

98
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:39,190
okay?

99
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:44,750
Lady Gaya.

100
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:48,230
I let that boat and that man go

101
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,350
on purpose.

102
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,600
Because that boat of Zornia

103
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:54,390
can help me

104
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,980
find its owner.

105
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:58,070
Don't waste your energy.

106
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:00,310
I won't say anything.

107
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,870
There's no turning back for you.

108
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:03,990
Gaya.

109
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,070
I know

110
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,480
you love General Nan very much.

111
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:09,230
Now,

112
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,260
only by helping the Inspection Office

113
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,120
solve this case

114
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:14,590
and find the mastermind...

115
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:16,720
So he works for the Inspection Office.

116
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,840
He never trusted me.

117
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:21,710
He has been lying to me.

118
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:24,230
I'm so stupid.

119
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,290
Apprehend Gaya!

120
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:32,710
Wait!

121
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:36,230
Nan Jifeng.

122
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,080
I don't expect you to punish your family.

123
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,040
But if you try to

124
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:41,750
obstruct our investigation,

125
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,550
I won’t go easy on you.

126
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,730
I'm not trying to stop you.

127
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,800
I want you to detain me too.

128
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:51,790
Hubby.

129
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:52,950
The crime

130
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:54,950
my wife committed...

131
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:58,770
started because of me.

132
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,910
I deserve the same punishment.

133
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:02,590
Hubby.

134
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:03,950
No.

135
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:06,120
Your involvement is separate.

136
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,670
It's not the same crime.

137
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:08,670
Detain me!

138
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:12,840
Let the Ministry of Justice

139
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,690
and His Majesty convict me!

140
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:16,630
No.

141
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,110
No, Hubby.

142
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,110
No.

143
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:20,110
No.

144
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:22,720
I won't forgive you either.

145
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:27,960
But I'll accompany you.

146
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,220
Hubby.

147
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:36,030
Nan Jifeng.

148
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:38,300
Don't be impulsive.

149
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:39,750
I understand

150
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:40,610
your devotion.

151
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,590
But it's your duty

152
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:43,930
to not let down His Majesty

153
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:45,210
and the Heman people.

154
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:48,440
After we've clarified things,

155
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:50,230
we’ll give you an explanation.

156
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,030
Take her away!

157
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:52,790
Hey!

158
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,800
Don't you dare move!

159
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:05,460
Gaya!

160
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,190
Gaya!

161
00:09:09,179 --> 00:09:09,789
Gaya.

162
00:09:10,789 --> 00:09:11,190
Hurry!

163
00:09:11,289 --> 00:09:11,720
Gaya.

164
00:09:11,909 --> 00:09:12,350
Hurry!

165
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:12,840
You...

166
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,240
Hurry.

167
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:14,500
Why are you so silly?

168
00:09:15,289 --> 00:09:16,500
Why are you so silly?

169
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:17,550
Dr. Yan.

170
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,720
Dr. Yan, please save her.

171
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,180
Dr. Yan.

172
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:21,830
I shouldn’t live.

173
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,190
I can't live either.

174
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:25,440
Who said that?

175
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:26,190
You can live.

176
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:26,950
Who said so?

177
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:28,210
You can live, you know?

178
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:28,910
Gaya.

179
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,370
You can live, you know?

180
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,940
I can't be interrogated.

181
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,900
They won't let you go.

182
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:38,190
I want you to live.

183
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:40,630
Only when I die

184
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,550
can you live.

185
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:47,080
Gaya.

186
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:49,950
Why did you do that?

187
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:52,390
Maybe one day,

188
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:55,910
you'd face the same dilemma.

189
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,940
When the person you love the most

190
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:04,390
is pitted against your conscience

191
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:05,190
and faith

192
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:07,510
and you must give one up...

193
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:10,750
Then,

194
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,110
you'd understand me.

195
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,110
That feeling...

196
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,910
like you're in purgatory.

197
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:28,910
Gaya.

198
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:31,430
Gaya.

199
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:33,630
Gaya.

200
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:40,150
Gaya.

201
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:51,230
Gaya.

202
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:13,040
Yan Nanxing.

203
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:15,960
Yan Nanxing!

204
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,160
Where are you going?

205
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:22,960
It's none of your business.

206
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:25,860
Zornia killed many people.

207
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,270
If it continues to spread,

208
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:32,070
more people will die.

209
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,750
I didn't come to Heman

210
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:39,910
as a lone, brave man.

211
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,320
My most trusted brothers

212
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:43,790
are all outside the city

213
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:45,110
waiting for my order.

214
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,820
We have the most thorough arrangements

215
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:47,310
and plans...

216
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:48,600
So you lied to me!

217
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,150
You told me

218
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,230
you trust me,

219
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,550
that we're friends.

220
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:58,310
But you're using me!

221
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,780
You've never experienced my hardship.

222
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:03,710
You don't know

223
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:05,200
I nearly died once.

224
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:06,810
I fought for my life

225
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:09,380
against the Heavens!

226
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,470
I still have

227
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:12,930
many people I've yet to see

228
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:15,390

[Spirit tablet of beloved wife, Gaya]

289
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:51,589
My lord.

290
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:53,829
You don't have to

291
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:55,230
apologize.

292
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:58,790
I know you're not the real

293
00:17:58,790 --> 00:17:59,470
culprit...

294
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:02,250
who killed my wife.

295
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:04,240
She must've killed herself

296
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,830
to protect this major secret,

297
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:06,790
in which...

298
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,290
she couldn't

299
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:11,120
fathom anyone who could

300
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,000
protect me,

301
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,790
so she refused the interrogation

302
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:15,870
in the capital.

303
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:18,640
You also think

304
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:21,510
the culprit is in the capital?

305
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:23,630
Only

306
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,020
the capital

307
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:26,560
can control all channels.

308
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:28,390
For the Zornia epidemic,

309
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:30,670
Heman's just for importing

310
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:32,710
and not the center.

311
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:34,980
Zornia was

312
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,000
on the verge of being totally banned.

313
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:39,070
But recently,

314
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:41,290
it's gaining momentum again.

315
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:43,910
I came to Heman

316
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:46,450
to figure this clue out from the root.

317
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:48,690
But I didn't expect...

318
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:54,710
Lanna Village no longer grows Zornia.

319
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:55,710
Please make arrangements

320
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:57,510
for the villagers' livelihood.

321
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:00,880
You didn't come here

322
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,350
for nothing.

323
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,750
It was risky for that batch of Zornia

324
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:07,470
to enter the capital.

325
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:09,990
A storm must be waiting for you there.

326
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:12,390
My lord.

327
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:14,790
Stay alert.

328
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,140
I've taken care of Lanna Village.

329
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:18,630
Please rest assured.

330
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,230
Young lady!

331
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:50,950
Who are you?

332
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:53,240
Don't come over.

333
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:56,550
Don't be afraid.

334
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:58,350
I am

335
00:19:58,630 --> 00:19:59,630
a good person.

336
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:01,710
Seeing how you're

337
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:03,790
all alone on an arduous trip,

338
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:05,400
I felt sorry for you.

339
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:06,240
I found you

340
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:07,150
a good husband.

341
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:08,040
It's him?

342
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:08,870
I guarantee

343
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:11,150
you'll live a comfortable life.

344
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,840
Just go get married,

345
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,920
so I can earn this money.

346
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:17,830
Or you'll lose

347
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:19,070
your life.

348
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:21,670
Scumbag.

349
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:24,440
Foxes may grow grey but never good.

350
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,720
Sir.

351
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:34,030
Please be kind

352
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:35,630
and let me go.

353
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:38,910
My mother is sick.

354
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,410
I'm on my way to my maiden home.

355
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:43,910
I don't have money with me.

356
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:45,590
But

357
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:48,030
I brought

358
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:50,160
an antique fragrance bottle.

359
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,430
It's quite valuable.

360
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,430
Antique?

361
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:54,870
Hurry up.

362
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:55,950
Take it out.

363
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:57,270
Let me help you

364
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:57,920
appraise

365
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:00,000
if it's more valuable than you.

366
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:03,550
Where is it?

367
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:06,630
No.

368
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,600
It's in this pouch.

369
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:13,110
Yes, that's it.

370
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:17,110
It does look like an antique.

371
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,030
The spices inside

372
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:21,150
are costly.

373
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:22,470
Don't open it.

374
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,930
The smell will fade.

375
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:28,180
If I don't open it,

376
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:30,300
how'd I verify its value?

377
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:36,050
It smells quite...

378
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:54,510
Sis.

379
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:55,880
What's this for?

380
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,390
Let's talk it out.

381
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:59,370
Enemies can't be avoided indeed.

382
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:00,630
To think you'd

383
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:02,750
fall into my hands one day.

384
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:06,270
Please spare me.

385
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:08,670
Have I ever offended you?

386
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:10,100
Fine.

387
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:12,240
I'll let you know why you've to die.

388
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:13,520
15 years ago,

389
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:14,470
you abducted

390
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:15,360
a girl and a boy

391
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,840
in Yazhou.

392
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:18,400
That girl

393
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,710
let him go secretly,

394
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:21,470
so you got angry

395
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:22,750
and

396
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:23,990
sold her to a family.

397
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:25,070
Do you remember this?

398
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:25,830
No!

399
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:26,910
Heroine.

400
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,900
Did you get the wrong person?

401
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:30,080
You don't remember?

402
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:37,750
Heroine.

403
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:39,590
Let me help you

404
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:40,790
jog your memory.

405
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:42,670
Wait!

406
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:43,990
I remember.

407
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:47,870
I think something like this did happen.

408
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:50,750
How did you know about it?

409
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,360
Because I'm that girl.

410
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:53,270
Impossible.

411
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:54,240
Impossible.

412
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:55,310
Cut the crap.

413
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:57,150
Just answer my questions.

414
00:22:57,950 --> 00:22:58,500
Okay.

415
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:00,030
Let me ask you.

416
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:01,430
On the day of the incident,

417
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:02,720
the boy came back

418
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:03,670
and saved me.

419
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:04,960
What happened next?

420
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:07,080
It's been so long.

421
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:08,370
Who can remember that?

422
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,150
Heroine.

423
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:12,110
I need to use the toilet.

424
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:13,710
Why don't you let me down?

425
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:14,840
You don't remember?

426
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:17,470
Yet you still...

427
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:20,670
want to use the toilet.

428
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:21,740
-I remember!
-Remember now?

429
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,190
Y-Y-Yes, I do.

430
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:26,290
Here's what happened.

431
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,490
After finding out you ran away,

432
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:29,590
I chased you down.

433
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:36,970
Stop there!

434
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:37,970
After them!

435
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:40,100
-Brat.
-You stole my stuff!

436
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:42,470
Go!

437
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,570
Don't look back!

438
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:01,430
Watch out.

439
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:09,880
When we arrived,

440
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:11,230
you and him

441
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,020
had already collapsed.

442
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,330
One of them fed you

443
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:23,150
a bottle of medicine.

444
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:26,550
Young Sir.

445
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:28,150
Young Sir!

446
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:34,520
You blacked out from the medicine.

447
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:37,390
Those people

448
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:39,030
also drugged him.

449
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:46,850
Then another group of people came...

450
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:49,350
and chased away the previous group.

451
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:11,780
The second group in official boots

452
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,840
took him away.

453
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:18,600
I thought you were dead,

454
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:21,360
so I ran away to save myself.

455
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,010
Heroine.

456
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:30,390
You're really lucky.

457
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,430
Did you just say

458
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:32,890
they wore official boots?

459
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:33,470
Yes.

460
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:36,050
In my line of business,

461
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:38,200
we're always chased by officials.

462
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:39,670
I still remember

463
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:41,240
the boots' pattern.

464
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:43,190
The pattern's quite special.

465
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:44,630
It looks like a dragon

466
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:46,310
but

467
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:47,510
also not.

468
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:51,190
They seem to be capital officials.

469
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:54,230
Local officials wouldn't dare wear these.

470
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:56,990
Capital officials?

471
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:07,710
Young Sir.

472
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:09,470
I've been seeking

473
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:10,630
your whereabouts,

474
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:12,470
praying you're still alive.

475
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:13,790
Could you've also been infected

476
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:15,650
with such a weird disease like me?

477
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:17,380
Why did all this happen?

478
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:20,820
Only by finding you can it be solved.

479
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:57,020
[Capital]

480
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,360
Your burger.

481
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:11,350
Thank you.

482
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:12,370
Take care.

483
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:13,030
My lord.

484
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:14,640
Come again!

485
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,700
He left so quickly.

486
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:21,870
Yummy.

487
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:23,830
This is the taste of home.

488
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:24,830
Mr. Yao.

489
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,270
Why haven't you been coming for drinks?

490
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:26,910
Ma San.

491
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:28,430
Any good wine?

492
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:29,320
Yes, we've plenty!

493
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,250
I'll visit soon!

494
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:30,790
Okay.

495
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:40,110
My lord.

496
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:44,880
I knew you'd eat here first

497
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:46,200
back in the capital.

498
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:48,030
Have a burger too.

499
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:49,230
Freshly made.

500
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:52,250
My lord.

501
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:54,430
Since Princess sent me to be

502
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:55,910
your personal attendant,

503
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:57,070
this has been

504
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:58,330
the longest work trip.

505
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:00,110
It's been 3 years,

506
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,310
1,095 days,

507
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,400
since I've rested.

508
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:04,310
On my way back,

509
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,150
I did the calculations.

510
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:08,100
For the 159 off days

511
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:10,170
over the last three years,

512
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,780
I've been working overtime with you.

513
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:17,670
Those who've been

514
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:19,450
on this Heman work trip

515
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:21,190
will get triple the salary.

516
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:22,030
You know

517
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:23,470
that's not what I mean.

518
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:25,950
I'm honored to be able

519
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:27,350
to suffer with you.

520
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:30,010
I'm not doing this for myself,

521
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:31,870
but requesting for leave

522
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:32,800
for my comrades.

523
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:34,070
Look.

524
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:35,670
Three years

525
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:37,750
means 159 off days.

526
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:39,750
Let's compromise.

527
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:41,470
How's nine days?

528
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,110
Are you bargaining with me?

529
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:48,760
This case

530
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:50,550
has just begun.

531
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,070
Before the case is solved,

532
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:54,230
all off days

533
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:55,670
will be canceled.

534
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,880
On behalf of my comrades,

535
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:03,190
I'll thank you for the tripled salary.

536
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:05,150
If you know of more great deals like this,

537
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:06,510
please think of us.

538
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:08,070
We'd love to do it.

539
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:09,270
We'd love to do it.

540
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:10,790
Yao Qianshu.

541
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:12,680
Do you think I can't tell

542
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:14,150
you're being sarcastic?

543
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:16,750
How dare I?

544
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:18,110
Catch the thief!

545
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,720
Catch the thief!

546
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:21,230
Over there! Catch him!

547
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:22,510
Get him!

548
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:23,870
What's wrong with you?

549
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:24,510
Watch it!

550
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:25,550
A thief!

551
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:32,830
Nice arrest!

552
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:34,140
My lord.

553
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,010
Constable Yao.

554
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:40,160
Chief Constable Jiang.

555
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:41,310
What?

556
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:43,040
Stealing credit again?

557
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:43,780
Mr. Yao.

558
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:45,520
Catching petty thieves

559
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:47,160
is Jinwu Guards' duty.

560
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:49,540
I don't dare trouble the Inspection Office.

561
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,910
Are you blind?

562
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:53,190
He stole other's things

563
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:54,670
and caused a ruckus.

564
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:57,830
The official punishment for theft is 50 flogs;

565
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:00,200
60 flogs for every penny stolen;

566
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:01,590
crime grade increases per note.

567
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:03,390
Daqi's Theft Act includes

568
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,190
being exiled beyond 1,000 miles

569
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:05,930
and three years of hard labor.

570
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:07,870
Isn't a sentence beyond three years

571
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:10,230
under our jurisdiction?

572
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:11,190
Well...

573
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,960
Rather than stealing credit,

574
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:14,910
why don't you check what was stolen

575
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:16,240
and comfort the people?

576
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:17,990
What are you waiting for?

577
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:20,520
What if he has an accomplice

578
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:22,640
who makes use of this chaos to rob the street?

579
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,430
You want Commander-in-chief Shang

580
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:25,590
to be fired?

581
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:27,750
Well...

582
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:29,580
Go on!

583
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:30,910
Let's go.

584
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:40,550
My lord.

585
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,190
Jinwu Guards

586
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:44,350
are as inept as their leader.

587
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:45,650
Lock this man up

588
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:47,110
in the Inspection Office.

589
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:48,520
Convict him

590
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:49,750
after verifying

591
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:50,990
the victim's losses.

592
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:51,950
Yes.

593
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:53,600
It's been a long day.

594
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:55,190
Go back and rest early.

595
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:58,150
When can I rest?

596
00:30:59,310 --> 00:30:59,860
Take him away.

597
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:00,390
Yes.

598
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:04,920
If you want to rest, eat your burger first.

599
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:49,510
It's still warm.

600
00:31:56,630 --> 00:31:57,350
Wait!

601
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:03,510
Mother.

602
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:05,690
Messing with me again.

603
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:07,950
[Princess of Yuejiang, Jiang Zhiyi]

604
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:08,430
You're so boring.

605
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:10,640
Take it back.

606
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:15,030
Mother.

607
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:17,240
Don't wear a veil next time.

608
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,480
That's true.

609
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:22,280
My son is immensely smart.

610
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:23,890
He doesn't need his vision...

611
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:25,090
to recognize people.

612
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:27,130
Your son's clearly face-blind

613
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:27,850
and can't

614
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,070
recognize people.

615
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:30,350
How's that smart?

616
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:32,270
Who said that?

617
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:34,460
My son is the chief constable

618
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:36,030
who's solved countless cases.

619
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:37,390
Face blindness

620
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:38,870
is no big deal.

621
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:43,830
What happened to you

622
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:44,890
in just two months?

623
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:46,160
You're much thinner

624
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,030
and darker.

625
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:48,160
Where have you been?

626
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:51,070
Heman.

627
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:52,150
Heman?

628
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:56,830
Xinbai.

629
00:32:58,230 --> 00:32:59,490
You know His Majesty's

630
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,220
most wary of non-blood related royals

631
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:02,350
going to the border,

632
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:04,150
in fear of treachery.

633
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:07,070
I know.

634
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:10,130
I went to Heman to investigate a case.

635
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:11,630
What case?

636
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:15,640
There's been a surge in the Zornia epidemic.

637
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:17,430
So I went to check the source.

638
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:21,110
Xinbai.

639
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:23,990
I know

640
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:25,270
what's been

641
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:26,730
weighing your heart down.

642
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:29,090
But you have to understand

643
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:31,210
you're not just your father's son

644
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:33,030
but also my son.

645
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,510
For my sake,

646
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:36,620
prioritize your safety.

647
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:37,640
Got it?

648
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:44,160
Alright.

649
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:45,530
Enough about this.

650
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:46,560
I came to you

651
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:47,450
for something.

652
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,760
Your grandfather’s 70th birthday

653
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:50,710
is in a few days.

654
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,080
Many

655
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:53,350
guests will come.

656
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:54,950
Since you're back,

657
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:56,670
please entertain the guests for your mother

658
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:57,580
and grandfather.

659
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:58,110
Okay?

660
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:00,350
Mother, you know I'm bad at

661
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:01,930
socializing with guests.

662
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:03,710
If I go,

663
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:05,590
I might ruin the atmosphere.

664
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:07,630

665
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:08,910

your absence

669
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:15,270

Commander-in-chief Shang.

684

What's all this

685
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:34,430
first thing in the morning?

686
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:35,070
I heard

687
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:36,790
the petty thief

688

in the Inspection Office.

691

I don't want to bother you,

692
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,780
so I came to pick him up this morning.

693
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:45,660
Such a ruckus

694
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:46,990
to pick up a thief?

695
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:50,760
You've been on leave

might be rusty.

699
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:57,440

700
00:36:58,310 --> 00:36:59,750
to help them warm up.

701
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:03,340
In that case,

702
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:04,750

00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:10,800
Now that

706
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:12,160
your men have warmed up,

707
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:14,710
I'll personally

708
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:17,350
help you warm up.

709
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:32,430
Where have you been

710
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:34,760
the past two months?

711
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:36,630
The Inspection Office

712
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:37,630
works upon orders

713
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:39,910
and report to His Majesty directly.

714
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:41,950
We need not report to others.

715
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:43,550
I'm just concerned

716
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:44,920
if you had a good break.

717
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:47,030
Can't I?

718
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:50,440
Even His Majesty isn't concerned,

719
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:52,490
so don't you worry about it.

720
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:54,990
Don’t pressure me with His Majesty.

721
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:57,580
Does His Majesty know where you went

722
00:37:58,370 --> 00:37:59,380
and what you did?

723
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:01,560
What do you mean?

724
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:03,000
You tried to frame

725
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:04,680
my sworn brother, Nan Jifeng.

726
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:06,510
When you failed,

727
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,910
you forced my sister-in-law to death!

728
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:09,700
Mr. Jiang.

729
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,030
Is this the so-called

730
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:13,180
acting upon orders?

731
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:16,510
Sworn brother?

732
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:29,530
Commander Shang.

733
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,420
Although our departments

734
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:33,080
have always been on bad terms,

735
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:34,190
we've implicitly agreed

736
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:35,650
not to fight with weapons.

737
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,560
If you

738
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:37,950
attack us with weapons,

739
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:39,220
then we

740
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:41,090
will be irreconcilable.
