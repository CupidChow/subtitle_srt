Ruoqian

5
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,270
really overreacted.

6
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,310
I thought I was menstruating.

7
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,310
Turned out, it was just an oil stain.

8
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:10,389
Were you scared just now?

9
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:11,990
Of course.

10
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:14,710
I don't know who I'll become every time.

11
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:16,200
Sometimes I'm an old man,

12
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,280
sometimes a child,

13
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,640
sometimes a man,

14
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:20,329
and sometimes a woman.

15
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:21,710
Of course I'm scared.

16
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:26,870
I didn't expect

17
00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:29,310
you to admit it to me.

18
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,790
I didn't expect

19
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,240
to ask for your help either.

20
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:53,829
It seems that since I met you,

21
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,870
you found me every time

22
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:57,550
I hid away in fear.

23
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:02,910
You also said that

24
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,570
no matter what I become,

25
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:05,950
you would recognize me.

26
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:06,590
Yes.

27
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:07,600
Lies.

28
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,390
But I believed you.

29
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:12,180
Maybe

30
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,870
it's because you don't remember people by their looks.

31
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,180
But it's strange.

32
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:17,950
Sometimes,

33
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,270
I was afraid that you would expose me.

34
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:21,090
Other times,

35
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,180
I hoped that you would expose me.

36
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:24,940
Why so?

37
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,230
Actually...

38
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,030
I want people

39
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:33,810
to see me.

40
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:35,829
Maybe

41
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,310
it's because I'm lonely.

42
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,070
Lonely?

43
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:52,720
I've told you the truth.

44
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,160
When will you tell me the truth?

45
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:01,000
This is your last chance.

46
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,150
We have to be frank with each other

47
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,150
so you can protect me

48
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,010
and vice versa.

49
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:08,050
You can protect me?

50
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,840
You're changing the subject again!

51
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:11,990
You lock

52
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:13,380
your heart away every time

53
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,910
you get the answer you want.

54
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:17,990
Can you tell me

55
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,589
what happened to you

56
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:20,510
for you to

57
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,070
become like this?

58
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:25,280
Well,

59
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:27,640
it's a long and complicated story.

60
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:29,030
Anyway, I came to the capital

61
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:30,060
to find Young Sir

62
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,630
for the answer.

63
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,270
So,

64
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,510
this Young Sir of yours

65
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,110
can shapeshift too?

66
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,560
Maybe.

67
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,800
Maybe he is the only kin

68
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:48,480
of my kind in this world.

69
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,430
If that's the case,

70
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:53,180
have you ever considered that

71
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:53,930
although you cannot

72
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:55,590
control your shapeshifting,

73
00:04:55,909 --> 00:04:57,040
he might be able to?

74
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,220
What do you mean?

75
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:02,990
Think about it.

76
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:05,100
You've been in the capital for so long,

77
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,560
but you haven't found him.

78
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:08,320
Is there a possibility that

79
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:10,690
he is using shapeshifting

80
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:11,870
to avoid you?

81
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,300
Why would he do that?

82
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,590
He doesn't know I'm looking for him.

83
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:17,830
That's the key here.

84
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,650
You've been looking for him.

85
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:21,050
Why didn't he come to you?

86
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,090
How can you assume that?

87
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:24,910
Maybe he has been looking for me too.

88
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:25,630
Maybe he has been looking for me

89
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:26,870
for a long time to no avail.

90
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,390
Why are you saying all of this?

91
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,830
People change.

92
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:31,510

I see.

Are you here to perform?

153

What makes you think

00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:06,280
I'm here to perform?

Isn't it obvious?

How so?

157
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:15,350

00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:42,270
Mr. Li is here to save him.

351
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,790
Letting him go would be favoritism.

352
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:45,810
But if we lock him up,

353
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:47,170
this game will be over.

354
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:58,620
Grandfather!

355
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:01,790
I suffered a lot.

356
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:02,910
He...

357
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:03,390
Shut up!

358
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,260
This kid is ignorant.

359
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:08,790
Thank you for teaching him

360
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,450
a lesson for me, Mr. Jiang.

361
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:11,930
Don't say that, Mr. Lu.

362
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:13,550
We needed

363

Young Master Li's help with some cases.

364
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:18,030
It did inconvenience him.

365
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,010
Now that everything is fine,

366
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:22,290
please take Mr. Li

367
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,870
to rest at home.

368
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:26,010
Thank you, Your Highness.

369
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:26,750
Please.

370
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,430
Grandpa, let me tell you.

371
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,760
I told him in there.

372
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:33,350
I... I'm innocent.

373
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:34,590
Shut up. Stop talking.

374
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:35,590
He kept interrogating me

375
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:36,390
about things.

376
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:38,650

378
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:58,260
Grandfather.

379
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:59,960
Why were you here

380
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,070
with Mr. Li?

381
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:03,380
The Suburb Mansion is quiet and peaceful.

382
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:05,630
It's annoying to live alone there for too long.

383
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:07,360
I was taking a stroll in the city

384
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,230
and ran into Mr. Lu.

385
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:10,000
He said

386
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,560
his grandson

387
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,060
was detained by you.

388
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,040
So,

389
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:16,390
I followed him to have a look.

390
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,990
I see.

391
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:22,780
After so many years,

392
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:26,190
you still want to avenge your father?

393
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:32,620
I just want to fulfill

394
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:34,510
the duty of the Inspection Office

395
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:36,140
and have a clear conscience.

396
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:39,040
If you really want revenge,

397
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:40,200
you should

398
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,850
take revenge on me too.

399
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:44,310
Back then,

400
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,220
I forced

401
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:47,250
your parents to divorce each other.

402
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:50,680
I'm partly to be blamed

403
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:54,380
for your father's death in Yazhou.

404
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:57,580
I dare not.

405
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:58,830
You dare not?

406
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:02,750
Why not?

407
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:05,870
When your father

408
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:07,170
was sent to Yazhou,

409
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,800
you were only five years old.

410
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,710
You insisted on abandoning your grandfather

411
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:11,670
and your mother

412
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:13,510
to follow your father

413
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:15,070
and suffer in Yazhou.

414
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:19,390
No matter how I coaxed, pleaded,

415
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:21,670
or told you that you belonged with the Jiang family,

416
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:22,730
it was useless.

417
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:25,710
Do you know

418
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:27,040
what you said back then?

419
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:31,190
Just one sentence.

420
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,660
That you were Xi Zhaoming's son.

421
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,360
Ever since you left,

422
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,620
your mother cried for a long time.

423
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,600
I couldn't do anything but

424
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,260
cry with her.

425
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:47,470
I also

426
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:49,230
reflected on myself.

427
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:49,830
Was it

428
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,550
all my fault in the end?

429
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:54,270
No.

430
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:57,230

431
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:58,490
you did nothing wrong.

Didn't I know that

00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,860
your father was wronged

434

for the Zornia case?

His Majesty was wary of us.

438
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,180
How could I possibly defend him?

439
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:13,190
Yes.

440
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:16,750
Grandfather,

441
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:18,630

the safety and honor of the Jiang family.

443
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:24,420

444
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,590

Chancellor,

497

in my opinion,

498
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,930
the admission qualification of the Imperial Academy

499
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:56,860
was only limited to the officials.

500

After that, the opportunity was extended to the rich families.

501

Now, even poor individuals may be admitted.

502
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:04,130
Although His Majesty meant well,

503
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:05,000
should we not

possibly teach us?

507

Since His Majesty allowed

508
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:14,690
the admission of poor students

509
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:17,080

Why are you back so soon?

524
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,470
Because I missed you dearly, Suoluo.

525
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:58,290
That's why I ended my trip ahead of time

526
00:28:58,290 --> 00:28:59,750
and rushed back to see you.

527
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:03,110
This is the Imperial Academy.

528
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:03,710
Don't say such

529
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:04,710
unfitting words.

530
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:08,470
Just now,

531
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:10,330
I shouldn't have questioned

532
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:12,260
your authority in front of others.

533
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:13,330
Don't be angry.

534
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:15,190
I'm angry

535
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:17,140
because of your societal prejudice.

536
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:19,200
Since you have a societal prejudice,

537
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:21,030
do you have

538
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,060
gender prejudice as well?

539
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:24,600
Do you respect me

540
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:26,030
as the chancellor or not?

541
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:28,240
You misunderstood me, Suoluo.

542
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,410
I've always been proud of you,

543
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:30,400
you know that.

544
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:34,230
Alright.

545
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:35,950
Let's not talk about

546
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:37,410
those irrelevant things.

547
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:39,910
I'm here

548
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:41,430
to ask you

549
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:44,460
when would be a good time

550
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:47,260
to inform the elders

551
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,480
about our agreement?

552
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:58,090
Now's not the time yet.

553
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,270
Okay.

554
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:04,410
I'll listen to you.

555
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:11,750
Just remember and understand that

556
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:14,920
I can help you.

557
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:18,330
So you have to be on my side.

558
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:20,190
Boss, Ruoqian!

559
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:21,730
I'm going to deliver the goods!

560
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:22,250
Sai'er.

561
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:23,770
Sai'er!

562
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,500
Don’t get lost again!

563
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,390
I won't!

564
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:28,420
[Blossom Beauty]

565
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:32,910
I can finally go back and eat something delicious.

566
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:28,030
It’s her.

567
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:33,750
Commander Shang.

568
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:35,370
Why is it so hard to find

569
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:36,570
my way in the capital?

570
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:37,780
I get lost every time.

571
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:39,830
The capital has many streets and alleys,

572
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:41,230
not to mention two markets and hundreds of shops.

573
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:42,560
It’s normal to get lost.

574
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,710
By the way, Commander Shang,

575
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,960
have you figured out how

576
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,890
to use the three peach wood pieces?

577
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:50,180
Are you serious?

578
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:52,270
I'm serious.

579
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:58,960
Have you found your fiance?

580
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,880
I almost forgot about that.

581
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:04,690
Blossom Beauty's business is booming.

582
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:06,490
I'm too busy to do anything else.

583
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:07,550
Besides,

584
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:08,670
I don't know

585
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:10,000
where to start looking.

586
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:12,550
You should get started soon.

587
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:16,660
It's not a good idea

588
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:18,820
to keep working at Blossom Beauty.

589
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:19,550
Why can't I just

590
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:21,350
keep working at Blossom Beauty?

591
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:23,500
Because...

592
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:27,620
Because you can't forget your purpose.

593
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,920
You came to the capital to look for someone,

594
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,520
not to work for someone else.

595
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:33,230
Anyway,

596
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:35,550
staying with Blossom Beauty

597
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,360
is not a long-term solution.

598
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,640
Why not?

599
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:43,630
Because you have to get married eventually.

600
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:44,450
Even so, I can still

601
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:46,520
work at Blossom Beauty after marriage.

602
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,430
What if your future husband

603
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:48,270
disagrees?

604
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,060
Then I won’t marry him.

605
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,060
I want to be with Boss forever.

606
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:54,010
Boss?

607
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:57,370
Yan Nanxing is that important

608
00:32:57,790 --> 00:32:58,550
to you?

609
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:02,380
Commander Shang.

610
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,510
Do you have a family?

611
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:04,350
Family?

612
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:08,790
I don't have one.

613
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,240
So, Boss is my family.

614
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:11,670
And I’m happy

615
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:12,430
with her.

616
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:15,530
Commander Shang.

617
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:16,070
I’m here.

618
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:17,340
Thank you.

619
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:19,760
Here.

620
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:22,510
If you get lost again,

621
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,460
find the Jinwu Guards.

622
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,790
They will send you back.

623
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:26,110
Okay, I got it.

624
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:26,920
I’m leaving.

625
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:34,950
Commander Shang.

626
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:37,700
Remember the peach wood pieces.

627
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,760
Tell me when you've made up your mind.

628
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:49,750
I've heard about the minor mishap

629
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:51,450
at the public banquet.

630
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:56,910
Let's

631
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:58,480
forget about that matter.

632
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:00,210
Otherwise, it might affect

633
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:02,540
the duke's relationship with his family.

634
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:04,910
I think we better not make a fuss about it.

635
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:06,510
If His Majesty hears about it,

636
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:08,510
our loss will be more than our gains.

637
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:11,630
That lady must be

638
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:12,670
unpresentable.

639
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:14,590
That's why my son

640
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:15,989
didn't tell me about her.

641
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:17,469
Maybe your son

642
00:34:17,469 --> 00:34:18,929
isn't good enough for her.

643
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:25,800
Greetings, Mother.

644
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:28,670
Ms. Yan, you're here too.

645
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:32,060
Son,

646
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:35,510
I won't beat around the bush.

647
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:37,190
Let me ask you.

648
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,550
Are you secretly married?

649
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:46,360
Yes.

650
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:48,810
However,

651
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,179
I've divorced her.

652
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:56,949
Why?

653
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:58,830
It's complicated.

654
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:01,830
I can only say that

655
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:05,690
we were not fated to grow old together.

656
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:08,090
Still, I look back on our encounter fondly.

657
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:14,510
So

658
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:16,210
you don't plan to

659
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:17,340
reconcile with her?

660
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:23,960
My life is unpredictable.

661
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:25,270
I don't know

662
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:28,000
if I'm suitable for her.

663
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:34,070
No.

664
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:35,190
I mean

665
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,280
whether I'm suitable

666
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:38,470
for any woman

667
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:40,330
who wants to live a peaceful life.

668
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:48,850
So you left her

669
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:50,070
to protect her.

670
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:51,710
In that case,

671
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:53,130
just forget about it.

672
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:14,090
Your Grace.

673
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:18,120
This voice is not familiar.

674
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:20,350
But he calls me your grace

675
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:21,590
instead of Mr. Jiang.

676
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:24,110
Then he's not a colleague of the imperial court.

677
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:24,970
Who could it be?

678
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:27,290
Where have I met him before?

679
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:34,270
Do you not recognize me?

680
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,370
A junior, maybe?

681
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,540
He's dressed as a scholar.

682
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:41,520
Is he the student of a minister?

683
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:46,030
You are indeed so busy

684
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:48,660
that you don't remember me anymore.

685
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,390
Greetings, I am Yan Nanxing from Blossom Beauty.

686
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:56,070
It's my first time seeing you.

687
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,800
How should I address you?

688
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:00,100
I'm Yan Biqing.

689
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:01,750
So you are Ms. Yan.

690
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:03,870
As soon as I returned to the capital,

691
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:04,820
your respectable name

692
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:06,080
was heard everywhere.

693
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,140
Seeing you today,

694
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:10,070
you're indeed as charming as they say.

695
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:11,790
You're too kind.

696
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:15,820
Mr. Yan, I see you have returned to the capital.

697
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:19,270
Your Grace, you still remember me?

698
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:20,340
I thought

699
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,260
you had completely forgotten me.

700
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:23,670
Of course not.

701
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,660
Back in the State of Miluo,

702
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:27,860
you took great care of my sister

703
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:28,700
Suoluo.

704
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:31,120
I heard that you are currently

705
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,980
working at the Imperial Academy.

706
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:33,910
Yes.

707
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:35,950
The semester just started at the Imperial Academy.

708
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:37,270
There are too many things to be done.

709
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:38,740
Today, under my father's order,

710
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:40,940
I'm here to pay respect to Her Highness.

711
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:43,660
How very polite of you.

712
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,200
I heard that you have some

713
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:51,030
disagreements with Her Grace.

714
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:54,040
Although I work at the Imperial Academy,

715
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,120
I wish to be friends with you.

716
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:57,830
I hope you won't

717
00:37:58,050 --> 00:37:59,650
hold any grudges against me.

718
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:04,430
Next time,

719
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:05,720
I'll pay a visit to you.

720
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:37,270
Well...

721
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:40,130
I've reached my place.

722
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:48,470
If there's nothing else,

723
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:49,670
go back.

724
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:51,800
Yan Nanxing,

725
00:38:57,310 --> 00:38:58,840
I have something to ask you.

726
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:13,260
Just now in front of Yan Biqing,

727
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:17,370
why didn't you take the chance to make things worse for me?

728
00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:18,940
I'm not as bad as you think.

729
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:21,150
Although I can't cure you,

730
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:24,110
I don't want to see you suffer either.

731
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:30,200
You won't understand anyway.

732
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,870
Your life

733
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:34,310
is only filled with doubt and distrust.

734
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:38,800
Last time, you said

735
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:40,980
if I weren't honest with you,

736
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:43,280
I'd lose my chance to be protected.

737
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:45,380
Do I still have this chance?

738
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:48,290
You want me to protect you?

739
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:51,030
I hope

740
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:53,090
we can protect each other.

741
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,880
You just protected me.

742
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:56,950
Now,

743
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:58,500
it's my turn.

744
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:07,400
Tell me then.

745
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:09,750
How do you want to protect me?

746
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:12,830
As you said,

747
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:16,110
my lifestyle is to doubt people.

748
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:17,310
So,

749
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:20,830
let me witness

750
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:23,080
your shapeshifting process.

751
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:24,440
This way, I'll know

752
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:26,270
how to protect you.

753
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:31,530
Seeing is believing.

754
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:35,870
But I mostly shapeshift

755
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,230
at night.

756
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:39,680
Sometimes, it happens in my sleep.

757
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:42,470
How will you witness it?

758
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:46,670
♫Sit with you at night and listen to the wind♫

759
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:50,100
♫When the wind flutters, the heart does too♫

760
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:53,720
♫Step by step, no words are spoken♫

761
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:57,690
♫Barged into sight♫

762
00:40:55,210 --> 00:40:56,450
Then sleep with me.

763
00:40:57,990 --> 00:41:01,160
♫When did your figure grow hazy?♫

764
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:04,810
♫And how clear is it?♫

765
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:05,320
Let me trust you for sure.

766
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,560
♫I don't intend to break your heart♫

767
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:10,790
♫Silently fall into my arms♫

768
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:14,350
♫The world is ever-changing♫

769
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:15,960
♫We still remember♫

770
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:17,110
♫To be the stars♫

771
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:19,030
♫That light up each other's worlds♫

772
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:21,240
♫Don’t fear the night as dark as ink♫

773
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,120
♫Just take up your pen and sketch♫

774
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:26,440
♫You and I, recognizing each other with our hearts♫

775
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:28,680
♫Waiting for you in the blooming splendor♫

776
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:30,290
♫To pick the colors of spring for me♫

777
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:30,950
♫Waiting for the starry sky♫

778
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:33,390
♫To offer your dreams to me♫

779
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:36,200
♫I invite you♫

780
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:37,950
♫To hold a place in my heart♫

781
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:40,200
♫Stay together forever♫
