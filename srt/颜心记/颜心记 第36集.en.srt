Mr. Yan.

You asked me here...

Second Boss.

Do you know

8
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,650
Chief Bai has been targeted

9
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:01,110
by the Inspection Office?

10
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:01,950
Yes.

11
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:03,510
But...

12
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,190
considering what Chief Bai is capable of,

13
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:06,480
they won't have anything on him.

14
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,810
But I can't find him now.

15
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:09,380
If something happens,

16
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,580
what about the goods?

17

When the situation gets better,

18

I will continue to deliver the goods.

I can't wait any longer.

20
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:19,640
Second Boss,

21
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:21,870
I want you to deliver the goods now.

22
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:22,990
Now?

23
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,590
The Inspection Office is keeping a close eye on us.

24
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,110
As long as the goods are not in your hands,

25

they won't be able to find

any evidence against you.

27
00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:30,280
If the goods are in your hands,

28
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,410
once they find them,

29
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,280
you'll be caught red-handed.

Now the Inspection Office

31

hasn't started to investigate you.

32

If there are any more delays,

33
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:44,910
it'll be more dangerous.

Okay.

37
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:55,130
Since Baiyuan Gang

38
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:57,070
agreed to cooperate with you,

39
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:58,590
we'll get it done.

40
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:01,110
Since it's not convenient for Chief Bai to do it,

41
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:01,710
I'll do it.

185
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,390
Who is disturbing the peace?

186
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,110
Isn't this Mr. Yan,

187
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:11,390
Assistant Minister of Justice?

188
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:12,230
Mr. Shang,

189
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:15,750
do you also want to cover for the criminals?

190
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:16,790
What did you say?

191
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,670
I don't understand.

192
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:21,150
I was on patrol.

193
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:24,310
I saw men of the Ministry of Justice

194
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:27,230
and the Inspection Office fighting on the street.

195
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:28,430
Mr. Yan, if you

196
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:30,090
don't give me an explanation,

197
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:32,030
I will take all of you away.

198
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,270
Explanation?

199
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,480
The Ministry of Justice can give you one.

200
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:38,830
But I'm not sure

201
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:41,110
if you can afford the consequences.

202
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:44,390
I'll be waiting.

203
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:00,870
Yan Jinglun, if what you said is true,

204
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:03,270
I order you to go to Yuejiang's Residence

205
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:05,480
with the Ministry of Defense's garrison immediately

206
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,750
to arrest them.

207
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:14,960
How dare you!

208
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:17,630
This is Yuejiang's Residence.

209
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:18,350
You can't

210
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,270
act rudely here.

211
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:21,190
The duchess of Yuejiang's Residence

212
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:22,650
has profited from Zornia.

213
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,620
Jiang Xinbai, Duke of Yuejiang,

214
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,020
covered for the criminal

215
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,300
and ran away.

216
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:30,940
The Jiang family can't get away with it.

217
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:32,960
Arrest them!

218
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:33,810
-Yes.
-Yes.

219
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:34,260
Wait.

220
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,990
You want to arrest us. Do you have any evidence

221
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:37,790
or witness?

222
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:39,770
You don't have any.

223
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:41,110
I'd like to see who dares to touch us!

224
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:42,370
This matter is urgent.

225
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:44,120
I'll arrest you first!

226
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:44,670
Come on!

227
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:48,870
If you want to be the first to die, come forward!

228
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:50,630
Arrest them! What are you waiting for?

229
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:51,310
Wait!

230
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:56,460
Mr. Yan,

231
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:58,000
Mr. Pei said

232
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,550
before the case is thoroughly investigated,

233
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:01,540
just seal Yuejiang's Residence temporarily.

234
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,240
They don't have to be put in prison.

235
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,080
This is also

236
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:06,800
what His Majesty means.

237
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:15,620
Keep an eye on them.

238
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,230
Please tell Mr. Pei

239
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:25,670
the Jiang family

240
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:27,470
is very grateful to him.

241
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:29,390
Okay.

242
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,790
Yan Nanxing has something to do with the Zornia case?

243
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:47,790
It's impossible.

244
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:50,840
There must be some misunderstanding.

245
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:53,030
But Xinbai has always been stable.

246
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:54,670
Why did he run away

247
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:57,830
instead of explaining?

248
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:00,550
That must be because

249
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,810
he couldn't explain clearly.

250
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:04,030
Suoluo,

251
00:17:04,869 --> 00:17:06,030
how did you know?

252
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:10,390
Yan Nanxing was poisoned with Zornia.

253
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:14,270
Really?

254
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:18,349
Poor girl.

255
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:22,030
She can even shapeshift.

256
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:25,190
She can even shapeshift.

257
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:32,800
Shapeshift?

258
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:35,430
What does it mean?

259
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,450
Shapeshift into what?

260
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:38,550
Mother,

261
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:40,150
I know it must be hard for you

262
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:42,010
to accept this for the time being.

263
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:43,470
But I believe

264
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:44,970
Yan Nanxing would never

265
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:46,770
have anything to do with Zornia.

266
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:48,990
Xinbai

267
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:51,230
took her away in front of everyone.

268
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:53,030
It must be because he was worried

269
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:55,270
she might shapeshift in front of them.

270
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:57,910
The Zornia poison

271
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:00,150
can make people shapeshift?

272
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:01,490
Shapeshift into what?

273
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:03,790
Shapeshifting is not a big deal.

274
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:05,470
I'm worried

275
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,150
the Yan family will frame us.

276
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:12,710
That's why Yan Jinglun

277
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:13,790
couldn't wait

278
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,220
to put us in prison today.

279
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,240
It must be like this.

280
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,200
The Yan family committed a crime?

281
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:20,790
Nanxing can shapeshift?

282
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:23,790
I can't believe this!

283
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:24,640
What else

284
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,680
are you two

285
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:26,310
hiding from me?

286
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:28,510
Just tell me everything in one go, okay?

287
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:31,510
Yan Nanxing, it's your fault again.

288
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:36,560
[Prison of the Ministry of Justice]

289
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:00,630
I can't believe Bai Yuan.

290
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:02,160
Ms. Yan treated him so well.

291
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:04,430
He actually used Blossom Beauty

292
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:05,360
to frame Ms. Yan.

293
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:22,470
Mr. Shang, thank you for what you did before.

294
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:23,190
Go ahead.

295
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:23,990
I'll stay here.

296
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:25,590
But you have to make it quick.

297
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:27,870
Thank you.

298
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:37,110
Sai'er.

299
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:38,500
Ruoqian.

300
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:41,830
Mr. Shang.

301
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:42,700
Shang.

302
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:45,150
Where is Ms. Yan? Where is Mr. Jiang?

303
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:45,950
Are they okay?

304
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:46,920
Don't worry.

305
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,630
Jiang Xinbai will definitely come up

306
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:49,690
with a perfect plan

307
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:53,030
before he comes back to the capital to solve the problems.

308
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,270
I already told them to take care of you.

309
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:55,910
You...

310
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:57,660
are safe for the time being.

311
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:00,150
The Jiang family has been implicated

312
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:01,590
because Mr. Jiang left.

313
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:03,450
Then Suoluo...

314
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:05,650
Yuejiang's Residence has been sealed.

315
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,510
Suoluo and the others...

316
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,270
have been grounded.

317
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:11,950
Suoluo is in trouble,

318
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:13,830
but I can't be with her.

319
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:16,270
Ruoqian,

320
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,070
you're just

321
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:19,420
an employee of Blossom Beauty.

322
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,020
You're not deeply involved.

323
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,550
But if you're involved

324
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:23,810
with the Jiang family,

325
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:27,220
you could die.

326
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,930
As long as I can be with Suoluo,

327
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:31,400
I'm not afraid of death.

328
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,390
I'll tell her that you're worried about her.

329
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:35,070
Maybe...

330
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,380
I can help you meet each other.

331
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,150
Thank you, Mr. Shang.

332
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:46,070
Sai'er.

333
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:47,200
Shang.

334
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:49,320
Don't worry.

335
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:51,270
I will get you out of here.

336
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:54,870
Shang.

337
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,430
What on earth happened outside?

338
00:20:58,550 --> 00:20:59,570
I'm very worried about Ms. Yan

339
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:00,370
and Mr. Jiang.

340
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:01,670
Now they are

341
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:02,800
wanted by the court.

342
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:04,270
I guess

343
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:07,180
they're also in a difficult situation.

344
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:07,940
Shang,

345
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:09,560
please do me a favor.

346
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:11,030
If they come back,

347
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,260
you must help them.

348
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:14,080
Don't worry.

349
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:15,980
Even if I can no longer

350
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,510
be a member of Jinwu Guards,

351
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:19,030
I will protect them

352
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:21,750
and you.

353
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:32,220
[Jinwu Guards]

354
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:33,150
Move.

355
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,430
Go inside!

356
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:48,830
Shang Bieli,

357
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:51,090
you transferred me

358
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:53,550
from the Inspection Office to Jinwu Guards.

359
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:54,230
What?

360
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:56,760
Did something happen to Jiang Xinbai?

361
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,790
You colluded with Yan Biqing

362
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:00,830
to frame Blossom Beauty.

363
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:02,470
Yan Biqing?

364
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,250
I don't know him.

365
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:11,110
Tell me!

366
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:13,730
How did the Yan family help you secretly?

367
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:15,590
The Yan family?

368
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:16,590
Which Yan family?

369
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:19,280
Yan Nanxing, right?

370
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:21,150
You should ask her.

371
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:28,030
Guards.

372
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:37,450
You're stubborn, aren't you?

373
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,350
I'd like to see

374
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:42,200
how stubborn you are.

375
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:43,590
Okay.

376
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:45,230
Tie him up.

377
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:45,950
Yes!

378
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:47,210
Use the torture rack.

379
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:48,630
-Move!
-Move!

380
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:50,870
Let go!

381
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:51,440
Move!

382
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:51,770
Move!

383
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:01,590
Xinbai,

384
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:03,470
my house is right ahead.

385
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:06,070
Don't worry.

386
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:07,460
My house is very hidden.

387
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,750
They can't find it.

388
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,870
Are you okay?

389
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:18,270
Don't worry. I'm fine.

390
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:20,270
But you

391
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:22,650
must have been terrified.

392
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:30,000
Yan Nanxing,

393
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:31,790
don't blame yourself

394
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,860
for what happened to Bai Yuan.

395
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:37,050
The culprits are Yan Jinglun and Yan Biqing.

396
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:39,150
It has nothing to do with you.

397
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:40,750
But after all,

398
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:41,990
he died in front of me.

399
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:45,070
Then pull yourself together

400
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:47,570
and make the most of every day.

401
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:51,670
At least,

402
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:54,070
Bai Yuan had learned to look forward

403
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:55,260
before he died.

404
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:58,270
So your acquaintance

405
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:00,560
with him is not for nothing.

406
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:07,310
Xinbai,

407
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:09,310
promise me.

408
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:12,670
Yan Jinglun and Yan Biqing should be arrested.

409
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:13,590
But promise me

410
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:14,610
you will be fine.

411
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:19,870
I promise you.

412
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:37,870
This is my house.

413
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:38,510
Come in.

414
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,540
Mother?

415
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:51,070
Mother.

416
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:01,270
Mother!

417
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:03,870
Mother!

418
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:06,590
Mother!

419
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,000
Mother!

420
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,900
Why are you back?

421
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:30,830
Enough.

422
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:34,020
Why are you crying?

423
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:35,550
It's all my fault.

424
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:38,550
I was so careless.

425
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:41,050
I didn't realize it until now.

426
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:44,470
Stop crying.

427
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:47,030
Smile.

428
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:50,520
It's not your fault.

429
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:54,470
It's my fault.

430
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:57,070
I tried the medicine and fainted.

431
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:58,110
Stop crying.

432
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:00,260
I'll be angry if you don't stop crying.

433
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:02,150
Is it worth

434
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:04,130
compromising your health

435
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:06,410
just to test the medicine?

436
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:08,550
Yes.

437
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,370
As long as you are safe,

438
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:13,550
everything is worthwhile.

439
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:15,830
Stop crying.

440
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:20,270
What?

441
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:21,830
Wine.

442
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:24,630
No.

443
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,790
Fine. I'll give you.

444
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:31,440
You can't drink it before you recover.

445
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:37,760
What should I drink?

446
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:39,220
It's empty.

447
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:44,450
What are you doing? Lie down.

448
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,450
These days,

449
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:47,700
I made

450
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:48,970
some progress.

451
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:55,070
I developed

452
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:57,910
a new medicine recently.

453
00:26:59,070 --> 00:26:59,740
But

454
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:02,080
I still need a medicinal usher.

455
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:04,590
Next,

456
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:06,270
you have to

457
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:09,080
find the medicinal usher on your own.

458
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:10,830
What are you talking about?

459
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:11,630
I don't agree.

460
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:14,110
I don't know how to develop the medicine.

461
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,470
Since you've developed it for me,

462
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:17,470
you have to finish what you started.

463
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,580
No doctors would leave their patients behind

464
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:20,350
in the middle

465
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:21,830
of the treatment.

466
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:23,180
I don't agree.

467
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:24,590
You have to find

468
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:27,190
the last ingredient you need yourself.

469
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:29,480
Look at

470
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:32,190
you.

471
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:34,750
No more crap.

472
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:35,750
Fine.

473
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:39,360
I'm going to get some sleep.

474
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:40,430
I'll find it for you

475
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:41,710
when I wake up.

476
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:43,790
Alright.

477
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:45,110
Stop talking.

478
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:47,290
Get some sleep.

479
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:21,940
My lord,

480
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,470
looks like Phantom Physician's condition

481
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:25,950
is worse than it appears.

482
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:32,850
My lord, what's wrong?

483
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:45,950
Looks like the deterioration of my five senses

484
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,240
is getting worse.

485
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:49,640
Did you go to Mr. Wen?

486
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:55,870
My condition

487
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:58,080
is beyond recovery.

488
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:01,890
My lord, what's your plan?

489
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:05,990
I planned

490
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:07,920
to go back to the capital

491
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,810
after taking Yan Nanxing here.

492
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:10,790
But now,

493
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:13,310
Phantom Physician is seriously ill.

494
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:14,710
I can't let her stay here

495
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:15,310
alone.

496
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:19,310
Looks like

497
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:21,870
we can only stay for a few more days.

498
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:23,790
My lord,

499
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:24,990
when do you plan

500
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:26,050
to tell Her Ladyship about the deterioration

501
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:27,180
of your five senses?

502
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:05,630
Ruoqian.

503
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:10,910
Mr. Shang.

504
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:12,870
Suoluo.

505
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:14,390
You guys talk.

506
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:15,580
I'm going to Sai'er.

507
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:17,990
Thank you, Shang.

508
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:21,670
Suoluo.

509
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:22,990
Suoluo.

510
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,640
Yuejiang's Residence has been sealed, right?

511
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,600
You snuck out

512
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:29,430
and came here.

513
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:30,910
Will you be in danger?

514
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:33,130
The Jiang family

515
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:34,910
is under Mr. Pei's protection now.

516
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:36,390
Everything is fine for now.

517
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:37,070
I came here

518
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:38,390
under Shang's protection.

519
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:39,030
It's safe.

520
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,630
I took good care

521
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:41,960
of your parents for you.

522
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:43,240
Don't worry.

523
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:02,600
I've been waiting for your letter.

524
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:04,990
For a few nights,

525
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:06,520
I dreamt

526
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:07,810
that you came to see me.

527
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,260
I didn't expect

528
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,580
this dream has come true.

529
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:16,510
I should have

530
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:18,070
listened to Yan Nanxing.

531
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:19,720
I should have let you go.

532
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:21,550
No.

533
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:23,590
Even if I go to Yizhou,

534
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:25,500
I will come back immediately

535
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,030
if I know you're in trouble.

536
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,720
Since you

537
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:31,790
took me back

538
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:34,210
in front of everyone in the capital,

539
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:36,000
you must be responsible for me.

540
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:38,510
Liu Ruoqian,

541
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:39,880
listen carefully.

542
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:41,750
You are mine.

543
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:43,780
I'm also yours.

544
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:51,190
Sai'er.

545
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,600
Shang.

546
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,450
Yo must have suffered here.

547
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:07,390
I'm sorry.

548
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:11,670
You were framed and put in prison,

549
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:15,210
but I can't get you out.

550
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,270
It's okay.

551
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,950
You are the commander-in-chief of Jinwu Guards.

552
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:23,630
You are also my hero.

553
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:25,550
I'm fine.

554
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:26,770
Don't worry about me.

555
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:28,920
Just do

556
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,150
what you need to do.

557
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:33,910
After you catch those bad guys

558
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,680
and clear Mr. Jiang

559
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:37,840
and Ms. Yan's names,

560
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:39,910
I can get out.

561
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:42,000
I understand.

562
00:32:58,390 --> 00:32:58,750
Here.

563
00:32:59,350 --> 00:32:59,880
Is it hot?

564
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:08,010
Be careful. Drink slowly.

565
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:12,240
Enough.

566
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:16,470
Where should Jiang Xinbai

567
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:18,130
and his man sleep tonight?

568
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:20,420
They sleep on the floor outside.

569
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:28,790
You came back in such a hurry this time.

570
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:30,270
Did something happen?

571
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:33,550
Nothing happened.

572
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:35,670
I missed you.

573
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:36,890
I wanted to visit you.

574
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:38,740
Really?

575
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:40,070
Yes.

576
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:43,580
You're coughing again.

577
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:45,070
Don't worry about us.

578
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,380
Get some sleep.

579
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,960
I'll put you to sleep.

580
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:49,000
Come.

581
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:51,900
Just like how you put me to sleep when I was little.

582
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,560
This would make me very happy.

583
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:54,240
Be careful.

584
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:55,970
Be careful.

585
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:06,990
I'm going to

586
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,760
put you to sleep.

587
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:12,070
Close your eyes.

588
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:13,909
Close your eyes.

589
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:29,730
How could this happen?

590
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:31,590
How come my shapeshifting

591
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:33,590
is getting more and more irregular?

592
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:44,430
Xing.

593
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:50,680
Don't drink it.

594
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:53,950
This medicine

595
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:56,920
still needs a medicinal usher.

596
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,110
If you drink it,

597
00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:01,950
maybe you can never regain your original appearance.

598
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:02,630
I failed

599
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,100
to find the medicinal usher.

600
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:06,260
I want you to look at me again.

601
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:10,670
Alright.

602
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:14,220
Stop crying.

603
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:16,510
I watched you grow up.

604
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:20,120
I've long been tired of looking at you.

605
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:24,150
But...

606
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:27,950
I want to be by your side

607
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:31,270
with my true appearance.

608
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:35,560
♫Branches bare as flowers fall off♫

609
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:41,230
♫Akin to how I can't stay in your heart♫

611
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:43,230
I won't mistake you for someone else.

612
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:45,380

immune to all poisons.

617
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:56,750
I can tell it's you when I smell it.

00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:57,550
My lord,

645
00:37:58,230 --> 00:37:59,160
let's eat first.

646
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:03,630
You can have the strength to come up with a plan only after you eat.

647
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:04,830
Should I invite Her Ladyship to come out

648
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:05,760
to eat together?

649
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:09,600
No need for that.

650
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:11,790
Let her spend more time

651
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:12,720
with her mother.

652
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:14,390
Okay.

653
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:16,070
I'll cook something and deliver it

654
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:16,800
to her later.

655
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,560
Who... Who are you?

656
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:48,910
Xinbai.

657
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:50,710
It's me.

658
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:55,710
Yan Nanxing.

659
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:57,390
It's you.

660
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:00,510
Wait.

661
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:02,590
The...

662
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:05,550
clothes and hairstyle are the same.

663
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:08,600
The disguise spell?

664
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,990
She's not disguising herself.

665
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:12,270
She just...

666
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:13,930
shapeshifted.

667
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:16,430
Shapeshifted?

668
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:19,070
How is this possible?

669
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:22,760
Yan Biqing did this.

670
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:25,390
Yan Biqing?

671
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:28,750
This is

672
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:30,710
what happened.

673
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:35,310
Well, my lord,

674
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:36,870
I still can't understand.

675
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:38,880
I'm going to think about it.

676
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:49,750
Xinbai,

677
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:51,230
why did it take you

678
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:51,880
so long

679
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:53,310
to recognize me just now?

680
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:54,410
Is something...

681
00:39:54,410 --> 00:39:55,730
wrong with you?

682
00:39:56,910 --> 00:39:57,990
But I don't think

683
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,860
there's anything wrong with your pulse.

684
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:05,310
Nanxing,

685
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:06,960
you're a doctor.

686
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:08,490
Since you said there's nothing wrong

687
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:09,290
with my pulse,

688
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:11,120
there's nothing wrong.

689
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:12,990
Xinbai,

690
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:15,320
you can't hide anything

691
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:16,350
from me.

692
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:18,030
Alright.

693
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:19,790
Don't worry.

694
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:21,750
I'm really fine.

695
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:32,800
Mr. Pei,

696
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:35,350
it's such a good opportunity.

697
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:36,070
Why don't we

698
00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:37,420
defeat the Jiang family

699
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:40,280
and make them unable to make a comeback again?

700
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:47,380
It won't be too late to catch them all

701
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:49,180
after we lure Jiang Xinbai back.

702
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:54,590
You're right, Mr. Pei.

703
00:40:56,270 --> 00:40:57,330
It was so dangerous

704
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,130
in Yazhou back then.

705
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:01,090
Jiang Xinbai still survived.

706
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:02,230
So,

707
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,410
he is much luckier than his father.

708
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:10,270
Now he's at large.

709
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:11,550
Maybe

710
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,590
he'll cause more trouble.

711
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:18,130
I can't rest assured if I don't see him die

712
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:20,310
with my own eyes.

713
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:26,100
Mr. Pei, I have something to report to you.

714
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:27,230
Go ahead.

715
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:35,310
When we besieged Blossom Beauty that day,

716
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:37,950
I noticed there seems to be something wrong

717
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:40,150
with Jiang Xinbai.

718
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:50,070
Mr. Yan,

719
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:53,390
if so,

720
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:57,790
you should investigate it

721
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:01,350
and find out

722
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,640
what's wrong with Jiang Xinbai.

723
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,200
Let me go.

724
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:14,550
Mr. Wen,

725
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:16,670
you're risking your life

726
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:17,770
for a criminal.

727
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:19,070
Is it worth it?

728
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:22,890
After... After he...

729
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:24,430
What?

730
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,360
Louder.

731
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:27,720
After he came back from Yazhou,

732
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:30,350
he was diagnosed with face blindness.

733
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:31,390
What?

734
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:33,550
Face blindness?

735
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:35,990
That's all?

736
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:38,340
He... He is...

737
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,930
losing his five senses.

738
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:41,950
He's about to become a disabled man.
