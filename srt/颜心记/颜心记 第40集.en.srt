00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:48,910
Be good.

176
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:50,110
Take it.

177
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:52,370
Granny,

178
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,310
I can't take the money.

179
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:57,170
You are here running a stall all by yourself.

180
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,000
You probably

181
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,040
don’t have any family, right?

182
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:04,860
Good boy.

183
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,550
I have

184
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:10,550
a big family.

185
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,630
I have my husband,

186
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:14,820
a sister, a brother,

187
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:16,480
and I also have

188
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,640
a mother-in-law and a father-in-law.

189
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,150
Granny,

190
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:21,190
you're lying.

191
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,430
You're old.

192
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,850
The family members you just mentioned

193
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,230
must all be over a hundred years old by now.

194
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:34,920
Thanks for your kind words.

195
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:36,670
They will surely

196
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:38,070
live to be over a hundred.

197
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:39,270
Granny,

198
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:41,450
you must live to be over a hundred too.

199
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:44,530
Come on.

200
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:40,950
Yan Nanxing,

201
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,020
where on earth are you?

202
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:53,810
Kid,

203
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,330
this pastry is spoiled.

204
00:12:58,590 --> 00:12:59,000
Here.

205
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:00,880
Go buy some more.

206
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:09,640
Yan Nanxing?

207
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:12,030
Brother,

208
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:13,430
what are you doing?

209
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:14,550
Kid,

210
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:16,150
who taught you

211
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:17,190
this gesture?

212
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:19,250
The granny up ahead

213
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,450
who gave me free treatment taught me it.

214
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:25,390
Thank you.

215
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:35,620
Yan Nanxing!

216
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:36,970
Drink more water.

217
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:38,030
What are you doing?

218
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:22,640
Yan Nanxing.

219
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:25,080
Yan Nanxing!

220
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:27,360
Yan Nanxing.

221
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,360
Sir,

222
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:34,820
I think you've mistaken me for someone else.

223
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:35,930
I haven't.

224
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,660
You are Yan Nanxing.

225
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,450
Yan Nanxing!

226
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:49,720
What a coincidence.

227
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,510
The first time we met

228
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:55,510
was in Heman.

229
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:58,630
Now,

230
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,880
I found you in Heman.

231
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,280
This must be Heaven's arrangement.

232
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:20,690
I know what you're worried about.

233
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:23,230
You're afraid

234
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,870
you won't be able to transform back.

235
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,850
But I don't care at all.

236
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,540
We've been through so much together.

237
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,470
No matter how rough the road was,

238
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:43,930
we have walked through it.

239
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,300
I don't want to lose you again.

240
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:56,750
I just want to tell you

241
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,270
that no matter what you become,

242
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,440
I'll be by your side.

243
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:12,950
Don't leave me again.

244
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,430
Let's stay together just like now,

245
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:19,230
okay?

246
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:42,960
I missed you so much.

247
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,150
I missed you so much.

248
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:53,200
I missed you so much too.

249
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:56,140
I really miss you.

250
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:48,670
Alright.

251
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,550
Let's go home together.

252
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,110
Okay.

253
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,070
Let's go home.

254
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:20,670
Yan Nanxing.

255
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,000
You transformed back.

256
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:29,560
I transformed back?

257
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:33,610
I really did!

258
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:38,790
You really did.

259
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,270
♫When the emotions are ignited♫

260
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:47,130
♫Yet scurries away in a hurry♫

261
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:47,990

♫The more you're afraid of it piercing through♫

263

♫The more it plays in your mind♫

265
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:54,390
Is this...

266
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:56,110
♫Look at your longing♫

267
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:59,110
♫Taking turns to light up♫

268
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:58,670
our first meeting?

269

♫I wait expectantly♫

270
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,040
♫There's no room for return♫

♫Let it occupy my mind♫

273
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,260
a reunion.

274

♫I want to keep an image of you♫

275

♫What's confusing me to this extent♫

284
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:32,860
♫And the beginning of everything♫

♫It's because of love♫

286
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:49,570
Mom,

287
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,270
to resolve a problem, one must find the person who started it.

288
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:54,530
I've already found the medicinal usher.

289
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:55,470
Don't worry.

290
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:17,110
Great!

291
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:27,480
Congratulations!

292
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,560
Congratulations!

293
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:37,110
Great!

294
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,510
Great!

295
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,480
Alright.

296
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,270
Alright.

297
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:01,150
Today,

298
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,660
both my grandson and granddaughter

299
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,220
are getting married.

300
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:07,030
Commander Shang,

301
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:08,550
although you are not a descendant

302
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:10,340
of our Jiang family,

303
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:12,860
you, Xinbai, and Suoluo

304
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,510
are as close as siblings.

305
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:17,190
I have long regarded you

306
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,070
as family.

307
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,090
Good!

308
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:23,030
Thank you, Your Majesty.

309
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,660
Thank you, Grandfather!

310
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:30,230
Great!

311
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,880
Great!

312
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:39,870
These children,

313
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:43,120
from their first meeting to becoming a family,

314
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:45,470
have a deep connection

315
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,290
with Ruyi District.

316
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,100
Today, they're getting married

317
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,810
at Ruyi District.

318
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:52,910
It is an honor

319
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,730
for our Jiang family.

320
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:58,610
Thank you, Your Majesty.

321
00:21:59,120 --> 00:21:59,920
Your Majesty,

322
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:01,310
Your Highness,

323
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,430
Mr. Yan,

324
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,440
your presence at our Ruyi District

325
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,660
is our honor.

326
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:08,530
It's an honor!

327
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,230
It's an honor!

328
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:11,830
Stop!

329
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,230
Yes! Stop!

330
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:14,930
Alright, alright.

331
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:15,740
Stop laughing.

332
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:16,870
It's the auspicious hour.

333
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:18,940
The grooms are all eager to see their brides.

334
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,140
I want to see them too.

335
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:21,370
Come on.

336
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,240
Yes.

337
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,560
Wait a moment.

338
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:30,710
If you want to take away the brides,

339
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:31,890
you mustn't rush.

340
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,790
You have to pass our test,

341
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:34,870
right?

342
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:37,160
Yes! That's right!

343
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,470
In these three bridal sedan chairs

344
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,110
are three brides.

345
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:42,950
You three grooms

346
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:44,430
need to find your own bride

347
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:45,470
by watching from afar,

348
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:46,670
without approaching

349
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:48,840
or touching.

350
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,360
If you choose the wrong one,

351
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:53,920
you won't be able to get married.

352
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,710
Yes!

353
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:57,500
Yes!

354
00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:58,750
Yes!

355
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:05,130
Your Highness,

356
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:08,000
today the Duke and the Duchess

357
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:09,850
are both getting married.

358
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:11,230
On such a blessed day,

359
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,790
it won't be good

360
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:15,030
if something goes wrong, right?

361
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:18,510
You guys don't know yet, do you?

362
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:19,510
It was

363
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:21,510
her idea.

364
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:26,910
Let me tell you three.

365
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:29,020
It won't be easy

366
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:30,270
to marry your brides.

367
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:32,110
You three have to pass this test.

368
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,590
Yes!

369
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,930
What are you looking at?

370
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,630
I agree with Zhiyi.

371
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:40,870
You brat,

372
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:42,040
it won't be easy for you

373
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,170
to take away Suoluo.

374
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:47,790
Okay.

375
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,310
I'll go first.

376
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:50,910
Please!

377
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,200
Good for you, Ruoqian.

378
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:56,230
I have faith in you.

379
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:41,070
Suoluo.

380
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:43,960
Do you remember the time

381
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:45,790
when I fell from a tree

382
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:47,830
and fell into your carriage?

383
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:50,910
Today, I'll climb up a tree again

384
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:54,440
and this time I'll fall into your bridal sedan chair.

385
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:56,750
So cool!

386
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:57,700
I'm setting off.

387
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,510
I'm going to climb the tree.

388
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:01,370
Ruoqian.

389
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:03,280
It's so high. Come down.

390
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:04,420
I'm really going!

391
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,910
You don't know any martial arts.

392
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:07,510
What if you fall and get hurt?

393
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:08,720
I'm really going!

394
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,430
Be careful!

395
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,310
-Don't stop me!
-Ruoqian, you climbed too high.

396
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:11,920
It's dangerous!

397
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,120
I climbed up the tree!

398
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:13,970
Liu Ruoqian!

399
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:14,370
I...

400
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:17,080
Liu Ruoqian!

401
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:18,010
Don't you jump!

402
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:20,910
He is not in the tree.

403
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:22,480
He's here!

404
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,070
Go over there!

405
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:31,210
Congratulations!

406
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:32,310
Congratulations!

407
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:33,370
Congratulations!

408
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:34,440
Congratulations!

409
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:38,930
Suoluo,

410
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:41,050
you look so beautiful today.

411
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:45,830
If...

412
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,670
If I hadn't come out just now,

413
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:50,020
would you really have jumped down?

414
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,290
As long as I can find you,

415
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,390
I'm willing to do anything.

416
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:01,110
You're so impatient.

417
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:02,870
Why are you not like me

418
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:03,390
at all?

419
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:05,240
These two kids love each other.

420
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:06,130
Don't touch me.

421
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:10,990
Great!

422
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:11,670
Great!

423
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:13,110
Great! Great!

424
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:14,730
Mr. Jiang, Commander Shang,

425
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:17,210
now it's your turn.

426
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:19,590
You must choose carefully.

427
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:19,990
Hurry up.

428
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:21,520
If you choose the wrong one,

429
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:24,510
your bride will be very upset.

430
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:26,520
That's right.

431
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:27,830
Please.

432
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:28,770
Come.

433
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:31,910
Go!

434
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:33,630
Yes, go!

435
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:35,110
Hurry up!

436
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:36,240
Choose one.

437
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:36,790
Go, go.

438
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:39,350
Now there are only two sedan chairs left.

439
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:39,970
It's easy to choose.

440
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:41,120
The difficulty has been reduced.

441
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:41,640
Yeah.

442
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:45,990
You've made your choice already?

443
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:47,390
Yes.

444
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,530
I was right.

445
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:28,660
You chose the wrong one.

446
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:29,380
Impossible.

447
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:30,710
You chose the wrong one.

448
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:32,350
I already told you,

449
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:33,320
you chose the wrong one.

450
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,520
Sai'er is over there.

451
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,990
The two grooms

452
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:38,760
chose the same sedan chair.

453
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:40,630
Looks like

454
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:42,800
one couple won't get married today.

455
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:44,110
Shang,

456
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:45,990
you mustn't choose the wrong one.

457
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:50,340
Trust me,

458
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:52,200
you chose the wrong one.

459
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:53,670
-Really?
-Go over there.

460
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:54,130
Really!

461
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,220
I have an idea.

462
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:04,830
Tong Sai'er.

463
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,280
I love it when you're lively and playful

464
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,470
by my side.

465
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:11,510
I love

466
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,930
the most fragrant scent of grain seedling on you.

467
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:16,470
The dishes you make

468
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:19,190
are the most delicious in the world!

469
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:22,910
Being able to marry you

470
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,760
is the happiest thing

471
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:25,860
for me!

472
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:29,410
Great!

473
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:33,970
I'm going to lift the curtain.

474
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:36,280
Hurry up.

475
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,260
She's in that one!

476
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:41,480
He chose the wrong one.

477
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,610
Why did she pull her hand back?

478
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:43,740
Hurry up and come up!

479
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:47,200
I've made my choice!

480
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:48,490
He made the choice.

481
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,560
He made the choice.

482
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:50,550
Mr. Jiang,

483
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:52,460
you've made your choice too?

484
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:53,540
Yes!

485
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,200
Are you going to change it?

486
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,170
-No!
-No!

487
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,170
Well then, brides, please step out of the sedan chairs.

488
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:03,470
Hurry up and come out, brides!

489
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:04,290
Come out!

490
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:04,970
Come out!

491
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:06,830
Come out!

492
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:11,950
Great!

493
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,840
How did you know it was me?

494
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:57,030
I just knew

495
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:58,620
it was you.

496
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:00,390
Great!

497
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:14,120
I was afraid you might make a wrong choice just now.

498
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:18,640
But I chose the right one, didn't I,

499
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:20,010
Honey?

500
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:25,670
Great!

501
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:27,350
Great!

502
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:29,270
Great!

503
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:31,960
Congratulations!

504
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:33,510
Congratulations!

505
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:36,220
Both grooms have chosen correctly.

506
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:39,710
Congratulations on bringing your beloved ones into your arms!

507
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:40,790
Great!

508
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,110
Yes!

509
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:47,650
They are enviable.

510
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:51,480
I wish you

511
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:53,490
a lifetime of harmony and love

512
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:55,430
as husband and wife.

513
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:57,640
Well said!

514
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,120
I wish you

515
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:02,660
prosperity, harmony, and happiness

516
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:04,690
for a hundred years.

517
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:08,310
Bravo!

518
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:09,410
Blessings to you!

519
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:12,350
I wish for you to share the joys and sorrows,

520
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:13,390
and respect each other!

521
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:16,110
Bravo! Bravo!

522
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:17,270
Well said!

523
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,820
But none of you mentioned the main point.

524
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:23,290
The main point is to have babies as soon as possible!

525
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,350

Yes.

624

696
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:36,900
♫That light up each other's worlds♫

697
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:39,710
♫No matter how unfamiliar the road is♫

698
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:41,590
♫As long as we are connected♫

699
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:44,320
♫I'm willing to be with you♫

700
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,810
♫Waiting for you in the blooming splendor♫

701
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,420
♫To pick the colors of spring for me♫

702
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,090
♫Waiting for the starry sky♫

703
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:52,190
♫To offer your dreams to me♫

704
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:54,320
♫I invite you♫

705
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:56,160
♫To hold a place in my heart♫

706
00:40:56,170 --> 00:41:01,850
♫Stay together forever♫

707
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:19,470
Are you done?

708
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:20,990
Yes.

709
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:21,910
Coming!

710
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:25,390
What exactly were you doing?

711
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:26,710
Nothing.

712
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:27,610
Almost done.

713
00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:28,850
Hurry up.

714
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:32,000
I'm starving.

715
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:34,420
Hurry.

716
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:36,280
Sorry to keep you waiting.

717
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:36,720
Here.

718
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:38,270
Try it while it's hot.

719
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:43,280
It took you so much time.

720
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,320
And this is what you made?

721
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:50,240
I originally wanted to take you to a restaurant.

722
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,270
But then I thought about

723
00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:53,060
how you've cooked so many meals for me.

724
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:54,860
So I decided to cook a meal for you

725
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:56,310
to repay you.

726
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:58,860
But if you really don't want to eat it,

727
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:00,720
we can still go to the restaurant.

728
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,240
Forget it.

729
00:42:02,850 --> 00:42:04,530
Since you worked so hard,

730
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:06,600
I'll make myself eat it.

731
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:12,600
How is it?

732
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:13,630
Too salty?

733
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:14,860
Too bland?

734
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,250
Does it have flavor?

735
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:18,790
Is it hot?

736
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,310
Your soup is...

737
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:22,510
Soup?

738
00:42:24,490 --> 00:42:25,100
Soup?

739
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:32,220
I made porridge.

740
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:36,160
I forgot to put in the rice.

741
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,400
How's the soup I made?

742
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:41,470
Here, try it.

743
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:48,300
It's sweet.

744
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,310
Sweet?

745
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,810
I didn't put sugar in it.

746
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:57,630
It's so salty!

747
00:42:59,020 --> 00:42:59,590
Stop drinking it.

748
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:00,720
I'll make you another bowl.

749
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:01,560
No, no, no.

750
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,550
This is the first time you've cooked for me.

751
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:04,680
I have to cherish it.

752
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:05,910
Give it back to me.

753
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:12,500
It's really delicious.

754
00:43:14,070 --> 00:43:15,800
Look at you. You worked so hard.

755
00:43:20,110 --> 00:43:20,870
Have a sip.

756
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:28,670
Let's dance! Yes!

757
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,750
Five, six, seven, eight.

758
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:32,490
One, two, three, four.

759
00:43:33,850 --> 00:43:34,650
Great.

760
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,470
Five, six, seven, go.

761
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:41,550
Very good!

762
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:45,500
Let's dance and show some more joy!

763
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:09,270
♫I will never leave you♫

764
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:12,930
♫You're my little apple♫

765
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:24,790
♫Fire♫

766
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:30,780
Let's get high, everyone!
