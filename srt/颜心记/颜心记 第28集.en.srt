00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,500
all believe you?

179
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,550
Yan Nanxing

180
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:23,880
met her match this time.

181
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,530
With my help,

182
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:28,350
I'll see how she'll embarrass herself.

183
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:39,030
Jiang Xinbai,

184
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:41,750
your wife got bullied,

185
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:42,750
you know?

186
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:45,750
I wish you were here.

187
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,550
You wouldn't let me

188
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:49,550
get bullied.

189
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,350
Jiang Xinbai,

190
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:05,270
you're a jerk.

191
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,020
You've been away for half a month

192
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,350
without any news.

193
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,150
Do you know...

194
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:13,830
Do you know

195
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:18,200
I miss you so much?

196
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:49,440
Ms. Bai, are you studying this hard

197
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,740
because you think there's something wrong

198
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,030
with our products?

199
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:55,250
Beauty of the City's beauty cream

200
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:58,240
has good and plentiful medicinal materials.

201
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:00,150
Your products are no less impressive compared to

202
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,210
Blossom Beauty's.

203
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:02,630
But your price

204
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:05,090
is only half of Blossom Beauty's.

205
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:08,550
Ms. Yen, what is the meaning of this?

206
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:11,900
You must be joking.

207
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,940
There are no losses in doing business.

208
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,400
Ms. Yan was right.

209
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:19,630
I

210
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,390
am doing a price war.

211
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:24,290
After Blossom Beauty goes bankrupt,

212
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:26,470
won't I dominate the businesses

213
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:28,860
in the capital?

214
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:31,830
Really?

215
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:34,960
You worry too much.

216
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:36,870
What other purpose can I have?

217
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,780
I didn't even know Ms. Yan before.

218
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:44,750
In that case,

219
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,270
let's go all out

220
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:50,250
and hold a 10-day opening promotion.

221
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:53,960
We'll see if Blossom Beauty can handle it.

222
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,800
I'll do whatever you say.

223
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,190
[Special Sale]

224
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:35,750
Their prices are so cheap.

225
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,670
Can they break even this way?

226
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,750
She must want to

227
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:39,950
do a price war with us.

228
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:42,150
That woman is so cruel.

229
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:44,030
Boss,

230
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,310
what should we do?

231
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:47,950
I'm thinking.

232
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:49,830
What are you thinking?

233
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,360
Thinking about a solution.

234
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,210
What's so hard about this?

235
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:55,160
She's ruthless,

236
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:57,550
so we must be more ruthless than her.

237
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:59,270
How?

238
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,590
Go boil a pot of water later.

239
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:05,680
When it gets dark,

240
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:07,700
I'll let them know

241
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,200
that pots are made of iron.

242
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:14,230
Auntie,

243
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:16,160
do you want to scald them?

244
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:17,680
That's illegal.

245
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,510
I'm the duchess now.

246
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,500
I can't do anything illegal.

247
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,750
Don't worry.

248
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:26,020
We won't do

249
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:27,630
anything illegal.

250
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:30,830
You'll know

251
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:32,680
when night falls.

252
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:47,790
Why are you here?

253
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:52,570
Suoluo.

254
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:57,570
I heard

255
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:00,510
you're going to invite a few elders from aristocratic families.

256
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:01,270
I was worried you wouldn't be able to

257
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:02,150
handle them alone,

258
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:04,510
so I came with my father without invitation.

259
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:05,910
Father will be here soon.

260
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:08,750
You

261
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,360
aren't unhappy, right?

262
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:12,510
Whether I'm happy or not,

263
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:13,930
you're already here.

264
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,400
Are you still mad at me

265
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:18,870
because of last time?

266
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,590
Let bygones be bygones.

267
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:21,880
Yes.

268
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:23,920
Don't worry.

269
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:25,790
As long as my father and I are here,

270
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:26,450
those lords

271
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,150
will treat you politely.

272
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:37,690
My lords, thank you

273
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:39,250
for coming today.

274
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,780
I invited you today

275
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:43,980
for...

276
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,430
For the succession, right?

277
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:53,790
Your brother has been exiled from the capital.

278
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,830
He doesn't pose a threat anymore.

279
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,220
The Yuejiang title

280
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:59,230
can only be yours.

281
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:01,770
You don't have to worry about

282
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,640
our family affairs.

283
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:05,870
Although I'm the chancellor

284
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,400
and don't have a low status,

285
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:09,470
I'm not a court official.

286
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,950
I would like to discuss

287
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:13,870
court affairs with you all

288
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:15,870
and share His Majesty's burden.

289
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:19,560
Discuss court affairs?

290
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:20,590
That's right.

291
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:26,150
I hope you all will support me.

292
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:29,980
Suoluo.

293
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:36,150
Mr. Yan,

294
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:37,880
what advice do you have?

295
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:40,130
You are from the Jiang family.

296
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:43,350
You used to be the crown prince's teacher

297
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:45,150
and you're close to the empress.

298
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:46,540
If you want to enter the court,

299
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:47,310
His Majesty

300
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:51,390
may regard this as an abuse of power

301
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:54,270
or even interference of an outside force.

302
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:56,990
You're asking for trouble.

303
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:59,210
As the saying goes,

304
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:01,590
one shouldn't avoid recommending relatives.

305
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:02,830
The Jiang family

306
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:05,200
has always been loyal to His Majesty.

307
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:07,470
How is it an abuse of power?

308
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:10,830
Her Majesty and the crown prince

309
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,030
are also loyal to His Majesty.

310
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:15,460
How is it despotic?

311
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,930
You have already reached the top

312
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:19,570
of what women can reach.

313
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:22,430
Why are you not satisfied?

314
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:23,750
That's right.

315
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:25,270
A woman

316
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:28,530
should behave like a woman.

317
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:30,030
Exactly.

318
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,280
Women

319
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,880
must return home

320
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:35,240
and take care of their families in the end.

321
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:36,070
Besides,

322
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:38,550
how can we discuss court affairs

323
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:40,150
with a woman?

324
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:42,000
How inappropriate!

325
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:47,210
I didn't expect you all

326
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,200
would think so too.

327
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:00,230
However,

328
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:03,360
if you're interested,

329
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:05,910
it's still negotiable.

330
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:07,730
How about this?

331
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:08,790
Today,

332
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:10,510
show your sincerity.

333
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:13,290
Pour the wine for all of us.

334
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:16,790
Mr. Yan,

335
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:18,430
this...

336
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:20,950
It's inappropriate

337
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:23,750
to make the duchess lower herself.

338
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:25,110
Exactly.

339
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,920
It's inappropriate.

340
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:29,630
I think

341
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,790
there's nothing inappropriate about it.

342
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:36,210
Well,

343
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,090
thank you, Your Grace.

344
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,280
You may not like the process

345
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,440
of working to the top.

346
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:05,910
You'll have to lie

347
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:08,849
and act against your will.

348
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:11,760
You'll have to twist the truth

349
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:14,819
and be decisive.

350
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:18,950
It's my duty.

351
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:51,780
Liu Ruoqian?

352
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,570
Why did you fall

353
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:58,640
from the sky again?

354
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,820
I was cleaning upstairs.

355
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,280
Cleaning?

356
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:07,580
Why are you in my house?

357
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,590
I'm the maid that you

358
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:11,910
hired.

359
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,110
You're that maid?

360
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,150
Didn't I say

361
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:34,150
you can only appear at five o'clock?

362
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,210
It's not past the hour yet.

363
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,700
You came back too early.

364
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,200
Who allowed you to be here?

365
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,020
Who allowed you to peep here?

366
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:47,980
I...

367
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:50,270
Don't you know you need to respect boundaries?

368
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:50,950
I know.

369
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:52,830
I just held on for too long.

370
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:53,370
I couldn't keep going.

371
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:55,370
Who allowed you to watch from above?

372
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:56,910
Do you think it's fun to see

373
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:57,980
a woman cry?

374
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:58,900
No.

375
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,110
I didn't mean that.

376
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:01,270
Then what do you mean?

377
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:02,600
What are you looking at?

378
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,110
You are all like this.

379
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:04,990
You're just a rabble.

380
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:06,470
You all look down on me, right?

381
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:07,350
Get out!

382
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:08,390
Get out!

383
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:09,310
I...

384
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,390
I told you to get out, you hear me?

385
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:15,990
Get out!

386
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,340
Yes.

387
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,000
What did he do wrong?

388
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,120
Why did I vent

389
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:00,070
my anger on him?

390
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:03,550
Liu Ruoqian.

391
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:10,080
Chancellor.

392
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,630
-I'm sorry.
-I’m sorry.

393
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,470
Why did you bring me here?

394
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:50,950
I saw you were in a bad mood.

395
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:52,480
You can insult people here.

396
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:54,090
Insult people?

397
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,360
Just vent out all of your

398
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,720
unhappiness.

399
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,300
What's the use of insulting them?

400
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,430
They can't hear me.

401
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:06,150
They can't,

402
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:08,070
but god can.

403
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:10,230
If god hears,

404
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:11,880
he can help you punish them.

405
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:14,660
It's simple.

406
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:15,770
Let me teach you.

407
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:21,830
Those who look down on me

408
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:23,310
are idiots.

409
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:25,020
I'm talented

410
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:26,440
and handsome.

411
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,480
I'm the greatest genius in the world.

412
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,140
You actually dare to say that?

413
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:33,990
Try it.

414
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:36,040
I won't.

415
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,110
Try it.

416
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:40,990
Go ahead.

417
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:49,950
You...

418
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:53,190
You...

419
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:57,040
I don't know what to say.

420
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:58,510
Just insult them.

421
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,510
You can insult them as you like.

422
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:10,570
You conservative old men!

423
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,920
You're too gentle.

424
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:15,760
Old farts! Old bastards!

425
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:19,910
Old farts!

426
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:21,310
Old farts!

427
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:22,500
Old farts!

428
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,970
Old farts!

429
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,040
Despicable, shameless, lowly!

430
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:28,590
Those who look down on women are cowards.

431
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:29,780
I'll choke you

432
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,270
if you make me pour wine again!

433
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:32,390
Choke you to death!

434
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,360
I want to be an official.

435
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:35,390
I want to be the female minister

436
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:36,870
who is above everyone but the emperor.

437
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:37,630
I'm going to

438
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:38,980
step on all of you!

439
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:41,660
Step on all of them!

440
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:03,270
Look.

441
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:05,230
Those two old farts

442
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:06,590
were the ones who bullied me today.

443
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:07,150
Father,

444
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:08,880
your move

445
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:11,150
was really clever.

446
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:14,350
She had to pour the wine because I said so.

447
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:24,960
Assassin!

448
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:28,700
Who is the assassin?

449
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:35,030
Who are you?

450
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,790
Your shoe-throwing is so accurate.

451
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:44,350
How can a common bird

452
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:45,790
understand a swan?

453
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:47,870
Everyone speculates others

454
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:49,000
based on prejudice,

455
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:49,830
but we

456
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,830
definitely can't

457
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:52,360
underestimate ourselves.

458
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:02,560
Let me carry you.

459
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:04,710
No need.

460
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:08,010
I'll carry you. Come.

461
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:17,160
Are you happy today?

462
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:22,020
Do you want to be happier?

463
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:23,950
Yes.

464
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:26,150
Let's go!

465
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:51,150
Okay.

466
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,440
Mother.

467
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:08,750
What should we do?

468
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,410
Their shop

469
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:12,460
has bad feng shui,

470
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:14,560
but this tree is different.

471
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:16,110
How so?

472
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:18,530
This is the position of wealth.

473
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:20,500
It can help them change their fate

474
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:21,910
and make money.

475
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:23,230
So?

476
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:24,590
Kill it.

477
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:25,550
Kill it

478
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:26,930
and let's see how their business will boom.

479
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:27,490
Water it.

480
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:39,410
Why did you two leave?

481
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:41,680
Don't you know feng shui?

482
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:46,990
Let's go.

483
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:51,840
Watering their tree of wealth with boiling water.

484
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,370
How could you think of that?

485
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:54,190
What's wrong?

486
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:55,250
If she provokes me again,

487
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:56,650
I still have many tricks.

488
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:58,270
Within three days,

489
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:00,350
they'll definitely go out of business.

490
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:01,430
They'd better.

491
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:03,230
When will you

492
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:04,830
sign the divorce agreement?

493
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:06,950
After Beauty of the City goes bankrupt,

494
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:08,210
you must leave with me.

495
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:10,510
You...

496
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:12,510
You just can't stand

497
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:13,870
seeing happy couples, right?

498
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:15,500
Can't we wait for him to come back

499
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,840
from Tingzhou and eat a meal together?

500
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:17,890
Can't you just wait

501
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:19,480
and observe him?

502
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:21,390
I'll wait.

503
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:22,940
I'll wait for you to get pregnant

504
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,070
and give birth to a crying baby

505
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:25,350
and you leave it to me to take care of.

506
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:26,010
That's what you want?

507
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:27,470
I don't want to talk to you.

508
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,000
Look.

509
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:41,490
Ruoqian is carrying Suoluo.

510
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:43,680
Who is he carrying?

511
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,910
Suoluo, my sister-in-law.

512
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:46,950
The duchess.

513
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,200
Duchess?

514
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:52,410
Ruoqian went out to work

515
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:55,530
at night in Suoluo's house?

516
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,640
Ruoqian

517
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:00,590
is quite impressive.

518
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:03,030
He works by day and at night, he...

519
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,080
What are you thinking about?

520
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,220
Here, Boss.

521
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:28,850
Thank you for taking care of Ruoqian.

522
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:30,320
Thank you, Auntie.

523
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:33,650
Ruoqian actually helped me a lot.

524
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,940
I should have come to visit you earlier.

525
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:40,340
Ruoqian,

526
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:41,450
your Boss is here.

527
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:42,410
Boss,

528
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:43,800
why are you here?

529
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,170
Didn’t you tell Sai'er

530
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:46,790
you want to be my manager?

531
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:48,560
I'm here to discuss it with you.

532
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:50,630
We were just kidding.

533
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:52,470
But I'm serious.

534
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:55,020
Let's talk inside.

535
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:05,680
Ruoqian, let me ask you.

536
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:08,910
Do you want to drop out of school?

537
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:10,510
No.

538
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,790
I want to change my fate with knowledge.

539
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:13,670
How?

540
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:15,590
You just

541
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:16,710
go to my sister-in-law's house at night—

542
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:17,750
You know already?

543
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:19,180
You admit it?

544
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,590
I wanted to tell you a long time ago.

545
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,080
But later I thought

546
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:23,990
it's nothing.

547
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,810
It's nothing?

548
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:26,840
You actually think

549
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,070
it's nothing?

550
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:30,150
I'm just working as her maid.

551
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:31,360
Liu Ruoqian.

552
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,400
What did you tell me before?

553
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,090
Although you're a slave,

554
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,260
you have dignity.

555
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,480
You won't do

556
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,530
self-deprecating things.

557
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:42,260
I'm making money with my own skills.

558
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,920
It's not that I'm not working.

559
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:46,560
You...

560
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:48,990
How could you say that?

561
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,570
Aren't you ashamed?

562
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,800
Why should I?

563
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,740
Can't men do

564
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:55,950
what women do?

565
00:29:56,970 --> 00:29:59,030
-What are they talking about?
-Liu Ruoqian.

566
00:29:59,030 --> 00:29:59,890
Let me tell you.

567
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,440
As long as I’m your Boss,

568
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:02,400
I won't allow you

569
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:04,210
to go to Suoluo's house at night.

570
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:05,430
Boss,

571
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:07,950
you went against prejudices

572
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:09,550
and hired me as a clerk before.

573
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:11,140
Why do you judge me

574
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,340
based on gender now?

575
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,620
It has nothing to do with gender.

576
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:15,710
Is it because of Suoluo

577
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:17,020
and your husband's relationship?

578
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:17,710
No, no.

579
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:18,850
It's not like that.

580
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:20,760
Anyway, I won't allow you to go.

581
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:21,850
If you really need money,

582
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:22,750
I can give it to you.

583
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:24,680
You can't earn what you shouldn't.

584
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:25,980
I won't allow you

585
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:27,510
to belittle yourself again.

586
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:28,240
You can't go.

587
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:30,430
I'm just working there as a maid.

588
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:31,270
Bastard!

589
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:34,190
Move!

590
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:38,310
Listen.

591
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:39,390
Tomorrow,

592
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:41,470
you go drop out of the Imperial Academy

593
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:43,320
and resign from the duchess's mansion.

594
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,220
From now on,

595
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:46,270
you are not allowed to go out again.

596
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:48,030
Obediently be a blacksmith at home.

597
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:48,490
Father,

598
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,240
you are so unreasonable.

599
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:51,530
I won't quit my job

600
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:52,790
or drop out from school.

601
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:54,250
I don't have a son like you.

602
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:55,150
Get lost.

603
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:56,540
Get out!

604
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:58,000
Get out!

605
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:58,470
Wait.

606
00:30:58,490 --> 00:30:58,910
Your hand.

607
00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:00,310
Why are you all like this?

608
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:01,530
Why do you all disrespect

609
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:02,290
my life?

610
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:04,270
Look what you've done.

611
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:05,590
Get lost!

612
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:06,070
Yes.

613
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:07,790
Apologize to your father now.

614
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:08,550
You...

615
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:10,200
Ruoqian!

616
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,120
Don't stop him.

617
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:12,550
Boss,

618
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:14,910
we

619
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:17,150
didn't teach our child well.

620
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:18,650
Sorry for the trouble.

621
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:20,110
Sorry, Boss.

622
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:21,350
Sir, Auntie,

623
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:22,370
don't say that.

624
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:24,330
Ruoqian is like my family.

625
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:25,910
I'm also at fault.

626
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:27,330
I've neglected him

627
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:28,680
these days.

628
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:31,390
Auntie,

629
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:33,620
take the money.

630
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:34,430
No.

631
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:35,510
We can't.

632
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:36,310
Take it.

633
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:38,190
Suoluo is my sister-in-law.

634
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:39,120
I'll talk to her.

635
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:40,360
I'll have her

636
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:41,880
explain about this.

637
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:43,230
Take it.

638
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,140
-Boss.
-Thank you, Boss.

639
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,790
You are such a good person.

640
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,830
Now I'm homeless.

641
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:21,030
Hiding at the Imperial Academy

642
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:22,730
isn't a long-term plan.

643
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:36,430
If I accidentally

644
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:37,730
break a vase,

645
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:39,030
I'll have an excuse

646
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:40,030
to be a housemaid.

647
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:42,590
I can pay with my labor.

648
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:55,000
This is big. It must be expensive.

649
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:58,150
The color is so nice.

650
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,310
It must not be cheap.

651
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:01,910
This seems...

652
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:04,120
Not this one either.

653
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:10,090
This should be cheap.

654
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:20,330
It broke.

655
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:25,970
The vase broke.

656
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:29,910
I'll pay for it.

657
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:33,680
Can you afford it?

658
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:36,230
How expensive can this vase be?

659
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:38,950
This is a white porcelain from the Xing kiln.

660
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:40,550
It's worth 100 taels of gold.

661
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:45,980
Then...

662
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:46,850
Then...

663
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:47,850
What about these?

664
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,190
Those are cheap.

665
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:56,430
Why did I

666
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:58,050
pick the most expensive one?

667
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,320
If you don't mind,

668
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,180
I can pay with my labor.

669
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:11,310
Your labor?

670
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:17,870
I can work for you for free

671
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:19,409
and be a housemaid.

672
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:21,820
Until I pay you back.

673
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,239
My vase

674
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:26,420
was put in such a high place

675
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,850
and you broke it?

676
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:31,150
Tell me.

677
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:32,020
Why do you

678
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:33,179
insist on moving in?

679
00:34:34,469 --> 00:34:35,909
Chancellor, you are wise.

680
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:37,639
I can’t hide anything from you.

681
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,520
Don't you work for Yan Nanxing?

682
00:34:46,909 --> 00:34:47,710
I used to.

683
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:49,949
From now on,

684
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:51,230
I'm your maid.

685
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:54,830
What?

686
00:34:55,469 --> 00:34:56,600
Did she abandon you?

687
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:00,490
She was very angry that I'm working

688
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:01,510
for you

689
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:03,270
and kicked me out.

690
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:04,990
Why?

691
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,470
Is it shameful to be my maid?

692
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,510
I don't know

693
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:09,710
what she's thinking.

694
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:12,230
Looks like I'll have to

695
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:13,290
talk to Yan Nanxing

696
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:14,490
and see what she has

697
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:15,260
against me.

698
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:17,960
Chancellor,

699
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:20,550
then I...

700
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:23,150

00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:57,090
Why don't you buy their shop

877
00:42:57,430 --> 00:42:58,890
and end it once and for all?

878
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:00,010
I have no money.

879
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:01,900
You have no money?

880
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,630
You're a duchess

881
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:04,550
and the chancellor.

882
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:05,950
How can you have no money?

883
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,710
Do you think a chancellor

884
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:08,710
has a high salary?

885
00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:10,310
How come

886
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:11,600
you were rich back when you wanted to

887
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:12,730
drive me away?

888
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:14,590
You shouldn't have mentioned it.

889
00:43:14,590 --> 00:43:15,590
If you hadn't

890
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:16,950
fought with Mother back then,

891
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:17,830
why would I have bought

892
00:43:17,830 --> 00:43:19,090
those two title deeds?

893
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:20,300
Are you blaming me?

894
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:21,710
Who else should I blame?

895
00:43:21,710 --> 00:43:22,470
I spent a lot of money

896
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:23,870
on those two title deeds.

897
00:43:24,550 --> 00:43:25,280
Besides,

898
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:26,200
Mother

899
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:27,510
didn't say anything after that.

900
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:28,750
In order to please you,

901
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:30,150
Xinbai also took the deeds away.

902
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:31,720
He didn't give me a penny.

903
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:33,220
Otherwise,

904
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:34,230
why would I need Ruoqian

905
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:35,430
to be a cleaning maid?

906
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:39,910
What did you say?

907
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:43,950
The "maid" that Ruoqian mentioned

908
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:46,060
is a cleaning maid?

909
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:47,470
What else?

910
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:50,250
What kind of maid did you think it was?

911
00:43:52,990 --> 00:43:55,390
He was talking about being a cleaning maid.

912
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:02,430
A cleaning maid.
