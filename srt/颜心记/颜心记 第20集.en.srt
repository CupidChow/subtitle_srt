It's early in the morning.

00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,800
Are you here

7
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,840
to scold me again?

8
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,740
I won't delay your class.

9
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,070
I'll cut to the chase.

10
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:16,510
Can you sell me

and Yan Nanxing's residence?

13
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:24,920
So, for my sister-in-law,

14
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,920
you've decided

15
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:27,410
to fight Mother to the end?

16
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:28,630
Yeah.

17
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,350
Since

18
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:33,030
you called her your sister-in-law,

19
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:34,370
you'll help me, right?

20
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,190
Why should I help you?

21
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,110
Suoluo.

22
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,270
I came to your door today.

23
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,350
You can see it

24
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,390
as me begging you.

25
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,550
Begging me?

26
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:05,390
Then you need to be more sincere.

27
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,880
How sincere do you want me to be?

28
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,160
Yan Nanxing once said

31

It seems you've never cooked for me before.

32
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,570
What do you want to eat?

33
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:28,110
Braised chicken with bean sprouts.

Rice cakes with dates.

35
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:32,829
Too complicated.

36

I don't have enough time today.

00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,460
Come for the deeds

when my dishes are ready.

39
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,910
I asked for rice cakes with dates

40
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,860
and braised chicken with bean sprouts.

41
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:06,720
What are these?

42
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:07,890
Pumpkin cakes.

43
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:09,070
Millet porridge.

44
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,820
Is this how sincere you are?

45
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:12,990
Bean sprouts are cold in nature.

46
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:14,920
The rice cake is made of river rice.

47

Both of them

But

55

00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:53,590
to you.

176
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,190
What's it?

177
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:57,630
Can't you say it now?

178
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:00,950
It's not time yet.

179
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:05,950
How about

180
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:07,240
I deliver it for you?

181
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:09,230
I'll come back early tonight

182
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:10,090
to cook dinner.

183
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:11,080
No way.

184
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,830
I promised Mrs. Bao

185
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:14,050
to give her a massage.

186
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,020
Can you give her a massage?

187
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:18,130
Then…

188
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:19,510
Then I'll walk you there.

189
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:20,200
No.

190
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,580
It's too high-profile.

191
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,080
What if someone sees us?

192
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:27,150
Alright.

193
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:29,870
Be back soon.

194
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:34,510
You too.

195
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,110
Twelve Music House,

196
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:58,170
Longxin Teahouse,

197
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:59,560
the Ghost Market, and the Li family's casino.

198
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,620
I've taken back all the artworks

199
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:01,550
on their walls.

200
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:03,600
Why do you want them?

201
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:05,510
Have you figured something out?

202
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,010
Secret profiteering.

203
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:09,770
Yes.

204
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,200
Without exception, these artworks

205
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,070
are all fake.

206
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,400
Fake?

207
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,160
You know what?

208
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,590
The guy who replicated them was quite good at it.

209
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:19,520
At first glance,

210
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:20,840
they all seem genuine.

211
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,760
All businesses

212
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:22,750
and deals,

213
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:23,870
in the end,

214
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,720
are just ledgers.

215
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,640
In all these ledgers,

216
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,600
artworks have the highest prices.

217
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:32,510
Especially this painting.

218
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:33,310
Its price exceeds

219
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:35,670
the music house's earnings for half a year.

220
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,200
It's so expensive

221
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:38,750
but was casually hung

222
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:39,720
in the passage.

223
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,330
Does it make sense?

224
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:44,750
Then where should it be?

225
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,150
Well, just tell me

226
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:56,310
how to profit off fake artworks.

227
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:00,650
First, find a channel

228
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:02,770
to authenticate these fakes.

229
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:05,360
Then auction them off at high prices.

230
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,470
Since they're fake,

231
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:07,670
no one would buy them.

232
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,080
But Li Wufang claimed

233
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:11,710
to have found secret buyers.

234
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:12,390
Finally,

235
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,840
find a third party

236
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,110
to buy these fakes back

237
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:16,910
at low prices.

238
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:19,750
That way, everything is legit on the books.

239
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:20,900
And the artworks

240
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,640
can be sold again.

241
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:25,470
Buy fakes at high prices

242
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,550
to cook the books.

243
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,330
No need to hide the fakes.

244
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:29,990
What are you muttering about?

245
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:31,950
Nothing.

246
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:36,270
Then,

247
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:38,210
what should we do next?

248
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,540
Next, we should

249
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:42,510
find the people

250
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:43,750
who made these fakes,

251
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:44,460
sold them,

252
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:45,880
and arranged the deals.

253
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:47,030
Only by sorting out

254
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,430
how this business works…

255
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,680
Can we prove

256
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,890
that the accounts are fake.

257
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:07,470
Ms. Yan.

258
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:09,520
You're mistaken.

259
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,080
Ms. Yan.

260
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:11,230
I'm not mistaken.

261
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:12,710
Blossom Beauty has closed down.

262
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:13,590
It's really hard

263
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:14,990
to buy your creams again.

264
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:18,380
Well…

265
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:21,050
Let's find a place to talk.

266
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:28,230
Miss.

267
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:31,180
You should be a regular,

268
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,150
but I don't remember you.

269
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,290
I'm ordinary-looking.

270
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:37,230
It's normal that you don't.

271
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:38,230
But

272
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:39,750
I've been thinking about you

273
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:40,880
and looking for you.

274
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:42,330
Looking for me?

275
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:45,230
You used this flyer

276
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,790
to look for someone, right?

277
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:32,750
So this is what they call

278
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:34,390
shooting fish

279
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:36,510
in a barrel.

280
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:42,520
Who are you?

281
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,270
It doesn't matter.

282
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:46,080
What matters is that

283
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:48,030
your man messed with me.

284
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,480
I don't have a man.

285
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,270
I'm not married yet.

286
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:58,640
Ms. Yan, you're lying through your teeth.

287
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:01,390
Rumor has it that Jiang Xinbai got married.

288
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:02,590
His bride

289
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,030
was you, right?

290
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:14,470
I've figured it all out,

291
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:17,350
or I wouldn't have abducted you.

292
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,030
You're married to Jiang Xinbai,

293
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:23,030
yet you're looking for another man.

294
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:24,150
Miss,

295
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,560
you're quite interesting.

296
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:31,870
I don't know what you're talking about.

297
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:33,280
What do you want?

298
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:34,450
Nothing.

299
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,210
I just want Jiang Xinbai here.

300
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:41,280
I don't know…

301
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,080
I don't know who you are.

302
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,440
But I think you're mistaken.

303
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,070
My relationship with him

304
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:48,630
isn't what you think it is.

305
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:50,430
He...

306
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:53,330
He despises me for my humble origins.

307
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:54,760
I'll be honest with you.

308
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:55,900
He's long divorced me

309
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,110
with a repudiation letter.

310
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:58,270
He walked out on me.

311
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:59,730
You can't lure him here

312
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:01,030
by taking me hostage.

313
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,280
You can't fool me.

314
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:06,250
I can see

315
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,140
how much Jiang Xinbai cares for you.

316
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:12,360
You really misunderstood.

317
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:13,310
Then…

318
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:18,460
Let's have a bet.

319
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:39,550
Why hasn't she come back?

320
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:44,990
My lord.

321
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,630
You were supposed to pick her up at Mrs. Bao's.

322
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:50,350
Where is she?

323
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:50,990
Mrs. Bao said

324
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:51,970
Ms. Yan left her place

325
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:53,090
at a quarter to six.

326
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:56,670
She left so early?

327
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:57,300
Yes.

328
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:58,630
Mrs. Bao invited

329
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:00,090
Ms. Yan to stay for dinner.

330
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:00,690
But Ms. Yan said

331
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:02,000
she had an important date tonight

332
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,910
and left.

333
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:06,710
Something's off.

334
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:09,630
Go inform Shang Bieli.

335
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:10,470
Then,

336
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,430
go look for her with other constables.

337
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:12,950
Quick.

338
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:13,510
Yes.

339
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:14,270
I'm on it.

340
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,780
If you don't want her to die,

341
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,070
come to Twelve Music House

342
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:40,670
by yourself.

343
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:10,630
Jiang Xinbai!

344
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:25,829
You finally came.

345
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:29,360
If I hadn't come,

346
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,610
how could I catch you red-handed?

347
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:34,370
The Inspection Office is busy

348
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,630
looking for evidence

349
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:37,830
to charge you with Zornia trafficking.

350
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:38,970
I didn't expect you

351
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:41,070
to give me evidence yourself.

352
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:43,170
Hold on.

353
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:44,350
Hold on.

354
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,600
Aren't you two a thing?

355
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:48,370
Aren't you…

356
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,120
Aren't you worried about her?

357
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,350
If she dies,

358
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,390
her death will be honorable

359
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,980
because it's for a righteous cause.

360
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:10,230
What did I say?

361
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,930
I told you

362
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:13,700
he'd just let me die.

363
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:15,670
Jiang Xinbai,

364
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:16,600
you jerk!

365
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:17,750
Yan Nanxing,

366
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,100
you've fallen into enemy hands so many times.

367
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,500
I don't have the patience

368
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,230
to save you again.

369
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:25,280
You…

370
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,390
Do you hear him?

371
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:27,470
Let me go!

372
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:28,310
He's toast!

373
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:33,300
Mr. Li,

374
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:35,010
I want to remind you

375
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:36,430
that kidnapping

376
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:38,920
carries a sentence of 10 years.

377
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:39,950
Murder

378
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:42,860
carries the same sentence as selling Zornia:

379
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:43,720
decapitation.

380
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:49,670
Think carefully.

381
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,030
Mr. Jiang,

382
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,830
I'm just kidding

383
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:54,560
with Ms. Yan.

384
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:55,820
I-If I let her go now,

385
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:56,460
it's not

386
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:58,010
kidnapping, is it?

387
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:08,440
Yan Nanxing!

388
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:21,030
You're so good at acting.

389
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,690
I almost got fooled by you two.

390
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:25,910
Go on.

391
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:27,470
Keep acting.

392
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:31,500
Li Wufang.

393
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,710
You asked me to come here.

394
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:35,550
What do you want?

395
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,190
I want you to return my store.

396
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:37,990
Will you do it?

397
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:39,870
I want you

398
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:40,850
to stop pursuing Zornia.

399
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:42,050
Will you listen to me?

400
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:43,470
Since you won't,

401
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:45,190
one of you

402
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:46,430
has to die here today.

403
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:47,430
Either you die,

404
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:48,710
or she does!

405
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:49,390
Stop!

406
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:50,950
Not gonna happen!

407
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:52,230
Really?

408
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:55,510
Fine.

409
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,310
Do I have to die

410
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:01,040
to make you release her?

411
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:02,990
Yes.

412
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:08,590
Fine.

413
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:10,910
Tell me.

414
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:14,610
How do you want to play?

415
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,680
Mr. Jiang,

416
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:18,980
you made me lose everything.

417
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:21,750
First,

418
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:24,720
I want you to kneel

419
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,320
and apologize to me!

420
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:28,510
No, Jiang Xinbai.

421
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:29,790
Jiang Xinbai!

422
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,590
Don't kneel!

423
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:38,320
Don't kneel!

424
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,310
Will you kneel

425
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,550
or not?

426
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,790
Look.

427
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:20,070
Jiang Xinbai!

428
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,970
The chief constable of the Inspection Office

429
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,350
actually kneeled down before me

430
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:32,550
for a woman.

431
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:34,510
You have no backbone at all.

432
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:37,950
Now,

433
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:40,590
beat him.

434
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:43,100
Beat him to a pulp!

435
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:47,190
No!

436
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:48,750
Stop!

437
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:52,740
Jiang Xinbai!

438
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:55,590
Stop!

439
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,790
Fight back,

440
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,030
Jiang Xinbai!

441
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:00,510
Stop!

442
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:08,870
Yan Nanxing.

443
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:10,920
Close your eyes.

444
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:12,560
Don't look.

445
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:13,650
No!

446
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,190
Get off him!

447
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:16,810
Go on.

448
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:18,270
Beat him!

449
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:22,720
Jiang Xinbai!

450
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,810
Fight back, Jiang Xinbai!

451
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,340
Jiang Xinbai, get up!

452
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:45,750
Fight back!

453
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:47,590
Jiang Xinbai!

454
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:50,590
Fight back, Jiang Xinbai!

455
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:53,110
Stop beating him!

456
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:55,150
Stop.

457
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:03,150
Li Wufang!

458
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,160
Is this all you got?

459
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:08,310
Fu.

460
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,270
No! No!

461
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:19,150
No!

462
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:23,030
No!

463
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:29,590
No!

464
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:32,110
Star-crossed lovers.

465
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:34,960
Don't haunt me

466
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:38,360
after you die.

467
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:56,580
Jiang Xinbai.

468
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,410
Are you okay, Jiang Xinbai?

469
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:08,350
Jiang Xinbai!

470
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:10,730
Jiang Xinbai!

471
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:14,590
Jiang Xinbai!

472
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:44,390
Stop crying.

473
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,960
I'm fine.

474
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:49,260
Look at you.

475
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:52,790
You're not fine at all.

476
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:54,910
Sorry.

477
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:57,310
It's all my fault.

478
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:00,110
It's my fault you're injured.

479
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:02,310
Blame me.

480
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:04,630
It's all my fault.

481
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:09,040
It's not your fault.

482
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:13,690
You just want to find your young sir.

483
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:16,940
They used your care for him against you.

484
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:19,470
No.

485
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:22,510
I want to find Young Sir

486
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:24,380
to repay his kindness.

487
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:26,360
I don't feel for him

488
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:27,470
the way you think.

489
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,880
There's nothing between him and me.

490
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:31,460
Trust me.

491
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:36,470
I know.

492
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:39,960
I trust you.

493
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:43,920
Yan Nanxing.

494
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,510
There's already a man

495
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:49,780
who makes you feel guilty.

496
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,910
I'll stay safe

497
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:00,300
so you don't have to worry anymore.

498
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,510
For this alone,

499
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,750
I'll stay alive.

500
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:11,510
Promise me

501
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:13,430
to stay safe

502
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:16,970
and live a long life.

503
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,660
Don't get hurt again.

504
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,520
I won't let you

505
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:26,390
get hurt again.

506
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:29,390
No matter what happens,

507
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:32,710
I'll protect you.

508
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:42,280
This won't happen again.

509
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:43,870
Don't cry.

510
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:47,270
I don't want you to protect me.

511
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:51,830
I want us to protect each other.

512
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:58,530
I'll protect you too.

513
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,790
Your face is all wet with tears.

514
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:12,790
Silly.

515
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:14,150
Don't cry.

516
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:17,760
I'm fine.

517
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:39,880
Father-in-law.

518
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:42,440
That stupid boy acted on his own

519
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:43,870
and deserved what he got.

520
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:45,710
He not only caused you

521
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:47,250
to be fined a year's salary

522
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,520
but also caused me to be demoted.

523
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:51,020
At this point,

524
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:53,230
I think

525
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:56,160
we have to give up on him.

526
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,950

527
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:06,480
you watched him grow up!

528
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,440
Instead of thinking about

529
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,150
how to defeat Jiang Xinbai,

530
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:11,410
you want to give up on your boy?

531

I wish I had other choices.

But they've backed us into a corner.

00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:19,910
we can help him out.

536

Wait and see.

537
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,510
I'll definitely

538
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:32,930
make you pay.

there are things

you really want to hide from me.

can keep you alive.

of banishment.

564
00:29:58,870 --> 00:29:59,470
I wonder

565
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:01,990
if there's a place you want to go.

566
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:07,950
Yazhou is good.

567

Unfortunately,

570
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:17,430
you're not an official.

571
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:18,470
I'm afraid

572
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,360
you can't go to Yazhou.

573
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:22,270
Let me think.

574
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,020
Do you like snow, Mr. Li?

575
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:29,670
In Youzhou, it snows from June

576
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:31,450
until April of the next year.

577
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,470
The whole place is snow-white.

578
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:34,480
Very beautiful.

579
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:37,070
However,

580
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:38,640
it's hard to get food

581
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:40,710
in that remote place.

582
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,190
Lingnan is good too.

583
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,820
It's always summer there.

584
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:50,000
Unfortunately,

585
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:52,470
the air is toxic,

586
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:54,930
and pests like snakes, bugs, and rats

587
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:56,030
are everywhere.

588
00:30:58,270 --> 00:30:59,430
Qixi is a choice too.

589
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:02,790
The desert there is magnificent.

590
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:04,910
It's just too far away.

591
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:06,110
I heard

592
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:08,710
many people died of starvation or thirst

593
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:11,110

596

What do you want to know?

597
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:28,130
Mr. Li,

598
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:31,510
I'm very interested in the artworks

599
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:32,950
you collected.

600
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,510
I can only tell you that

601
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:43,470
the person who bought them

602
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:46,110
wasn't me.

Chief Constable Jiang,

604
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:06,840

605
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,510
Drink it if you want.

606
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:11,080
I have no objection.

607
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:13,670
Gosh, Jiang Xinbai,

608
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:15,190
did you hurt your head too?

609
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:17,400
You almost kicked the bucket.

610
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,310
Why cover up for Li Wufang?

611
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:20,650
That jerk should be sentenced to death,

612
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:21,450
not banished!

613
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:22,370
Don't yell.

614
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:25,400
Can you let me finish the decoction first?

615
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:26,770
Anyway, I don't agree.

616
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,800
I don't need your approval

617
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,400
to make any decisions.

618
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:31,530
I don't care.

619
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:33,460
I saved your ass.

620
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:39,810
Thank you.

621
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:46,830
Why don't you ask

622
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,860
how I, Commander Shang,

623
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:50,640
found you

624
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:52,000
at Twelve Music House?

625
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:56,510
You're not hopelessly stupid

626
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:59,650
as to overlook what's hiding in plain sight.

627
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:03,980
Not hopelessly stupid?

628
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:07,870
Can't you just give me a compliment?

629
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:10,830
I'm not kidding.

630
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:12,590
It is…

631
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:14,610
It is a compliment.

632
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:16,310
I'm not kidding either.

633
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:19,310
You can't let Li Wufang off.

634
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:20,630
But

635
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,910
if this matter gets too much attention,

636
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:24,790
those scumbags will know

637
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:26,730
Nanxing is my weakness.

638
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:29,790
Look at you.

639
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:32,740
Hopelessly in love.

640
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,180
You got so badly injured.

641
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:39,910
Yet the clue you got is barely worth it.

642
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:40,910
How frustrating.

643
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:43,320
Think positive.

644
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:45,360
We've also bought time.

645
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,700
It's only two months,

646
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:50,150
but every extra day matters.

647
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:14,540
It's okay.

648
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:24,280
I'm so mad!

649
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,070
I'm so mad!

650
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,320

has been banished to Lingnan.

654

You know what?

657
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:39,489
He should've been

658
00:34:39,489 --> 00:34:41,080
thrown into remote mountains

659
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,409
to be fed to deadly insects.

660
00:34:42,409 --> 00:34:44,330
He deserved worse than that.

661
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:45,530
Someone like him

662
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:46,540
should be fed to poisonous snakes

663
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:47,670
or torn into pieces.

664
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:48,630
Right.

665
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:51,270

666
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:52,590

672
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,080
don't go out

673
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:01,190
for the time being.

674
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:03,430
Even if I want to go out,

675
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:04,220
I can't.

676
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:05,670
He's grounded me.

677
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:12,040
Who can ground our boss?

678

You're staying in willingly, right?

Sai'er.

680
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:22,670
You know what?

681
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:24,570
I think you were right.

682
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,800
Shang Bieli

683
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:27,230
is not as bad as I thought.

684
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:29,430
He came to our rescue this time.

685
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,380
How do you think

686
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:31,880
I can thank him?

687
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,310
Boss.

688
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:37,800
If you want

689
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:39,310
to thank Mr. Shang,

690
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,450
why don't you

691
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:42,270
fix his nose?

692
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,030
Will he let me?

693
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:46,990
He will.

694
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:48,190
Why?

695
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:53,910
Sai'er.

696
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,210
What are you up to this time?

697
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:03,970
[Jingsheng Hall]

698
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:21,880
Why are you here?

699
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:23,760
Where's the butler?

700
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,270
You're not supposed to do this.

00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:28,380
I volunteered.

702
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:30,150
You let me freeload at your house

703
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:31,100
and pay me a salary.

704
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,500
I should do more work.

705
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,310
Mr. Shang.

706
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:35,320
Enjoy your bath.

707
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,420
I don't mind it.

708
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:43,180
But…

709
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:45,370
you're a girl after all.

710
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:46,850
It's not convenient.

711
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:48,310
You may leave.

712
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:50,780
No.

713
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:52,390
If I leave,

714
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:54,050
who will add hot water for you?

715
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:56,420
H-How about this?

716
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:57,660
Mr. Shang, don't worry.

717
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:58,900
I swear not to peek.

718
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,130
I'll be behind the curtain.

719
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:01,730
Call me if you need anything.

720
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:02,660
Enjoy your bath.

721
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:03,030
You…

722
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:14,270
Mr. Shang.

723
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,520
Don't you take off your mask

724
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:17,680
when you take a bath?

725
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:19,600
I once saw you

726
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:21,090
wearing it when sleeping.

727
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:22,550
Isn't it hard to breathe?

728
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,560
I'm used to it.

729
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:28,550
When I took off my mask last time,

730
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:30,720
were you scared?

731
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:31,990
No.

732
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:33,390
Why would I be scared?

733
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,870
I just felt a bit sorry for you

734
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:38,070
when I found out later

735
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:39,910
that you have no sense of smell.

736
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:41,400
Sorry?

737
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:43,120
You can't smell things,

738
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:45,350
so your sense of taste must've been impaired too.

739
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:46,710
No wonder you ate all the food

740
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:47,750
I made last time.

741
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:51,920
Actually, your cooking

742
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:53,870
is not bad.

743
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:56,990
Thank you, Mr. Shang.

744
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:04,030
Mr. Shang.

745
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:06,110
This is the best-selling sachet

746
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:07,890
at Blossom Beauty.

747
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:08,910
It smells great.

748
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:11,310
You can't smell it,

749
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:13,390
but I still think you can give it a try.

750
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:19,950
How does it smell?

751
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:21,520
It smells like…

752
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:25,450
It smells like gardenias

753
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:26,830
and cypress.

754
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:37,930
I wish I could smell it.

755
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,120
Do you mean it?

756
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,820
Mr. Shang,

757
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,390
my boss can treat facial injuries.

758
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:47,590
She can fix your nose.

759
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:51,790
You also think my nose is a problem?

760
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:52,400
No, no.

761
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:53,480
Don't get me wrong.

762
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:54,950
I…

763
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:57,630
I just want you to be able

764
00:38:57,630 --> 00:38:59,090
to smell this world again.

765
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:00,850
Think about it.

766
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:02,580
After your nose is fixed,

767
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:03,970
you'll be able to smell

768
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,100
fragrant flowers

769
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,270
and delicious foods.

770
00:39:08,370 --> 00:39:09,370
Isn't that great?

771
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:11,830
But no one's life

772
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:13,030
is perfect.

773
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:15,590
Thank you.

774
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:18,970
I'll just live with it.

775
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:19,700
Live with it?

776
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:20,950
How can you live with it?

777
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:22,750
You'll have regrets, Mr. Shang.

778
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:30,350
Mr. Shang.

779
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:32,090
I'll be honest with you.

780
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:33,180
Don't be mad.

781
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:35,750
It's not just for your sense of smell.

782
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:37,310
Actually, I also want to see

783
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:39,010
what you look like with a nose.

784
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:46,070
Mr. Shang?

785
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:48,390
Mr. Shang?

786
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:50,150
Mr. Shang!

787
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:53,820
Come in and help me.

788
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:54,430
He's out!

789
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:03,170
Hurry up, Boss.

790
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:04,790
He may wake up soon.

791
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,090
How much knockout drug did you use?

792
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:08,110
I put two taels of it

793
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:09,190
in the sachet.

794
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:10,360
Two taels?

795
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:11,960
That's enough to knock out a tiger.

796
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,440
He may sleep for two days straight.

797
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,450
Mr. Shang is stronger

798
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:15,850
and fiercer than a tiger.

799
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:16,930
Since you know he's fierce,

800
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:17,700
why did you do this?

801
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:18,630
You want me dead?

802
00:40:19,570 --> 00:40:20,740
Boss, I assure you,

803
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:21,930
he wants this.

804
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:22,980
Please.

805
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:24,260
Hurry up.

806
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,970
I need to work tomorrow.

807
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:28,070
Dr. Yan, just do it.

808
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:30,730
Who are you two to rush me?

809
00:40:30,770 --> 00:40:31,690
You're injured.

810
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:32,620
Why are you here?

811
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:33,250
And you.

812
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,060
Who invited you?

813
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:34,700
Be quiet.

814
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:36,160
You're not helping.

815
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:37,510
Dr. Yan.

816
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:39,030
Bieli lost his nose

817
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:40,230
partly because of me.

818
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,150
It's the regret of his life

819
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:42,790
and mine.

820
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:44,690
I hope he can find

821
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:45,700
his old self.

822
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:48,430
Boss, Boss.

823
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,700
His hand is moving.

824
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:50,790
Hurry up!

825
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:52,420
Hurry up.

826
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:54,510
Leave it to me.
