[Episode 3]

4
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:55,070
We've worked together

5
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:56,590
in Lanna Village.

6
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:59,330
Why are you still doing this to me?

7
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,480
Do you have some

8
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,790
special fetish?

9
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,290
Do you need treatment?

10
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:10,740
Why did you tie me up?

11
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:13,790
I'm talking to you.

12
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:14,950
Where are we going?

13
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:20,150
Back to Heman.

14
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,310
Heman?

15
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,190
Again?

16
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:25,930
You're so eager to meet General Nan.

17
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,910
Are you gonna use me as a pawn?

18
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:39,070
You know a lot about Zornia,

19
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,030
want to meet General Nan,

20
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:42,910
and even let me burn

21
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,110
the Zornia field.

22
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:46,230
Are you...

23
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,770
from another faction

24
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:48,850
smuggling Zornia?

25
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,110
Shut up.

26
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:52,230
Don't associate me

27
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:53,160
with that thing.

28
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,579
I'm relieved then.

Zornia's rampant despite multiple bans.

30
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,150
Even His Majesty sent a general

31
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,270
to guard Heman

32
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,820
to prevent its import.

33
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:05,970
Unfortunately, His Majesty sent the wrong person.

34
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:07,910
Do you think

35
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:10,060
General Nan owns that Zornia field

36
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,500
in Lanna Village?

37
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,350
If we go back to Heman,

38
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:14,830
we'll be caught!

39
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:15,990
Don't worry.

40
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,300
I'll keep you safe.

41
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:20,710
Easier said than done.

42
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,900
I don't believe it.

43
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:32,950
It's untied.

44
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:35,140
Did he untie me on purpose?

45
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,430
Should I run away or not?

46
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:41,250
I have to go back to find the antidote.

47
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,290
Instead of taking the risk alone,

48
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:44,550
it's safer to be

54

walk back like this?

55
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:10,010

Don't you drink?

67
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,980
I rarely see men who don't drink.

68
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:18,300
That means you haven't seen

69

enough men.

70
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,680
Why are you looking at me?

71

I'm taking

72
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,940
your advice

73
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:38,510
to look at men.

74
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,950
You were so worried,

75
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:45,760
yet you can joke with me now.

76
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,750
I can't escape anyway.

77
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,600
Might as well take it easy.

Besides,

00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:53,320

80
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:54,580
you'll keep me safe?

81
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:57,610
You trust everything I say?

82
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,520
How can a martial artist

83
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:01,630
be so careless?

84

You don't understand.

87
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:10,800

89
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,770

we'll see.

Tell you what?

97
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:30,690
Since you wanted to arrest me,

98
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:32,810
why did you let me go

99
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:34,830
at the shabby temple?

100
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:43,080
Why do you think I let you go?

101
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,909
Is it because...

102
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:49,920
you can't recognize me?

Xinbai!

110
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,650
Don't come over.

111
00:07:32,909 --> 00:07:33,790
What's wrong?

112
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,710
I'm your mother.

Duke hit his head

115
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,990
and blood stasis pressured his brain,

116
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:48,510
damaging the area

117
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,550
for facial recognition.

118
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:53,350
He's now face-blind.

119
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,750
You haven't told me yet.

120
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:18,870
Sometimes, there's no logic

behind one's actions.

122

on a whim.

124

You can't even lie.

125
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:27,390
Forget it.

Yan Nanxing.

127
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:34,350
Why don't you tell me

128
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,000
how you offended

129
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,030
General Nan?

130
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:44,470
The dishes are here.

131
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:49,180
The dishes are all here.

132
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:49,980
Please enjoy.

133
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:52,710
I have to explain it sooner or later.

134
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,550
Let's test this excuse

135
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:55,990
on him first.

136
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:00,470
Here's the thing.

137
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:03,540
The person in Her Ladyship's room that day

138
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:04,910
wasn't a man,

139
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:06,810
but a woman.

140
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:08,550
She's my senior.

141
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:12,710
I was missing

142
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:14,120
some herbs,

143
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:14,810
so I asked

144
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,230
my senior to help me.

145
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,510
As I went to prepare

146
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,630
the medicine,

147
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:19,830
only my senior

148
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:20,590
and Lady Gaya

149
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:21,790
were left in the room,

150
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:23,470
causing a misunderstanding.

151
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:25,800
General's Residence is heavily guarded.

152
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,990
You think all the guards are blind?

153
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:31,110
This is a secret that can't be told.

154
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:33,570
Don't you know?

155
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:34,930
My senior was born

156
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:36,220
with a masculine face

157
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:37,560
and sturdy physique.

158
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:39,790
She doesn't like being seen.

159
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:42,120
We are a trio of traveling doctors,

160
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:44,460
but outsiders only know about

161
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,080
my mother

162
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:47,470
and I.

163
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:51,640
While

164
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:53,670
being chased by soldiers, she fell into the water.

165
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:54,990
She told me all about

166
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:56,450
how you protected her.

167
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:57,830
Yan Nanxing.

168
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:00,390
You're full of nonsense

169
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:01,710
and so absurd.

170
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:03,930
It was clearly a man

171
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,490
who fell into the water.

172
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:07,410
Why insist it's a woman?

173
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:09,990
Burning the Zornia field

174
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,490
seems satisfying

175
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:13,240
but is in fact troublesome.

176
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:16,350
Impulsive, reckless, and cunning.

177
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:17,870
You are

178
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:20,030
really untrustworthy.

179
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,830
I didn't know

180
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,350
I'm so likeable.

181
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:25,950
What?

182
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:29,000
We've only spent a few days together

183
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:30,960
but you've described me

184
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:31,950
so precisely.

185
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:33,750
You must fancy me.

186
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:35,870
You're hopeless.

187
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,300
Don't deny it.

188
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:42,480
Please come in.

189
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:43,770
Bring me good wine and dishes!

190
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:44,170
Sure.

191
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:45,860
It’s so lively in Heman City.

192
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,440
What's the gossip?

193
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:48,830
Tell us now!

194
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,170
Didn't you see

195
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,020
the wanted posters

196
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,360
throughout the city?

197
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,330
I did!

198
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:56,750
I've met the mother and daughter

199
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:58,910
on the wanted poster.

200
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:02,150
I heard her daughter's pretty.

201
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:03,390
Yes, she is.

202
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:06,150
A loose woman too. Unusual!

203
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:07,560
Loose?

204
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:08,520
Has she no shame?

205
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:09,840
Tell us

206
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:10,800
what's going on.

207
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,420
I heard

208
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:15,190
the mother and daughter rented a house,

209
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,790
where

210
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,680
different men

211
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:19,790
come and go daily.

212
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:23,030
Old, middle-aged, and young;

213
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,380
all sorts!

214
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,850
Just super messy!

215
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:30,030
Are you serious?

216
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:35,500
Not only that,

217
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:37,790
some even saw a child.

218
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:38,990
A child?

219
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:39,950
Even a child?

220
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,300
There's no father,

221
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:42,400
so it must be

222
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:44,420
a bastard!

223
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:46,070
Bastard!

224
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,190
Yummy!

225
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:48,830
That's nothing.

226
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:50,190
To be wanted,

227
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:52,150
they must've committed many sins.

228
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:54,190
It could be deception

229
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:57,190
or even murder and robbery!

230
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:59,820
It's so complicated?

231
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:04,660
Why didn't that loose woman

232
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:05,900
come to us?

233
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:16,000
Who is it?

234
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:17,160
Who attacked me?

235
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,130
What a foul mouth.

236
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:21,100
A disgrace to mankind.

237
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:23,840
Is it your business?

238
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,420
You must be one of

239
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,670
her clients.

240
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:27,440
Cut the crap!

241
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,030
Attack!

242
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:49,790
I was wrong. I'm sorry.

243
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:51,520
Go!

244
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:52,150
Hurry!

245
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:53,510
Hurry and go!

246
00:13:59,190 --> 00:13:59,990
Eat up.

247
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:05,760
[Posthouse]

248
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:07,190
Here.

249
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,640
What's wrong?

250
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,210
Are you down too?

251
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:16,590
It's just nonsense.

252
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:19,070
Nonsense.

253
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:21,950
Is gossiping fun?

254
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:23,630
Spreading nonsense!

255
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:26,470
They even

256
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:27,550
said they

257
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:28,800
saw me with many men.

258
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,280
Are they

259
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:31,440
blind?

260
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:36,030
I have a bastard kid?

261
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:38,430
You're the bastards!

262
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:41,510
Slandering others behind

263
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:42,240
their backs.

264
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,230
Why don't you write a novel?

265
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:46,880
Jerks.

266
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:50,180
Bastards!

267
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:53,050
Do you think I want this life?

268
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,540
Do you think I want

269
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:57,190
to change every day?

270
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:00,750
Who doesn't want

271
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:01,910
a stable life?

272
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,640
Who doesn't want to

273
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,640
hide at home with family

274
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:10,020
and make friends happily?

275
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:15,430
I want to make friends too.

276
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,960
What did I do wrong?

277
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:21,440
I clearly

278
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,110
did nothing wrong.

279
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,900
Why are the Heavens doing this to me?

280
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,430
I'm trying my best.

281
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:34,090
I'm doing so much to help others.

282
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,240
Why can't you

283
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,990
be nicer to me?

284
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,150
Why?

285
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:20,790
Leave.

286
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,630
Go find your mother and senior.

287
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:25,470
Leave?

288
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:27,670
You're letting me go?

289
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:29,230
You believe me?

290
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:31,190
No.

291
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:32,710
Then why?

292
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:35,080
I don't believe your words,

293
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:36,210
but I believe

294
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:37,340
you're not a villain

295
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:38,430
and have

296
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:39,760
your own difficulties.

297
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:45,230
But I've changed my mind.

298
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,030
Anyway,

299
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:49,800
you said you can protect me.

300
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,910
I'll go back to Heman with you

301
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,000
and explain things

302
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:55,160
to that General Nan.

303
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:56,390
Being wanted isn't fun

304
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:57,270
anyway.

305
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:00,590
Risking it to go to Heman

306
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:02,340
just to explain things?

307
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:05,330
Like I'd believe that.

308
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:06,990
Let me ask you.

309
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:10,110
Why did you insist on entering his residence

310
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:11,670
that day?

311
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,550
Let's not pry into

312
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:14,960
each other's business.

313
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,820
Let's just be work partners.

314
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:20,560
That General Nan

315
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:21,660
is so strange.

316
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:24,120
Even if it's to find your antidote,

317
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,050
don't risk it

318
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:25,990
by going

319
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:26,750
to Heman.

320
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:28,720
What do you mean?

321
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,570
His wine

322
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:30,880
doesn't get you drunk!

323
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:32,280
Isn't he an alcoholic?

324
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,200
That's why something's off.

325
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:42,870
I know what you want.

326
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:44,470
I can help you.

327
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:47,630
Do you suspect

328
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:50,280
the Zornia field in Lanna Village

329
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,830
belonged to General Nan?

330
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:53,560
I have two pieces

331
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,530
of info

332
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,930
about him.

333
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:58,790
If you

334
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:00,070
promise to take me back

335
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:00,930
and protect me,

336
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:02,150
I'll tell you.

337
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:03,790
To show my sincerity,

338
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:04,990
I'll tell you one now.

339
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:06,790
Everyone knows

340
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:08,600
Nan Jifeng's an alcoholic.

341
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:11,770
Actually, he's never been drunk.

342
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:14,730
Something's off with his wine.

343
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:17,950
Isn't that

344
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,990
some valuable info?

345
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:22,370
The other's even more important.

346
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:24,190
If you send me back,

347
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:25,390
I'll tell you.

348
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:27,270
Yan Nanxing.

349
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,520
Are you afraid of death

350
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:30,890
or not?

351
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:33,270
I am.

352
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:36,170
But there are things I find

353
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:37,710
scarier than death

354
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,010

Since we're

both headed to General's Residence,

358

I don't trust you.

just explain things.

If they don't believe you,

383
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:00,950
I'll vouch for you.

384

You have to protect me.

You agreed to cooperate.

00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:13,950
You can't ignore me.

for interrogation by the general.

406

without any evidence.

408

00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:50,480
I have no respect for the law?

412
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:54,910
I dare not.

Then I have to thank you.

Imprisoning someone is

illegal.

532
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,350
Where are you going? Keep drinking!

533
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:25,270
Remember our deal.

534
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:25,940
Careful.

535
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:26,800
Keep drinking.

536
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:29,970
Practice and come back tomorrow.

537
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:31,720
I haven't had enough!

538
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,050
Why did you drink so much?

539
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:33,780
Yan Nanxing.

540
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:35,250
Don't fall into the river!

541
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,110
Careful.

542
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:36,950
Yan Nanxing.

543
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:39,950
Yan Nanxing.

544
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:40,870
I'm here.

545
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:42,680
Yan Nanxing.

546
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:43,970
What's wrong with you?

547
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:45,110
Yan Nanxing.

548
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:45,770
What is it?

549
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:46,630
Yan Nanxing!

550
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:50,510
What are you doing?

551
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,920
Are you trying to

552
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:53,150
take advantage of me?

553
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:54,680
I don't trust you,

554
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,660
as I can't see you clearly.

555
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:02,550
I really can't.

556
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,350
What?

557
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:20,070
These are... your eyebrows.

558
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:23,790
Your eyes.

559
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:29,190
Your nose.

560
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,840
Your mouth.

561
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:42,310
Yan Nanxing.

562
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:45,870
What do you look like?

563
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:49,840
I really can't see clearly.

564
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:51,510
I...

565
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:53,030
So I...

566
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:56,660
I don't dare believe you.

567
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:10,350
Forget it.

568
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:12,010
It's not my first kiss.

569
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:13,800
Just think of it as a dog's bite.

570
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:20,690
You're bleeding.

571
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:28,270
I-I'm... I'm fine.

572
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:30,790
You're bleeding so much.

573
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:33,190
It must hurt.

574
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:36,100
Why are you so careless?

575
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,150
Look at you.

576
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:40,550
Dr. Yan.

577
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:44,430
Excuse me.

578
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:45,810
Carry on.

579
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:46,750
I...

580
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,170
Yan Nanxing.

581
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:50,470
Here.

582
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:51,390
Sit down.

583
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:53,960
Slowly.

584
00:31:57,470 --> 00:31:58,190
Don't move.

585
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:01,190
It's loose.

586
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:03,590
Let me wrap it for you.

587
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:08,070
Does it hurt?

588
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:13,550
No.

589
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:21,950
Really?

590
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:31,630
That's good.

591
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:33,670
Remember,

592
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:36,420
I wrapped this for you.

593
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:45,310
My head hurts.

594
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:56,230
Yan Nanxing.

595
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,770
I want to watch fireworks.

596
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:04,110
Watch fireworks.

597
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:06,870
The beautiful ones

598
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:08,850
that are big...

599
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,070
and dazzling.

600
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:16,550
Look.

601
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:18,910
Those

602
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:20,870
big

603
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:23,290
and beautiful ones...

604
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:26,910
Filling the entire sky.

605
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:53,920
♫I'll fetch you the moon in my heart♫

606
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:56,200
♫I dream of the courtyard♫

607
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:59,390
♫It knows my heart♫

608
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:02,320
♫I want to return triumphantly with you♫

609
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:01,750
So beautiful.

610
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:04,420
♫We can listen to the rain♫

611
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,440
Of course it's beautiful.

612
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:05,630
It's so expensive.

613
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:08,560
♫And watch the snowfall in the west hills♫

614
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:07,110
I paid so much for them.

615
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:09,989
Haven't you seen fireworks before?

616
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,699
♫On the streets, the alleys, and the palace♫

617
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:11,639
Must you watch it today?

618
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,830
♫We shall always meet♫

619
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:13,949
Are you done?

620
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:17,739
♫I only hope you fall into my heart♫

621
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:15,800
Bro, I want to go back...

622
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:20,159
♫The fire warms winter days♫

623
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,790
♫Spring can take its time♫

624
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:26,650
♫Everything is as you wish♫

625
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,630
♫We meet with our hearts♫

626
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:31,090
♫Let's not miss each other♫

627
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:35,270
♫You're what I always think about♫

628
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:37,449
♫I'm willing to go to the sky for you♫

629
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:40,270
♫To pluck the moon above the clouds♫

630
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:44,480
♫I'd knit a whole galaxy for you♫

631

♫We meet with our hearts♫

632

♫I'll grow old for you♫

634
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:55,389
♫I want this flower to bloom and never wilt♫

635

636
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,010

637
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:04,330

650
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:26,730
Mr. Xi.

651
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,510
Can you recognize me?

652
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:32,400
What are you talking about? I don't get it.

653
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:35,190
Now you're playing dumb?

654
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:38,190
Are you going to lose your memory later?

655
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:40,630
Can you recognize me?

656
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:41,630
Recognize her?

657
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:44,010
Why's she asking that?

658
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,430
What happened?

659
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:48,690
Yes, even if you turn into ashes.

660
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:51,590
Am I that unforgettable?

661
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:23,670
Where am I?

662
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:25,440
You're in

663
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,280
the General's Residence...

664
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:28,830
My guest room.

665
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:33,050
Why am I here?

666
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:34,690
Why are you here?

667
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:35,900
Ask yourself.

668
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:38,510
You were drunk and refused to leave.

669
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,580
I had to bring you back.

670
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:43,150
I was drunk?

671
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,400
What else did I do?

672
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:51,870
What did you do?

673
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:53,550
Ask yourself.

674
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,480
You

675
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:57,830
touched me from head to toe.

676
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:04,220
You even

677
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,150
told me many, many things.

678
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:10,750
What did I say?

679
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,420
You said...

680
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:17,290
your surname is Xi.

681
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:19,290
You're a tea merchant.

682
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:21,310
You came to Heman

683
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:22,230
to do business.

684
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:23,710
You also said

685
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,270
you feel an affinity with me

686
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:28,000
and want to give me

687
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:29,290
all your earnings.

688
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,210
You're lying again.

689
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,440
I couldn't have told you all that.

690
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:36,430
Drunk words are sober thoughts.

691
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:38,880
Since you said I lied,

692
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:40,950
it can only prove...

693
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:43,910
your surname isn't Xi

694
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,410
and you aren't

695
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:47,770
a tea merchant here for business.

696
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:51,140
You're lying.

697
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:57,450
You don't scare me.

698
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:58,800
Stare all you want!

699
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:01,460
But don't worry.

700
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:03,260
I won't foil your plans.

701
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:04,390
I can tell

702
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,710
you're also a good man

703
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:07,170
with ulterior motives.

704
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:11,670
A good man?

705
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:14,950
How can you be so sure?

706
00:39:15,410 --> 00:39:17,730
You've been protecting me all the way

707
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:19,020
and saved

708
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:20,440
Lanna villagers with me.

709
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,750
I have

710
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:23,430
a sense of loyalty.

711
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:26,310
Since you protected me,

712
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,190
if you need anything,

713
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:29,010
I'll help you.

714
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,550
As long as it

715
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:31,750
doesn't cost money

716
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:32,410
or my life.

717
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:38,270
It can't cost money or your life.

718
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:40,450
Then what can you do for me?

719
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,160
Isn't it obvious?

720
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:44,930
I can put my beauty to good use.

721
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,320
As a girl,

722
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:51,230
can you not be so...

723
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:51,710
So...

724
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:53,170
So... So...

725
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:54,870
shameless, right?

726
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:57,020
I really

727
00:39:57,350 --> 00:39:58,270
don't have

728
00:39:58,290 --> 00:40:00,020
the slightest sense of shame.

729
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:00,830
You...

730
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:02,260
Are you really angry?

731
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:03,830
That makes me

732
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,750
so happy.

733
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:11,290
What are you doing?

734
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:13,480
What do you want?

735
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:16,040
Are you really this kind of person?

736
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:17,260
It's broad daylight.

737
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:18,510
Can't you

738
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:19,870
take a joke?

739
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:21,070
I never

740
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:22,330
joke around.

741
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:24,190
Yan Nanxing.

742
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:26,300
I don't care about your past.

743
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:28,130
Now, remember this.

744
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:30,110
From the moment we came back

745
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:30,990
to Heman,

746
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:32,840
every moment

747
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:34,750
is no longer a joke.
