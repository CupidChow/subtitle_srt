00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:51,470
So handsome.

5
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:52,560
Look at him.

6
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:53,190
Look.

7
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:54,300
That guy.

8
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:55,270
Who is he?

9
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,259
He's so handsome.

10
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,310
Look.

11
00:01:58,509 --> 00:01:59,350
So handsome.

12
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:00,880
Elegant too.

13
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:01,640
Follow him.

14
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:08,530
Greetings, Boss.

15
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:10,900
Hello, ladies.

16
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,670
-Hello.
-Hello.

17
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:15,210
Get a grip.

18
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:17,920
Young man,

19
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:19,510
you're so handsome.

20
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:20,600
I'm Liu Ruoqian,

21
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,680
an Imperial Academy student.

22
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:24,490
Imperial Academy!

23
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:26,590
You're an Imperial Academy student?

24
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,130
You must know how to read.

25
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:29,579
I know a bit.

26
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:30,600
Then

27
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,850
read this recruitment notice

28
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:33,800
for me.

29
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:36,870
Blossom Beauty's hiring

30
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:37,310
women...

31
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:37,910
Stop.

32
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:39,270
Women.

33
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:41,280
Only female workers.

34
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:43,120
That's because

35
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:44,710
you haven't

36
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,150
met me yet.

37
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,650
Yes, yes, yes.

38
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,230
I still only hire women.

39
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,270
Blossom Beauty wants

40
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,030
considerate workers who'll satisfy

41
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:56,950
customers,

42
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:58,500
right?

43
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,440
If I can do that

44
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:08,170
or

45
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:10,540
be better than other women,

46
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:13,360
do you still insist on

47
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,420
only hiring women?

48
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:18,390
Buddy.

49
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,190
Look.

50
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,320
I only have female customers.

51
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,810
The considerate service you said

52
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:25,690
is impossible

53
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,310
as men and women shouldn't be intimate,

54
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:28,950
right?

55
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,610
I have a clear

56
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,040
conscience.

57
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:34,540
Nonsense!

58
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,800
We don't mind.

59
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:37,020
-Yes, we don't mind.
-Yes, we don't mind.

60
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,620
-We don't mind.
-We don't mind.

61
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,660
Let me tell you.

62
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:42,030
Our shop has its principles.

63
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:43,440
Principles are set by people.

64
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,310
Just change them.

65
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:45,910
Boss.

66
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:46,980
Look.

67
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:49,210
Look at what the ladies said.

68
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,220
They're all open-minded.

69
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:52,740
The only one against it

70
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:53,630
is you.

71
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,310
If you

72
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,350
really have concerns,

73
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,440
I can dress up as a woman

74
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,720
in front of you.

75
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:11,170
Is this appropriate?

76
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,580
So appropriate.

77
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,630
-So appropriate.
-So appropriate.

78
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:15,830
Boss.

79
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:17,209
I’m determined

80
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:18,350
to get this job.

81
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,769
My biggest strength

82
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:20,930
is persistence.

83
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:22,190
Then I'll refuse you

84
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:22,920
persistently.

85
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,830
Then I'll visit daily,

86
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:24,580
persistently.

87
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:24,920
You...

88
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,450
I'll work for free

89
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:26,710
during the probation.

90
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:27,670
Is that

91
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:28,670
sincere enough?

92
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:29,590
You'll...

93
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:31,740
work for free?

94
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,080
I'll consider it.

95
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,030
For how long?

96
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:39,780
-What's there to consider?

Ms. Yan.

100

A word, please.

101
00:04:54,409 --> 00:04:55,540
Is everything okay?

102
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:58,400
Is there trouble?

103
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,130
Don't panic.

104
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:00,510
Mr. Jiang's here

105
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,750
to congratulate me

106
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:02,810
on my opening.

107

Check out

108

the new products.

Take a look around.

110
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:26,990
If you yell

111
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,740
so sternly at my shop,

112
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:29,670
it'll seem like

113
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:31,310
I offended the Inspection Office.

114
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:31,950
It'll

115
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:33,690
scare my customers away.

116
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:35,080
If you don’t

117
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:36,110
want to offend us,

118
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,270
don't hire Liu Ruoqian.

119
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:39,030
Why?

120
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:39,880
You should know

121
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,340
he worked in Ghost Market,

122
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,310
so it's clear

123
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:43,400
who his boss was.

124
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,790
I know.

125
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:47,020
But his boss is guilty,

126
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,010
not him.

127
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,480
I hope he wasn't involved.

128
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,970
But you can't be sure

129
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:53,230
or guarantee it.

130
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,040
So,

131
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,590
don't hire him first.

132
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,300
Wait till I figure it out.

133
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,030
Come back.

134

Hey.

do things?

to people

139
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:07,930
like we're suspects.

140
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,990
I-I won't argue with you.

141
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:11,660
But this time,

142
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:13,590
you must trust me.

143
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,560
Why should I?

144
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,640
I'm the one hiring.

145
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:18,420
Besides,

146
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:19,490
he seems nice.

147
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,090
Even working for free.

148
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,360
Mr. Liu, check this out for me.

149
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:32,960

It's for whitening.

Yes.

This is for dark spots.

00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:42,340
She doesn't look like

359
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:43,270
a troublemaker.

360
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,470
How about this?

361
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,490
Let her work to offset her debt.

362
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:48,660
Aren't we

363
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,680
short of workers?

364
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,760
She seems quite smart.

365
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:54,550
Work?

366
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:56,190
I may look like this,

367
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:57,180
but I'm very strong.

368
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,460
I know you're strong.

369
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,180
Since Mr. Lan asked,

370
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,220
you can

371
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,470
stay here to work.

372
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:04,390
I'm leaving. Let's go!

373
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:05,310
Well...

374
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:36,550
Bravo!

375
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:39,430
Bravo!

376
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:42,900
Your Grace,

377
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,370
it's my honor to have you at Longxin Teahouse.

378
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:46,630
I’m waiting for Shang.

379
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:47,890
Don’t bother about me.

380
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,540
Your Grace.

381
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,730
It's dangerous for a noble like you

382
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:53,880
[Li Wufang]

383
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:53,530
with all sorts of people here.

384
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,410
Let me arrange a temporary guard

385
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:56,330
for you.

386
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:58,190
Temporary guard?

387
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:00,350
Tong Sai'er.

388
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:02,460
Yes!

389
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:09,440
What can I do for you?

390
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:10,710
A task for you.

391
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,640
Take good care of this guest.

392
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,250
Don't let anyone bully her.

393
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:16,650
If anyone tries to be unruly,

394
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:18,040
teach them a lesson.

395
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:18,660
Yes.

396
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,680
If you take good care of her today,

397
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:22,550
I'll consider you for

398
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,960
full-time employment.

399
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:26,170
Boss.

400
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:27,390
Alright.

401
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,720
Take care of this distinguished guest.

402
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,720
Enjoy the tea and opera.

403
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:03,630
Ms. Yan.

404
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:06,390
You have

405
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:08,010
a good appetite as usual.

406
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,600
Your shop's now famous in the capital,

407
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,230
but you still

408
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:12,630
took the time to eat here.

409
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:14,250
Any wise words today?

410
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:15,610
Have this too.

411
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:18,360
Buddy.

412
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:19,890
The Mr. Cao

413
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,620
you introduced to me

414
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:23,300
can't be found.

415
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:26,210
I heard he's also a crook.

416
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:27,630
Who would've known?

417
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,920
Any other informants

418
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:31,910
in the capital?

419
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:34,880
There's one more place.

420
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,220
But...

421
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:37,940
What?

422
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,740
But its nature

423
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:42,220
is different from Ghost Market.

424
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:44,900
Elaborate.

425
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:49,290
Longxin Teahouse,

426
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,510
exclusive to

427
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,120
officials and nobles.

428
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,190
Commoners

429
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:57,420
can't enter?

430
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:00,550
Longxin Teahouse's boss comes from

431
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:01,530
a prominent family.

432
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:03,310
He has countless businesses

433
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:04,460
just in the capital.

434
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:05,630
Their fruits

435
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:06,270
and tea

436
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:07,220
are costly.

437
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:08,380
Commoners

438
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:09,470
can't afford them.

439
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:11,349
Like the Moon River tea

440
00:17:11,369 --> 00:17:12,369
exclusive to them

441
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:14,760
is the cream of the crop.

442

If I get there,

443
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:17,160
who should I

444
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:18,750
look for to get info?

445
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:19,770
Well...

446
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:21,609
It's hard to say.

447
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:27,420
Got it.

448
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,050
On days with

449
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:32,350
the number 8,

450
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,990
an informant will be

451
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,430
selling info there.

452
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:37,780
Number 8?

453
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,460
Isn't it the 28th today?

454
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,020
Yes.

455

456

a symbol

come talk to you.

460
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:50,040
It's a complex symbol.

461

Let me tell you.

462
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,070
It's top secret.

463

00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:17,650
Your Grace.

537
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:20,710
What happened last time

538
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:22,160
was an accident.

539
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,150
I didn't mean

540
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:25,100
to tease you.

541
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:26,360
Here.

542
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:27,470
Have some tea.

543
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,610
I haven't touched this cup.

544
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:32,180
This cup of tea

545
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,040
isn't enough to make amends.

546
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:36,930
How about this?

547
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:37,610
I run

548
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,200
a cosmetics shop,

549
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:40,160
Blossom Beauty.

550
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,330
I'll give you

551
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:43,950
a 50% discount for life.

552
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:47,380
I don’t care for that.

553
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:48,750
You know

554
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:50,510
you offended me.

555
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:51,670
It's

556
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:53,300
child's play for me to kick you out

557
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,540
of the capital.

558
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:59,030
Since you are here,

559
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:00,920
Your Grace...

560
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,360
Why don't you show me the way?

561
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:08,310
There is a way.

562
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:11,280
What’s your relationship

563
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:12,730
with Jiang Xinbai?

564
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:15,600
Why are you shocked?

565
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:17,870
With Mr. Jiang skills,

566
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,670
how could you abduct him?

567
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:21,510
Do you think I'm a fool?

568
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:28,620
You and Jiang Xinbai

569
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:31,310
are either close

570
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,620
or...

571
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:35,610
you have something on him.

572
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:40,310
Jiang Xinbai.

573
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,860
You sure are a character.

574
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:44,090
You even have a feud with your sister.

575
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:47,100
Does she not know

576
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,040
Xinbai's face blind?

577
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:51,880
How can I leverage this?

578
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:53,430
Say something.

579
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:56,990
Your Grace.

580
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,030
You and Mr. Jiang

581
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,290
are siblings.

582
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:01,450
Just ask

583
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:03,450
your brother directly.

584
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:04,740
Why make it difficult

585
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,000
for a commoner like me?

586
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:11,710
Go home

587
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:13,130
and put in some effort.

588
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,570
It's best to

589
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:15,590
simplify things.

590
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:17,680
Is that a threat?

591
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:19,230
N-No.

592
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:21,470
Did you tell Xinbai

593
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,010
what I told you that day?

594
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:23,840
No.

595
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:25,700
Really?

596
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:27,150
Yes.

597
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:31,610
I shall take my leave.

598
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:33,820
I'm not done yet.

599
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:36,110
Stop there!

600
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:50,970
Wait.

601
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:52,590
Don't you recall meeting at Ghost Market?

602
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:53,650
I even praised you.

603
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,950
How lively.

604
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:38,890
Commander Shang.

605
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:40,000
Save me.

606
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:44,210
Who are you?

607
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:45,510
How arrogant.

608
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:48,190
I am Jinwu Guards' commander-in-chief,

609
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:49,030
Shang Bieli.

610
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,030
Who are you?

611
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:53,600
I'm Tong Sai'er.

612
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:55,710
A foreigner?

613
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:58,100
You'll still get the same treatment.

614
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,290
Your crimes will be

615
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:01,300
punished accordingly!

616
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:02,450
Stop!

617
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:03,720
My lord.

618
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:05,850
Mr. Shang.

619
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:10,420
Oh no.

620
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,680
Will Jinwu Guards

621
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,730
arrest us?

622
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,280
Commander Shang.

623
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,800
My buddy and I were just

624
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:17,720
messing around.

625
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,120
It's not a private fight.

626
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:20,230
Right, buddy?

627
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,120
Say something.

628
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:23,870
Buddy!

629
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:26,670
Why is he so strange?

630
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,260
He's even wearing a mask.

631
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:30,090
Is he my Young Sir?

632
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,480
Let's take a look.

633
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:41,850
Is this a joke too?

634
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:44,510
She's just playful...

635
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:46,830
Public disturbance!

636
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:47,570
Arrest her!

637
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:48,210
Yes!

638
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:55,230
Good buddies, right?

639
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,200
Not really...

640
00:25:57,730 --> 00:25:58,630
Arrest her too!

641
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:05,120
Suoluo.

642
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:06,230
I'm busy.

643
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:07,390
I'll meet you

644
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:08,500
another day.

645
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:09,550
Mr. Shang.

646
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,880
I've verified it.

647
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:13,630
Yan Nanxing did

648
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,310
go to Heman then.

649
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,040
So I caught

650
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:19,750
the right person.

651
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,470
Let's wait and see

652
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,610
if Xinbai

653
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:24,110
will come pick her up.

654
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:51,830
What's with

655
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:52,960
the ruckus outside?

656
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:54,380
Why was Xinbai's

657
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:55,290
abductor here?

658
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:57,600
Is this place unsafe?

659
00:26:57,890 --> 00:26:59,370
Shang Bieli took my money.

660
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:01,740
He won't let anything happen to me.

661
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:03,310
Jiang Xinbai...

662
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:06,150
is clinging to me

663
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,060
like a leech.

664
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:08,410
Mr. Li.

665
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,570
Why don't you

666
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,120
send me out of the capital?

667
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:12,800
Don't worry.

668
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,540
I'll arrange it soon.

669
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:17,700
[Jinwu Guards]

670
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:25,940
Bro!

671
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:27,230
Here, here, here.

672
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:30,240
Well, it was a misunderstanding

673
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,400
today.

674
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,160
In the martial world...

675
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:33,790
So noisy!

676
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:34,630
Shut up!

677
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:42,310
Buddy.

678
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,030
Buddy...

679
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,100
He has a bad temper.

680
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,270
Let me explain...

681
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,030
Cut the crap!

682
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:56,970
Forget it.

683
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:01,350
I'll spend the night behind bars.

684
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:13,880
I mean,

685
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:16,080
with your skills

686
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:18,060
and temper outside,

687
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:19,660
I thought you

688
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:20,770
were a heroine.

689
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:22,470
You're scared just

690
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:24,590
by being in prison.

691
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:28,160
W-What's wrong?

692
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,920
That's not why I'm crying.

693
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:36,100
Then why are you crying?

694
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,680
How dare you ask me?

695
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:38,820
Fine.

696
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,470
I shouldn't ask you.

697
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:41,780
Even if you're

698
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:42,910
not sleeping,

699
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:44,350
I'm going to sleep.

700
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:45,550
Please cry

701
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:46,370
quietly.

702
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,920
I...

703
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:51,620
How dare you sleep?

704
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:52,460
Get up!

705
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:53,480
Get up!

706
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:54,790
Stand up!

707
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:55,310
You...

708
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:55,940
-Hurry!
-What do you want?

709
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,690
-Get up!
-What do you want?

710
00:28:58,090 --> 00:28:59,290
I want compensation!

711
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:02,580
What's there to compensate for a portrait?

712
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:05,590
Will you pay me?

713
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:07,450
-Will you pay me?
-You…

714
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,950
-Will you pay me?
-What are you doing?

715
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:09,670
Yes, yes.

716
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:11,190
I'll pay, happy?

717
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:12,320
I'll pay.

718
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:13,870
Let me tell you.

719
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:15,700
I have

720
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:17,530
magical hands.

721
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,630
Not just a portrait;

722
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:20,960
it'd only take me 15 mins

723
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:22,060
to fix

724
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:23,260
a person's face.

725
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:24,670
Really?

726
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,400
Of course.

727
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:28,010
Well, my name's Yan Nanxing.

728
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:28,840
And you?

729
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:29,950
Tong Sai'er!

730
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:31,770
Tong Sai'er.

731
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,310
What a nice name.

732
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:35,670
Well,

733
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:37,120
who's it in

734
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,300
that portrait?

735
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,600
Why are you...

736
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:53,160
suddenly silent?

737
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:55,950
Didn't you ask me

738
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,110
to fix the portrait?

739
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,480
If I don't know who it is,

740
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,520
how'd I fix it?

741
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:06,710
Fine.

742
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:08,960
Forget it.

743
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:11,330
I'm unlucky enough today.

744
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,250
Let's talk about

745
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,880
your troubles later.

746
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:19,620
You said you'd

747
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:20,320
fix it for me.

748
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:20,890
Tell me

749
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:21,830
how you'd fix it.

750
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,600
Sai'er.

751
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:26,150
Here's the thing.

752
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:26,790
Look.

753
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,900
To fix the portrait,

754
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,300
we've to get out first.

755
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:31,940
How can we fix it

756
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:32,930
in here?

757
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:36,010
Then how do we get out?

758
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:37,810
How?

759
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:40,430
How?

760
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:42,470
Good question.

761
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:55,400
Poison Girl.

762
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:56,590
We meet again.

763
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:01,030
Why are you here?

764
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:02,850
Here to get me out?

765
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:03,710
What else?

766
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:05,510
Would I stay here myself?

767
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:06,350
Let's go.

768
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:06,830
Okay.

769
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:08,950
Miss.

770
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,270
Who are you?

771
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:11,830
Tong Sai'er.

772
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:12,980
Tong...

773
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:15,580
You and her...

774
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:16,750
Actually,

775
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:18,060
we aren't close.

776
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:21,180
We're very close.

777
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:23,130
You promised

778
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:24,190
to fix my portrait.

779
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:25,350
Ms. Yan.

780
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:27,350
Mr. Jiang said

781
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:28,820
to take you away.

782
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:30,630
Just you.

783
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:34,370
It's an emergency.

784
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:35,730
She's like

785
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:36,910
a freebie.

786
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:38,150
Please.

787
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,260
Do you think this is your home?

788
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:42,370
This is Jinwu Guards' prison.

789
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:43,450
They're our

790
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,280
arch enemies.

791
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:46,770
I'm overstepping bounds to take you out.

792
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:49,310
If it's too hard for you,

793
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,110
I won't go out.

794
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:54,350
Looking for me?

795
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:55,970
How could you threaten me?

796
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:57,880
Thanks. Let’s go.

797
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:06,990
My lord.

798
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,020
She's here.

799
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:15,730
Thank you

800
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:17,390
for saving us.

801
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:19,800
Yan Nanxing.

802
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,630
You must be crazy

803
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:24,130
to break into Jinwu Guards' prison.

804
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,510
I didn't!

805
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:27,220
They arrested me.

806
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:28,920
How many times

807
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:30,680
have you endangered yourself?

808
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:31,840
Do you have

809
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,810
multiple lives?

810
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,400
Don't worry about me.

811
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,150
Just don't drag me

812
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:38,400
into your perils.

813
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:39,710
You...

814
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:48,070
Mr. Jiang.

815
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,010
Taking someone from my prison

816
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,740
without saying goodbye?

817
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:57,310
And yet

818
00:32:57,330 --> 00:32:58,520
you still came.

819
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:03,730
I've never seen you

820
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:06,020
so anxious about a woman.

821
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:08,510
Are you bewitched?

822
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,400
How do I look

823
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:11,430
anxious?

824
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:17,240
Aren't you?

825
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,710
In that case,

826
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,720
I'd like to see

827
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,600
my...

828
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,150
Why are you

829
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:30,830
so rude?

830
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:31,550
You haven't

831
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:32,180
apologized to me.

832
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:33,580
Now you're bullying her.

833
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:39,530
I'll scold him for you.

834
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:41,150
You...

835
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:43,340
Y-Y-You? Are you serious?

836
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,330
Aren't you ashamed

837
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:45,130
bullying two frail ladies

838
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:45,750
as a grown man?

839
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:46,470
Listen.

840
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:47,670
Bully us again

841
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:48,820
and I'll... I'll...

842
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,320
get you arrested!

843
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:56,000
Let's go.

844
00:33:57,770 --> 00:33:58,770
Get you arrested!

845
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:05,010
Did I hear it right?

846
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,150
Get me arrested?

847
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:10,870
Report to you or me?

848
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:15,730
She can report to the Inspection Office.

849
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,480
Fresh candied haws!

850
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:25,280
Candied haws!

851
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,250
How much is it?

852
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,080
Five coppers.

853
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:28,610
Here.

854
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,199
Five coppers for one.

855
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:36,260
Forget it.

856
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:09,030
I...

857
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:17,910
Boss.

858
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:18,810
You're back.

859
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:19,470
Yes.

860
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,560
With a little tail.

861
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,860
It's really a little tail.

862
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,440
This little tail

863
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:45,310
is amazing.

864
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,080
If the portrait's not fixed,

865
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,010
she won't leave.

866
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:49,010
A portrait?

867
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:50,850
What portrait?

868
00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:52,070
Shall I draw another one

869
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:52,840
for you?

870
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,840
R-Ruoqian, hold this for me.

871
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:57,220
I'll be back soon.

872
00:35:57,370 --> 00:35:58,370
Wait, wait, wait.

873
00:35:58,580 --> 00:35:59,620
My shop is here.

874
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:00,310
I won't run.

875
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,170
I...

876
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:03,350
Hello.

877
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:04,560
I'm Liu Ruoqian.

878
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,550
What's your name, Little Tail?

879
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:07,690
What little tail?

880
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,240
I have a name.

881
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,390
I'm Tong Sai'er.

882
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:14,300
Tong Sai'er.

883
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:21,060
What's wrong?

884
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,160
A thank you isn't enough?

885
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,740
You even came to me.

886
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,100
Why did you go to Longxin Teahouse

887
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:30,030
yesterday?

888
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:31,660
Is it

889
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,430
related to the person

890
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:34,630
you were looking for?

891
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,520
Jiang Xinbai and Jinwu Guards don't get along.

892
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:38,960
What if Young Sir's

893
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,240
really a Jinwu Guard?

894
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,000
He'll ruin things.

895
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,400
No.

896
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,350
I heard

897
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:46,440
Longxin Teahouse's

898
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,690
Moon River tea's delicious.

899
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:48,570
I went to try it.

900
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:50,640
Who knew I'd run into

901
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:52,490
someone I didn't want to meet.

902
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,440
Are you

903
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:55,870
referring to

904
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,100
Shang Bieli

905
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:58,550
or Suoluo?

906
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:00,990
Why ask when you already know?

907
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:04,710
Yan Nanxing.

908
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:07,670
Don't mess with

909
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:08,800
either of them.

910
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:10,350
I can't always

911
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:12,040
be by your side to protect you.

912
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:13,330
Mr. Jiang.

913
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:15,190
Why do you still not get it?

914
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:16,590
It's because

915
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:17,820
you're always around me

916
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,250
that I'm in danger.

917
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,390
Without you around,

918
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,470
I might even

919
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:24,040
get along well with them.

920
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,680
So I'm hindering you

921
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:28,310
from making friends?

922
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:30,700
I dare not

923
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:32,120
make friends again

924
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,410
for the rest of my life.

925
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:40,840
Yan Nanxing.

926
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:43,320
It's fine if you don't

927
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,320
see me as a friend.

928
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,190
But I told myself

929
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:47,550
I must

930
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:48,590
protect you

931
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:50,170
if I run into you again.

932
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:53,350
It's my promise to myself.

933
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,010
It has nothing to do with

934
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:56,860
your appreciation.

935
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:00,310
Ridiculous.

936
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:02,350
What appreciation?

937
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:03,900
My lord means

938
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,250
you can't refuse his kindness toward you.

939
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,380
Nonsense!

940
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:12,970
He's just stubborn.

941
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:15,280
Will it kill you to apologize?

942
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:22,050
A vertical stroke.

943
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:23,800
A left-falling stroke.

944
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:24,710
Yes.

945
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:25,670
A right-falling stroke.

946
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:26,430
A dot.

947
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:28,130
A vertical stroke.

948
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:29,350
A left-falling stroke.

949
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:30,590
A right-falling stroke.

950
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:31,150
Yes.

951
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,770
The word "heart" below.

952
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:34,390
A dot. A right curve and hook.

953
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:36,870
Yes.

954
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:39,800
This is the word "Blossom" in Blossom Beauty.

955
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:42,930
Blossom... Beauty.

956
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:45,990
Yes.

957
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:47,430
Try it again.

958
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,110
Okay.

959
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:54,720
Boss!

960
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:57,310
Boss.

961
00:38:57,810 --> 00:38:58,600
Boss, look.

962
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:00,750
Ruoqian taught me to read and write,

963
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:01,770
and told me the names of

964
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:02,830
all your products.

965
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,640
I just wrote this. Look.

966
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:11,380
You sure like

967
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:13,160
calling me Boss.

968
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:18,270
Boss.

969
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:19,830
Sai'er's very smart.

970
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:21,230
A quick learner.

971
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,190
She's illiterate,

972
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:24,150
but she grew up

973
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:25,230
in the mountains

974
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:27,580
and know all kinds of plants and spices.

975
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:28,420
She knows more than

976
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:30,080
I've learnt in medical books.

977
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:33,420
Salves are

978
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,270
identified by their main ingredients.

979
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:36,150
Sai'er can identify them

980
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:36,880
with a whiff.

981
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:38,490
Even I have to

982
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:39,450
consult her.

983
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,640
This is the Seven White Cream.

984
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:49,300
Its main ingredients include Angelica dahurica,

985
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,490
Atractylodes macrocephala, Ampelopsis japonica, Aconite,

986
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:51,450
and Poria cocos.

987
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:52,800
Its main function is...

988
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:56,670
It is...

989
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,500
Nourishing the skin.

990
00:39:58,630 --> 00:39:59,150
Yes.

991
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:00,870
Nourishing the skin.

992
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:02,400
It helps lighten

993
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:03,420
dull skin.

994
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,950
In short, it's for

995
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:06,670
whitening, right?

996
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:08,440
Try one more.

997
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:10,770
This is

998
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,650
Fairy Powder.

999
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:13,830
Its main ingredient is Motherwort.

1000
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:14,590
Function?

1001
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,530
This little girl

1002
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,400
can guess nearly

1003
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:18,360
the full formula

1004
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:19,290
with a whiff.

1005
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:21,090
She's quite eloquent too.

1006
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:23,550
She even remembers so many herbs.

1007
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:25,360
One of you's uncouth

1008
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:27,160
while the other's refined.

1009
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,400
You get along well.

1010
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:30,830
Sai'er.

1011
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:32,150
I need time

1012
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:33,890
to fix your portrait.

1013
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:36,050
Since you've called me

1014
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:37,230
your boss,

1015
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:38,110
how about

1016
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:40,130
staying in my shop for now?

1017
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:41,030
Really?

1018
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:46,310
Boss.

1019
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:47,590
You're so nice to me, Boss.

1020
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:48,320
Stop.

1021
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:49,340
Calm down.

1022
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,280
Listen.

1023
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:51,880
I don't raise idle folk.

1024
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:53,390
You can't stay here

1025
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:54,230
for free.

1026
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:55,580
You've to work for me.

1027
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,870
I'll pay you

1028
00:40:56,890 --> 00:40:57,980
accordingly.

1029
00:40:58,250 --> 00:40:58,810
Yes.

1030
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:02,350
I mean, no.

1031
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:03,460
Why?

1032
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:05,450
I'm still working for

1033
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,540
Longxin Teahouse.

1034
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:07,980
I can't just leave.

1035
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:09,260
Don't worry.

1036
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:11,630
It's just Longxin Teahouse.

1037
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:12,590
I'll talk

1038
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:13,180
to them.

1039
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:14,830
Well,

1040
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:15,730
I...

1041
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:24,310
I owe them money for a meal.

1042
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:26,590
How much?

1043
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:28,230
A little much.

1044
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:36,540
Here.

1045
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:37,300
Eat more.

1046
00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:41,990
Ruoqian.

1047
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:44,250
Your noodles are delicious.

1048
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:46,250
I'll make it for you again.

1049
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:47,150
Here.

1050
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:48,470
Eat more.

1051
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:50,920
I've

1052
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:52,210
already paid your debt

1053
00:41:52,270 --> 00:41:53,470
at Longxin Teahouse.

1054
00:41:53,830 --> 00:41:54,490
From now on,

1055
00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:55,750
just stay here at ease.

1056
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:04,570
But Boss,

1057
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:05,860
although you

1058
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:06,860
paid my debt,

1059
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,600
Longxin Teahouse's boss

1060
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:09,190
Li Wufang

1061
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:10,470
can't be trifled with.

1062
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:12,310
I heard he owns several music houses

1063
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:12,920
and restaurants

1064
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:13,780
in the capital.

1065
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:14,450
Besides,

1066
00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:16,460
his father and grandfather

1067
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,410
are officials.

1068
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:20,000
If you offend him,

1069
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:22,390
he'll make your life miserable.

1070
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:24,260
Boss.

1071
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:26,070
Are we closing down?

1072
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:27,640
Nonsense!

1073
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:30,350
The capital is a place with laws.

1074
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:31,470
Officials are

1075
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:32,680
still under the law.

1076
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:33,870
It's fine. Eat up.

1077
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,100
Officials?

1078
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:41,830
Boss.

1079
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,960
You know an official too.

1080
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:45,360
Yes.

1081
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:46,420
Boss.

1082
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:47,850
Go beg Mr. Jiang.

1083
00:42:48,350 --> 00:42:49,210
That horrid...

1084
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:54,040
That's a horrid choice.

1085
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:55,180
He has no power.

1086
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:56,410
Forget about it.

1087
00:42:57,070 --> 00:42:57,870
But I think

1088
00:42:57,890 --> 00:42:59,090
he's quite powerful.

1089
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:00,790
High-ranking and skilled at fighting.

1090
00:43:00,790 --> 00:43:02,320
Kind and from a good family.

1091
00:43:02,350 --> 00:43:03,520
He also cares a lot about you.

1092
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:04,680
Gentle and elegant.

1093
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:05,910
And Boss...

1094
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:07,340
Stop, stop, stop.

1095
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:08,500
Stop.

1096
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:10,410
Let's eat first.

1097
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:11,120
Come on.

1098
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:12,780
Eat more.

1099
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:13,940
Boss.

1100
00:43:15,330 --> 00:43:17,560
Could it be you like

1101
00:43:17,590 --> 00:43:18,870
the masked guy?

1102
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,150
Shang Bieli?

1103
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:23,710
You know him too?

1104
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:27,560
Do you know why

1105
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:28,810
he's always masked?

1106
00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:30,260
What does he look like?

1107
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:32,140
No idea.

1108
00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:32,950
Masked?

1109
00:43:32,970 --> 00:43:34,170
In all these years,

1110
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,150
no one's seen him

1111
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:36,230
without a mask.

1112
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:42,650
Ruoqian.

1113
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,300
Has he been

1114
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:46,900
living in the capital

1115
00:43:46,930 --> 00:43:49,450
or did he move here later?

1116
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:52,470
He seems to have been here

1117
00:43:52,470 --> 00:43:53,630
for many years.

1118
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:55,030
His background's

1119
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:56,030
a bit mysterious.

1120
00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:02,950
Mysterious?

1121
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:05,590
Could Shang Bieli

1122
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:06,560
be Young Sir?

1123
00:44:06,970 --> 00:44:08,220
Why's he

1124
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:10,630
always wearing a mask?

1125
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:13,600
-Where does he live?
-Where does he live?

1126
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:17,910
[Shang Residence]

1127
00:44:35,270 --> 00:44:36,820
He even sleeps with a mask.

1128
00:44:38,310 --> 00:44:39,100
What's he hiding

1129
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:40,500
under his mask?

1130
00:45:04,190 --> 00:45:05,790
That's Tong Sai'er's knife.

1131
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:08,320
Is she trying to kill Shang Bieli?

1132
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:15,220
She wants to remove his mask.

1133
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:17,340
Why's she so persistent?

1134
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:22,540
Woman?

1135
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:24,400
Assassin!

1136
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:31,780
Go after the assassin!

1137
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:56,750
It's you?

1138
00:45:58,730 --> 00:45:59,610
I...

1139
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:01,270
I can explain.
