I'll make him fall for my trick.

I was born on the day of Gengyin.

178
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:05,470
The Emperor observed my initial demeanor

179
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:08,310
and bestowed upon me a fine name.

180
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:12,120
My name is thus Zhengze.

181
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,250
I heard that you work at Blossom Beauty.

182
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,630
You're working for a woman.

183
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:36,830
Do you

184
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,490
have a crush on your boss?

185
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,630
I heard that woman

186
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:42,240
is indeed pretty.

187
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,020
Lu Bo'an, let me tell you.

188
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,320
You can make fun of me all you want,

189
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,340
but not my boss.

190
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:49,000
More importantly, don't talk nonsense here!

191
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:50,580
So he is Lu Bo'an?

192
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:54,110
What if I want to talk nonsense today?

193
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:56,200
I was looking for a reason to beat you.

194
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:57,200
Who did that?

195
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:57,950
You...

196
00:10:58,350 --> 00:10:59,290
What are you looking at?

197
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:00,390
What are you looking at?

198
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:00,870
I...

199
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:02,750
Beat him!

200
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:04,240
They are beating me!

201
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,730
Go on!

202
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:13,750
Go.

203
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:23,750
Blood...

204
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:25,030
Wu Ming!

205
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:25,910
They're trying to kill me!

206
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:26,370
Wu Ming!

207
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:27,120
This is murder!

208
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,340
Go to the Inspection Office

209
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,340
and find my uncle.

210
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:30,550
Report him!

211
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,220
Who is your uncle?

212
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:33,910
Wu Ming!

213
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:34,950
Wu Ming!

214
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:39,870
My lord.

215
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:41,700
Someone reported

216
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,820
that your nephew

217
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,710
fought with someone in the Imperial Academy

218
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:45,970
and was badly injured.

219
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:48,510
My nephew?

220
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,200
Yes.

221
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:53,210
Yan Nanxing...

222
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:58,450
What happened?

223
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:05,330
Your Grace.

224
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:06,950
What brings you here?

225
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:08,210
Someone made a report.

226
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:11,590
Uncle!

227
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,240
[Respect and uphold justice]

228
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:13,100
Uncle...

229
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:14,560
It's me, Wu Ming.

230
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:15,950
I made the report.

231
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:17,750
Uncle?

232
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:19,730
Mr. Jiang is his uncle?

233
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:21,720
Isn't he from a poor family?

234
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,020
Who beat you up?

235
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:27,430
It's...

236
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:28,820
It's him.

237
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:30,740
It's him.

238
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,460
Take them away.

239
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:32,870
Yes.

240
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:33,530
It wasn't me.

241
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:34,070
Not me.

242
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:34,790
It's them!

243
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:35,620
Not me!

244
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:36,420
It wasn't me.

245
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:37,800
It's not me. It's them!

246
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:39,830
Chief Constable,

247
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:42,050
this is just a small argument among students.

248
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:44,150
There's no need to alarm the Inspection Office, right?

249
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:44,590
Yes.

250
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:45,690
Besides,

251
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,210
it seems to be

252
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:49,090
just a minor injury.

253
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:50,810
A minor injury?

254
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:58,080
Wu Ming!

255
00:12:58,830 --> 00:12:59,430
Wu Ming!

256
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:07,530
This is a minor injury?

257
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:11,360
The chancellor went to the palace to pay respects to the crown prince.

258
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,150
I've sent someone to invite her back.

259
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,590
Why don't we discuss it

260
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:15,860
when she is back?

261
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:17,720
Wu Ming's safety is uncertain.

262
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:18,830
If he dies,

263
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:20,470
it doesn't matter who comes.

264
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:21,800
Take them all away!

265
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:23,210
Yes. Go.

266
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:24,390
Dean Yan!

267
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:24,720
Move!

268
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:25,310
Save me!

269
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:25,690
Wu Ming?

270
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:26,240
Dean Yan!

271
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:26,930
Wu Ming.

272
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:33,750
Put him on that.

273
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,230
Wu Ming.

274
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:42,030
Wu Ming.

275
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,440
What have you done?

276
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:02,310
I...

277
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:03,380
I didn’t ask Bo’an

278
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,150
to fight.

279
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:07,950
The Inspection Office wouldn't have been involved

280
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:09,150
if it was that simple!

281
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:11,510
They're targeting me!

282
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:13,950
Tell me the truth.

283
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,980
Did you implicate Bo'an

284
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,730
because of your incompetence?

285
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,680
Father-in-law, I wouldn't dare.

286
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:21,970
Bo’an

287
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,440
has nothing to do

288
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:24,750
with our business.

289
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:26,640
Father-in-law,

290
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:28,670
you're overthinking.

291
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:30,130
That'd better be the case!

292
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:37,310
Listen.

293
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,310
If anything happens to Bo’an,

294
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:43,130
be it imprisonment, exile,

295
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:44,990
or beheading,

296
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,740
you have to take responsibility for him!

297
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:49,790
Go.

298
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,100
Bring him back.

299
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:53,310
Yes.

300
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:55,510
Slowly.

301
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:56,740
It hurts.

302
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,560
Slowly.

303
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:01,910
It hurts.

304
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:04,040
Are you done?

305
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:09,110
What do you think?

306
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:09,910
Did I do well?

307
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:13,860
Wu Ming, right?

308
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:16,990
I'll send someone

309
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:18,390
to send you back right now.

310
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:19,910
Behave and stay at home.

311
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:20,900
Don't go out

312
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:22,150
in the next 3 days.

313
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:28,390
Before you send me back,

314
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:29,720
let me do one more thing.

315
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:32,830
What are you up to now?

316
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,190
Chief Constable Jiang.

317
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:36,910
Too close.

318
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,470
Chief Constable Jiang.

319
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:41,590
Without me,

320
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:42,390
would you have

321
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:43,990
so easily arrested Lu Bo'an?

322
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,070
Thank you so much.

323
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:49,230
You can go home and rest now.

324
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:50,670
Wait.

325
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:52,030
What now?

326
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:53,450
If you're gonna let me help,

327
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:54,540
let me finish what I started.

328
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:55,590
Just give me an hour

329
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:56,870
in prison with Lu Bo'an.

330
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:57,990
I will definitely get the information

331
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:59,110
you want out of him.

332
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,730
Yan Nanxing.

333
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:02,990
That's enough.

334
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:06,470
Don't worry.

335
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:07,830
I won't

336
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:09,350
go overboard.

337
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,530
Can you really do it?

338
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:17,590
My lord,

339
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:21,060
Chancellor Jiang is here for the students.

340
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:23,680
Just an hour!

341
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,000
I'll get it done for you.

342
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,660
Wait for me.

343
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,430
Chief Constable Jiang, you entered the Imperial Academy

344
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:33,710
as if no one was around.

345
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:35,910
Without any verbal instruction or document,

346
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:38,170
you took away my students just like that.

347
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:39,780
It was an urgent matter.

348
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:41,330
You were not there,

349
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,390
so I had to bring them back first.

350
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:45,190
They fought in the Imperial Academy,

351
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:46,670
not on the street.

352
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,070
Chief Constable Jiang,

353
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:50,350
do you plan to discipline my students for me?

354
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:51,800
I dare not overstep my authority.

355
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,410
The Inspection Office neither interrogated

356
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:54,470
nor punished them.

357
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:56,150
We only brought them back here

358
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:56,960
and let them reflect on themselves

359
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,160
in the prison cells.

360
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:01,080
What will it take for you to let them go?

361
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,069
Give me an hour.

362
00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:07,069
I can't wait.

363
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:09,150
Do you have to make a big deal out of this?

364
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:11,079
You're the one who wants to do that.

365
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:12,990
Didn't you promise

366
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:14,140
not to fight with me?

367
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:15,430
Right after saying that,

368
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:16,710
you decide to take my students

369
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:18,099
without proper reason?

370
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,310
Suoluo.

371
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:23,780
I just need

372
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:25,310
an hour.

373
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:30,190
Fine.

374
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:31,430
Just one hour.

375
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:33,530
Not even a moment more.

376
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,110
Are you awake now?

377
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:05,530
You're fine?

378
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:07,510
Who are you?

379
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,980
Why are you framing me?

380
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:11,710
It doesn't matter who I am.

381
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:14,800
I'm just doing someone a favor

382
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:16,430
in exchange for money.

383
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:18,190
A favor?

384
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:19,840
In this world,

385
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,340
don't you know

386
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:22,970
who hates you the most?

387
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:26,550
My cousin...

388
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:27,850
Li Wufang?

389
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:30,280
Isn't he exiled?

390
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,100
Being exiled won't affect his hatred for you.

391
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,110
What does he want then?

392
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:39,770
He kept a record of all the calligraphy and paintings

393
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:41,350
you processed for him.

394
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:43,080
You pocketed his money.

395
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:44,310
He knows everything!

396
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,220
That stingy guy!

397
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:47,170
He's...

398
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:48,750
He's already in exile

399
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:51,350
and he still cares about that tiny sum of money?

400
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,230
I was just trying my luck.

401
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:55,690
To think you were really this greedy.

402
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,870
You pocketed his money

403
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:01,830
and he's doomed now.

404
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:05,050
Naturally, he wants you to suffer as well.

405
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,460
Tell me.

406
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,480
If I expose

407
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:08,670
this matter,

408
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,310
do you think you can still

409
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:12,110
study in the Imperial Academy in peace?

410
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:13,070
You...

411
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:15,110
How much do you want?

412
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:16,710
Come, sit down.

413
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:20,690
Look at yourself.

414
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:22,370
You're from a noble family.

415
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,710
Of all the things you could have done,

416
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:24,910
why did you have to do that?

417
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:27,110
You even helped people sell fake calligraphy and paintings.

418
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:28,440
Your grandfather, Assistant Minister of Rites,

419
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,700
is a major official...

420
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:32,690
It has nothing to do with my grandfather.

421
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:33,740
My cousin...

422
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:37,470
My cousin and uncle

423
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:38,430
asked me to do it.

424
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:39,830
Besides,

425
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:43,310
I just wanted to make some money.

426
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:45,200
Li Jun and his son

427
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,750
dragged Lu Bo'an into their deal

428
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:47,990
behind Mr. Lu's back?

429
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:50,710
Interesting.

430
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:51,950
You cannot let

431
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:52,950
my grandfather

432
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:54,740
know about this.

433
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:56,990
Otherwise, I'll be doomed.

434
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:00,960
How much do you want?

435
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:02,410
I'll give it to you.

436
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:04,560
As much as I want?

437
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:07,470
Fine.

438
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,050
I'll pretend I didn't hear

439
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:11,470
anything you said today.

440
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:14,400
You look like an honest guy.

441
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:16,060
I won't give you a hard time.

442
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:20,700
Li Wufang is not in the capital.

443
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:23,630
If I lack money in the future...

444
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:26,390
I understand.

445
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,430
If you need money,

446
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:30,040
come to me anytime.

447
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:31,600
I'll give you

448
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,090
everything I have.

449
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:35,190
Look.

450
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:36,510
You're covered in blood.

451
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:38,770
It's inappropriate to go back like this.

452
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:39,470
It's fine.

453
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,750
It's fine.

454
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:02,150
It's been an hour.

455
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:03,170
Where is he?

456
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,090
Chancellor.

457
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:09,310
They're here.

458
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:15,270
It's done.

459
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:19,270
-Chancellor.
-Chancellor.

460
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:20,590
-I’m sorry.
-I’m sorry.

461
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:21,790
I'm glad you're fine.

462
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:24,110
You may go home first.

463
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:24,550
Yes.

464
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:25,100
Go!

465
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:28,430
Wu Ming!

466
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:31,710
Are you okay?

467
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:32,840
I'm fine.

468
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:33,670
My body's fine.

469
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:34,400
I'm leaving.

470
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:35,020
Wait.

471
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,820
You're not a student at the Imperial Academy.

472
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:46,750
Why are you wearing the Imperial Academy's uniform?

473
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:47,590
I...

474
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,350
Chancellor,

475
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:49,590
you don't even recognize

476
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:50,430
your nephew?

477
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:53,990
My nephew?

478
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:00,330
Greetings, Aunt.

479
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,450
Aunt?

480
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,500
Which Yuejiang family are you from?

481
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:16,260
Go now.

482
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:18,760
Uncle.

483
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:19,310
Aunt.

484
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:20,310
I'll visit you

485
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:21,070
next time.

486
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,060
See you.

487
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:28,110
Jiang Xinbai!

488
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,550
You actually found someone

489
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:30,950
to set me up?

490
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:35,150
Suoluo.

491
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:38,790
You once said that

492
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:39,830
the conflict between us

493
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:40,430
is at least

494
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,590
nothing underhanded.

495
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:43,350
I'm returning your words to you.

496
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:43,830
It's not...

497
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,110
If you want to declare war,

498
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:46,440
I'll accept it any time.

499
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,310
Suoluo!

500
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:55,990
Did I cause trouble?

501
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,140
What do you think?

502
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:12,330
Grandfather!

503
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:13,720
Grandfather!

504
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:14,850
-Grandfather.
-Bo’an.

505
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:15,390
Bo’an.

506
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:16,390
Don't be afraid.

507
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:17,290
I'm here.

508
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:18,770
Did they do anything to you?

509
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:19,550
No.

510
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:21,160
This blood...

511
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:22,590
It's not my blood.

512
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:23,150
See?

513
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:23,830
Look.

514
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:25,510
I'm fine. Look.

515
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:27,220
He just locked me up for a while

516
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,600
and told me

517
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:30,440
not to fight again.

518
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:31,990
That's all?

519
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:38,630
But they were very fierce.

520
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:39,560
Grandfather...

521
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:40,740
Alright.

522
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:42,430
As long as you're fine.

523
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,370
I'm fine, Grandfather.

524
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:46,120
That's good.

525
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:03,070
My daughter,

526
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:04,670
don't be angry.

527
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:07,430
Your mother and grandfather are here

528
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:08,890
to uphold justice for you.

529
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:11,550
The Yuejiang clan

530
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,950
has always been upright.

531
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:15,070
No one has done something this ridiculous before.

532
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:15,660
What?

533
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,910
Your sister has barely taken office

534
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:18,970
and you're already

535
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:20,070
in a hurry

536
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:21,410
to drag her down?

537
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:22,830
Xinbai.

538
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:25,990
Didn't your relationship recently improve?

539
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:27,520
Why are you fighting again?

540
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:28,830
Besides,

541
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:29,930
it's considered

542
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:31,190
a family dispute if you

543
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:32,450
argue with her at home.

544
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:33,830
Once you go outside,

545
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:35,830
it becomes a dispute between officials.

546
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:38,160
You've always been calm and considerate.

547
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:40,670
Why did you do such a thing this time?

548
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:44,670
Suoluo.

549
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:47,510
I was wrong

550
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,750
this time.

551
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:51,070
I

552
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:53,430
apologize to you.

553
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:00,590
You can start by telling us

554
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,690
when we suddenly have a

555
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:03,910
nephew in the family.

556
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:07,390
A nephew?

557
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:09,550
What nephew?

558
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:12,170
From which branch of the clan?

559
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:13,950
You came to

560
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:15,110
the Imperial Academy to arrest someone

561
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:15,590
just to

562
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:16,950
stand up for a young man?

563
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,550
Suoluo, stop it.

564
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,100
I think you were just taking advantage

565
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,720
of the situation and got a stranger involved

566
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,480
to make things difficult for me.

567
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,550
W-what young man?

568
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:29,710
Suoluo.

569
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:31,110
What did he look like?

570
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:33,300
Was he

571
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,110
about this tall,

572
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:36,610
fair-skinned, slim,

573
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:37,710
and pretty

574
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:39,030
but not as pretty as me?

575
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,630
Maybe.

576
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:42,390
There's no "maybe"!

577
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:43,070
Yes or no?

578
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:45,820
Yes or no?

579
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:47,060
Do we really have

580
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,590
such a nephew in the family?

581
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:50,540
You still know to come back?

582
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:54,200
You'll be turning back to normal soon.

583
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,660
Of course I must come back.

584
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:01,800
Are you drawing a portrait?

585
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:03,230
Yes.

586
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:04,450
But this time,

587
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:05,610
for some reason,

588
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,190
I just can't draw it well.

589
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:10,040
How about

590
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:11,870
letting me draw instead?

591
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:14,430
Stop bragging.

592
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,930
You don't even remember my face.

593
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:17,060
How will you draw it?

594
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:18,920
You don't understand.

595
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,080
I have a unique skill.

596
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:52,830
Done.

597
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:01,140
Why did you draw me instead?

598
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:09,550
I've changed back!

599
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:13,070
When did it happen?

600
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:16,350
No wonder you drew me.

601
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,520
It looks just like me.

602
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:21,740
You have

603
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,710
such a strange pair of eyes.

604
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:25,980
You can't recognize anyone,

605
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:28,310
but you can draw portraits of such high resemblance.

606
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:29,270
If you like it,

607
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:30,230
I will

608
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:32,030
draw you more.

609
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:33,150
Really?

610
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:34,550
Really.

611
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:37,070
Okay.

612
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:38,250
From now on,

613
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:39,880
I'll always let you draw me.

614
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:42,480
Sure.

615
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:49,660
[Blossom Beauty]

616
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:49,790
Take your time.

617
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:50,770
I'll be right there.

618
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:51,210
Okay.

619
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:52,110
Ms. Yan.

620
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:53,150
Ms. Yan!

621
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:54,500
Blossom Beauty

622
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,830
finally reopened again.

623
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:56,390
Don't

624
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:57,630
disappear again.

625
00:30:58,070 --> 00:30:59,190
Look at my face.

626
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:01,890
I'll become ugly if I don't see you for 3 days.

627
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,800
Mrs. Bao, you're exaggerating.

628
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:05,390
I'll give you a free service later

629
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:07,120
and take good care of your skin.

630
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:07,680
Okay!

631
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,360
Please wait for me over there.

632
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,130
I’ll be right there.

633
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:11,910
Boss!

634
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:14,610
What’s wrong with you?

635
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:16,130
Without explanation, you left us a note

636
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:17,130
about leaving the city.

637
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:18,270
Do you know how worried

638
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:19,330
Ruoqian and I were?

639
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:21,390
Boss.

640
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:22,890
You have no idea

641
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:23,670
how many things happened

642
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:24,730
when you were away.

643
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:26,190
I know.

644
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:28,550
You know?

645
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:32,270
I mean,

646
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:33,510
I can guess it.

647
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,980
You must have been busy.

648
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:35,500
Right?

649
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,010
You poor thing.

650
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:38,190
You must have been so busy.

651
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:39,230
It's time to remove my mask.

652
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:39,870
Someone help me.

653
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:40,310
The customer is looking for you.

654
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:40,880
Hurry up.

655
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:41,890
Get back to work.

656
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:43,270
Take good care of the guests!

657
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:44,190
Coming. Hold on.

658
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:45,230
Be friendly!

659
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:46,870
Yan Nanxing.

660
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:12,970
Nanxing...

661
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,510
I miss you so much.

662
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:17,150
I've been waiting for you here every day.

663
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:18,350
You're finally back.

664
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:22,440
I miss you so much.

665
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:27,600
Greetings...

666
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:28,430
Don't bother.

667
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:30,350
I have a lot to tell you.

668
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:31,440
Let's go.

669
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:33,860
Let's talk inside.

670
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:37,550
Nanxing...

671
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:45,030
You must...

672
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:53,740
Nanxing.

673
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:56,390
You must promise me

674
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:58,670
to hold on to Xinbai's heart.

675
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:00,630
I...

676
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:04,060
Don't back down.

677
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:06,670
Xinbai

678
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:08,990
doesn't have any relationship experience.

679
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:10,320
He's not young anymore.

680
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:12,070
He's easy to get.

681
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:12,920
Trust me.

682
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:17,590
Your Highness, why has

683
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,890
your attitude changed so quickly?

684
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:23,500
Are you sure

685
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:24,960
you want someone like me

686
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:26,450
as your daughter-in-law?

687
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:28,050
I tend to

688
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:29,400
be a freeloader.

689
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:30,640
Besides,

690
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:31,760
I don't know manners

691
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,020
and I'm bad-tempered.

692
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:33,830
And...

693
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:34,950
All right.

694
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,000
It was all Mother's fault.

695
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,870
Mother?

696
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:41,470
Would you like a mother

697
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:42,360
like me?

698
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:46,000
Don't worry.

699
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,650
I will treat you as my own child.

700
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:50,310
I won't be biased towards Xinbai

701
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:52,230
or let you suffer.

702
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:54,260
Besides,

703
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:57,030
I won't be an evil mother-in-law either.

704
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:00,230
Do I still

705
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:02,290
look like an evil mother-in-law?

706
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:06,030
No.

707
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,020
Then call me Mother again.

708
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:12,320
Mother.

709
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:16,020
Like music to my ears.

710
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:34,310
Mother.

711
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:38,550
Are you here at the office in the morning

712
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:40,330
for official matters?

713
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:41,889
I've thought about it.

714
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:43,550
Yan Nanxing

715
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,120
may be a commoner,

716
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,550
but she has a high reputation

717
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:48,409
in the capital.

718
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:50,610
She's a good match for you.

719
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,710
Most importantly,

720
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:55,000
marrying a commoner's daughter means

721
00:34:55,429 --> 00:34:57,230
you won't threaten His Majesty.

722
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:01,990
Mother,

723
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:04,630
I don't want

724
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:06,310
to involve too many

725
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:09,590
calculations and considerations in this marriage.

726
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:10,390
Jiang Xinbai.

727
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:12,790
What do you want your mother to do?

728
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,090
I've already compromised.

729
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:16,990
All the calculations and considerations

730
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:17,910
are my idea,

731
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:18,280
okay?

732
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:19,910
It has nothing to do with you.

733
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,020
No matter what,

734
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:23,470
you two must

735
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:25,110
get engaged as soon as possible.

736
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:25,660
Also!

737
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:28,950
Don't cause

738
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:30,750
any more trouble.

739
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:38,430
Mother.

740
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:41,750
From now on,

741
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:43,340
I will prepare for my marriage

742
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:45,400
with Yan Nanxing as soon as possible.

743
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:50,050
Thank you, Mother.

744
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,530
Thank you for agreeing.

745
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:57,100
I'll get going then.

746
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,190
[Blossom Beauty]

747
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:05,800
Goodbye, ma'am.

748
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:07,670
Please come again

749
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:10,430
Ruoqian, Ruoqian, Ruoqian!

750
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:10,960
Ruoqian!

751
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:12,030
Ruoqian!

752
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:13,290
Oh no.

753
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:14,750
What's wrong?

754
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:15,790
My fiance is dead.

755
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:18,310
What happened?

756
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:20,190
I dreamed that he died last night.

757
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:22,030
It was a dream?

758
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:24,310
Next time,

759
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:25,880
finish your words at once, okay?

760
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:26,640
No.

761
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:29,710
I woke up from crying.

762
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,560
When I think about this,

763
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:33,620
I dare not look for him anymore.

764
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:36,650
You need to know one thing.

765
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:37,280
Dreams

766
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,830
and reality are opposites.

767
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:39,670
Really?

768
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:40,630
Yes.

769
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:42,060
Is Ms. Yan here?

770
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:49,590
Welcome.

771
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:53,510
Ms. Sai'er.

772
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:56,430
Mr. Lan!

773
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,240
I heard that Ms. Yan's

774
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:05,590
contouring technique is excellent.

775
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:06,720
I wonder if you could

776
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,870
help me conceal my imperfection?

777
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,260
Imperfection?

778
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,750
Mr. Lan, your makeup skills

779
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:20,960
are truly amazing.

780
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:22,870
I didn't even notice

781
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:25,220
the scar on your face before.

782
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:27,510
Ms. Yan,

783
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:28,990
you must know that

784
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:30,380
the Qingfeng troupe

785
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:32,570
used to perform at Longxin Teahouse.

786
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:35,330
Now Li Wufang has been convicted and exiled.

787
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:37,530
We need to find a new place to perform.

788
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,950
I'm really anxious

789
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:40,250
to remove this scar.

790
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:41,310
After all,

791
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:43,110
I’m the leader of the troupe.

792
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:44,740
Everyone is counting on me.

793
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:48,320
Mr. Lan,

794
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:51,350
how did you

795
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,860
get this scar?

796
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:55,340
It's a long story.

797
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:57,350
When I was 12,

798
00:37:57,790 --> 00:37:58,920
I got separated

799
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:00,310
from my group during a trip.

800
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:01,220
While finding my way,

801
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:03,100
I ran into a group of bandits.

802
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,760
They were robbing

803
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:06,190
a pregnant woman.

804
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,120
This woman

805
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,280
saw me

806
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:10,500
and shouted for help.

807
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:11,950
In the end,

808
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:12,980
those bandits

809
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:14,500
all ran after me.

810
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:16,000
It was a disaster.

811
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:17,750
I was just a normal teen

812
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:19,150
passing by.

813
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:21,250
I had no means to be a hero.

814
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:23,150
I was no match for them.

815
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,510
Just like that,

816
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:25,630
I got this scar.

817
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:27,430
Otherwise,

818
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:29,640
I wouldn't have ended up like this.

819
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:31,250
It's all that woman's fault.

820
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:31,890
I talked too much.

821
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:32,470
Ms. Yan.

822
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:33,230
Do you think

823
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:34,430
you can remove this scar

824
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:35,550
on my face?

825
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:39,150
You did a good thing.

826
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:40,310
Saving a life has more merit

827
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:41,350
than building a seven-level pagoda.

828
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:41,910
Right?

829
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:43,410
You've done a great deed.

830
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:45,550
I didn't want to!

831
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:47,710
You have no idea.

832
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:48,760
That woman

833
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:50,630
wanted me to marry

834
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:52,150
her unborn child.

835
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,010
If she comes to me in the future,

836
00:38:56,830 --> 00:38:57,310
what

837
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:58,980
will I do?

838
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,800
I talked too much.

839
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:04,470
Ms. Yan.

840
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:05,450
Do you think

841
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:06,950
you can remove this scar

842
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:07,670
on my face?

843
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:10,870
Yes.

844
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:38,400
I'll kill you.

845
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:41,560
Little pig! Little pig!

846
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:42,870
Is she really okay?

847
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:52,580
Young Sir.

848
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:53,680
Young Sir.

849
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:55,130
Young Sir. Young Sir!

850
00:39:55,170 --> 00:39:56,540
Young Sir. Young Sir...

851
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:19,150
So,

852
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,880
Lu doesn't know

853
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:22,170
his precious grandson

854
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:24,330
is being used by Li Jun and his son?

855
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,110
He doesn't.

856
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:29,270
If he knew,

857
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:30,760
he would be distraught.

858
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:32,470
It must feel worse

859
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:33,930
than being tortured by me.

860
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:36,790
It would be interesting

861
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:37,750
if this gets out.

862
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:40,190
We can't do that for now.

863
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:43,880
The more cards we have in our hands,

864
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:45,880
the greater the chance of winning.

865
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:46,830
Right.

866
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:48,260
Lu Dingzhao

867
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:50,950
has been profiting off Zornia for over 20 years.

868
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:52,280
He's not easy to defeat.

869
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:00,720
If anything goes wrong,

870
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:03,910
we will lose the whole game.

871
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:12,410
When was the last time

872
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:14,140
this pigeon house was cleaned?

873
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:15,980
That's why I called you here.

874
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:18,760
How nice of you.

875
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:27,330
You should be careful.

876
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:29,290
Back then, Lu Dingzhao

877
00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:30,940
was able to make your father his scapegoat.

878
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:32,580
Now, he can do the same to you.

879
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:35,950
I'm not afraid.

880
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:37,710
Back then,

881
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:39,700
my father fought alone.

882
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:41,110
But now,

883
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:43,350
I have you guys.

884
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,510
My brother and Yao Qianshu

885
00:41:58,510 --> 00:42:00,110
are on their way to Tingzhou.

886
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:02,440
With my brother on the case,

887
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:04,300
I'm sure they'll find something.

888
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:11,110
I also have a lead right here.

889
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:13,550
It has nothing to do with Zornia.

890
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:16,550
But it has something to do with Yan Nanxing.

891
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,070
Although I promised her not to tell,

892
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:19,630
I think

893
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:20,960
I'm closer to you

894
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:21,870
than to her.

895
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:24,870
Tell me.

896
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:30,870
She asked me to find someone for her.

897
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:32,070
You know that, right?

898
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:35,590
I found him.

899
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:39,360
He's missing

900
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:41,440
and likely dead.

901
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:45,550
You...

902
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:47,320
Are you sure?

903
00:42:50,590 --> 00:42:51,920
This person completely

904
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:53,570
fits her description.

905
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:58,230
It must be hard for her to accept it

906
00:42:58,230 --> 00:42:59,950
since she's been looking for him for so long.

907
00:42:59,950 --> 00:43:01,190
I was troubled too.

908
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:03,590
I mulled over it for a few days

909
00:43:03,950 --> 00:43:06,150
before deciding to discuss it with you.

910
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:11,410
Tell her the truth.

911
00:43:13,470 --> 00:43:14,200
Are you sure?

912
00:43:15,870 --> 00:43:17,270
She deserves to know the truth.
