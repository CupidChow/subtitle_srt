4
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:24,630
Commander Shang,

5
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:25,700
you shouldn’t be like this.

6
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:26,620
Do you know how much

7
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:27,250
effort we put in

8
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,210
for your nose?

9
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:29,230
Sai'er, I...

10
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:29,870
Stop talking.

11
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:30,670
Let me finish.

12
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,120
I'm sure if Lady Gaya

13
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:32,750
and General Nan

14
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:33,510
see you like this,

15
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:34,790
they'd be very sad too.

16
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,550
We all want you to be well.

17
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:37,310
Why can't you

18
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,270
be brave?

19
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:44,550
Commander Shang.

20
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:46,190
Trust me.

21
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:47,370
You look really good

22
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:48,570
with a nose.

23
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:52,550
I won't lie to you.

24
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:18,220
All right.

25
00:03:18,829 --> 00:03:19,990
To celebrate today,

26
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,520
I’ve decided to cook you

27
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:23,850
a new dish I just learned.

28
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:24,630
Wait for me.

29
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:47,579
Don't you think it smells great?

30
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:48,630
Let me tell you,

31
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:49,960
it's also super crispy.

32
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,320
It's crispy. Try it.

33
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,020
Is it good?

34
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,410
It is, isn't it?

35
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,220
Then I'll leave this for you.

36
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:11,390
No one else has it.

37
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:32,330
Not bad, right?

38
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:37,550
Are you not used to it?

39
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:39,070
I'm not used to it either.

40
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:41,409
Regardless, this is a good thing.

41
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,290
Congratulations, Shang.

42
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:45,050
Thank you, Suoluo.

43
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:45,950
But,

44
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:47,670
it would be nice if it were

45
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:48,930
as pretty as your nose.

46
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:50,790
I'm curious.

47
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:53,190
Which miracle worker

48
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,470
managed to restore your nose

49
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,950
to what it was before?

50
00:04:58,909 --> 00:05:00,630
This miracle worker...

51
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:03,970
This...

52
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:05,990
Is it Yan Nanxing?

53
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:10,790
We are sort of like

54
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:12,910
friends now.

55
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,110
In just a few days,

56
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:17,190
you two became good friends?

57
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,590
What about Jiang Xinbai?

58
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:20,560
Jiang Xinbai...

59
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:23,670
Jiang Xinbai

60
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:25,670
and I are also kind of

61
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:26,950
on the same side now.

62
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:28,800
What?

63
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,140
When did you form an alliance?

64
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:34,159
Half a month ago,

65
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,110
His Majesty summoned me.

66
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,550
Jiang Xinbai saved me

67
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:38,480
and my brother.

68
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:40,030
His Majesty

69
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:42,550
ordered me to investigate the Zornia case with him.

70
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,480
Half a month ago?

71
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:46,550
He came to my house five days ago

72
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,050
and asked for Blossom Beauty's title deed.

73
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:50,030
Why didn't he mention anything about it?

74
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:50,470
Did you guys

75
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:51,350
decide on everything

76
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,880
before telling me about it?

77
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:55,070
I knew it. As long as Jiang Xinbai is involved,

78
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,870
I will be treated as an outsider.

79
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:57,950
Suoluo.

80
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:00,030
Suoluo...

81
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:04,750
In the end,

82
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,100
you and Jiang Xinbai are family.

83
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:09,060
I think he’s devoted to investigating the Zornia case

84
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:12,520
and has no intention of competing for the succession with you.

85
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:13,870
Do you mean to say that

86
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,270
he doesn't care about me?

87
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,410
That's not what I mean.

88
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:20,360
I just suddenly find

89
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,310
your conflict

90
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,350
meaningless.

91
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,070
What do you mean?

92
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:26,510
Am I just

93
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,380
a willful child

94
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,520
in your eyes?

95
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,070
That's not what I meant.

96
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:32,710
Shang,

97
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:34,310
are you still my ally?

98
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,090
As long as you're willing,

99
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:40,030
we'll always be confidants.

100
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,030
I see.

101
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,200
No matter what you do,

102
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,159
it won't hurt our friendship.

103
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:47,230
Suoluo.

104
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:48,909

[Blossom Beauty]

106
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,190
Mrs. Bao.

107
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,040
Aren't you good at gathering information?

108
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,030
Ask her about it.

109
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:08,360
Is it true between her and the Duke?

110
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:10,350
I'm also good at curing all sickness

111
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:11,750
and keeping you content.

112
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:13,940
You are closest to Ms. Yan.

113
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:14,630
You're most suited

114
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:15,550
to ask her.

115
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:16,950
That's right, Mrs. Bao.

116
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:17,670
Go ask her

117
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:19,190
about her relationship with the Duke.

118
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:19,910
What's their relationship?

119
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:20,390
Ask her.

120
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:22,270
You can ask her yourself.

121
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:24,180
You're already filled to the brim with gossip.

122
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:24,820
Quit it.

123
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:26,390
Get up.

124
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:27,990
Fine, we'll stop.

125
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:33,990
Boss,

126
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:36,790
are they talking about you?

127
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,140
I feel that they are afraid of you.

128
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:43,480
Good news never spread,

129
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:44,720
gossips never stop.

130
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,690
I guess they heard that

131
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:47,790
I'm the ex-daughter-in-law

132
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:48,920
of the Jiang family,

133
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,260
so they are treating me differently.

134
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,870
They've heard about it already?

135
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:58,560
Of course they have.

136
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,310
Why are you here?

137
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:02,150
Don't you have school today?

138
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:03,870
Today, the ex-chancellor

139
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,390
is teaching at the Imperial Academy.

140
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:07,110
He has always had societal prejudice

141
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:08,910
and wouldn't let me attend class

142
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,800
because I'm from the slave class.

143
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,790
Just because he said so, you relented?

144
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:14,450
What did your chancellor say?

145
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:15,910
You're right.

146
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:18,450
I answer to my chancellor.

147
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:38,570
[Master for all ages]

148
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:33,350
You are now

149
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:35,390
the chancellor.

150
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:37,230
I am

151
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,500
proud of you.

152
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:41,679
You taught me well, Sir.

153
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:43,909
My achievements are thanks to you.

154
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:47,990
Everyone,

155
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,100
as the old saying goes,

156
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:51,650
the husband advocates

157
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:53,030
and the wife follows.

158
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:54,510
A woman

159
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:57,190
should obey her husband

160
00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:59,480
and take care of her family.

161
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:03,050
But nowadays, improper trends in society

162
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,790
make women show themselves in public.

163
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,220
What do you call this?

164
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:10,440
Turning the world upside down!

165
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:12,840
In my opinion...

166
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:13,870
Mr. Cui.

167
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,860
I would like to ask a question.

168
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:33,950
Go ahead.

169
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,080
I don't understand.

170
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,380
Since His Majesty has appointed the worthy,

171
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,550
there is no distinction between classes

172
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:40,500
and gender.

173
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:42,690
So, how can you call it improper?

174
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:45,030
A woman is as knowledgeable as a man.

175
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,300
So why must she blindly obey her husband?

176
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:53,790
You have no right to speak.

177
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:54,350
Leave.

178
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:55,690
It doesn't matter.

179
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:01,350
Which family are you from, young man?

180
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:02,950
I'm Liu Ruoqian.

181
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:04,630
I was born into a slave family,

182
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:06,030
not an aristocratic family.

183
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:06,990
A slave family?

184
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,110
A slave family!

185
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,960
It has been barely

186
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:14,850
two years since I left.

187
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:17,530
When did the Imperial Academy

188
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,020
start recruiting from the slave class?

189
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,850
His Majesty is a wise emperor of Daqi.

190
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,050
I may be born a slave,

191
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,270
but after studying at the Imperial Academy,

192
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,830
I can be a teacher or an official

193
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:32,630
in the future.

194
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:35,120
It is all thanks to His Majesty.

195
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:35,960
Mr. Cui,

196
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:39,400
are you questioning His Majesty's decision?

197
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:51,070
Mr. Cui.

198
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:57,790
The disciples I taught

199
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,480
were familiar with the etiquette of the emperor-subject relationship

200
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,700
but didn’t learn the etiquette of the teacher-student relationship.

201
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,830
Please forgive him.

202
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:09,030
It's fine.

203
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:10,070
It's fine.

204
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:29,130
Do you admit your mistake?

205
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:31,710
I was just discussing knowledge

206
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:32,440
with Mr. Cui.

207
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,510
The chancellor didn't blame me for that.

208
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:38,040
Don't try to save yourself by mentioning her.

209
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:44,600
I told you to go away.

210
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:46,170
How dare you come back?

211
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:49,350
The Imperial Academy recruited a slave

212
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,270
like you to put up a display.

213
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:54,630
Do you really think

214
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,440
you can be a teacher

215
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:58,330
or official in the future?

216
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:01,480
Dream on!

217
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,110
Whether I stay or not

218
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:08,480
depends on the chancellor.

219
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:10,150
How dare you dodge?

220
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:11,930
Hold out your hand!

221
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:18,260
Stop!

222
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:26,080
Chancellor.

223
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,070
Dean Yan,

224
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:28,470
the ruler in your hand

225
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:30,290
is for upholding the rules of the academy.

226
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:32,150
How dare you disregard the rules?

227
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,160
Hand over the ruler.

228
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:42,870
I was too angry

229
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,030
and offended you.

230
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:53,310
Ruoqian,

231
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:54,750
I'm sorry.

232
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:57,840
Chancellor,

233
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:00,850
I'll accept my punishment

234
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:03,670
and copy the student handbook a hundred times.

235
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:05,690
I'll take my leave.

236
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:23,000
Thank you.

237
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:30,850
From today onwards, come to my class.

238
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:32,750
Thank you, Chancellor.

239
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:33,630
You

240
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,840
irritated Dean Yan on purpose, right?

241
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:40,190
You seem gentle and weak,

242
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:41,880
but you are quite scheming.

243
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:43,830
Do I seem weak?

244
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:46,390
Chancellor, have you forgotten?

245
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:48,320
My family members are ironsmiths.

246
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:49,940
I really forgot.

247
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:53,550
You provoked

248
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:55,030
Mr. Cui today.

249
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:56,920
Weren't you afraid?

250
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:58,190
For you,

251
00:13:58,590 --> 00:13:59,450
I'm not afraid.

252
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:01,830
Why?

253
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:04,350
Because I'm on your side.

254
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:07,830
You...

255
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:12,000
You're good at saying nice things.

256
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:22,550
It's my honor to be able to

257
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:24,570
listen in at your classes.

258
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:26,600
I won't let you down.

259
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:38,250
I'll take my leave.

260
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,410
[Assistant Minister of Revenue, Yan Jinglun]

261
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:05,900
Biqing,

262
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,170
your chess moves are messed up.

263
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:11,950
Why go that far

264
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:13,380
for a woman?

265
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:17,310
Father.

266
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:18,740
I...

267
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:21,520
Tomorrow night,

268
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,480
the Yuejiang's Residence is holding an appreciation banquet.

269
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,750
Wasn't Mr. Cui your mentor

270
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:27,680
for a few months?

271
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:30,440
You're considered his student, then.

272
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,700
You should attend it.

273
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:33,250
How about this?

274
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:36,040
I'll accompany you to the banquet.

275
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:38,550
Let's fix

276
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:41,150
the situation.

277
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,400
[Shang Residence]

278
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:14,930
Commander Shang!

279
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:15,730
Commander...

280
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:16,610
Ms. Sai'er.

281
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:17,270
It's late.

282
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:18,200
You're still up?

283
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:20,150
Well,

284
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,190
why hasn't Commander Shang

285
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,470
returned yet?

286
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:24,910
Commander Shang has something important to do today.

287
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:26,370
He may be coming back late.

288
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:41,870
You're an hour late.

289
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,450
You'll know soon

290
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:52,390
how worth it it was

291
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:54,370
for you to wait for an hour.

292
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:58,520
Li Wufang mentioned

293
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:00,550
an agent for the fake calligraphy and paintings.

294
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:01,210
I found him.

295
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:05,109
How?

296
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:07,750
I found a friend who knows calligraphy and painting

297
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,280
to examine the works for me.

298
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:10,800
We found that

299
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,349
those fake calligraphy and paintings

300
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:13,950
were made by the same person.

301
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,630
Then I found

302
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:17,710
the painter behind those fake works

303
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:20,200
and got his ledger.

304
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:23,230
Commander Shang's efficiency

305
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:24,430
is truly formidable.

306
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,950
Mr. Jiang is taking his time with recovery.

307
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:33,350
Someone has to do the work in the meanwhile.

308
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:36,690
The results of the work

309
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:37,750
have yet to be seen.

310
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:41,050
Fine. It's okay if you don't want to take a look.

311
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:42,590
You see?

312
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,330
He's jealous of me.

313
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:45,790
I can do

314
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:47,230
what he can't.

315
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:48,650
I'm jealous of you?

316
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,800
Why would I be jealous of you?

317
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:52,690
That your nose is fake?

318
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:57,710
It may be fake, but it is perfect.

319
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,480
Can you smell anything with it?

320
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:04,990
Of course he can.

321
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:06,070
I'm working on it.

322
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:07,220
He'll be able to smell things in the future.

323
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:07,800
No hurry.

324
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:09,640
Let's get down to business.

325
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:10,630
You're right.

326
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:11,910
You two...

327
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:13,750
Let's get down to business.

328
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:14,480
Give it to me.

329
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:19,710
Lu Bo'an.

330
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:22,910
He is Li Wufang's agent.

331
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:24,350
Lu Bo'an?

332
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,470
Lu Dingzhao's grandson.

333
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:27,470
That's right.

334
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:28,950
He is also

335
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,680
a student of the Imperial Academy.

336
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,790
One grandson sold fake paintings.

337
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,950
The other grandson secretly embezzled money.

338
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:40,740
Lu

339
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,200
is going all out.

340
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:50,630
Lu Dingzhao

341
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:53,480
never personally participates in Zornia trading.

342
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,230
If anything happens,

343
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:56,430
he can completely distance himself

344
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:57,630
from the situation.

345
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,000
In the end,

346
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,120
we still have no evidence.

347
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:09,310
You're holding the ledger in your hand.

348
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,830
What more do you need?

349
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:12,670
This can only prove that

350
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:14,130
our deduction is correct.

351
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:15,770
What else can it prove?

352
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,140
In my opinion,

353
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,310
we should arrest

354
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:21,970
Lu Dingzhao

355
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:22,870
and beat him up

356
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:24,790
until he fesses up to his crimes.

357
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:26,350
Kidnapping an imperial official

358
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:27,850
and torturing him without permission.

359
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:29,720
How many heads do you have for something as risky as that?

360
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,520
Find clues

361
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:31,620
and evidence.

362
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,180
How much time do you have for that?

363
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:34,840
Two months?

364
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:37,240
We don't have that luxury anymore.

365
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,070
Two months?

366
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:39,630
What two months?

367
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,760
If we can't make Lu budge,

368
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,560
we'll start with his grandsons.

369
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:47,380
I'll find a way

370
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,440
to arrest Lu Bo'an.

371
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:51,830
Lu Bo'an is a student of the Imperial Academy.

372
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:53,070
He did nothing.

373
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:56,130
What right do you have to arrest him at the Imperial Academy?

374
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:57,190
Do you have an idea?

375
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:58,270
Tell me.

376
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:03,320
You have no idea either.

377
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:08,550
Mr. Jiang.

378
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,270
Is anything happening

379
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:12,800
in the court lately?

380
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,970
Especially regarding the Ministry of Personnel.

381
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:21,860
The officials assigned by the Ministry of Personnel

382
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:24,120
were all sent to the northwest recently.

383
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:26,740
It's such an important news.

384
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,600
Why didn't you mention it before?

385
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:32,440
There is a general outside the Pass

386
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,570
called Yi Yuanshan.

387
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:35,390
He contributed to eliminating the bandits.

388
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:36,650
Originally, Li Jun recommended him

389
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:37,570
to Heman

390
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:38,710
to replace you.

391
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:41,670
But after the dispatch notice was sent,

392
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:42,790
Yi Yuanshan

393
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,660
took office in Tingzhou instead.

394
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:46,910
So for them,

395
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:48,230
Tingzhou

396
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:49,950
is more important than Heman.

397
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:50,810
It's possible.

398
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,880
But we know nothing

399
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:54,840
about Tingzhou.

400
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:58,830
Mr. Jiang,

401
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:01,960
it's inconvenient for you and Bieli to leave the capital.

402
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,510
Why don't I go to Tingzhou

403
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:04,790
and find out

404
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,070
what they are up to?

405
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:08,520
It's a good idea.

406
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:09,710
Brother,

407
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:11,950
it's not safe for you to go alone.

408
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:13,750
I'll send some Jinwu Guards

409
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:14,750
to accompany you.

410
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:17,510
The Jinwu Guards take attendance regularly.

411
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,790
Once they find a member missing,

412
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:20,590
it'll be hard for you to explain.

413
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:22,030
Why don't you let Yao Qianshu

414
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,150
go with you?

415
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:25,570
You can take care of each other on the way.

416
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:28,960
There's no time to lose.

417
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,690
General Nan,

418
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:32,630
leave with Yao Qianshu as soon as possible.

419
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:34,070
As for Lu Bo'an,

420
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:37,750
I'll talk to Suoluo

421
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,340
and see what I can find

422
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:41,070
before we make the next plan.

423
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:54,710
Tonight,

424
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:57,210
the Yuejiang's Residence is holding an appreciation banquet.

425
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:58,610
Suoluo will be there too.

426
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:00,250
I'll make a trip back home.

427
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:04,020
Wait for me here.

428
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:06,850
I have something to tell you when I come back.

429
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:07,590
Okay.

430
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:09,710
See you.

431
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:19,950
Dr. Yan.

432
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:22,000
I have some progress regarding the person

433
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,130
you asked me to find.

434
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:24,250
How is it going?

435
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:25,590
I'll tell you about it

436
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:27,250
when I make more progress.

437
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:38,820
[Yuejiang's Residence]

438
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,470
Greetings, Your Grace.

439
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:44,690
Thank you, Your Grace.

440
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,370
I can't drink much.

441
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:49,150
I can't drink anymore.

442
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:51,950
Tonight is the appreciation banquet.

443
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:54,410
How can you not drink the appreciation wine?

444
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:55,790
Thank you.

445
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:01,670
Mr. Cui, please.

446
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:04,150
Thank you.

447
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:12,770
Your Highness.

448
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:14,090
I...

449
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:19,690
Are you drunk already?

450
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:22,160
You haven't eaten much yet.

451
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,160
The wife must follow the husband?

452
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,930
How dare you bully my daughter?

453
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:30,950
I'll show him.

454
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:43,400
Congratulations, Your Highness.

455
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,720
The Duke and Duchess are both trusted and valued

456
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,750
individuals of Daqi.

457
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:48,850
His Majesty thinks highly of you.

458
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:52,200
The Yan family is so fortunate

459
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:54,310
-to be in-laws with...
-Father.

460
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:55,430
You're drunk.

461
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:57,190
I'm drunk?

462
00:23:57,890 --> 00:23:59,530
Am I drunk?

463
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,190
Didn't you say

464
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:03,230
you are preparing the

465
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:06,070
betrothal gift for Her Grace?

466
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:08,840
Mr. Yan,

467
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:11,260
you are really drunk.

468
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:13,710
What nonsense are you talking about?

469
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:19,230
At this point,

470
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,100
hiding it any further

471
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,450
would be an act of disrespect

472
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:23,510
to the elders here.

473
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:25,090
Your Highness.

474
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:27,360
Three years ago,

475
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:30,270
Suoluo came to the State of Miluo to study.

476
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,190
We fell in love with each other,

477
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:34,550
so we got engaged there.

478
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:35,470
Nice!

479
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:38,110
What?

480
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:42,190
Is that true?

481
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:45,670
You...

482
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,580
Why didn't you tell me

483
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,310
such big news?

484
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:54,490
Your Highness.

485
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:56,220
It's not Suoluo's fault.

486
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:58,190
It's because I just came back

487
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:01,110
and haven't established a foothold in the court.

488
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:02,640
So we discussed and decided

489
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:05,000
to keep this secret for now.

490
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,350
How considerate of you, Mr. Yan.

491
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,500
Yan.

492
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:20,850
Your Highness.

493
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:23,320
For now, only our two families

494
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:24,680
know about this matter.

495
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,190
Please don't speak of this

496
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:27,390
to the outsiders.

497
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:28,230
Because

498
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:31,030
getting engaged without the parents' knowledge

499
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,910
is not quite a glorious matter.

500
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,550
Your Highness is right.

501
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,560
Since it's a happy event,

502
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:39,830
let's have a toast!

503
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:43,870
Biqing!

504
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:51,370
Thank you, Your Grace and Your Highness.

505
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:23,310
Mr. Yan.

506
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:26,030
Xinbai?

507
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:28,030
Didn't you say you had work tonight

508
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:28,870
and couldn't come back?

509
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:29,630
I'm here

510
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:31,630
to ask Suoluo about something.

511
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:32,150
Xinbai,

512
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:33,690
I'm afraid tonight

513
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:35,030
is a bad time.

514
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:37,640
Something bad happened to Suoluo.

515
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:47,110
Say it!

516
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:51,130
Mother, I know I was wrong.

517
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:52,750
You're wrong?

518
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:54,670
You're only quick to admit it!

519
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:56,150
-Do you know...
-I know.

520
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:57,740
I shouldn't have been engaged

521
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:58,940
without permission.

522
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:01,750
I shouldn't have hidden it from you either.

523
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:03,590
It's not about hiding the matter or not.

524
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:04,190
Do you know...

525
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:05,710
I know I'm immature.

526
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:08,320
I didn't get along with Xinbai,

527
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:09,430
so I

528
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:10,710
went to the State of Miluo

529
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:11,640
alone back then.

530
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:14,070
I studied alone in a foreign state

531
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:15,530
and had no help or support.

532
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:18,110
Yan Biqing

533
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:20,520
took great care of me back then.

534
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:22,270
He also promised me the support

535
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:24,870
of the capital and the noble families when I returned.

536
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:25,260
I...

537
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,100
I made a mistake.

538
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:31,870
It's not just a

539
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:33,190
simple mistake!

540
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:35,440
It's called being foolish!

541
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,770
I know I was wrong.

542
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:38,870
You know?

543
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,370
What do you know?

544
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:42,720
The Yans are nothing.

545
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:45,390
He doesn’t deserve you!

546
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:49,990
The Yans are not

547
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:50,990
a wealthy family,

548
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,110
But because of that,

549
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:57,410
our engagement

550
00:27:58,390 --> 00:27:59,920
will reassure His Majesty.

551
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:03,890
Aren't you thinking ahead of yourself?

552
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,850
His Majesty might be satisfied.

553
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,360
But am I, your mother, satisfied?

554
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,350
You can marry anyone

555
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:09,750
except for that vile man!

556
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:12,850
You think Yan Biqing is a vile man?

557
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,830
It's written all over his face!

558
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:15,830
His father

559
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,960
buttered up to authority and went from

560
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,810
a low-ranking official in the Ministry of Justice

561
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:20,940
to where he is today.

562
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:22,940
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

563
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:23,700
That brat

564
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:24,750
only stayed in the

565
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:26,080
deserted State of Miluo

566
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:28,690
for a decade or two

567
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:30,670
and dared to brag about how well-read

568
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:31,510
and knowledgeable he was.

569
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:32,390
Shameless!

570
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:33,320
Shameless!

571
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,120
Mother, don't be angry.

572
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,520
It's bad for your health.

573
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:38,400
How can I not be angry?

574
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:40,510
Xinbai

575
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:43,590
got married secretly in Heman.

576
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:44,470
And you...

577
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:47,230
got engaged secretly in Miluo.

578
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,310
Who exactly do you two

579
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:50,310
take after?

580
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:55,230
Since Xinbai

581
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:56,510
can get married in Heman

582
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:58,040
before divorcing his wife,

583
00:28:59,070 --> 00:28:59,750
at worse,

584
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,260
I'll divorce Yan Biqing after our marriage

585
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:02,470
and remarry.

586
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:03,400
Nonsense!

587
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:07,090
Marriage is a major milestone in life.

588
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:09,300
You're already thinking about divorce before marriage?

589
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,040
Isn't that a joke?

590
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:13,670
You are the princess's daughter! My daughter!

591
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:27,710
Suoluo.

592
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:28,990
Tell me.

593
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,010
Do you really like

594
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:33,070
Yan Biqing?

595
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:40,270
That's great.

596
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,660
Remember.

597
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:47,640
A good marriage is hard to come by.

598
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:49,200
You must

599
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:51,030
choose a man

600
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:52,670
you genuinely love.

601
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:56,370
If you don't want to marry,

602
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:58,020
no one can force you.

603
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:02,270
Mother.

604
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:09,310
No one can force you

605
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:11,310
to marry anyone.

606
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:13,830
You must treasure yourself.

607
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:15,880
Don't make me worry.

608
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:18,910
Don't let me down again.

609
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:35,310
Suoluo?

610
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:41,230
Suoluo.

611
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:44,630
You didn't have time to attend the banquet,

612
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:45,670
but you have time

613
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:47,200
to rush here and lecture me?

614
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,720
I've been lectured enough

615
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,470
today.

616
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,240
I don't want to hear it anymore.

617
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:52,830
Suoluo.

618
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,410
I've heard about it.

619
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:00,470
If you are doing this

620
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,030
just to spite me,

621
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:03,600
there is no need.

622
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:05,930
I hope you understand.

623
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:08,040
Don't do anything

624
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:09,470
you'd regret.

625
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:11,400
I never regret what I do.

626
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:13,720
Neither do I need anyone's advice.

627
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,470
If there's

628
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:16,290
nothing else,

629
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:18,170
I'll take my leave.

630
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,590
Suoluo!

631
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:33,240
How did it go?

632
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:34,880
How was your talk with Suoluo?

633
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,110
She has her own matters to worry about.

634
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:37,640
Let's think of another way.

635
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:42,440
You told me to wait for you.

636
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:45,010
What were you going to tell me?

637
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:49,790
The moon is full tonight.

638
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:52,990
Yes, what about it?

639
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:58,310
Come home with me.

640
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:00,310
We'll sleep together.

641
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:05,870
Have you forgotten

642
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:07,150
our promise?

643
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:09,560
I'll watch you shapeshift.

644
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,230
You once said

645
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:23,390
you didn't know

646
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:25,190
what you would shapeshift into.

647
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:26,750
You didn't know

648
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:29,630
what kind of danger you would be facing.

649
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:31,330
I want to be with you

650
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:34,210
so that you won't be lonely

651
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:35,970
or afraid anymore.

652
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:49,990
Well?

653
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:52,650
Are you going back with me?

654
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,460
This is what you meant

655
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:19,850
by sleeping together?

656
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:22,390
What else?

657
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:28,170
Then...

658
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:31,250
You're just gonna sit there and watch me?

659
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:32,750
Yes.

660
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:37,170
Go to sleep.

661
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,760
Are you really going to

662
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:43,390
sit and watch me all night?

663
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:48,870
But I don't think it's appropriate.

664
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:50,530
I can't bear to let you do that.

665
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:51,760
This is your bed.

666
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,640
But I'm lying here and you're sitting there.

667
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,970
That's inappropriate.

668
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:56,170
How about this?

669
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:57,390
We'll each take

670
00:33:57,390 --> 00:33:58,250
half of the bed.

671
00:33:58,410 --> 00:33:59,670
We'll sleep together.

672
00:34:21,989 --> 00:34:22,790
This can't do.

673
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:25,330
I have to keep an eye on you.

674
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:25,950
Zhiyi.

675
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:30,050
You didn't sleep well again, did you?

676
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,490
Have some ginseng soup.

677
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:32,510
Here.

678
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,390
My two kids

679
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:39,230
are taking turns to worry me.

680
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:44,200
How can I be fine?

681
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:50,070
Honey.

682
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:52,270
I asked you

683
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:53,620
to keep an eye on Xinbai.

684
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:54,470
Is he

685
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:55,730
up to anything lately?

686
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:57,510
Don't cry.

687
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,310
Xinbai

688
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:02,470
has grown up.

689
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:07,280
Is Yan Nanxing staying at his place again?

690
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:08,870
Is she?

691
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:13,850
Yan Nanxing...

692
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,330
You didn't shapeshift.

693
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:24,150
If not today,

694
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:25,670
it'll happen tomorrow.

695
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:28,940
It's either before or after the full moon anyway.

696
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:31,590
Really?

697
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:33,230
Yes.

698
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:38,070
Well...

699
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:40,270
Since I haven't shapeshifted,

700
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:43,400
I'm going back to Blossom Beauty first.

701
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,600
I'll be back tonight.

702
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:46,390
Again?

703
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:48,070
Yes.

704
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:03,030
Yan Nanxing!

705
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:06,750
What's wrong?

706
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:08,190
Your mother!

707
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,040
My mother?

708
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:09,670
Hurry up.

709
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,510
Come on.

710
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:13,350
Why is my mother here?

711
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:14,300
How would I know?

712
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,480
Hurry up.

713
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:17,440
Where do I go?

714
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:18,230
Hurry.

715
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:19,340
Coming, Mother!

716
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:23,590
Close the door for me.

717
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:24,710
Coming, Mother!

718
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,800
Where is Yan Nanxing?

719
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:31,190
Where is Yan Nanxing?

720
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:31,630
She...

721
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:33,110
I saw her open the door.

722
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:34,070
Where is she?

723
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:35,390
No, she...

724
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,350
Calm down.

725
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:40,670
Were you sleeping together?

726
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:45,210
I agreed to let you run Blossom Beauty together,

727
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:47,070
but I didn't say you could sleep together!

728
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:49,150
We did sleep together,

729
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:50,700
but it's not what you think!

730
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:52,410
How else do you want to sleep?

731
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:53,960
Why couldn't you control yourself?

732
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,290
What do you mean by that?

733
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:56,350
It's not like that!

734
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:02,990
Mother.

735
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:04,310
Mother!

736
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:05,190
Yan Nanxing!

737
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:08,210
Mother...

738
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:20,200
I can explain...

739
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:27,310
You...

740
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,270
He... He!

741
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:32,860
You!

742
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:33,600
You are...

743
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,710
I'm not.

744
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:35,930
He's not...

745
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:37,350
I am.

746
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:39,030
He is...

747
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:40,630
He's not...

748
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:41,390
You...

749
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:43,630
Mother.

750
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:44,710
It's not like that.

751
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:46,050
He...

752
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:47,590
He...
