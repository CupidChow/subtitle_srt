You wore it when you studied

72

I'll make him fall for my trick.

I was born on the day of Gengyin.

178
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:21,470
The Emperor observed my initial demeanor

179
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:24,310
and bestowed upon me a fine name.

180
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:28,120
My name is thus Zhengze.

181
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,250
I heard that you work at Blossom Beauty.

182
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,630
You're working for a woman.

183
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:52,830
Do you

184
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,490
have a crush on your boss?

185
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,630
I heard that woman

186
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:58,240
is indeed pretty.

187
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,020
Lu Bo'an, let me tell you.

188
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,320
You can make fun of me all you want,

189
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,340
but not my boss.

190
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:05,000
More importantly, don't talk nonsense here!

191
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,580
So he is Lu Bo'an?

192
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:10,110
What if I want to talk nonsense today?

193
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,200
I was looking for a reason to beat you.

194
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:13,200
Who did that?

195
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:13,950
You...

196
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:15,290
What are you looking at?

197
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:16,390
What are you looking at?

198
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:16,870
I...

199
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:18,750
Beat him!

200
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:20,240
They are beating me!

201
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:27,730
Go on!

202
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:29,750
Go.

203
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:39,750
Blood...

204
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:41,030
Wu Ming!

205
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:41,910
They're trying to kill me!

206
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:42,370
Wu Ming!

207
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:43,120
This is murder!

208
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,340
Go to the Inspection Office

209
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,340
and find my uncle.

210
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:46,550
Report him!

211
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,220
Who is your uncle?

212
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:49,910
Wu Ming!

213
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:50,950
Wu Ming!

214
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:55,870
My lord.

215
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:57,700
Someone reported

216
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:58,820
that your nephew

217
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,710
fought with someone in the Imperial Academy

218
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:01,970
and was badly injured.

219
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:04,510
My nephew?

220
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:05,200
Yes.

221
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:09,210
Yan Nanxing...

222
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:14,450
What happened?

223
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:21,330
Your Grace.

224
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:22,950
What brings you here?

225
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,210
Someone made a report.

226
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:27,590
Uncle!

227
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,240
[Respect and uphold justice]

228
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,100
Uncle...

229
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:30,560
It's me, Wu Ming.

230
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:31,950
I made the report.

231
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:33,750
Uncle?

232
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:35,730
Mr. Jiang is his uncle?

233
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,720
Isn't he from a poor family?

234
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:40,020
Who beat you up?

235
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:43,430
It's...

236
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:44,820
It's him.

237
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:46,740
It's him.

238
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,460
Take them away.

239
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:48,870
Yes.

240
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:49,530
It wasn't me.

241
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:50,070
Not me.

242
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:50,790
It's them!

243
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:51,620
Not me!

244
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:52,420
It wasn't me.

245
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,800
It's not me. It's them!

246
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:55,830
Chief Constable,

247
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:58,050
this is just a small argument among students.

248
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:00,150
There's no need to alarm the Inspection Office, right?

249
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:00,590
Yes.

250
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:01,690
Besides,

251
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:03,210
it seems to be

252
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:05,090
just a minor injury.

253
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:06,810
A minor injury?

254
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:14,080
Wu Ming!

255
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:15,430
Wu Ming!

256
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:23,530
This is a minor injury?

257
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,360
The chancellor went to the palace to pay respects to the crown prince.

258
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,150
I've sent someone to invite her back.

259
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,590
Why don't we discuss it

260
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:31,860
when she is back?

261
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:33,720
Wu Ming's safety is uncertain.

262
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:34,830
If he dies,

263
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,470
it doesn't matter who comes.

264
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:37,800
Take them all away!

265
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,210
Yes. Go.

266
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:40,390
Dean Yan!

267
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:40,720
Move!

268
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:41,310
Save me!

269
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:41,690
Wu Ming?

270
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:42,240
Dean Yan!

271
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:42,930
Wu Ming.

272
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:49,750
Put him on that.

273
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,230
Wu Ming.

274
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,030
Wu Ming.

275
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,440
What have you done?

276
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,310
I...

277
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:19,380
I didn’t ask Bo’an

278
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,150
to fight.

279
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:23,950
The Inspection Office wouldn't have been involved

280
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:25,150
if it was that simple!

281
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:27,510
They're targeting me!

282
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:29,950
Tell me the truth.

283
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,980
Did you implicate Bo'an

284
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,730
because of your incompetence?

285
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,680
Father-in-law, I wouldn't dare.

286
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:37,970
Bo’an

287
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,440
has nothing to do

288
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:40,750
with our business.

289
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:42,640
Father-in-law,

290
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:44,670
you're overthinking.

291
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,130
That'd better be the case!

292
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:53,310
Listen.

293
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:56,310
If anything happens to Bo’an,

294
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:59,130
be it imprisonment, exile,

295
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:00,990
or beheading,

296
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,740
you have to take responsibility for him!

297
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:05,790
Go.

298
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,100
Bring him back.

299
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:09,310
Yes.

300
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:11,510
Slowly.

301
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:12,740
It hurts.

302
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,560
Slowly.

303
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:17,910
It hurts.

304
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:20,040
Are you done?

305
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:25,110
What do you think?

306
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:25,910
Did I do well?

307
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:29,860
Wu Ming, right?

308
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:32,990
I'll send someone

309
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:34,390
to send you back right now.

310
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:35,910
Behave and stay at home.

311
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:36,900
Don't go out

312
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:38,150
in the next 3 days.

313
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:44,390
Before you send me back,

314
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:45,720
let me do one more thing.

315
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:48,830
What are you up to now?

316
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:52,190
Chief Constable Jiang.

317
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:52,910
Too close.

318
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,470
Chief Constable Jiang.

319
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:57,590
Without me,

320
00:15:57,610 --> 00:15:58,390
would you have

321
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:59,990
so easily arrested Lu Bo'an?

322
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,070
Thank you so much.

323
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,230
You can go home and rest now.

324
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:06,670
Wait.

325
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:08,030
What now?

326
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:09,450
If you're gonna let me help,

327
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:10,540
let me finish what I started.

328
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,590
Just give me an hour

329
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:12,870
in prison with Lu Bo'an.

330
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:13,990
I will definitely get the information

331
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:15,110
you want out of him.

332
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,730
Yan Nanxing.

333
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:18,990
That's enough.

334
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:22,470
Don't worry.

335
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:23,830
I won't

336
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:25,350
go overboard.

337
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,530
Can you really do it?

338
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:33,590
My lord,

339
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,060
Chancellor Jiang is here for the students.

340
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:39,680
Just an hour!

341
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,000
I'll get it done for you.

342
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,660
Wait for me.

343
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,430
Chief Constable Jiang, you entered the Imperial Academy

344
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:49,710
as if no one was around.

345
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:51,910
Without any verbal instruction or document,

346
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:54,170
you took away my students just like that.

347
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:55,780
It was an urgent matter.

348
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:57,330
You were not there,

349
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,390
so I had to bring them back first.

350
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:01,190
They fought in the Imperial Academy,

351
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:02,670
not on the street.

352
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,070
Chief Constable Jiang,

353
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:06,350
do you plan to discipline my students for me?

354
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:07,800
I dare not overstep my authority.

355
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,410
The Inspection Office neither interrogated

356
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:10,470
nor punished them.

357
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:12,150
We only brought them back here

358
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:12,960
and let them reflect on themselves

359
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,160
in the prison cells.

360
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,080
What will it take for you to let them go?

361
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:22,069
Give me an hour.

362
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:23,069
I can't wait.

363
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,150
Do you have to make a big deal out of this?

364
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:27,079
You're the one who wants to do that.

365
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:28,990
Didn't you promise

366
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:30,140
not to fight with me?

367
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:31,430
Right after saying that,

368
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:32,710
you decide to take my students

369
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:34,099
without proper reason?

370
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,310
Suoluo.

371
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:39,780
I just need

372
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:41,310
an hour.

373
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:46,190
Fine.

374
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:47,430
Just one hour.

375
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:49,530
Not even a moment more.

376
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:20,110
Are you awake now?

377
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:21,530
You're fine?

378
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:23,510
Who are you?

379
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,980
Why are you framing me?

380
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:27,710
It doesn't matter who I am.

381
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:30,800
I'm just doing someone a favor

382
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:32,430
in exchange for money.

383
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:34,190
A favor?

384
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:35,840
In this world,

385
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,340
don't you know

386
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:38,970
who hates you the most?

387
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:42,550
My cousin...

388
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:43,850
Li Wufang?

389
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,280
Isn't he exiled?

390
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,100
Being exiled won't affect his hatred for you.

391
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,110
What does he want then?

392
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:55,770
He kept a record of all the calligraphy and paintings

393
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:57,350
you processed for him.

394
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,080
You pocketed his money.

395
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:00,310
He knows everything!

396
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,220
That stingy guy!

397
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:03,170
He's...

398
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:04,750
He's already in exile

399
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:07,350
and he still cares about that tiny sum of money?

400
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,230
I was just trying my luck.

401
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:11,690
To think you were really this greedy.

402
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,870
You pocketed his money

403
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:17,830
and he's doomed now.

404
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:21,050
Naturally, he wants you to suffer as well.

405
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,460
Tell me.

406
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,480
If I expose

407
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:24,670
this matter,

408
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,310
do you think you can still

409
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:28,110
study in the Imperial Academy in peace?

410
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:29,070
You...

411
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:31,110
How much do you want?

412
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:32,710
Come, sit down.

413
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:36,690
Look at yourself.

414
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:38,370
You're from a noble family.

415
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:39,710
Of all the things you could have done,

416
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:40,910
why did you have to do that?

417
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:43,110
You even helped people sell fake calligraphy and paintings.

418
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:44,440
Your grandfather, Assistant Minister of Rites,

419
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,700
is a major official...

420
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:48,690
It has nothing to do with my grandfather.

421
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:49,740
My cousin...

422
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:53,470
My cousin and uncle

423
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:54,430
asked me to do it.

424
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:55,830
Besides,

425
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:59,310
I just wanted to make some money.

426
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:01,200
Li Jun and his son

427
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,750
dragged Lu Bo'an into their deal

428
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:03,990
behind Mr. Lu's back?

429
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:06,710
Interesting.

430
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:07,950
You cannot let

431
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:08,950
my grandfather

432
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:10,740
know about this.

433
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:12,990
Otherwise, I'll be doomed.

434
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:16,960
How much do you want?

435
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,410
I'll give it to you.

436
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:20,560
As much as I want?

437
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:23,470
Fine.

438
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,050
I'll pretend I didn't hear

439
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:27,470
anything you said today.

440
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:30,400
You look like an honest guy.

441
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:32,060
I won't give you a hard time.

442
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:36,700
Li Wufang is not in the capital.

443
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:39,630
If I lack money in the future...

444
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:42,390
I understand.

445
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,430
If you need money,

446
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:46,040
come to me anytime.

447
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:47,600
I'll give you

448
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:49,090
everything I have.

449
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:51,190
Look.

450
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:52,510
You're covered in blood.

451
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:54,770
It's inappropriate to go back like this.

452
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:55,470
It's fine.

453
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,750
It's fine.

454
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,150
It's been an hour.

455
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:19,170
Where is he?

456
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,090
Chancellor.

457
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:25,310
They're here.

458
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:31,270
It's done.

459
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:35,270
-Chancellor.
-Chancellor.

460
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:36,590
-I’m sorry.
-I’m sorry.

461
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:37,790
I'm glad you're fine.

462
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:40,110
You may go home first.

463
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:40,550
Yes.

464
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:41,100
Go!

465
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:44,430
Wu Ming!

466
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:47,710
Are you okay?

467
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:48,840
I'm fine.

468
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:49,670
My body's fine.

469
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:50,400
I'm leaving.

470
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:51,020
Wait.

471
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,820
You're not a student at the Imperial Academy.

472
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:02,750
Why are you wearing the Imperial Academy's uniform?

473
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:03,590
I...

474
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:04,350
Chancellor,

475
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:05,590
you don't even recognize

476
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:06,430
your nephew?

477
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:09,990
My nephew?

478
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:16,330
Greetings, Aunt.

479
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:17,450
Aunt?

480
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,500
Which Yuejiang family are you from?

481
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:32,260
Go now.

482
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:34,760
Uncle.

483
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:35,310
Aunt.

484
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:36,310
I'll visit you

485
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:37,070
next time.

486
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,060
See you.

487
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:44,110
Jiang Xinbai!

488
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:45,550
You actually found someone

489
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:46,950
to set me up?

490
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:51,150
Suoluo.

491
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:54,790
You once said that

492
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:55,830
the conflict between us

493
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:56,430
is at least

494
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,590
nothing underhanded.

495
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:59,350
I'm returning your words to you.

496
00:22:59,350 --> 00:22:59,830
It's not...

497
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:01,110
If you want to declare war,

498
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:02,440
I'll accept it any time.

499
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,310
Suoluo!

500
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:11,990
Did I cause trouble?

501
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,140
What do you think?

502
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:28,330
Grandfather!

503
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:29,720
Grandfather!

504
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:30,850
-Grandfather.
-Bo’an.

505
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:31,390
Bo’an.

506
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:32,390
Don't be afraid.

507
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:33,290
I'm here.

508
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:34,770
Did they do anything to you?

509
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:35,550
No.

510
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:37,160
This blood...

511
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:38,590
It's not my blood.

512
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:39,150
See?

513
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:39,830
Look.

514
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:41,510
I'm fine. Look.

515
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:43,220
He just locked me up for a while

516
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:44,600
and told me

517
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,440
not to fight again.

518
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:47,990
That's all?

519
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:54,630
But they were very fierce.

520
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:55,560
Grandfather...

521
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:56,740
Alright.

522
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:58,430
As long as you're fine.

523
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:01,370
I'm fine, Grandfather.

524
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:02,120
That's good.

525
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:19,070
My daughter,

526
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:20,670
don't be angry.

527
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:23,430
Your mother and grandfather are here

528
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:24,890
to uphold justice for you.

529
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:27,550
The Yuejiang clan

530
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,950
has always been upright.

531
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:31,070
No one has done something this ridiculous before.

532
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:31,660
What?

533
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,910
Your sister has barely taken office

534
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:34,970
and you're already

535
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:36,070
in a hurry

536
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:37,410
to drag her down?

537
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:38,830
Xinbai.

538
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:41,990
Didn't your relationship recently improve?

539
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:43,520
Why are you fighting again?

540
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:44,830
Besides,

541
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:45,930
it's considered

542
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:47,190
a family dispute if you

543
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:48,450
argue with her at home.

544
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:49,830
Once you go outside,

545
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:51,830
it becomes a dispute between officials.

546
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:54,160
You've always been calm and considerate.

547
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:56,670
Why did you do such a thing this time?

548
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:00,670
Suoluo.

549
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:03,510
I was wrong

550
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,750
this time.

551
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:07,070
I

552
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:09,430
apologize to you.

553
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,590
You can start by telling us

554
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,690
when we suddenly have a

555
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:19,910
nephew in the family.

556
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:23,390
A nephew?

557
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:25,550
What nephew?

558
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:28,170
From which branch of the clan?

559
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:29,950
You came to

560
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:31,110
the Imperial Academy to arrest someone

561
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:31,590
just to

562
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:32,950
stand up for a young man?

563
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:35,550
Suoluo, stop it.

564
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:38,100
I think you were just taking advantage

565
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,720
of the situation and got a stranger involved

566
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,480
to make things difficult for me.

567
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:44,550
W-what young man?

568
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:45,710
Suoluo.

569
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:47,110
What did he look like?

570
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:49,300
Was he

571
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,110
about this tall,

572
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:52,610
fair-skinned, slim,

573
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:53,710
and pretty

574
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:55,030
but not as pretty as me?

575
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,630
Maybe.

576
00:25:57,670 --> 00:25:58,390
There's no "maybe"!

577
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,070
Yes or no?

578
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:01,820
Yes or no?

579
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:03,060
Do we really have

580
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,590
such a nephew in the family?

581
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:06,540
You still know to come back?

582
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:10,200
You'll be turning back to normal soon.

583
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,660
Of course I must come back.

584
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:17,800
Are you drawing a portrait?

585
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:19,230
Yes.

586
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:20,450
But this time,

587
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:21,610
for some reason,

588
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:23,190
I just can't draw it well.

589
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:26,040
How about

590
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:27,870
letting me draw instead?

591
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:30,430
Stop bragging.

592
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:31,930
You don't even remember my face.

593
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:33,060
How will you draw it?

594
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:34,920
You don't understand.

595
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,080
I have a unique skill.

596
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:08,830
Done.

597
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:17,140
Why did you draw me instead?

598
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:25,550
I've changed back!

599
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:29,070
When did it happen?

600
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:32,350
No wonder you drew me.

601
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,520
It looks just like me.

602
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:37,740
You have

603
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:39,710
such a strange pair of eyes.

604
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,980
You can't recognize anyone,

605
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:44,310
but you can draw portraits of such high resemblance.

606
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:45,270
If you like it,

607
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:46,230
I will

608
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:48,030
draw you more.

609
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:49,150
Really?

610
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:50,550
Really.

611
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:53,070
Okay.

612
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:54,250
From now on,

613
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:55,880
I'll always let you draw me.

614
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:58,480
Sure.

615
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:05,660
[Blossom Beauty]

616
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:05,790
Take your time.

617
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:06,770
I'll be right there.

618
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:07,210
Okay.

619
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:08,110
Ms. Yan.

620
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:09,150
Ms. Yan!

621
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:10,500
Blossom Beauty

622
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,830
finally reopened again.

623
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:12,390
Don't

624
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:13,630
disappear again.

625
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:15,190
Look at my face.

626
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:17,890
I'll become ugly if I don't see you for 3 days.

627
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,800
Mrs. Bao, you're exaggerating.

628
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:21,390
I'll give you a free service later

629
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:23,120
and take good care of your skin.

630
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:23,680
Okay!

631
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,360
Please wait for me over there.

632
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,130
I’ll be right there.

633
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:27,910
Boss!

634
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:30,610
What’s wrong with you?

635
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:32,130
Without explanation, you left us a note

636
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:33,130
about leaving the city.

637
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:34,270
Do you know how worried

638
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:35,330
Ruoqian and I were?

639
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:37,390
Boss.

640
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:38,890
You have no idea

641
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:39,670
how many things happened

642
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:40,730
when you were away.

643
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:42,190
I know.

644
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:44,550
You know?

645
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:48,270
I mean,

646
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:49,510
I can guess it.

647
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,980
You must have been busy.

648
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:51,500
Right?

649
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,010
You poor thing.

650
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:54,190
You must have been so busy.

651
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:55,230
It's time to remove my mask.

652
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:55,870
Someone help me.

653
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:56,310
The customer is looking for you.

654
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:56,880
Hurry up.

655
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:57,890
Get back to work.

656
00:31:57,890 --> 00:31:59,270
Take good care of the guests!

657
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:00,190
Coming. Hold on.

658
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:01,230
Be friendly!

659
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:02,870
Yan Nanxing.

660
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:28,970
Nanxing...

661
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,510
I miss you so much.

662
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,150
I've been waiting for you here every day.

663
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:34,350
You're finally back.

664
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:38,440
I miss you so much.

665
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:43,600
Greetings...

666
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:44,430
Don't bother.

667
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:46,350
I have a lot to tell you.

668
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:47,440
Let's go.

669
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:49,860
Let's talk inside.

670
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:53,550
Nanxing...

671
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:01,030
You must...

672
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:09,740
Nanxing.

673
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:12,390
You must promise me

674
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:14,670
to hold on to Xinbai's heart.

675
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:16,630
I...

676
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:20,060
Don't back down.

677
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:22,670
Xinbai

678
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:24,990
doesn't have any relationship experience.

679
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:26,320
He's not young anymore.

680
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:28,070
He's easy to get.

681
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:28,920
Trust me.

682
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:33,590
Your Highness, why has

683
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,890
your attitude changed so quickly?

684
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:39,500
Are you sure

685
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:40,960
you want someone like me

686
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:42,450
as your daughter-in-law?

687
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:44,050
I tend to

688
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:45,400
be a freeloader.

689
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:46,640
Besides,

690
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:47,760
I don't know manners

691
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,020
and I'm bad-tempered.

692
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:49,830
And...

693
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:50,950
All right.

694
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,000
It was all Mother's fault.

695
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,870
Mother?

696
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:57,470
Would you like a mother

697
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:58,360
like me?

698
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:02,000
Don't worry.

699
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,650
I will treat you as my own child.

700
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:06,310
I won't be biased towards Xinbai

701
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:08,230
or let you suffer.

702
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:10,260
Besides,

703
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:13,030
I won't be an evil mother-in-law either.

704
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:16,230
Do I still

705
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:18,290
look like an evil mother-in-law?

706
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:22,030
No.

707
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,020
Then call me Mother again.

708
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,320
Mother.

709
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:32,020
Like music to my ears.

710
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:50,310
Mother.

711
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:54,550
Are you here at the office in the morning

712
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:56,330
for official matters?

713
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:57,889
I've thought about it.

714
00:34:58,750 --> 00:34:59,550
Yan Nanxing

715
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,120
may be a commoner,

716
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,550
but she has a high reputation

717
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:04,409
in the capital.

718
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:06,610
She's a good match for you.

719
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:07,710
Most importantly,

720
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:11,000
marrying a commoner's daughter means

721
00:35:11,429 --> 00:35:13,230
you won't threaten His Majesty.

722
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:17,990
Mother,

723
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:20,630
I don't want

724
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:22,310
to involve too many

725
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:25,590
calculations and considerations in this marriage.

726
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:26,390
Jiang Xinbai.

727
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:28,790
What do you want your mother to do?

728
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,090
I've already compromised.

729
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:32,990
All the calculations and considerations

730
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:33,910
are my idea,

731
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:34,280
okay?

732
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:35,910
It has nothing to do with you.

733
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,020
No matter what,

734
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:39,470
you two must

735
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:41,110
get engaged as soon as possible.

736
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:41,660
Also!

737
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:44,950
Don't cause

738
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:46,750
any more trouble.

739
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:54,430
Mother.

740
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:57,750
From now on,

741
00:35:58,270 --> 00:35:59,340
I will prepare for my marriage

742
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:01,400
with Yan Nanxing as soon as possible.

743
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:06,050
Thank you, Mother.

744
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,530
Thank you for agreeing.

745
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:13,100
I'll get going then.

746
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:21,190
[Blossom Beauty]

747
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:21,800
Goodbye, ma'am.

748
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:23,670
Please come again

749
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:26,430
Ruoqian, Ruoqian, Ruoqian!

750
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:26,960
Ruoqian!

751
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,030
Ruoqian!

752
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,290
Oh no.

753
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:30,750
What's wrong?

754
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:31,790
My fiance is dead.

755
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:34,310
What happened?

756
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:36,190
I dreamed that he died last night.

757
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:38,030
It was a dream?

758
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:40,310
Next time,

759
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:41,880
finish your words at once, okay?

760
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:42,640
No.

761
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:45,710
I woke up from crying.

762
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:47,560
When I think about this,

763
00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:49,620
I dare not look for him anymore.

764
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:52,650
You need to know one thing.

765
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:53,280
Dreams

766
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,830
and reality are opposites.

767
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:55,670
Really?

768
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:56,630
Yes.

769
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:58,060
Is Ms. Yan here?

770
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:05,590
Welcome.

771
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:09,510
Ms. Sai'er.

772
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:12,430
Mr. Lan!

773
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,240
I heard that Ms. Yan's

774
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:21,590
contouring technique is excellent.

775
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:22,720
I wonder if you could

776
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,870
help me conceal my imperfection?

777
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,260
Imperfection?

778
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,750
Mr. Lan, your makeup skills

779
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:36,960
are truly amazing.

780
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:38,870
I didn't even notice

781
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,220
the scar on your face before.

782
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:43,510
Ms. Yan,

783
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:44,990
you must know that

784
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:46,380
the Qingfeng troupe

785
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:48,570
used to perform at Longxin Teahouse.

786
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:51,330
Now Li Wufang has been convicted and exiled.

787
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:53,530
We need to find a new place to perform.

788
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,950
I'm really anxious

789
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:56,250
to remove this scar.

790
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:57,310
After all,

791
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:59,110
I’m the leader of the troupe.

792
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:00,740
Everyone is counting on me.

793
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:04,320
Mr. Lan,

794
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:07,350
how did you

795
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,860
get this scar?

796
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:11,340
It's a long story.

797
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:13,350
When I was 12,

798
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:14,920
I got separated

799
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:16,310
from my group during a trip.

800
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:17,220
While finding my way,

801
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:19,100
I ran into a group of bandits.

802
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,760
They were robbing

803
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:22,190
a pregnant woman.

804
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,120
This woman

805
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,280
saw me

806
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:26,500
and shouted for help.

807
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:27,950
In the end,

808
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:28,980
those bandits

809
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:30,500
all ran after me.

810
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:32,000
It was a disaster.

811
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:33,750
I was just a normal teen

812
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:35,150
passing by.

813
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:37,250
I had no means to be a hero.

814
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:39,150
I was no match for them.

815
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,510
Just like that,

816
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:41,630
I got this scar.

817
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:43,430
Otherwise,

818
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:45,640
I wouldn't have ended up like this.

819
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:47,250
It's all that woman's fault.

820
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:47,890
I talked too much.

821
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:48,470
Ms. Yan.

822
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:49,230
Do you think

823
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:50,430
you can remove this scar

824
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:51,550
on my face?

825
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:55,150
You did a good thing.

826
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:56,310
Saving a life has more merit

827
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:57,350
than building a seven-level pagoda.

828
00:38:57,350 --> 00:38:57,910
Right?

829
00:38:58,010 --> 00:38:59,410
You've done a great deed.

830
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:01,550
I didn't want to!

831
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:03,710
You have no idea.

832
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:04,760
That woman

833
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:06,630
wanted me to marry

834
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:08,150
her unborn child.

835
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,010
If she comes to me in the future,

836
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:13,310
what

837
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:14,980
will I do?

838
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,800
I talked too much.

839
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:20,470
Ms. Yan.

840
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:21,450
Do you think

841
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:22,950
you can remove this scar

842
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:23,670
on my face?

843
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:26,870
Yes.

844
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:54,400
I'll kill you.

845
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:57,560
Little pig! Little pig!

846
00:39:57,710 --> 00:39:58,870
Is she really okay?

847
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:08,580
Young Sir.

848
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:09,680
Young Sir.

849
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:11,130
Young Sir. Young Sir!

850
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:12,540
Young Sir. Young Sir...

851
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:35,150
So,

852
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,880
Lu doesn't know

853
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:38,170
his precious grandson

854
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:40,330
is being used by Li Jun and his son?

855
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,110
He doesn't.

856
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:45,270
If he knew,

857
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:46,760
he would be distraught.

858
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:48,470
It must feel worse

859
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:49,930
than being tortured by me.

860
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:52,790
It would be interesting

861
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:53,750
if this gets out.

862
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:56,190
We can't do that for now.

863
00:40:57,950 --> 00:40:59,880
The more cards we have in our hands,

864
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:01,880
the greater the chance of winning.

865
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:02,830
Right.

866
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:04,260
Lu Dingzhao

867
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:06,950
has been profiting off Zornia for over 20 years.

868
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:08,280
He's not easy to defeat.

869
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:16,720
If anything goes wrong,

870
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:19,910
we will lose the whole game.

871
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:28,410
When was the last time

872
00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:30,140
this pigeon house was cleaned?

873
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:31,980
That's why I called you here.

874
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:34,760
How nice of you.

875
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:43,330
You should be careful.

876
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:45,290
Back then, Lu Dingzhao

877
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:46,940
was able to make your father his scapegoat.

878
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:48,580
Now, he can do the same to you.

879
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:51,950
I'm not afraid.

880
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:53,710
Back then,

881
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:55,700
my father fought alone.

882
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:57,110
But now,

883
00:41:58,390 --> 00:41:59,350
I have you guys.

884
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,510
My brother and Yao Qianshu

885
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:16,110
are on their way to Tingzhou.

886
00:42:16,990 --> 00:42:18,440
With my brother on the case,

887
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,300
I'm sure they'll find something.

888
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:27,110
I also have a lead right here.

889
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:29,550
It has nothing to do with Zornia.

890
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:32,550
But it has something to do with Yan Nanxing.

891
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,070
Although I promised her not to tell,

892
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:35,630
I think

893
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:36,960
I'm closer to you

894
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:37,870
than to her.

895
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:40,870
Tell me.

896
00:42:45,870 --> 00:42:46,870
She asked me to find someone for her.

897
00:42:46,870 --> 00:42:48,070
You know that, right?

898
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:51,590
I found him.

899
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:55,360
He's missing

900
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:57,440
and likely dead.

901
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:01,550
You...

902
00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:03,320
Are you sure?

903
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:07,920
This person completely

904
00:43:08,310 --> 00:43:09,570
fits her description.

905
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:14,230
It must be hard for her to accept it

906
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:15,950
since she's been looking for him for so long.

907
00:43:15,950 --> 00:43:17,190
I was troubled too.

908
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:19,590
I mulled over it for a few days

909
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:22,150
before deciding to discuss it with you.

910
00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:27,410
Tell her the truth.

911
00:43:29,470 --> 00:43:30,200
Are you sure?

912
00:43:31,870 --> 00:43:33,270
She deserves to know the truth.
