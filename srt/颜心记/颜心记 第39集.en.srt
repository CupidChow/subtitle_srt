Ms. Bai.

6
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,520
You dropped something.

7
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,110
Mr. Yan.

8
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:43,670
These are my men

9
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:45,710
who fought life and death battles with me.

10
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:46,240
Tonight,

Guys.

13
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:58,790
Now,

14
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,920
I no longer have an official position.

15
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:04,200
Besides, what we're facing tonight is

16

the Imperial Guards.

17
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:08,280
If anything goes wrong,

18
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:11,240
it'll be a capital offence.

19
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:12,830
You...

20

My lord.

21
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,110
The men of the Inspection Office

22
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,440
are not afraid of death.

23

My lord.

24
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:18,300
We trust Commander.

25
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,430
Since he told us to follow you,

26
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,390
everyone from the Jinwu Guards

27
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:22,250
will follow you to death, Mr. Yan.

28

Follow Mr. Yan to death!

Xinbai... He...

34
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,100
He was locked up in the Imperial Prison.

35
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,110
Now, only by saving His Majesty

36
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,370
can we save Xinbai.

37
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:03,820
However,

38
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:06,220
our mission in the palace this time is extremely dangerous.

39
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,760

but what errand

47

brings you to the palace, Your Grace?

48
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:29,040

this is...

She is a female physician

52
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,790
I brought from Yuejiang's Residence.

53
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:37,010
She was also summoned here

54
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,010
to nurse Her Majesty back to health.

55

A female physician?

That's right.

Please.

It's indeed Zornia.

Is there a way to detoxify it?

91
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:18,950
I'll use acupuncture

92
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,480
to control the toxin first.

93
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,490
As for detoxification,

94
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:30,110
I'll use my blood

95
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:31,510
to detoxify His Majesty.

96
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:33,950
Will this really work?

00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:36,150
Your Majesty.

98
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:38,310

00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:02,040
What are you talking about?

102
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,220
What happened to my voice?

Good!

106

You...

107
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,390
You can actually shapeshift

108

into someone you know.

Let me go.

111
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:26,010
Otherwise,

112
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,740
Xinbai won't let you off.

113
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:28,910
Okay.

114
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:31,020
As long as you cooperate.

115
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:32,260
Tell me

116
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,640
how you did it,

117
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:34,730
and I'll let you go.

118
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:36,679
You really want to know?

119
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:41,630
As long as you don't kill me,

120
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:43,710
I'll tell you.

121
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:52,300
Are you trying to play tricks on me?

122
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,310
Your little tricks are far too stupid

123
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:00,550
to fool me.

124
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:02,250
Bai Yuchen.

125
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,230
When did you become

126
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:04,910
so ignorant of current circumstances?

127
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,370
The only thing I care about

128
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,350
is the Princess.

129
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:15,950
Pei Linfu.

130
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:18,730
You'll die a miserable death.

My lord.

132
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:33,050
Her Majesty brought someone into His Majesty's study.

133

Who's causing trouble?

134
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:55,310
I can accept that

135
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,770
His Majesty dismissed me.

136
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:58,470
But the Inspection Office also got disbanded.

137
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:00,070

138
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,270
Yes!

139

The Jinwu Guards

140
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:04,990
also want to seek justice for Commander Shang.

141
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:05,830
Yes!

142
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,470
You broke into the palace and caused trouble in the middle of the night.

143
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:08,470
Do you want to die?

144
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:10,150
I just want to see His Majesty.

145
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,090
How dare you act so recklessly

146
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:12,220
in the Royal Palace?

147
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:13,710
Imperial Guards, listen to my orders.

148
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:14,910
No one is allowed in.

149
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,840
Yes!

150
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:20,010
We need to see His Majesty!

151
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:21,490
We need to see His Majesty!

152
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:23,010
We need to see His Majesty!

153
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,250
We need to see His Majesty!

154
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:27,650
We need to see His Majesty!

155
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,210
We need to see His Majesty!

156

Who's that?

157
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:59,590
Jiang Xinbai.

158

Jiang Xinbai!

159
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:05,120
Shang Bieli.

160
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:23,550
Suoluo and Yan Nanxing

161
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:25,110
are saving His Majesty in the Imperial Study.

162
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:27,440
We need to go and help them as soon as we can.

163
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:35,990
Your Majesty.

164
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:43,710
Your Majesty.

165
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:48,880
Why is His Majesty still not awake?

166
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:53,480
It may take some time for the medicine to take effect.

167
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:56,360
How dare you!

168
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,070
How dare you attempt to murder His Majesty!

169
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:59,030
Protect His Majesty!

170
00:11:59,030 --> 00:11:59,630
Oh no.

171
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:02,390
Your Majesty.

172
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:03,030

How dare you!

Your Majesty.

175
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:08,110
You're fooled.

176
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,070
You actually got instigated by the traitors

177
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:11,330
to murder His Majesty.

178
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,500
Pei Linfu, it's you!

179
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,550
You mutinied, committed insurrection,

180
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:16,790
and poisoned His Majesty!

181
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:17,670
So what?

182
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:18,790
Now everything

183
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:21,390
is under my control.

184
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,320
Even if I kill you,

185
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:26,550
who can do anything to me?

186
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:27,550
Pei Linfu.

187
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:29,470
I've detoxified His Majesty.

188
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:30,870
You can't get away with this.

189
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:31,710
Although

190
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:33,830
you've detoxified His Majesty,

191
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,550
I can still give orders to the imperial physicians,

192
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:37,880
claiming that you're the one who poisoned His Majesty,

193
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,710
and Her Majesty is behind it,

194
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:42,370
while I, Pei Linfu,

195
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,870
loyally protected the emperor

196
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,430
as a meritorious hero.

197
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:46,310
Guards!

198
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:47,600
Arrest them all!

199
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:48,090
Yes!

200
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:48,510
Yes!

201
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:49,990
Pei Linfu.

202
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,800
How dare you!

203
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:21,870
Grand Councilor.

204
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,950
Shang Bieli and Jiang Xinbai

205
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:23,830
have barged in.

206
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:30,910
Take Yan Nanxing away.

207
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:31,630
Yes!

208
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:32,430
Go.

209
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:35,090
As for the rest of them,

210
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:36,110
give no quarter.

211
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:46,130
Let go of me!

212
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:47,170
Let go of me!

213
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:57,390
Yan Nanxing.

214
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:00,870
Stop acting.

215
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:02,350
Do you really think

216
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:03,830
I can't bear to kill you?

217
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:08,550
Tell me.

218
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:11,500
Tell me how you shapeshift.

219
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:12,790
Tell me!

220
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:14,950
You're not telling me?

221
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:15,390
Fine.

222
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:16,730
I'll make you die

223
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:19,190
a even more miserable death than Bai Yuchen.

224
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:28,230
Is this

225
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,440
the shapeshifting potion?

226
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,550
Lately, I developed

227
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,280
a potion.

228
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:37,110
However,

229
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,440
it still needs a medicinal usher.

230
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:41,870
If you drink it,

231
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:44,460
you may not be able to shapeshift back.

232
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:45,870
Good.

233
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,600
Wonderful.

234
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:57,070
Come on.

235
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:58,990
Drink it.

236
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:01,470
Drink it.

237
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:17,310
Your Majesty.

238
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:18,990
Sorry for offending you.

239
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:20,470
Watch out, Your Majesty.

240
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:32,550
Your Majesty.

241
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:36,230
Your Majesty.

242
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:38,550
Your Majesty.

243
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:39,920
You're awake.

244
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:42,150
It's okay.

245
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:44,040
Everything's okay.

246
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:48,230
Suoluo.

247
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:52,670
Are you okay?

248
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:53,530
I'm fine.

249
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:55,010
Where's Yan Nanxing?

250
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,610
She was taken away by Pei Linfu.

251
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:57,420
Go save her.

252
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,340
Be careful yourself.

253
00:15:59,440 --> 00:15:59,870
Okay.

254
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:07,870
Stop Jiang Xinbai!

255
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:08,300
You really shapeshifted.

256
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:10,470
Wonderful!

257
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:14,050
Yan Nanxing.

258
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:15,950
Get up.

259
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:18,190
Get up!

260
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:20,030
Get up!

261
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:25,290
Tell me!

262
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:26,869
Tell me

263
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,099
how you did it.

264
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:30,110
Tell me how to shapeshift!

265
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:32,610
I shapeshifted

266
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:34,690
because I took the Zornia poison.

267
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,700
Do you want to shapeshift?

268
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,870
Take it then!

269
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:53,950
Tell me.

270
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,950
Where is Yan Nanxing?

271
00:17:58,390 --> 00:17:59,310
Jiang Xinbai.

272
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:01,920
You can't do anything to me.

273
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:04,190
You're a useless person now.

274
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:07,270
Tell me!

275
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,590
The only thing

276
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:09,680
I regret

277
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:11,930
is not having killed you earlier.

278
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,760
In that case,

279
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:13,900
you'll never see

280
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,980
Yan Nanxing again.

281
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:18,190
Jiang Xinbai!

282
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,430
Take him away.

283
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:38,680
Yan Nanxing.

00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,480
I hereby sentence him to death.

339
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:24,070
Jiang Xinbai.

340
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:25,630
Pass my order.

341
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:27,810
Catch the remnants of Zornia,

342
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:29,230
and eradicate

343
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,900
all of his cohorts.

00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:36,940
-Wise decision, Your Majesty!
-Wise decision, Your Majesty!

345

we pursue Pei's remnants with all our might.

00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,980
Now the traitors have been eliminated,

348
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:13,520
and the imperial court has been reorganized.

349
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:15,320
Those who profited from Zornia

350
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,250
will be severely punished.

351
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:23,480
All persons involved in this case

352
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,260
in the territory of Daqi

353
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:28,050
must be thoroughly investigated

354
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:30,520
with zero tolerance

355
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:34,990
in an effort to establish the state prestige of Daqi.

356
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:36,710
Yes!

357
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,430
Yes!

358
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:39,910
Yes!

359
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:10,680
Why haven't they come back yet?

360
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:15,120
Could anything have happened to them?

361
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:19,470
Father.

362
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:21,870
Could anything have happened to them?

363
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:22,830
Why are they

364
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:23,710
still not back?

365
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:28,510
Are you alright?

366
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:30,110
Yan Nanxing detoxified His Majesty.

367
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:31,230
His Majesty is unharmed.

368
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:32,750
Pei Linfu has been executed.

369
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:33,510
Good.

370
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:34,710
Good.

371
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,860
You protected His Majesty

372
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:38,590
and the state of Daqi.

373
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:40,390
The Jiang family

374
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:42,270
didn't let His Majesty down.

375
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:48,840
Where is Xinbai?

376
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,590
Where is Xinbai?

377
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:50,190
Xinbai...

378
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:51,750
Mother, don't worry.

379
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:53,910
Xinbai went to look for Nanxing.

380
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:55,150
But...

381
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:56,320
Don't worry.

382
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:58,970
They'll come back safely.

383
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,510
Are you okay?

384
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:10,430
I’m okay, Grandfather.

385
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:12,560
Don’t worry. It's just a minor injury.

386
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:14,030
That's good.

387
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:18,410
Ruoqian has been waiting for you.

388
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:40,870
Look.

389
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:41,870
I told you.

390
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:44,030
After all of this is over,

391
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,910
I will officially

392
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:47,470
propose marriage to you.

393
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:50,630
Okay.

394
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:04,390
Everything's okay now.

395
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:12,880
Promise me

396
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:14,110
you'll never do

397
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:16,110
such dangerous things again, okay?

398
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:17,790
I promise.

399
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:20,400
I won't make you worry anymore.

400
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:39,830
Yan Nanxing!

401
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:51,640
Yan Nanxing.

402
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:27,350
[Everlasting Glory]

403
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:26,260
The imperial doctor has been in there for such a long time.

404
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,320
Could Xinbai be...

405
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:28,550
No, no.

406
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:29,630
No way.

407
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:31,630
God blesses good men like Xinbai.

408
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:32,430
We can't

409
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:33,580
fall into disarray.

410
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:35,070
Zhiyi.

411
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:36,710
Xinbai had this disease.

412
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:37,870
Why didn't you

413
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:39,030
tell me about such a big deal

414
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:40,150
earlier?

415
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:41,780
I...

416
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,320
I have my reasons, too.

417
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,220
He lost much blood.

418
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:52,710
No.

419
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:54,050
You can't go in.

420
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:55,270
The imperial doctors are in surgery.

421
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:56,670
We can't disturb them.

422
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:59,240
All the ancestors of the Jiang family,

423
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,200
please bless Xinbai

424
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,740
and let him survive this.

425
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,670
I'm willing to trade my life

426
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:05,990
for his life.

427
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:09,380
Doctor.

428
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:10,450
How is Xinbai?

429
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:11,590
His Grace...

430
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,800
His Grace is out of danger now.

431
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:14,720
It's just...

432
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:16,150
Say it.

433
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:17,180
It's just that

434
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:19,070
I'm not sure when he will wake up.

435
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:25,640
Zhiyi.

436
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:30,230
Xinbai.

437
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:31,550
Zhiyi.

438
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:33,270
Don't worry.

439
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:36,230
Xinbai will be okay.

440
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:39,310
I've tried my best.

441
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,030
Qingyun.

442
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,690
We haven't found Nanxing yet.

443
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,080
We must make sure

444
00:28:58,150 --> 00:28:59,910
nothing happens to Xinbai.

445
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:04,770
He'll wake up, right?

446
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:06,750
Zhiyi.

447
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:09,680
As long as Nanxing is alive,

448
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:11,190
Xinbai...

449
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,430
He will definitely wake up.

450
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:57,070
Why?

451
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:59,490
Why does my heart hurt so much?

452
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:01,350
Jiang Xinbai.

453
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:03,350
Are you in danger?

454
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:06,990
Jiang Xinbai.

455
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:11,120
No matter what you're going through,

456
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,550
you must

457
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:16,190
protect yourself.

458
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:19,270
Even if

459
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:20,920
in this life,

460
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:26,630
I couldn't shapeshift back to Yan Nanxing ever again,

461
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,900
promise me

462
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:32,830
you'll be safe.

463
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:36,750
You must be safe.

464
00:31:52,640 --> 00:32:00,010
[A few months later]

465
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:22,160
Are you okay?

466
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,100
I'm okay.

467
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:27,290
Official's boots!

468
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:29,760
I'm okay.

469
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:31,020
Thank you.

470
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:32,590
Take care.

471
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:33,510
Thank you.

472
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:34,350
Thank you.

473
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:35,310
I'm okay.

474
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:38,670
Honey. Honey.

475
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:39,870
I bought you a pancake.

476
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:41,150
Eat it while it's still warm.

477
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:41,680
Let's go.

478
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:49,720
Xinbai.

479
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:53,210
Over the past 20 years,

480
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:56,170
I've been deferring to you

481
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:58,690
and letting you do anything you want.

482
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,510
I just hope you can be safe.

483
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:07,310
You must pull through this time.

484
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:11,270
You must wake up.

485
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,929
Nanxing is still waiting for you to find her.

486
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:21,110
I've sent people to look for her,

487
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,620
but we haven't found her yet.

488
00:34:25,989 --> 00:34:27,190
I promise you

489
00:34:27,909 --> 00:34:29,570
I'll get Nanxing back for you.

490
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:38,670
Zhiyi.

491
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:41,090
You've been

492
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:43,310
sitting here for many nights straight.

493
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:45,750
It's time to take a rest.

494
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:49,590
I'm fine.

495
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:52,469
I want to stay here with my son.

496
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:55,710
He will wake up.

497
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:57,990
If he doesn't wake up,

498
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:01,190
I'll stay by his side forever.

499
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:05,000
Alright.

500
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:07,910
In that case,

501
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:12,190
I'll stay here with you

502
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:14,550
until Xinbai wakes up.

503
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,080
Any news about Nanxing?

504
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:25,830
Not yet.

505
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:41,630
Xinbai.

506
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:49,630
Did you see his hand move?

507
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:50,570
He's awake.

508
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,150
Xinbai.

509
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,840
I'll get the imperial doctor.

510
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:56,190
Xinbai.

511
00:35:58,070 --> 00:35:58,870
Xinbai.

512
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:09,100
Son.

513
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:16,110
Mother.

514
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:20,390
I can

515
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:23,230
see you clearly now.

516
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,030
Son.

517
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:09,840
Mother.

518
00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:17,610
Suoluo.

519
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,400
Mr. Yan.

520
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:32,280
Grandfather.

521
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:47,350
Yan Nanxing.

522
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:51,550
Yan Nanxing.

523
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:54,240
She still hasn't come back?

524
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:56,990
Son.

525
00:37:57,990 --> 00:37:58,920
We haven't found

526
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:01,390
Nanxing yet.

527
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:02,520
But don't worry.

528
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:04,370
We've tried our best to look for her.

529
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:05,900
We'll definitely find her.

530
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:07,160
Don't worry.

531
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:08,790
We need to be patient.

532
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:10,030
Yes, Xinbai.

533
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,740
The Inspection Office

534
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:13,030
is also looking for her.

535
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:15,150
You need to get better yourself first.

536
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:15,830
Xinbai.

537
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:18,310
Nanxing's a good person. She's definitely blessed by God.

538
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:20,070
She cares about you with her whole heart.

539
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:21,670
She will definitely come back.

540
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:22,480
Good boy.

541
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:24,070
Get well first.

542
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:26,370
Even if I have to turn

543
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:27,710
the whole Daqi upside down,

544
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:29,530
I'll find my granddaughter-in-law

545
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:30,690
for you.

546
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:47,510
Yan Nanxing.

547
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:49,960
No matter where you are,

548
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:51,750
wait for me.

549
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:19,530
♫Branches bare as flowers fall off♫

550
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:25,200
♫Akin to how I can't stay in your heart♫

551
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:30,190
♫When will I dare♫

552

553

♫Same dream and person in front of me♫

555
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:42,600
You like vinegar.

556
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:43,910
I'll pour you some vinegar.

557
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:44,840
That's too much.

558
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:45,990
Come on. Eat.

559
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:48,300
♫Abrupt ending on the cusp of fruition♫

560
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:46,850
I'll eat too.

561
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:47,780
Let's eat it up.

562
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:48,570
I'll eat two.

563
00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:50,430
♫I'm left behind♫

564
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:53,670

00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:06,410
♫Missing you day and night♫

568
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,650

♫Past, present, and future♫

586
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:08,560
You know what?

587
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:10,230
My life was miserable before.

588
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:11,710
I was abducted by a human trafficker

589
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:12,390
and almost

590
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:14,250
got killed by him.

591
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:16,210
Luckily, a young man saved me.

592
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:17,400
After that,

593
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,720
we fled together

594
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:20,210
and ran into some bad guys.

595
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:21,410
That young man

596
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,610
was taken away,

597
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:24,390
and I was poisoned by them.

598
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:25,680
That's why

599
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:27,640
I got this shapeshifting ailment.

600
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:33,910
However,

601
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:35,310
on the bright side,

602
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:37,450
if I hadn't gone through all this,

603
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:39,870
I wouldn't have met you.

604
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:05,070
Yan Nanxing.

605
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:07,830
Since I met you,

606
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,190
I've never seen

607
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:10,350
your true face.

608
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:13,390
We became the most familiar strangers.

609
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:17,230
We only spent a short time together,

610
00:43:17,950 --> 00:43:19,150
but a long time apart.

611
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:25,230
No matter where you are right now,

612
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:27,490
wait for me.

613
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:32,910
I'll spend the rest of my life with you.
