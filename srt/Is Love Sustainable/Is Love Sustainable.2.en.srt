00:00:00,467 --> 00:00:06,439
<i>Would you please go out with me without marriage in mind?</i>

2
00:00:06,439 --> 00:00:08,976
<i>From today, I'll go marriage hunting.</i>

3
00:00:08,976 --> 00:00:11,779
<i>Good luck. I hope that you will be happy.</i>

4
00:00:11,779 --> 00:00:15,368
<i>What are you talking about? You'd also be going with me.</i>

5
00:00:15,368 --> 00:00:16,902
<i>What?</i>

6
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:21,552
<i>Why are you here?</i>

7
00:00:21,552 --> 00:00:26,450
<i>The new department is in charge of marriage hunting and consultation.</i>

8
00:00:27,656 --> 00:00:30,364
<i>I'm afraid that your back is strained.</i>

9
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:32,671
<i>It would be better to go for an X-ray.</i>

10
00:00:32,671 --> 00:00:34,644
<i>I wanted to see you so much.</i>

11
00:00:34,644 --> 00:00:37,413
<i>Finally, we meet!</i>

12
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:47,154
Are you all right?

13
00:00:47,154 --> 00:00:49,412
- Ouch.
- Just a little more.

14
00:00:49,412 --> 00:00:51,051
Slowly.

15
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,953
Please get in the car.

16
00:00:54,602 --> 00:00:57,909
Ouch, it hurts.

17
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:03,840
I'm really sorry. Thanks for your help.

18
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,228
- Thank you very much.
- Please take care.

19
00:01:12,106 --> 00:01:14,541
Aging is really a problem.

20
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:15,942
What?

21
00:01:15,942 --> 00:01:19,812
I don't mean Kyoka, but her father.

22
00:01:21,481 --> 00:01:24,651
My bad, to be in this state during this time.

23
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:28,155
Never mind. I was planning to leave anyway.

24
00:01:28,155 --> 00:01:31,157
But the guy just now...

25
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:33,159
It's not what you think.

26
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:36,196
Father, don't you remember that guy?

27
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:39,733
Kyoka-chan is my childhood friend.

28
00:01:39,733 --> 00:01:42,068
We were neighbors when we were young.

29
00:01:42,068 --> 00:01:44,537
Our families were close.

30
00:01:44,537 --> 00:01:48,642
Is he Fuwa's son, Hayate-kun?

31
00:01:48,642 --> 00:01:50,677
That's right.

32
00:01:50,677 --> 00:01:54,848
Then what about that consultant guy?

33
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:57,184
Higashimura-san, what is your relationship with Kyoka-chan?

34
00:01:57,184 --> 00:02:00,551
Well...

35
00:02:01,355 --> 00:02:03,294
- We're friends.
- We're friends.

36
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:08,394
Then can you tell me Kyoka-chan's number?

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,880

<i>[Episode 2]</i>

39
00:02:30,537 --> 00:02:33,673
Father, breakfast is ready.

40
00:02:38,731 --> 00:02:40,733
How's your back?

41
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:45,065
Are you feeling okay in that position?

42
00:02:45,065 --> 00:02:48,401
There's an email from the marriage consultant.

43
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:51,938
It seems that a lady wants to meet me again.

44
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:55,056
Eh? What kind of person is she?

45
00:02:58,114 --> 00:03:00,613
I'm not sure.

46
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:04,700
If I were to join as a member, then I'll know about her.

47
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:07,391
I see that you are still popular.

48
00:03:07,391 --> 00:03:11,825
"And regarding Kyoka-sama..."

49
00:03:11,825 --> 00:03:15,228
"There are a few inquiries,"

50
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:20,600
"but we regret that no one has requested another meeting."

51
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,403
- Regret indeed.
- Yes.

52
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:26,806
Japanese are indeed tactful to reject a person.

53
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:29,443
And they even mentioned there were a "few" inquiries.

54
00:03:29,443 --> 00:03:34,430
Just a white lie to avoid hurting your feelings.

55
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:40,820
Well... I'm sorry for not asking before making you come along.

56
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:44,724
I'm going to register as a member tomorrow. Do you want to come with me?

57
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,994
Father, I hope you can stop...

58
00:03:46,994 --> 00:03:52,942
I've told the consultant Higashimura-san that we will be going together.

59
00:03:52,942 --> 00:03:54,706
Anyway...

60
00:03:57,711 --> 00:03:59,272
Okay, I got it.

61
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:02,594
So, shall we have breakfast?

62
00:04:02,594 --> 00:04:03,944
Slowly.

63
00:04:03,944 --> 00:04:07,914
I hope to become a righteous person who do not lie.

64
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,850
Everyone thinks the same way, right?

65
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:13,520
However, in yoga, we stress more about not hurting others,

66
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,756
rather than insisting that we are right.

67
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:21,094
For example, when you don't feel like going to a party,

68
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:26,475
"I have something to do." Sometimes, you tell such a white lie.

69
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:30,037
However, this is because you do not want to hurt that person,

70
00:04:30,037 --> 00:04:33,533
and you only tell the white lie to be kind.

71
00:04:33,533 --> 00:04:37,870
Well, actually you just want to idle your time away at home.

72
00:04:38,936 --> 00:04:43,116
- Thank you for today.
- Thank you.

73
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,885
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

74
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:54,060
Good job. It was a nice lesson.

75
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,695
Good work today.

76
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:57,739
It's been a long time since we met.

77
00:04:57,739 --> 00:05:03,550
You've been running around with all your busy schedule.

78
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:07,741
Ah, but you also seem to have been busy yourself, Vanessa-san.

79
00:05:07,741 --> 00:05:11,644
Then I shall not beat around the bush and go straight to the point.

80
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:15,182
Finally, we are going to have a new studio in Ginza.

81
00:05:15,182 --> 00:05:17,593
Eh, really?

82
00:05:17,593 --> 00:05:21,430
We will get even busier, so I hope to have your help.

83
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:23,890
We will be relying on you.

84
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:28,761
Yes, I will work hard.

85
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:34,200
- I'll take my leave.
- See you.

86
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:45,311
Kyoka Sensei, you told a lie.

87
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:48,815
What lie are you talking about?

88
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:51,651
I can feel it coming from you...

89
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:55,488
Something.

90
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:59,719
What are you talking about? There's nothing at all.

91
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:02,352
Nothing!

92
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:08,282
There must be something!

93
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:16,808
At the fourth vertebrae, there's a slip causing scoliosis.

94
00:06:16,808 --> 00:06:20,914
The leg cramp is caused by a back problem.

95
00:06:20,914 --> 00:06:25,872
If the cramp gets worse, let's take an MRI.

96
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:31,069
- Please have some tea.
- Thank you.

97
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:38,164
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
- Sorry for causing trouble that day.

98
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:39,661
You don't need to worry about it.

99
00:06:39,661 --> 00:06:41,811
- Are you feeling better now?
- Yes, I am.

100
00:06:41,811 --> 00:06:43,912
I'm relieved to hear that.

101
00:06:47,107 --> 00:06:48,808
Let's proceed to the other room.

102
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:52,188
We'll see you at the same time next week. Please take care.

103
00:06:52,188 --> 00:06:54,375
Thank you.

104
00:06:55,115 --> 00:06:56,992
Let me see.

105
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,652
- You've worked hard.
- Thank you.

106
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:01,654
I've ordered delivery for lunch today. Is that fine?

107
00:07:01,654 --> 00:07:04,857
Of course! Thank you so much.

108
00:07:04,857 --> 00:07:09,196
Did something good happen?

109
00:07:09,196 --> 00:07:10,730
It's the exact opposite.

110
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:14,210
Can I ask you to complete this registration form?

111
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:15,791
Okay.

<i>[Counselling Sheet]</i>

113
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:23,010
<i>There was an emergency case, so they realized that I'm a doctor.</i>

114
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:25,117
<i>I see.</i>

115
00:07:25,117 --> 00:07:29,892
After knowing my occupation, they started to be more persistent.

116
00:07:29,892 --> 00:07:33,253
At least you are not a beauty.

117
00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:37,389
Is there any demerit to tell others about your profession?

118
00:07:38,309 --> 00:07:40,527
Demerit?

119
00:07:40,527 --> 00:07:43,563
Normal guys would just get cold feet and run away.

120
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:45,148
Such a highly qualified lady...

121
00:07:45,148 --> 00:07:47,935
- Why...
- Why is she single at this age?

122
00:07:47,935 --> 00:07:49,987
They must think that I have some shortcomings.

123
00:07:49,987 --> 00:07:51,627
Yes.

124
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:55,175
But why the sudden urge to go for marriage hunting?

125
00:07:58,245 --> 00:08:03,280
As of now, I think I can have a pure love relationship.

126
00:08:04,322 --> 00:08:06,152
I was asked about the partner criteria

127
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:12,459
when I went to the marriage consultant.

128
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:18,905
<i>Education, salary, occupation, height...</i>

129
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,869
<i>It's good that the consultant acted fast.</i>

130
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:26,072
During that time,

131
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:31,011
I realized that I don't really care about the details.

132
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:33,046
Really?

133
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:35,682
I'm not looking forward to his possessions,

134
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:39,815
because I can have what I want.

135
00:08:39,815 --> 00:08:42,230
I will work hard to get what I want, too.

136
00:08:42,907 --> 00:08:44,860
I'm already over forty.

137
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:49,020
<i>[It's enough if the person is friendly.]</i>

138
00:08:50,163 --> 00:08:55,834
So I can get married if I were to just like him.

139
00:08:55,834 --> 00:08:57,804
That's so cool.

140
00:08:57,804 --> 00:09:02,980
Not at all. My Prince Charming still has not even appeared yet.

141
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:08,891
Last year, 30% of our members got married through AI matching.
<i>[Matching rate 81%]</i>

142
00:09:08,891 --> 00:09:12,452
Meeting the first person is complimentary.

143
00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:17,791
Higashimura-san, please find a reliable man for my daughter.

144
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:20,356
Yes, I will.

145
00:09:24,454 --> 00:09:27,834
Will your father be all right with his back still hurting?

146
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:32,172
It seems better when he walks. Don't worry about him.

147
00:09:36,032 --> 00:09:38,444
Does it not suit your taste?

148
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:42,449
This is a café, but it's popular for vegetable curry, so I thought you might like it.

149
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:46,195
It's delicious but sorry to say that I don't really like carrots.

150
00:09:46,195 --> 00:09:49,222
Even my son can eat carrots, but I...

151
00:09:52,205 --> 00:09:55,629
When you need to work late, what happens to him?

152
00:09:55,629 --> 00:10:01,233
There's a nearby place he goes to for two days a week.

153
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:04,938
You mean your family? It's good to live near your parents.

154
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:09,076
My friend with kids also moved near her parents.

155
00:10:09,076 --> 00:10:12,455
Not really...

156
00:10:12,455 --> 00:10:15,352
Actually,

157
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:19,152
I hope you will keep this a secret from my father,

158
00:10:19,152 --> 00:10:23,557
but can you cancel my membership?

159
00:10:23,557 --> 00:10:26,654
Of course, I can do that.

160
00:10:26,654 --> 00:10:28,161
Thank you so much.

161
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:31,532
I'm sorry. I just thought that it would be just the party.

162
00:10:31,532 --> 00:10:33,524
Oh, right.

163
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:37,492
Fuwa Hayate-san, who was at the marriage hunting event...

164
00:10:37,492 --> 00:10:40,273
Ah... Hayate?

165
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:43,202
It's been more than ten years since I last saw him.

166
00:10:43,202 --> 00:10:46,013
There's really nothing between us.

167
00:10:46,013 --> 00:10:49,059
He used to have a dripping nose when he was this small.

168
00:10:49,059 --> 00:10:52,684
He asked me for your number.

169
00:10:52,684 --> 00:10:54,621
Can I tell him?

170
00:10:54,621 --> 00:10:56,472
Eh?

171
00:10:56,472 --> 00:10:58,158
Ah... Of course.

172
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:00,993
Fuwa-san is a teacher at my son's school.

173
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:03,663
And I invited him to the marriage hunting party,

174
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,699
because there were too few participants.

175
00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:08,364
He is someone whom I can trust.

176
00:11:09,036 --> 00:11:14,439
So, you are introducing him to me as a marriage counselor?

177
00:11:14,439 --> 00:11:16,800
No, I'm just...

178
00:11:17,945 --> 00:11:20,347
telling you as a friend.

179
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:26,420
It's fine. He's just a friend to me.

180
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,332
I see.

181
00:11:36,789 --> 00:11:43,360
Hey. I think I will try to go matchmaking for once.

182
00:11:43,865 --> 00:11:47,060
I want to see the kind of person AI will choose for me.

183
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,490
And we might be able to become friends.

184
00:11:52,141 --> 00:11:54,457
Is that so?

185
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:02,890
<i>[Japanese - Sanseido]</i>

186
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:06,058
So, you joined the marriage consultancy?

187
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:07,678
Can't I do that?

188
00:12:07,678 --> 00:12:10,663
Of course, you can. It's so interesting.

189
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:12,933
You can also come along if you want.

190
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:16,739
No, I'm fine. It would be a waste.

191
00:12:16,739 --> 00:12:17,970
A waste?

192
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:21,975
You date each other with marriage in mind. Isn't there a "something" period?

193
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:24,229
<i>Something</i>?

194
00:12:24,229 --> 00:12:27,497
Is this the first time you've heard this term?

195
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:29,916
I'm ashamed, but this is the first time.

196
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,274
Please explain it to me.

197
00:12:34,387 --> 00:12:38,557
I've also fallen into such a relationship recently.

198
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:42,261
What kind of relationship is that?

199
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:45,298
No, he's not my boyfriend yet.

200
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:47,801
We just go to the supermarket or bathhouse together.

201
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:51,871
Where did you meet a guy that you could show with no makeup?

202
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:54,841
He talked to me in the elevator at the supermarket.

203
00:12:54,841 --> 00:12:56,319
In the elevator...

204
00:12:56,319 --> 00:12:58,573
And then we started meeting once a week.

205
00:12:58,573 --> 00:12:59,646
A weekly date...

206
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:02,115
Sometimes we meet by coincidence.

207
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:03,951
By coincidence...

208
00:13:03,951 --> 00:13:07,030
Really, we have only held hands till now.

209
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,511
Only held hands...

210
00:13:08,511 --> 00:13:11,405
- So, you're still in a something period.
- That's right.

211
00:13:11,405 --> 00:13:14,727
That's the period when your heart flutters the most.

212
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:18,031
Wait up. Who's Sam? A foreigner?
<i>(T/N: "Some" and "Sam" are pronounced the same in Japanese.)</i>

213
00:13:18,031 --> 00:13:21,934
You're mistaken. It means "something" is going on.

214
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:25,571
You're "something" more than friends, but not yet lovers.

215
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:27,340
I see. "Something"...

216
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,208
Having meals together,

217
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:32,845
and messaging each other. That's the most enjoyable.

218
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:35,983
Don't friends also go to meals together?

219
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:39,218
When it's just a normal guy friend, would you find a restaurant that he likes,

220
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:42,555
or want to know more about him?

221
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:44,691
- And you always wear your pretty underwear for your meetings.
- That's right.

222
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:48,203
Now I'm just wearing my normal underwear.

223
00:13:48,203 --> 00:13:51,072
Don't tell me about that.

224
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:58,170
So, you know Goto-kun from our department?

225
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:01,407
Yes, we were in the same year and stayed in the same dorm.

226
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:04,076
So, you also studied Economics at UCLA?

227
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:05,913
I was not a hardworking student.

228
00:14:05,913 --> 00:14:08,581
- UCLA?
- You're too modest!

229
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:10,193
- Hello.
- Hello.

230
00:14:10,193 --> 00:14:13,029
Your dad is here to fetch you.

231
00:14:14,121 --> 00:14:15,788
You're here.

232
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:16,866
Shall we go?

233
00:14:16,866 --> 00:14:17,847
Say goodbye to your teacher.

234
00:14:17,847 --> 00:14:19,858
- See you.
- See you.

235
00:14:19,858 --> 00:14:22,538
- We'll take our leave then.
- Take care on your way back.

236
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:28,528
I've contacted Kyoka-chan.

237
00:14:28,528 --> 00:14:30,734
- Thank you for your help.
- It was nothing.

238
00:14:30,734 --> 00:14:33,272
She's my first love.

239
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:35,776
Eh...

240
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:42,415
Spare my life, please...

241
00:14:56,797 --> 00:15:01,602
Segawa-san, she's here.

242
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:09,642
Nice to meet you. I'm Segawa Yukiya.

243
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:12,879
I'm Sawada Kyoka. Nice to meet you, too.

244
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:17,283
The flower of apricots. What a beautiful name you have.

245
00:15:18,685 --> 00:15:21,287
Let's sit down, shall we?

246
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:29,228
Me, too. I'm careful about my diet.

247
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:33,008
I tried to avoid fatty and processed food, and take organic foods.

248
00:15:33,008 --> 00:15:38,333
I see. Due to my job, I try to eat

249
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:40,455
to keep my body light. That's all.

250
00:15:40,455 --> 00:15:45,435
That's good. If we were to live together, our diet would have to be similar, too.

251
00:15:45,435 --> 00:15:50,149
I expected this because the AI matching rate is 83%.

252
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:52,958
They really are compatible.

253
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:57,990
Both of you also like to travel during your free time.

254
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:01,694
I've traveled to fifty countries, mainly in Europe.

255
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:05,064
I can speak English, Spanish, and French fluently.

256
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:08,768
Regarding German, I can read it well, but I'm not good at speaking.

257
00:16:08,768 --> 00:16:11,838
But I can show you around the countries without any problem.

258
00:16:11,838 --> 00:16:14,341
- That's impressive.
- For language, you just need to get used to it.

259
00:16:14,341 --> 00:16:17,211
I'm not that highly qualified,

260
00:16:17,211 --> 00:16:20,497
but of course, I'm not the average guy too.

261
00:16:20,497 --> 00:16:23,616
Segawa-san researches dams at the university,

262
00:16:23,616 --> 00:16:27,019
and he often attends academic conferences overseas.

263
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:29,888
Sawada-san, where do you like to go traveling?

264
00:16:29,888 --> 00:16:34,446
I used to work at a travel agency,

265
00:16:34,446 --> 00:16:39,625
regardless of whether it's local or overseas, I like warm weather, especially the tropics.

266
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:42,702
I like to travel alone to the places that I like.

267
00:16:42,702 --> 00:16:46,295
Alone? Why? Even if you are married?

268
00:16:49,776 --> 00:16:52,478
Sawada-san is kind,

269
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:56,256
so she gets tired, as she always considers the feelings of others.

270
00:16:56,256 --> 00:16:58,985
It will be different when she gets married, though.

271
00:16:58,985 --> 00:16:59,853
That's right.

272
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:02,990
That's good. Do you like Japanese sweets?

273
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:05,424
I'm lean, but I like them.

274
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:07,489
Yes, I like mitarashi dango, in particular.
(<i>T/N: soy sauce glazed dumplings)</i>

275
00:17:07,489 --> 00:17:09,261
What a pity!

276
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:10,496
What a pity?

277
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:14,567
I like dumplings with fillings, especially red beans.

278
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:18,394
Akabane-bashi has a shop that sells delicious dumplings made with organic red beans.

279
00:17:18,394 --> 00:17:19,735
We can go during the weekend if you are free.

280
00:17:19,735 --> 00:17:22,476
Sorry, but I have something to do this weekend.

281
00:17:22,476 --> 00:17:26,430
Something to do? Is it your hobby?

282
00:17:28,215 --> 00:17:33,352
Let's skip the weekend first because you both will get to enjoy the time from now on by yourselves.

283
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:35,422
- Eh?
- Please enjoy your time.

284
00:17:35,422 --> 00:17:37,724
Thank you.

285
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,835
I've not done yoga before. Do you think I can handle it?

286
00:17:43,835 --> 00:17:46,165
Please come to try it out.

287
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:48,954
- My job involves dams.
- Dam and yoga...

288
00:17:48,954 --> 00:17:52,310
It's quite rate that both our jobs are two syllables in Katakana.

289
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:55,122
- It's such a coincidence.
- What a rare common point we have.

290
00:17:55,122 --> 00:17:56,443
Yes, it is.

291
00:17:56,443 --> 00:18:01,215
Raise your left leg to the height of your backside.

292
00:18:01,215 --> 00:18:04,739
When your position is steady, stretch out your right arm.

293
00:18:04,739 --> 00:18:08,260
Don't force yourself too hard, and continue to breathe.

294
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:11,419
Face your palm to the mirror.

295
00:18:11,419 --> 00:18:12,593
Yes.

296
00:18:12,593 --> 00:18:16,144
Those who find this easy can raise your leg higher.

297
00:18:26,273 --> 00:18:29,874
<i>[Vanessa Yoga Studio]</i>

298
00:18:35,203 --> 00:18:37,772
<i>Thank you.</i>

299
00:18:39,048 --> 00:18:41,135
- How was your first lesson?
- I enjoyed it very much.

300
00:18:41,135 --> 00:18:44,071
It was great. And you, too.

301
00:18:44,979 --> 00:18:47,648
Thank you for the hard work.

302
00:18:49,217 --> 00:18:51,475
Sorry.

303
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,727
Please excuse me.

304
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:02,810
I feel "something" fatal.

305
00:19:10,016 --> 00:19:11,738
Kyoka-chan, you are hurting me.

306
00:19:11,738 --> 00:19:15,353
Wait a moment.

307
00:19:15,353 --> 00:19:17,690
I just wanted to take your lesson for once.

308
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:20,693
But you are troubling me.

309
00:19:20,693 --> 00:19:22,422
I'm sorry.

310
00:19:23,108 --> 00:19:26,966
I would like to apologize to you. Do you have time now?

311
00:19:26,966 --> 00:19:29,340
It's my lunchtime now.

312
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:32,034
Then come with me.

313
00:19:32,034 --> 00:19:34,207
Wait up, Hayate.

314
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:46,758
- Where are we going?
- My favorite place.

315
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:56,797
There.

316
00:19:56,797 --> 00:19:58,832
What is there?

317
00:20:15,415 --> 00:20:19,485
When I was ten, I followed my parents due to work relocation to Malaysia.

318
00:20:19,485 --> 00:20:24,190
Then when I graduated in the States, I went to quite a few places before coming back to Japan.

319
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:27,197
I didn't know about that.

320
00:20:27,197 --> 00:20:30,062
You've grown to be a better man.

321
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:32,854
Of course, I'm already 28 now.

322
00:20:32,854 --> 00:20:35,067
So, you are 28?

323
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:38,286
I'm also getting old.

324
00:20:38,286 --> 00:20:42,282
Really. But I'm glad you are still not married.

325
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:43,411
Huh?

326
00:20:43,411 --> 00:20:46,512
Since you are going for marriage hunting, it means that you are available.

327
00:20:46,512 --> 00:20:49,737
Well, that party was just to accompany someone.

328
00:20:49,737 --> 00:20:51,749
I don't really care about getting married.

329
00:20:51,749 --> 00:20:53,480
You don't care?

330
00:20:54,027 --> 00:20:57,345
I'm not the type to go for marriage hunting.

331
00:20:58,157 --> 00:21:01,848
Most Japanese girls always set their criteria first

332
00:21:01,848 --> 00:21:03,696
before looking for a partner, right?

333
00:21:03,696 --> 00:21:06,154
Eh? Are American girls different?

334
00:21:06,154 --> 00:21:09,788
We need a longer queue to talk about that.

335
00:21:09,788 --> 00:21:12,191
Really?

336
00:21:12,191 --> 00:21:17,866
But it's already a miracle to meet someone that you like.

337
00:21:18,378 --> 00:21:21,328
I've yet to meet

338
00:21:22,349 --> 00:21:24,092
someone that I like.

339
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:27,835
Are you serious?

340
00:21:28,388 --> 00:21:33,967
Those who went to the party must be desperately searching for someone that they like.

341
00:21:33,967 --> 00:21:36,150
That's true.

342
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:39,353
You cannot do it half-heartedly.

343
00:21:39,353 --> 00:21:41,756
I went without thinking much,

344
00:21:41,756 --> 00:21:45,486
but I guess I needed to be serious.

345
00:21:47,752 --> 00:21:50,031
However, it was great to see you again.

346
00:21:50,031 --> 00:21:51,919
Same here.

347
00:21:52,446 --> 00:21:55,900
- You've not changed at all, Hayate.
- Really?

348
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:02,561
That time, I was taken care of by your family frequently, right?

349
00:22:04,224 --> 00:22:08,833
My mother lied that I might run away from home,

350
00:22:10,898 --> 00:22:13,901
but actually, they were on bad terms and divorced soon after that.

351
00:22:15,135 --> 00:22:17,411
It must have been tough for you.

352
00:22:17,411 --> 00:22:20,747
I did not know anything at all.

353
00:22:21,542 --> 00:22:23,909
Kyoka-chan, are you fine with oily food?

354
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:27,668
Due to my job, I need to be careful with my diet.

355
00:22:27,668 --> 00:22:33,292
Even if you were to say that, the ramen here is so delicious that you would smile after eating.

356
00:22:33,292 --> 00:22:35,187
It's true.

357
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,424
Really?

358
00:22:37,424 --> 00:22:40,014
I always smile while eating it.

359
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:44,631
Let's ask your mother along next time.

360
00:22:44,631 --> 00:22:47,636
I used to like your mother a lot.

361
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:51,505
Hayate.

362
00:22:53,054 --> 00:22:55,996
My mother...

363
00:23:16,688 --> 00:23:19,199
This is delicious.

364
00:23:19,199 --> 00:23:20,841
I told you, right?

365
00:23:34,846 --> 00:23:37,153
<i>[Sawada Kyoka]</i>

366
00:23:41,381 --> 00:23:43,095
Hello.

367
00:23:44,152 --> 00:23:46,347
Yes, I'm free now.

368
00:23:46,347 --> 00:23:50,751
After much thought, I still think I should cancel my membership.

369
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:54,167
Really? Okay, I'll proceed to cancel it.

370
00:23:54,167 --> 00:23:58,203
However, my father would surely ask me about it,

371
00:23:58,203 --> 00:24:00,372
so can you not tell him?

372
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:03,231
I'll do that... Um...

373
00:24:03,231 --> 00:24:06,941
A reason would be required for cancellation,

374
00:24:06,941 --> 00:24:08,987
so what should I write?

375
00:24:11,444 --> 00:24:13,874
It was really so delicious

376
00:24:14,502 --> 00:24:17,334
that I was smiling while eating.

377
00:24:21,428 --> 00:24:23,898
Sawada-san, what a handsome stole you have today.

378
00:24:23,898 --> 00:24:27,201
Kyoka was the one who coordinated my clothes.

379
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:31,168
You don't need to be so nervous to meet the other party.

380
00:24:31,168 --> 00:24:35,316
Her hobby is reading, so I think you would be compatible.

381
00:24:37,133 --> 00:24:41,883
However, having the same hobbies doesn't mean that you can get married.

382
00:24:41,883 --> 00:24:46,742
Because my deceased wife and I had totally different hobbies.

383
00:24:47,688 --> 00:24:52,299
Oh, I'm sorry. My daughter told me not to compare.

384
00:24:52,299 --> 00:24:53,260
No, it's fine.

385
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:55,204
Hello.

386
00:24:55,204 --> 00:24:56,661
Osaki-san, you're here.

387
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,967
Sawada-san, this is Osaki-san.

388
00:25:03,804 --> 00:25:08,653
I heard that your hobby is reading.

389
00:25:08,653 --> 00:25:13,256
I read mostly books that won the Naoki Prize.

390
00:25:16,283 --> 00:25:19,647
If you have any favorite books,

391
00:25:19,647 --> 00:25:23,077
I'll be glad to read them, too.

392
00:25:24,291 --> 00:25:28,673
Recently, I'm reading the original "Lamentations of Divergences" <i>(Buddhist text)</i> again,

393
00:25:28,673 --> 00:25:31,646
but it does not resonate with anyone easily.

394
00:25:31,646 --> 00:25:33,487
Eh?

395
00:25:33,487 --> 00:25:38,090
Lamentation?

396
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:44,555
Even the good guys can be saved, so the more the bad guys should be saved.

397
00:25:44,555 --> 00:25:47,013
Do you know that?

398
00:25:49,149 --> 00:25:51,207
That's a little...

399
00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:55,145
See you next week. I'll be waiting.

400
00:25:55,145 --> 00:25:57,614
Thank you for coming.

401
00:25:59,626 --> 00:26:01,873
Kyoka Sensei.

402
00:26:01,873 --> 00:26:06,110
Segawa-san has called you several times.

403
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:08,399
Segawa-san?

404
00:26:08,399 --> 00:26:10,536
Ah... did he leave any message?

405
00:26:10,536 --> 00:26:11,637
What did he say?

406
00:26:11,637 --> 00:26:13,207
Just in case, I asked for his number.

407
00:26:13,207 --> 00:26:15,110
Thank you.

408
00:26:18,641 --> 00:26:20,848
You lied to me behind my back, right?

409
00:26:20,848 --> 00:26:22,220
What do you mean?

410
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:25,363
I saw you holding hands with a young man.

411
00:26:25,363 --> 00:26:26,290
What?

412
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:29,038
I'm going to ask for a refund of the consultancy fees.

413
00:26:29,038 --> 00:26:31,416
Please wait a moment.

414
00:26:31,416 --> 00:26:35,639
If necessary, I will also sue you for cheating.

415
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:39,440
<i>[Vanessa Yoga Studio]</i>

416
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,522
Sawada-san was holding hands...

417
00:26:51,522 --> 00:26:54,076
It was not just holding hands!

418
00:26:54,076 --> 00:26:56,849
Segawa-san.

419
00:26:56,849 --> 00:27:01,858
You were holding hands with a young man,

420
00:27:01,858 --> 00:27:03,674
and both of you went to a hotel, right?

421
00:27:03,674 --> 00:27:06,454
No, he was just my childhood friend.

422
00:27:06,454 --> 00:27:07,481
Don't lie to me!

423
00:27:07,481 --> 00:27:09,151
I'm not lying.

424
00:27:09,151 --> 00:27:11,894
We were just holding hands and taking a shortcut to the ramen shop...

425
00:27:11,894 --> 00:27:14,070
Do ordinary friends hold hands?

426
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:16,668
It's not what you think.

427
00:27:16,668 --> 00:27:20,118
Higashimura-san, they are just putting on a front,

428
00:27:20,118 --> 00:27:23,058
and trying to cheat my money.

429
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:24,631
No.

430
00:27:24,631 --> 00:27:28,835
Sawada-san would not lie to hurt anyone.

431
00:27:28,835 --> 00:27:31,105
Then why?

432
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:34,632
Why can't she just choose me?

433
00:27:41,061 --> 00:27:43,631
58 people...

434
00:27:43,631 --> 00:27:47,140
In two years, I've been rejected by 58 people.

435
00:27:47,706 --> 00:27:52,279
I'm better than the average guy, and I'm well-dressed.

436
00:27:52,279 --> 00:27:56,006
Am I really that unpopular?

437
00:27:56,006 --> 00:27:58,239
I've already lowered my standards.

438
00:27:58,239 --> 00:28:02,870
Segawa-sama, we deeply apologized for the results this time.

439
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:05,772
Why does it always end up like this?

440
00:28:07,364 --> 00:28:09,930
I don't want you to apologize.

441
00:28:10,617 --> 00:28:13,436
Why am I always not the chosen one?

442
00:28:14,176 --> 00:28:16,478
What's wrong with me?

443
00:28:18,098 --> 00:28:20,335
- Yes, you do have a problem.
- Higashimura-san!

444
00:28:20,335 --> 00:28:22,346
Everyone has their weaknesses.

445
00:28:22,346 --> 00:28:26,343
It is destiny to meet someone

446
00:28:26,343 --> 00:28:29,162
who will make up for your weaknesses.

447
00:28:29,162 --> 00:28:30,811
Stop saying such beautiful words.

448
00:28:30,811 --> 00:28:33,680
It is not necessary to lower your standards.

449
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:38,236
It's our fault to introduce someone not up to your standard.

450
00:28:38,236 --> 00:28:41,472
We're deeply sorry for that.

451
00:28:45,072 --> 00:28:46,850
For my case,

452
00:28:47,793 --> 00:28:52,640
I don't think it's your fault.

453
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:56,514
I have things that I want to do now,

454
00:28:56,514 --> 00:28:59,175
and I'm not ready for marriage at all.

455
00:28:59,175 --> 00:29:04,202
When you are married, you need to consider your partner's happiness.

456
00:29:05,112 --> 00:29:07,024
Your partner...

457
00:29:07,024 --> 00:29:12,314
Yes, I'm already overloaded with my own matters.

458
00:29:12,314 --> 00:29:16,300
It's troublesome to do the household chores and look after my father.

459
00:29:19,944 --> 00:29:25,666
I'm sorry to have caused trouble to you.

460
00:29:27,491 --> 00:29:29,993
I'm really sorry.

461
00:29:32,324 --> 00:29:38,187
Segawa-san, Sawada-san has already canceled her membership,

462
00:29:38,187 --> 00:29:40,430
and won't continue with marriage hunting.

463
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:42,781
Therefore, this time...

464
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:45,682
When did you cancel your membership?

465
00:29:45,682 --> 00:29:48,011
Father.

466
00:29:56,383 --> 00:29:58,951
I'm sorry to keep you in the dark.

467
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:03,804
I knew that this was not a good lie,

468
00:30:06,773 --> 00:30:11,488
thus you don't have to lie, too.

469
00:30:12,179 --> 00:30:14,019
Lie?

470
00:30:14,882 --> 00:30:19,119
The letter written by mother which was together with the divorce application,

471
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:21,189
I read it.

472
00:30:24,591 --> 00:30:27,645
Mother told you to look after me.

473
00:30:28,495 --> 00:30:33,160
Therefore, you started marriage hunting because of me, right?

474
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:36,736
It's not just your mother.

475
00:30:36,736 --> 00:30:40,841
But I also want you to be happy.

476
00:30:40,841 --> 00:30:43,588
With me around, it's difficult for you to become someone's wife.

477
00:30:43,588 --> 00:30:47,281
My definition of happiness is different from yours.

478
00:30:47,281 --> 00:30:50,284
How different is it? To get married to the person you like...

479
00:30:50,284 --> 00:30:53,023
I have someone that I like!

480
00:30:55,629 --> 00:30:57,701
What?

481
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:00,959
Then what are you waiting for?

482
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:07,201
Because I like him, so getting attached to or married immediately

483
00:31:07,201 --> 00:31:10,367
is not what I really want.

484
00:31:12,673 --> 00:31:15,689
However...

485
00:31:17,578 --> 00:31:19,518
Is there "something"?

486
00:31:20,447 --> 00:31:22,742
You like him, and you do things for him.

487
00:31:22,742 --> 00:31:24,485
But yet you are not attached to a half-hearted relationship. Is that what you mean?

488
00:31:24,485 --> 00:31:26,186
I don't know what you are talking about.

489
00:31:26,186 --> 00:31:29,199
If you don't see yourself getting married to that person, you won't be happy.

490
00:31:29,199 --> 00:31:35,916
I've never imagined myself being married like you and mother.

491
00:31:39,343 --> 00:31:41,012
I don't mean that.

492
00:31:41,702 --> 00:31:44,738
So, it's my fault that you don't want to get married?

493
00:31:44,738 --> 00:31:48,350
- No, I don't mean that.
- Then what?

494
00:31:49,042 --> 00:31:50,883
I need to go for the evening classes now.

495
00:31:50,883 --> 00:31:53,775
Wait up.

496
00:31:56,895 --> 00:31:58,652
Eh?

497
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,279
Did you sprain yourself?

498
00:32:03,924 --> 00:32:06,414
Excuse me.

499
00:32:06,414 --> 00:32:11,265
Excuse me, my friend's father is here with back pain.

500
00:32:11,265 --> 00:32:14,327
- Okay.
- Sorry to trouble you.

501
00:32:14,327 --> 00:32:16,570
Good evening. What happened to you?

502
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:19,553
Sorry to trouble you after closing time.

503
00:32:19,553 --> 00:32:21,627
Are you all right?

504
00:32:32,452 --> 00:32:36,789
Excuse me, do I have any other problems?

505
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:40,609
No, don't worry.

506
00:32:40,609 --> 00:32:42,863
Please lower your knees.

507
00:32:42,863 --> 00:32:44,131
Let's try to sit up.

508
00:32:44,131 --> 00:32:47,131
One, two, three.

509
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:50,110
There's no other problem.

510
00:32:50,902 --> 00:32:53,706
Do you walk usually?

511
00:32:53,706 --> 00:32:58,162
I do walk, but I mainly sit down for my job.

512
00:32:58,162 --> 00:33:01,531
That's right. You do amendments for the dictionary.

513
00:33:01,531 --> 00:33:03,342
Yes.

514
00:33:03,342 --> 00:33:08,450
I'm really embarrassed

515
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:10,032
to lie that I'm a librarian.

516
00:33:10,032 --> 00:33:12,011
You don't have to be.

517
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:15,364
But why?

518
00:33:15,364 --> 00:33:18,356
That's because

519
00:33:18,356 --> 00:33:22,539
to put it simply, my job is not an attractive one to men.

520
00:33:22,539 --> 00:33:25,481
A female doctor going for marriage hunting.

521
00:33:25,481 --> 00:33:31,663
But isn't that just a white lie?

522
00:33:31,663 --> 00:33:33,881
In order to be successful in finding a partner,

523
00:33:33,881 --> 00:33:36,682
it's fine to tell a white lie to increase your success rate.

524
00:33:36,682 --> 00:33:39,578
Let's just stop this conversation.

525
00:33:39,578 --> 00:33:41,330
It just makes me more upset.

526
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:43,641
I'm sorry.

527
00:33:43,641 --> 00:33:47,615
But compared to my daughter who doesn't want to get married,

528
00:33:47,615 --> 00:33:49,295
you are right in your own way.

529
00:33:49,295 --> 00:33:51,755
Slide your body to the right.

530
00:33:51,755 --> 00:33:55,781
<i>She's already past thirty, but still says that she doesn't want to get married.</i>

531
00:33:55,781 --> 00:33:57,742
Point your left hand towards the ceiling.

532
00:33:57,742 --> 00:34:00,705
I know you obviously don't have to get married in this era,

533
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:03,695
but as a parent, I still would like her to.

534
00:34:03,695 --> 00:34:05,833
I know that parents would be worried.

535
00:34:05,833 --> 00:34:09,358
No, I'm not directing it at you.

536
00:34:09,358 --> 00:34:11,991
What is marriage?

537
00:34:11,991 --> 00:34:15,366
Is it something you do when you want to do it?

538
00:34:16,594 --> 00:34:23,050
I want to believe that it takes a miracle to meet

539
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:25,830
the right person at the right timing.

540
00:34:25,831 --> 00:34:27,713
A miracle?

541
00:34:27,713 --> 00:34:29,976
Yes, the miracle has not happened to me in decades,

542
00:34:29,976 --> 00:34:32,678
so I thought of going to the party.

543
00:34:37,243 --> 00:34:39,545
A miracle...

544
00:34:51,023 --> 00:34:53,825
- Higashimura-san, come here for a bit.
- Yes.

545
00:35:04,771 --> 00:35:07,640
Straighten your pelvis.

546
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:10,790
Focus your sight at one point.

547
00:35:11,342 --> 00:35:14,604
Stretch your spine.

548
00:35:14,604 --> 00:35:17,370
It's important to keep your back straight.

549
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:21,404
<i>[Higashimura Seita]</i>
<i>[Can we meet today?]</i>

550
00:35:39,106 --> 00:35:42,141
This is from Segawa-san as a form of apology.

551
00:35:42,141 --> 00:35:45,744
It's dango! Mitarashi dango!

552
00:35:45,744 --> 00:35:49,828
It seems that he went to find a good shop for your favorite sweet.

553
00:35:49,828 --> 00:35:53,409
He was hoping to apologize in person, but he thought you would not like it.

554
00:35:54,254 --> 00:35:56,122
I see.

555
00:35:56,122 --> 00:36:00,826
I think he would be able to find his partner soon.

556
00:36:02,462 --> 00:36:06,263
But this is too much. How about we share them?

557
00:36:06,263 --> 00:36:11,260
I don't really like dango, because I've choked on them before.

558
00:36:11,894 --> 00:36:15,955
So, you don't like dango and carrots?

559
00:36:17,272 --> 00:36:19,998
We are total opposites.

560
00:36:19,998 --> 00:36:21,551
That's true.

561
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:34,030
By doing this job, I sometimes wonder what it is to be compatible.

562
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:37,826
I think it is more of the values.

563
00:36:37,826 --> 00:36:41,156
But there is also the food that you like,

564
00:36:41,156 --> 00:36:45,037
frequency of washing the bath towel, or whether you like the Giants or not.

565
00:36:45,037 --> 00:36:47,739
Regardless of the hobbies or values,

566
00:36:47,739 --> 00:36:51,021
you would still like the person, right?

567
00:36:51,021 --> 00:36:54,499
Acknowledging the differences,

568
00:36:54,499 --> 00:36:57,492
or even giving up your beliefs?

569
00:36:57,492 --> 00:37:01,884
If you can accept the differences,

570
00:37:01,884 --> 00:37:05,487
I realized recently that you can become a family.

571
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:13,763
Your father told me that he had totally different hobbies from your mother.

572
00:37:13,763 --> 00:37:15,711
Did he say that?

573
00:37:15,711 --> 00:37:17,344
Yes.

574
00:37:27,891 --> 00:37:31,993
Hey, do you have anything after this?

575
00:37:31,993 --> 00:37:35,747
It's still a bit early, but I can finish my work without going to the office.

576
00:37:35,747 --> 00:37:37,508
I see.

577
00:37:37,508 --> 00:37:39,440
Yes.

578
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:45,918
- Then...
- Then...

579
00:37:47,332 --> 00:37:49,035
Wait for me!

580
00:37:49,035 --> 00:37:50,422
Wait up!

581
00:37:50,422 --> 00:37:52,239
Let's go.

582
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:54,241
Hurry up.

583
00:37:56,430 --> 00:37:58,044
Please excuse me.

584
00:37:58,044 --> 00:38:00,046
Don't worry about it.

585
00:38:03,784 --> 00:38:09,688
I did not know you used to work in a travel agency,

586
00:38:09,688 --> 00:38:11,888
even though I'm your friend.

587
00:38:11,888 --> 00:38:15,758
Thinking about it, you always eat my favorite curry,

588
00:38:15,758 --> 00:38:18,876
and we are always talking about myself.

589
00:38:18,876 --> 00:38:22,862
Let's go eat something you like next time.

590
00:38:26,438 --> 00:38:29,540
I want to know more about you.

591
00:38:31,548 --> 00:38:33,578
Sorry, I have a call.

592
00:38:35,482 --> 00:38:37,228
It's Hayate.

593
00:38:37,228 --> 00:38:41,090
- Go ahead.
- Please excuse me.

594
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:43,061
Hello.

595
00:38:43,949 --> 00:38:45,914
Now?

596
00:38:47,712 --> 00:38:50,440
I'm with a friend.

597
00:38:51,029 --> 00:38:54,891
I just registered as a member in your yoga studio.

598
00:38:54,891 --> 00:38:57,712
Let's go eat something.

599
00:38:57,712 --> 00:39:00,351
I'm not free today.

600
00:39:00,351 --> 00:39:02,568
I have something to do.

601
00:39:02,568 --> 00:39:04,065
Eh?

602
00:39:11,084 --> 00:39:12,518
Hello.

603
00:39:12,518 --> 00:39:14,052
Okay.

604
00:39:14,052 --> 00:39:16,187
Let's flip this.

605
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:18,924
- I'm good, right?
- Yes, it looks delicious.

606
00:39:18,924 --> 00:39:22,162
I want to do it, too.

607
00:39:22,162 --> 00:39:24,061
- You can do it.
- I'm going to flip it.

608
00:39:24,061 --> 00:39:25,097
One, two!

609
00:39:25,097 --> 00:39:27,933
- You are good!
- Yeah.

610
00:39:27,933 --> 00:39:31,269
Are you okay with the sweet sauce?

611
00:39:31,269 --> 00:39:33,204
Can a yoga instructor eat this?

612
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:36,608
Today, I just want to eat something I like.

613
00:39:36,608 --> 00:39:41,347
From now onwards, let's always go eat something that you crave.

614
00:39:41,347 --> 00:39:43,381
Then you will be looking forward to our meeting.

615
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:46,228
But we won't be able to meet often, because I don't want to put on weight.

616
00:39:46,228 --> 00:39:50,899
Then let's give that up. We'll just go for soba.

617
00:39:52,025 --> 00:39:57,306
Do you not like okonomiyaki due to your yoga job?

618
00:39:57,306 --> 00:39:58,952
No.

619
00:40:02,836 --> 00:40:04,711
Isn't this ready to eat?

620
00:40:04,711 --> 00:40:06,279
Sauce, please.

621
00:40:06,279 --> 00:40:07,672
Here I go.

622
00:40:07,672 --> 00:40:09,407
How about some Worcestershire sauce?

623
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:12,712
Does it go together well? I don't think so.

624
00:40:27,757 --> 00:40:30,907
<i>[Anna]</i>
<i>[It's okay to stay over next time.]</i>

625
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,543
This dango is extremely delicious.

626
00:40:45,845 --> 00:40:49,183
Ah, do you want to come over and eat dango with my father?

627
00:40:49,183 --> 00:40:52,590
- My father will be happy to see you.
- Really?

628
00:40:53,694 --> 00:40:57,521
I used to like going to your house.

629
00:40:57,521 --> 00:41:00,692
Therefore, when I had to go to your house,

630
00:41:00,692 --> 00:41:03,607
I was always very happy.

631
00:41:03,607 --> 00:41:06,900
I wanted so much to become a child of your family,

632
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:09,340
and continue to stay together.

633
00:41:11,648 --> 00:41:15,941
"What a good and happy family." I thought.

634
00:41:24,443 --> 00:41:26,814
I'll go to your house next time.

635
00:41:28,246 --> 00:41:31,770
See you.

636
00:41:36,697 --> 00:41:39,715
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

637
00:42:08,396 --> 00:42:10,317
I'm home.

638
00:42:20,772 --> 00:42:22,497
I'm sorry.

639
00:42:26,828 --> 00:42:29,484
What I wanted to say was,

640
00:42:29,484 --> 00:42:35,507
I cannot get married

641
00:42:35,507 --> 00:42:39,030
because I can't be like mother who can take care of you so well.

642
00:42:40,044 --> 00:42:45,230
I can't take care of someone like father who forgets where his socks are.

643
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:51,038
I can't invite the neighbors to meals like mother did.

644
00:42:51,038 --> 00:42:53,170
I really...

645
00:42:54,008 --> 00:42:59,530
I really like our family.

646
00:43:00,444 --> 00:43:04,301
I'm blessed to have been born into this family.

647
00:43:07,654 --> 00:43:12,125
Therefore, our perspective of happiness...

648
00:43:12,125 --> 00:43:18,731
Maybe you would encounter your own miracle when you meet your Mr. Right at the right timing.

649
00:43:20,537 --> 00:43:23,068
Why this sudden change?

650
00:43:23,748 --> 00:43:26,050
The same goes for you, too.

651
00:43:27,644 --> 00:43:30,673
I was talking to my friend,

652
00:43:30,673 --> 00:43:33,547
regardless of hobbies, habits, and values,

653
00:43:33,547 --> 00:43:38,964
a family is a family on its own.

654
00:43:38,964 --> 00:43:41,381
Does it sound a bit weird?

655
00:43:41,381 --> 00:43:44,967
Well, as a family, you have no choice

656
00:43:44,967 --> 00:43:47,369
but to accept the differences.

657
00:43:49,028 --> 00:43:50,860
I see.

658
00:43:51,551 --> 00:43:53,656
You have a good friend.

659
00:43:56,270 --> 00:43:58,382
Then what about you?

660
00:43:58,382 --> 00:44:03,554
Me? Well...

661
00:44:05,276 --> 00:44:08,482
- Do you want dango?
- Yes, please.

662
00:44:08,482 --> 00:44:10,568
