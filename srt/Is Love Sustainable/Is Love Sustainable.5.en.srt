It's the last time.

3
00:00:05,439 --> 00:00:09,309
I'm glad I met you, Seita-san.

4
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:11,177

Seita-san?

7
00:00:35,855 --> 00:00:41,372
Sorry, I suddenly... A goodbye hug. For the last time.

8
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,815
Nijiro is attending English lessons, so I got influenced by him.

9
00:00:47,815 --> 00:00:53,085
Oh, Hayate came back from overseas, so he sometimes does this too.

10
00:00:53,085 --> 00:00:54,855
Is that so?

11
00:00:54,855 --> 00:00:57,205
I'll get going, then.

12
00:00:57,205 --> 00:00:59,259
Sure. See you next timeー

13
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:03,999
I wish you success... in going independent.

14
00:01:15,365 --> 00:01:18,285
Huh? Independent? Who?

15
00:01:18,285 --> 00:01:19,795
Me.

16
00:01:19,795 --> 00:01:21,305
I don't get what you're talking about.

17
00:01:21,305 --> 00:01:23,817
Did I not tell you before, Dad?

18
00:01:23,817 --> 00:01:28,088
I didn't hear about that. Do you even have money to go independent?

19
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,857
I've saved up enough.

20
00:01:29,857 --> 00:01:33,292
The reason why I came back to live here is also to save enough capital for my startup.

21
00:01:33,292 --> 00:01:34,995
So it wasn't for my sake?

22
00:01:34,995 --> 00:01:37,535
Well, partly that, too.

23
00:01:37,535 --> 00:01:39,208
Did you tell Hayate about it?

24
00:01:39,208 --> 00:01:41,168
- Why should I?
- After all, the two of you areー

25
00:01:41,168 --> 00:01:44,237
I'll lend my hand in anything if it's for Kyoka's dream.

26
00:01:44,237 --> 00:01:46,907
- Welcome home, Hayate.
- I'm back.

27
00:01:46,907 --> 00:01:51,095
For now, shall I check with my friends about any rent-free venues where you can conduct lessons?

28
00:01:51,095 --> 00:01:53,038
Really? Thanks!

29
00:01:53,038 --> 00:01:54,648
Hayate, you're okay with that?

30
00:01:54,648 --> 00:01:56,049
Dad...

31
00:01:56,049 --> 00:02:00,197
You've gotten it wrong all this time. We're not in that kind of relationship. Totally not.

32
00:02:00,197 --> 00:02:01,765
- W-What?
- "What?"

33
00:02:01,765 --> 00:02:03,955
Unfortunately, not yet.

34
00:02:03,955 --> 00:02:07,665
Jeez, if you say it like that, my dad will really take you seriously.

35
00:02:07,665 --> 00:02:11,412
Huh? In that case, that someone you like is...

36
00:02:12,825 --> 00:02:16,115
Anyway, rather than who I like or dislike,

37
00:02:16,115 --> 00:02:17,805
there's something more important.

38
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:21,315
Right now, I'm only focused on going independent, and I'm going all the way.

39
00:02:25,023 --> 00:02:29,149
From now on, I'll work hard to live up to your expectations.

40
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,950

00:04:50,825 --> 00:04:52,968
- I see that you like flowers.
- Not really.

73
00:04:52,968 --> 00:04:54,494
But just now...

74
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:56,505
My wife taught me that.

75
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:59,165
- Your wife?
- That's right.

76
00:05:00,245 --> 00:05:08,808
Initially, my knowledge of flowers was only limited to knowing whether they are white, red, big, or small.

77
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:12,455
But one day, I saw the flowers that my wife decorated our home with,

78
00:05:12,455 --> 00:05:16,535
and for the first time, realized that our feelings can be healed by flowers.

79
00:05:16,535 --> 00:05:18,852
From then on, I started knowing more flower terminologies.

80
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:21,025
It's wonderful to hear that.

81
00:05:21,025 --> 00:05:24,575
What was your wife like?

82
00:05:26,555 --> 00:05:27,975
Oh, I'm sorry for being rude.

83
00:05:27,975 --> 00:05:31,631
Don't be. I just wasn't sure how to explain it.

84
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:35,275
She was sort of a unique person to me.

85
00:05:35,275 --> 00:05:40,265
She was the one who taught me the real meaning of words.

86
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,905
If you write down the word "the sky above",

87
00:05:43,905 --> 00:05:46,835
it has another meaning, which is "to be in another world".

88
00:05:46,835 --> 00:05:49,865
When you think about how it's interpreted...

89
00:05:53,334 --> 00:05:54,388
<i>No!</i>

90
00:05:54,388 --> 00:05:56,515
<i>It'll be all right,</i>

94
00:06:05,525 --> 00:06:07,567
<i>how it's like to be in another world?</i>

95
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:09,536
<i>- Please do it.
- Okay.</i>

96
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:12,285
<i>I can't! I can't! No, no, no, no!</i>

97
00:06:12,285 --> 00:06:15,365
<i>- You'll be fine! Come on!
- I can't do it! No!</i>

98
00:06:15,365 --> 00:06:21,720
Instead of being in another world, I fainted and ended up having a bad experience.

99
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:25,635
Just like that, she brought me to all kinds of places.

100
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:29,305
In reality, half of them were by force.

101
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:33,445
She showed me a real world that cannot be found in books.

102
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:38,298
She was really a wonderful wife.

103
00:06:38,298 --> 00:06:41,845
But I have to move on.

104
00:06:41,845 --> 00:06:46,583
My wife wrote me a letter before she passed away, asking me to remarry.

105
00:06:50,135 --> 00:06:54,700
I'll cheer you on in your marriage hunting, Sawada-san.

106

107

- Swing it widely.

Dad, where have you been?

111
00:07:16,715 --> 00:07:20,145
- I went for a walk.
- This early in the morning?

112
00:07:20,145 --> 00:07:21,845
You went alone, wearing this?

113
00:07:21,845 --> 00:07:24,189
Doesn't matter who I'm walking with, right?

114
00:07:24,189 --> 00:07:26,315
Who were you with?

115
00:07:26,315 --> 00:07:28,055
Ah, could it be a walking marriage hunt?

116
00:07:28,055 --> 00:07:32,345
No, it's not! It's the doctor, you know, my back pain.

117
00:07:32,345 --> 00:07:35,285
It's the doctor at your friend's clinic.

118
00:07:35,285 --> 00:07:39,155
She suggested that I walk often to prevent my back pain from acting up.

119
00:07:39,155 --> 00:07:44,375
I heard that the doctor at Suzu's clinic is a very beautiful woman.

120
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:47,765
Different people have d-different standards of beauty.

121
00:07:47,765 --> 00:07:49,538
- So how was it?
- I'm taking a shower.

122
00:07:49,538 --> 00:07:52,674
- Door closing.
- How was it? Was it that doctor?

123
00:07:52,674 --> 00:07:55,105
- I'm really curious.
- Yeah.

128
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:09,235
I'm afraid I'll have to turn it down.

129
00:08:09,235 --> 00:08:12,505
Is that so? What a shame.

130
00:08:12,505 --> 00:08:16,555
Since you're not interested in managing them, it won't work out even if I force you to.

Thank you for taking care of my dad.

Well, that's part of the reason,

152

00:09:45,575 --> 00:09:48,295
Wait, with my dad?

154
00:09:48,295 --> 00:09:53,068
Yes. He knows a lot about marriage and husband-wife relationships.

155
00:09:53,068 --> 00:09:54,494
My dad does?

156
00:09:54,494 --> 00:10:00,835
The other day, too. He chatted with me a lot about his late wife.

157
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:03,825
Your mom was a wonderful woman.

158
00:10:04,655 --> 00:10:08,675
So he's now able to open up and talk about my mom?

159
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:14,247
When my mom passed away,

160
00:10:16,355 --> 00:10:19,715
<i>it looked like a part of him has died.</i>

161
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:27,633
I really had a hard time back then.

162
00:10:27,633 --> 00:10:33,165
Well, in the first place, my dad wasn't good at living on his own.

163
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:37,904
Is that so? He looked like he enjoyed himself when we chatted that day.

164
00:10:37,904 --> 00:10:42,405
But since he's started marriage hunting, that means he's all right now, no?

165
00:10:42,405 --> 00:10:45,655
I hope he'll marry someone soon,

166

so that I can also devote everything to my work.

167
00:10:48,645 --> 00:10:53,710
Kyoka-san is planning to go independent, unlike a paid worker like me.

168
00:10:54,535 --> 00:10:59,635
Say, Hinata-san, when did you open your own clinic?

169
00:10:59,635 --> 00:11:03,315
I opened my own clinic when I was 37.

170
00:11:03,315 --> 00:11:05,875
I was working at a university hospital until I was in my 30s.

171
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:08,461
Then why did you go independent?

172
00:11:09,405 --> 00:11:12,495
I didn't want to be a grumpy old lady in the future.

173
00:11:12,495 --> 00:11:14,065
Grumpy?

174
00:11:14,065 --> 00:11:18,485
When I become an old lady, I didn't want to complain that, "I should have started my own business".

175
00:11:18,485 --> 00:11:21,191
I'd much rather complain that I went independent,

176
00:11:21,191 --> 00:11:22,965
but it didn't work out.

177
00:11:22,965 --> 00:11:26,465
I thought old ladies would normally complain.

178
00:11:26,465 --> 00:11:30,625
Of course, people who don't complain are wonderful, myself included.

179
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:35,715
But on the contrary, isn't it harder to trust people who just live normal lives

180
00:11:35,715 --> 00:11:38,500
without complaints or regrets?

181
00:11:39,195 --> 00:11:42,245
I'd rather complain that live regretting it.

182
00:11:42,245 --> 00:11:46,595
Then, by choosing work over marriage,

183
00:11:46,595 --> 00:11:48,141
when you're an old lady, you alsoー

184
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:50,701
I didn't choose it.

185
00:11:50,701 --> 00:11:53,890
That was just how it happened.

186
00:11:54,675 --> 00:11:57,125
Now I feel like complaining.

187
00:11:58,085 --> 00:12:02,795
Perhaps you can tell me more specifically about your requirements in a female partner.

188
00:12:02,795 --> 00:12:05,615
My requirements in a female partner?

189
00:12:05,615 --> 00:12:11,175
That way, we can visualize the kind of future married life that you hope to have.

190
00:12:11,175 --> 00:12:14,965
It can be the food she likes, her hobbies, or anything will do.

191
00:12:21,102 --> 00:12:23,072
<i>Thank you.</i>

192
00:12:36,465 --> 00:12:40,115
Someone who can outlive me.

193
00:12:42,545 --> 00:12:45,185
I'm tired of sending people off.

194
00:12:46,805 --> 00:12:51,095
Wait, it's bad to make a lady feel that way, right?

195
00:12:52,515 --> 00:12:56,065
- Sawada-san, if you still have lingering feelings for your wife-
- No.

196
00:12:56,065 --> 00:12:59,485
I'm looking for a partner because I don't want to be a burden to my daughter.

197
00:13:01,395 --> 00:13:05,745
To be honest, I actually wanted Kyoka to get married.

198
00:13:05,745 --> 00:13:09,155
To just live a normal, happy life.

199
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:11,025
A normal...

200
00:13:11,025 --> 00:13:15,480
Yes. A normal life, for my daughter.

201
00:13:16,225 --> 00:13:20,595
If I tell her that, she'll be mad at me for sure.

You're apologizing?

open our studios to the public, and set up a bazaar.

226
00:15:31,745 --> 00:15:33,605
It'll be a lot of work.

00:15:33,605 --> 00:15:36,765
Really? Live in the moment.

228
00:15:36,765 --> 00:15:41,005
It means "enjoy the present". That's the spirit of yoga.

00:15:41,005 --> 00:15:44,590
Oh, maybe I should invite Hinata-san too.

- Yup.
- Why?

232
00:15:49,355 --> 00:15:53,565
I was wondering who your walking date is,

233
00:15:53,565 --> 00:15:55,185
so I went to Suzu's clinic.

234
00:15:55,185 --> 00:15:58,165
- She's not my date.
- She's not, right?

235
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:03,060
A wonderful woman like her wouldn't see you as a potential partner, right?

236
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,298
Do you remember?

237
00:16:04,298 --> 00:16:07,968
That doctor at the marriage meeting party.

238
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:11,295
Oh, that beautiful lady?

239
00:16:11,295 --> 00:16:13,035
Sounds like fun to walk with her.

240
00:16:13,035 --> 00:16:15,325
I said it's not what you think.

241
00:16:15,325 --> 00:16:18,685
I'm going for a marriage meeting with someone else this time.

242
00:16:18,685 --> 00:16:20,625
Huh? Who is she?

243
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:22,215
I don't know the details,

244
00:16:22,215 --> 00:16:26,815
but it should be a nice person since Higashimura-san is doing the recommendation.

245
00:16:26,815 --> 00:16:30,200
Good luck with your meeting, then.

246
00:16:31,955 --> 00:16:33,295
Oh, right.

247
00:16:33,295 --> 00:16:37,798
I think it's time to dispose of Yoko-san's clothes.

248
00:16:37,798 --> 00:16:39,633
Are you okay with that?

249
00:16:39,633 --> 00:16:42,033
I'm sure Yoko-san, too...

250
00:16:42,033 --> 00:16:44,685
"You should have thrown them away sooner",

251
00:16:44,685 --> 00:16:47,595
is what mom would say, right?

252
00:16:48,705 --> 00:16:52,595
I see. You're right.

253
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:54,175
Oh.

254
00:16:54,175 --> 00:16:57,655
Speaking of which, why not sell aunt's clothes at the bazaar?

255
00:16:57,655 --> 00:17:00,995
Good idea! It's better than throwing them away.

256

00:22:45,482 --> 00:22:47,902
Stretch your right leg back to rest on your toes,

348
00:22:47,902 --> 00:22:50,042
and turn your heel inwards.

349
00:22:50,042 --> 00:22:53,952
Turn your left leg outwards 90 degrees, and face forward.

350
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:59,772
Extend your right arm through the sky, until it touches your ear.

351
00:22:59,772 --> 00:23:01,902
Raise the corners of your mouth slightly,

352
00:23:01,902 --> 00:23:05,302
and relax the muscles on your face.

353
00:23:05,302 --> 00:23:09,502
This is called the Savasana pose.

354
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,272
Entrust your body to the land,

355
00:23:12,272 --> 00:23:15,592
and clear your mind.

356
00:23:15,592 --> 00:23:17,822
You may be constantly busy

357
00:23:17,822 --> 00:23:21,482
with work or house chores.

358
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:25,432
When you take time to stop thinking about them,

359
00:23:25,432 --> 00:23:29,008
it opens you to the deepest part of your emotions.

360
00:23:29,008 --> 00:23:32,652
Negative emotions like sadness, frustration,

361
00:23:32,652 --> 00:23:37,162
and things you complain about may start to emerge,

362
00:23:37,162 --> 00:23:39,732
but that's all part of you.

363
00:23:39,732 --> 00:23:42,682
Don't close off these painful feelings.

364
00:23:42,682 --> 00:23:44,802
Just merely feel them,

365
00:23:44,802 --> 00:23:46,962
let them out,

366
00:23:46,962 --> 00:23:49,432
and accept them.

367
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,422
Right now, sit upright,

368
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:58,762
and press your hands together in front of your chest.

369
00:23:58,762 --> 00:24:00,306
Thank you for the session.

370
00:24:00,306 --> 00:24:02,852
Thank you very much.

371
00:24:02,852 --> 00:24:07,452
Let's also give our thanks to those around us who have spent this time together with us.

372
00:24:07,452 --> 00:24:09,075
Thank you very much.

373
00:24:09,075 --> 00:24:14,185
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you very much.

374
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,352
Thank you.

375
00:24:16,352 --> 00:24:19,142
Thank you for the session.

376
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:22,592
- Thank you so much.
- How was it?

377
00:24:22,592 --> 00:24:26,102
My body is still quite inflexible, but your words really soothe me.

378
00:24:26,102 --> 00:24:29,932
But even now, I still can't apply whatever I said on myself.

379
00:24:29,932 --> 00:24:32,162
That's rather common for instructors.

380
00:24:32,162 --> 00:24:36,062
Orthopedic surgeons have stiff shoulders too, so we're no different.

381
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:38,822
Kyoka-chan.

382
00:24:38,822 --> 00:24:41,232
Hey, good job. Thanks.

383
00:24:41,232 --> 00:24:44,942
Tell me about it. When Mikako Sensei's autograph session started,

384
00:24:44,942 --> 00:24:48,372
I was forced to be her manager. It was really tough.

385
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:51,852
Oh, you're Hinata Sensei, right?

386
00:24:51,852 --> 00:24:53,572
Yes.

387
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:59,952
Hi, it's been a while.

388
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:09,388
Uncle.

389
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:13,572
Looking for Kyoka-chan? She's over there.

390
00:25:13,572 --> 00:25:16,599
Here you go. Thank you very much.

391
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,742
How did the marriage meeting go?

392
00:25:20,742 --> 00:25:23,962
Well, it wasn't bad at all. We had a good conversation.

393
00:25:23,962 --> 00:25:25,822
- Really?
- Dad.

394
00:25:25,822 --> 00:25:28,812
- Hey.
- Buy something and contribute to our profits.

395
00:25:28,812 --> 00:25:31,525
So that's what it is, huh? Did you manage to sell our stuff?

396
00:25:31,525 --> 00:25:34,635
Yup. What's left are only these.

397
00:25:34,635 --> 00:25:38,285
Mom's scarf was sold rather quickly.

398
00:25:38,285 --> 00:25:40,552
- Scarf?
- Yeah.

399
00:25:40,552 --> 00:25:42,902
You know, the orange one.

400
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,552
No, I didn't throw that away.

401
00:25:45,552 --> 00:25:49,452
But it was in the box. Right, Hayate?

402
00:25:49,452 --> 00:25:51,462
- Did you check properly?
- I did.

403
00:25:51,462 --> 00:25:53,552
- But it was in the box.
- Why?

404
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:57,092
I'm so sorry! It's my fault.

405
00:25:57,092 --> 00:26:00,972
It was on top of the box this morning, so I just assumed.

406
00:26:00,972 --> 00:26:03,992
On top? It must have dropped!

407
00:26:03,992 --> 00:26:06,952
I'm truly sorry. It's all my fault.

408
00:26:06,952 --> 00:26:10,222
It's okay, Hayate. You didn't know that. There's nothing we can do.

409
00:26:10,222 --> 00:26:11,793
Sawada-san?

410
00:26:11,793 --> 00:26:13,552
Oh, Hinata-san.

411
00:26:13,552 --> 00:26:16,982
- What's happened?
- We made a mistake,

412
00:26:16,982 --> 00:26:19,792
and accidentally sold my mom's scarf during the bazaar.

413
00:26:19,792 --> 00:26:21,892
- Scarf?
- No need to worry.

414
00:26:21,892 --> 00:26:26,132
My wife would have wanted me to move on. Yup.

415
00:26:26,132 --> 00:26:29,422
You mean, the orange scarf that was here?

416
00:26:29,422 --> 00:26:32,662
- Yes.
- I remember the people who bought it.

417
00:26:32,662 --> 00:26:34,864
They were also at the yoga session just now.

418
00:26:34,864 --> 00:26:36,255
Really?

419
00:26:36,255 --> 00:26:39,615
They may still be around. What do they look like?

420
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:41,912
It's two ladies in their 40s.

421
00:26:41,912 --> 00:26:44,242
They have bob hairstyles and were wearing yellow.

422
00:26:44,242 --> 00:26:46,792
They're the Tamagawa sisters.

423
00:26:46,792 --> 00:26:48,342
What do you mean?

424
00:26:48,342 --> 00:26:51,482
Don't you know them? I took a picture with them earlier.

425
00:26:51,482 --> 00:26:53,312
They're quite well-known in this area.

426
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:55,932
I heard if you put it on your standby screen, you'll achieve happiness.

427
00:26:55,932 --> 00:26:59,352
It's now the buzz among high school girls in the Nikotama neighborhood.

428
00:26:59,352 --> 00:27:01,642
Now that you mention, after the yoga...

429
00:27:01,642 --> 00:27:05,882
<i>This marks the end of our session. Thank you very much.</i>

430
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:10,452
<i>It feels so good. I worked out a sweat.</i>

431
00:27:10,452 --> 00:27:14,752
<i>Me too. Maybe I should head to the salon for a head spa after this?</i>

432
00:27:14,752 --> 00:27:17,052
<i>Great idea!</i>

433
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:20,122
<i>- All right if I join you?
- Of course.</i>

434
00:27:20,122 --> 00:27:23,222
<i>Sustainable, indeed!</i>

435
00:27:23,222 --> 00:27:24,492
Let's look for them.

436
00:27:24,492 --> 00:27:27,632
- They're probably at one of the salons around here.
- But...

437
00:27:27,632 --> 00:27:29,232
The scarf is important to you, right?

438
00:27:29,232 --> 00:27:31,072
Hurry!

439
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:35,532
- Yes, Ma'am!
- I'm going too.

440
00:27:35,532 --> 00:27:37,422
I'm counting on you!

441
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:51,638
Bob hairstyle, yellow clothes.

442
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,340
You're the Tamagawa Sistersー

443
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:58,982
Not. Sorry about that.

444
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,959
Thank you very much.

445
00:28:12,959 --> 00:28:14,879
Let's go to the next one.

446
00:28:14,879 --> 00:28:18,439
The ladies have bob hairstyles and wear yellow clothes.

447
00:28:18,439 --> 00:28:21,549
- Understood. Thank you very much.
- No problem.

448
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:27,240
Let's go to this salon next.

449
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:29,490
It's enough.

450
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:31,621
Huh?

451
00:28:31,621 --> 00:28:33,879
Really, it's enough.

452
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:40,409
But... isn't it something important to you?

453
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:45,749
My dream was to become a dictionary maker.

454
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:54,219
But a dictionary only gets published once every seven, or eight years.

455
00:28:54,219 --> 00:29:00,249
Naturally, the number of scholars involved in compiling dictionaries is few and far between.

456
00:29:00,249 --> 00:29:02,229
I see.

457
00:29:02,229 --> 00:29:05,309
I didn't have much luck,

458
00:29:05,309 --> 00:29:09,289
and I wasn't selected for the editorial committee at that time.

459
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:20,549
<i>What a pity.</i>

460
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:26,470
<i>Rather than feeling it a pity,</i>

461
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,179
<i>I feel more frustrated than anything.</i>

462
00:29:30,179 --> 00:29:33,879
<i>Then, it's frustrating, right?</i>

463
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:39,149
<i>And sad, too. Perhaps.</i>

464
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:46,648
<i>Disappointed, heartbroken, dismayed,</i>

465
00:29:46,648 --> 00:29:52,769
<i>dejected, discouraged, miserable.</i>

466
00:29:52,769 --> 00:29:55,519
<i>Even though you know so many words</i>

467
00:29:55,519 --> 00:29:58,299
<i>associated with depressed emotions.</i>

468
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:02,389
<i>I still feel frustrated, after all.</i>

469
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:07,140
<i>So frustrating!</i>

470
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:26,209
<i>I'm pathetic, right?</i>

471
00:30:26,209 --> 00:30:27,639
<i>Sorry.</i>

472
00:30:27,639 --> 00:30:30,009
<i>Seeing this side of you</i>

473
00:30:30,009 --> 00:30:32,609
<i>is my special privilege as your wife.</i>

474
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:51,129
<i>I'm... so pathetic.</i>

475
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:06,249
Let's go. We'll definitely find the scarf.

476
00:31:06,249 --> 00:31:07,596
Huh?

477
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:17,210
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

478
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:19,025
We are looking for someone.

479
00:31:19,025 --> 00:31:23,795
She has a bob hairstyle and wears yellow clothes. Could we take a look inside...?

480
00:31:23,795 --> 00:31:25,835
Bob hairstyle and yellow clothes.

481
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:30,635
- Huh?
- O-Oh, I'm sorry.

482
00:31:30,635 --> 00:31:32,885
They have bob hairstyles, and wear yellow clothes.

483
00:31:32,885 --> 00:31:34,855
<i>- The Tamagawa sisters?</i>
- That's right!

484
00:31:34,855 --> 00:31:36,835
I saw them waving at the train at the riverside just now.

485
00:31:36,835 --> 00:31:39,435
- W-Where?
- Not true. I saw them at the park feeding the pigeons.

486
00:31:39,435 --> 00:31:41,135
When? Over there?

487
00:31:41,135 --> 00:31:43,545
By the way, Brother, you're kind of cute.

488
00:31:43,545 --> 00:31:45,975
- Super cute!
- Can we take a photo together?

489
00:31:45,975 --> 00:31:47,675
Super cute? Okay.

490
00:31:47,675 --> 00:31:50,158
Super cute...

491
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:53,158
<i>Super cute...</i>

492
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:13,525
P-Please put on your glasses.

493
00:32:13,525 --> 00:32:15,745
- Your glasses.
- Glasses?

494
00:32:15,745 --> 00:32:19,451
<i>Glasses, glasses...</i>

495
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:25,035
- Thank you so much!
- Huh?

496
00:32:25,035 --> 00:32:28,690
What's going on?

497
00:32:29,355 --> 00:32:31,735
Oh, hello.

498
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:36,365
- That's the one!
- What's this about?

499
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,655
Sorry.

500
00:32:38,655 --> 00:32:41,845
But could you return that to us?

501
00:32:41,845 --> 00:32:44,475
Does this belong to a big brand, or something?

502
00:32:44,475 --> 00:32:50,675
No, but it's something very important to us.

503
00:32:50,675 --> 00:32:52,765
So, please.

504
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:56,615
Please.

505
00:32:57,570 --> 00:33:00,522
Feels good.

506
00:33:00,522 --> 00:33:04,435
<i>Sustainable, indeed.</i>

507
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:09,435
So sorry to trouble you.

508
00:33:09,435 --> 00:33:11,599
You went out of your way to do this for me.

509
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:14,826
No problem. I'm glad we found it.

510
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:19,005
I thought I'll be fine even without my wife's belongings.

511
00:33:19,005 --> 00:33:21,935
But I guess I couldn't let go.

512
00:33:21,935 --> 00:33:23,465
Yes.

513
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:27,015
It's about time that I should move on.

514
00:33:27,015 --> 00:33:31,835
In fact, even now, I keep reminding myself about that every day.

515
00:33:31,835 --> 00:33:35,495
But it's only this one...

516
00:33:35,495 --> 00:33:37,635
I'm so pathetic.

517
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:42,645
It's all right to be pathetic, isn't it?

518
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:46,615
Your wife whom you hold dearly in your heart

519
00:33:46,615 --> 00:33:49,395
has also saved me.

520
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:54,605
Did you see my snot on that scarf?

521
00:33:54,605 --> 00:33:56,115
What?

522
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:06,599
It's tiring to just keep moving on.

523
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:10,315
Don't close off these painful feelings.

524
00:34:10,315 --> 00:34:13,875
Just feel them, let them out,

525
00:34:13,875 --> 00:34:16,662
and accept them.

526
00:34:16,662 --> 00:34:19,902
That was what Kyoka-san said during her lesson just now.

527
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:26,225
Now that we are older,

528
00:34:26,225 --> 00:34:28,733
we've gained lots of memories.

529
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:31,405
We all carry them with us,

530
00:34:31,405 --> 00:34:35,565
but we'll look back on them occasionally as we walk on.

531
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:39,535
Wouldn't that be enough?

532
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:57,488
- I'm home.
- Welcome back.

533
00:34:57,488 --> 00:35:00,558
- I'm dead tired.
- It's been a long day.

534
00:35:00,558 --> 00:35:02,701
You must be tired too, right, Hayate?

535
00:35:02,701 --> 00:35:04,972
Thanks for everything.

536
00:35:04,972 --> 00:35:07,725
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

537
00:35:07,725 --> 00:35:11,958
Uncle is already feeling sorry about it. So don't quarrel with him, all right?

538
00:35:11,958 --> 00:35:14,688
- I get it already.
- Really?

539
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:16,826
Hey, you're back.

540
00:35:16,826 --> 00:35:18,008
I'm home.

541
00:35:18,008 --> 00:35:20,798
I'll go for my bath, then.

542
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:25,728
Sorry about today.

543
00:35:25,728 --> 00:35:27,458
It's okay.

544
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:31,038
Sorry. I didn't consider your feelings at all.

545
00:35:31,038 --> 00:35:35,508
No. Everything is fine already.

546
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:41,105
In fact, people may not want to forget,

547
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:45,608
but they'll start to forget gradually.

548
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:50,510
There are times when I feel like seeing her.

549
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:54,388
And I'll wonder if she'll suddenly appear from there.

550
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,898
"Rintaro,

551
00:36:00,898 --> 00:36:04,853
please keep the mess to your own room only".

552
00:36:04,853 --> 00:36:07,468
Mom will say something like that, right?

553
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:14,548
Your mom's voice sounds more refreshing than that.

554
00:36:14,548 --> 00:36:16,778
Hey, you're trying to beautify mom, aren't you?

555
00:36:16,778 --> 00:36:19,448
No, I'm not. Could it be your articulation?

556
00:36:19,448 --> 00:36:21,338
There's nothing wrong with my articulation.

557
00:36:21,338 --> 00:36:23,688
- Maybe it's how you end your words.
- How I end my words?

558
00:36:23,688 --> 00:36:25,868
Say "wakata kakage."

559
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,720
- "Wataka katage."
- "Wakata kakage."

560
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,824
- "Wataka takage."
- Not "wata".

561
00:36:30,824 --> 00:36:32,080
"Wataka takage."

562
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,370
Say it again.

563
00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:37,170
I said it right.

564
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:46,268
Jeez, again! My phone, my phone...

565
00:36:46,268 --> 00:36:48,638
- Where is it?
- Here.

566
00:36:48,638 --> 00:36:51,245
Ah, thanks a bunch!

567
00:36:51,245 --> 00:36:54,355
You'll be back early today, so I'll cook dinner and wait for you.

568
00:36:54,355 --> 00:36:55,201
What?

569
00:36:55,201 --> 00:36:57,801
Your seminar has ended, right?

570
00:36:57,801 --> 00:37:00,185
Oh, yeah.

571
00:37:00,185 --> 00:37:03,148
- See you later.
- Be careful.

572
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:07,258
She's left already?

573
00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:09,138
Uncle, you're going out?

574
00:37:09,138 --> 00:37:11,558
Yeah, I'm going out for a bit.

575
00:37:11,558 --> 00:37:13,938
- Be careful on your way.
- See you.

576
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:26,548
I'm sorry, but regarding the marriage meeting the other day, I wish to turn it down.

577
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:29,871
Understood. Let me find another suitable person-

578
00:37:29,871 --> 00:37:34,141
Sorry. I'm not meeting anyone for the time being.

579
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:39,048
I wish to cherish the time now

580
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:41,938
when I can still meet the person I want to meet.

581
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:44,465
The person you want to meet?

582
00:37:44,465 --> 00:37:49,215
There'll be times when I won't get my wish, but...

583
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:53,498
even then, I want to feel that I can meet her.

584
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,906
That feeling of yours,

585
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:08,104
I can totally understand.

586
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:11,013
Really?

587
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:17,728
Then, in that case...

588
00:38:17,728 --> 00:38:20,381
I'll erase this. Okay.

589
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:22,628
Thank you very much.

590
00:38:22,628 --> 00:38:24,771
Thank you.

591
00:38:24,771 --> 00:38:27,669
- See you next week.
- Thank you.

592
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:40,428
- Hey there.
- Hello.

593
00:38:40,428 --> 00:38:43,788
Live in the moment.

594
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:49,168
Do you feel alive right now?

595
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:29,198
<i>I thought it'd be nice to just hop on the first bus wherever.</i>

596
00:39:29,198 --> 00:39:33,073
<i>If the sand is above 29.5 degrees Celsius, the baby is a female.</i>

597

<i>Anything below becomes a male.</i>

598
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:57,678
Seita-san?

599
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,628
Huh? Why?!

600
00:40:00,628 --> 00:40:04,154
"Why"? What about you?

601
00:40:04,154 --> 00:40:06,607
Oh, I was thinking today's the day of the seminar, so...

602
00:40:06,607 --> 00:40:10,777
You thought today's the day of the seminar, so you came here?

603
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:15,328
Isn't it the same for you?

604
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,978
No, it's not.

605
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,164
- He turned it down?
- Yes.

606
00:40:43,164 --> 00:40:45,178
My dad...

607
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:50,428
still can't forget my mom, after all.

608
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:54,718
But Mr. Sawada looked happy.

609
00:40:54,718 --> 00:40:56,863
- Is that so?
- Yes.

610
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:01,729
When my mom died,

611
00:41:01,729 --> 00:41:06,639
my dad wouldn't eat anything.

612
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:12,768
But even so, he'd still water the houseplants that my mom left behind.

613
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,468
He seemed to take it real hard.

614
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:21,008
At that time, how did you handle it?

615
00:41:21,008 --> 00:41:22,648
Me?

616
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:25,828
What I did was...

617
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:49,808
<i>Dad, what do you want to eat for dinner?</i>

618
00:41:49,808 --> 00:41:53,178
<i>Fried pork with ginger? It's your favorite, right?</i>

619

<i>[Preparation for Cherry Blossom-Viewing!]</i>

620
00:42:01,582 --> 00:42:03,434
<i>Mom...</i>

621
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,157
<i>What do you think?</i>

622
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:39,326
<i>Yeah.</i>

623
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:43,314
<i>Looks good.</i>

624
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,998
<i>It's good.</i>

625
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:59,201
I was desperately...

626
00:42:59,201 --> 00:43:02,811
<i>trying to make my dad human again.</i>

627
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:06,868
And also,

628
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:10,418
I had to settle all the funeral procedures.

629
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:14,688
When a person dies,

630
00:43:15,870 --> 00:43:20,528
there are many things you have to settle until you're so fed up.

631
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:24,905
If I had broken down too,

632
00:43:24,905 --> 00:43:28,625
my home would have turned into a rubbish dump.

633
00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:35,778
But... you must be hurting too, weren't you?

634
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:39,620
I...

635
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:45,649
My dad was hurting...

636
00:43:45,649 --> 00:43:48,018
more than me...

637
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:56,038
Huh?

638
00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:03,058
Why am I crying?

639
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:06,748
It's a natural response.

640
00:44:06,748 --> 00:44:09,378
After all, your mom passed away.

641
00:44:37,330 --> 00:44:39,298
I miss her.

642
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:46,308
