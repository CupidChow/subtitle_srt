1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:02,890
So...

2
00:00:02,892 --> 00:00:04,877
what is it you wanted to ask me?

3
00:00:04,877 --> 00:00:08,637
What are your priorities in life?

4
00:00:08,637 --> 00:00:11,150
My life?

5
00:00:11,694 --> 00:00:13,627
What?

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,247
Sorry, sounds like I'm too intrusive?

7
00:00:17,247 --> 00:00:19,220
Is it like, a coverage report interview?

8
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:20,968
Coverage report interview?

9
00:00:20,968 --> 00:00:22,777
Well, an interview, I guess?

10
00:00:22,777 --> 00:00:27,461
I thought I'd know more about you so I can better support you in going independent.

11
00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:29,129
You'll give me your support?

12
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:32,450
- Thank you so much.
- No, it's the least I can do.

13
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:38,939
So, between work, money, love, and marriage...

14
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:41,509
how important are they, honestly?

15
00:00:41,509 --> 00:00:44,311
In order of priority?

16
00:00:45,383 --> 00:00:50,117
Well, considering which one I can relate to...

17
00:00:50,117 --> 00:00:55,422
but then, I don't really know what it is exactly that I relate to.

18
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:59,745
Maybe something that matters most to you?

19
00:00:59,745 --> 00:01:02,462
Right now, that will be my work.

20
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:05,054
Yup, going independent is the most important thing to me right now.

21
00:01:05,054 --> 00:01:07,007
You're currently dating someone, right?

22
00:01:07,007 --> 00:01:08,736
Yes.

23
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:11,104
But he's fine with me putting my work first.

24
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:15,512
A relationship won't last if both parties place their expectations on a date.

25
00:01:17,853 --> 00:01:20,156
Well understood.

26
00:01:20,156 --> 00:01:22,382
So, I've to help you succeed in going independent.

27
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:25,185
It's still sketchy, but I've come up with a startup plan.

28
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:26,341
Already?

29
00:01:26,341 --> 00:01:28,395
Thank you so much.

30
00:01:28,395 --> 00:01:34,494
Firstly, until you can open a studio, you'll need to achieve a fixed number of your own customers.

31
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:40,584
For that, I'd suggest that you teach yoga online, using this carbon neutral panel.

32
00:01:40,584 --> 00:01:42,272
It's a fixed cost, so there's some risk.

33
00:01:42,272 --> 00:01:45,130
Carbon neutral panel?

34
00:01:45,705 --> 00:01:48,076
Take a look at this.

35
00:01:48,076 --> 00:01:50,277
Thank you.

36
00:01:52,130 --> 00:02:00,020
credits

37
00:02:01,584 --> 00:02:04,925
To have a date with no expectations...

38
00:02:06,842 --> 00:02:10,030
is it even possible?

39
00:02:13,494 --> 00:02:15,401
Huh? Do I have a cold?

40
00:02:16,091 --> 00:02:17,412
I guess not.

41
00:02:17,412 --> 00:02:19,762
Higashimura-san, can I have a word?

42
00:02:19,762 --> 00:02:24,015
- Sure.
- It's about Hinata Akari-san.

43
00:02:24,015 --> 00:02:28,703
She wishes to have a marriage meeting with your client.

44
00:02:28,703 --> 00:02:30,384
Here.

45
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:33,495
Huh?

46
00:02:33,495 --> 00:02:36,905
Sensei, you gave a great speech in today's lecture.

47
00:02:36,905 --> 00:02:39,794
Is that so? The content is the same as usual, though.

48
00:02:39,794 --> 00:02:43,558
Yes. I didn't really quite get it before,

49
00:02:43,558 --> 00:02:47,278
but it finally got through to me today. I wonder why?

50
00:02:47,278 --> 00:02:49,144
Well...

51
00:02:49,144 --> 00:02:52,710
I give my speeches with the belief that no matter how boring my lecture is,

52
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:55,954
there may be just one person in the theater who'll find it interesting.

53
00:02:55,954 --> 00:03:00,247
I see. It's like talking to an invisible girlfriend in the theater, right?

54
00:03:00,247 --> 00:03:01,730
Looks like your marriage hunting is going smoothly.

55
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:03,793
No, not necessarily so.

56
00:03:03,793 --> 00:03:06,954
What about you,  Kodama-san? How was it with that Sam guy?

57
00:03:06,954 --> 00:03:09,370
Sam faded out of the picture, in the end.

58
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:15,229
That guy is all about the environment and human rights, it's tiring to be with him.

59
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:17,431
That's what I mean. Sustainability fatigue.

60
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:20,167
Sustainable fatigー
<i>[You may have sustainable fatigue!]</i>

61
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:22,158
Sustainable fatigue!

62
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:26,759
It's fatigue arising from trying to achieve sustainability.

63
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:28,742
What?

64
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:32,541
A contradiction between sustainability and being tired?

65
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:35,086
This is interesting!

66
00:03:43,702 --> 00:03:47,279
Hello? Hi, Higashimura-san.

67
00:03:47,279 --> 00:03:48,860
Yes.

68
00:03:51,607 --> 00:03:53,307
What?!

69
00:03:53,307 --> 00:03:57,437
"Good evening Hinata-sama."

70
00:03:57,437 --> 00:04:02,552
"Regarding the marriage meeting,

71
00:04:02,552 --> 00:04:06,578
I was extremely surprised."

72
00:04:06,578 --> 00:04:12,036
"Is this for the purpose of practicing..."

73
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:18,080
"Palpitation".

74
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,671
"Pounding of the heart after running

75
00:04:20,671 --> 00:04:23,797
or when one is nervous".

<i>Are you free to talk right now?</i>

80
00:04:41,802 --> 00:04:45,809
If this is regarding the marriage meeting, let us talk about it when we meet.

81
00:04:45,809 --> 00:04:48,767
<i>Or during our walking session.</i>

82
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,777
Oh, h-huh?

83
00:04:49,777 --> 00:04:52,106
I humbly request for that. Thank you for understanding.

84
00:04:52,106 --> 00:04:54,843
- <i>Goodbye.</i>
- Waitー

85
00:05:04,008 --> 00:05:06,072
Dad?

86
00:05:08,025 --> 00:05:11,179
Huh? Dad?

87
00:05:11,179 --> 00:05:12,916
What?

88
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:14,515
Jeez...

89
00:05:14,515 --> 00:05:16,650
Turn the lights on, at least.

90
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,719
For a moment, I thought you'd fainted.

91
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:21,171
You're right.

92
00:05:21,171 --> 00:05:24,805
I'm at this age where people worry if I don't turn the lights on.

93
00:05:24,805 --> 00:05:27,240
It's not possible, indeed.

94
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:31,384
Augh... Kyoka.

95
00:05:31,384 --> 00:05:34,202
I'm asking this for my own reference.

96
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:43,210
When a younger woman and I have a marriage meeting and she marries me, what charmー

97
00:05:44,138 --> 00:05:47,081
What qualities do I have that made it possible?

98
00:05:49,192 --> 00:05:51,516
- None.
- I'm sure there's something.

99
00:05:51,516 --> 00:05:53,652
You need aged care in future,

100
00:05:53,652 --> 00:05:57,825
and before that, you have zero ability in housework.

101
00:05:57,825 --> 00:05:59,493
You have a job,

102
00:05:59,493 --> 00:06:02,405
but your salary and inheritance are so-so.

103
00:06:02,405 --> 00:06:05,265
Besides, you have a daughter in tow, who's single.

104
00:06:05,265 --> 00:06:07,605
No qualities at all, huh?

105
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:13,683
Let me ask, then. What if I say...

106
00:06:13,683 --> 00:06:17,487
I want to marry someone who has a kid. What would you think?

107
00:06:18,846 --> 00:06:20,857
- My, my, my...
- A kid?

108
00:06:20,857 --> 00:06:24,114
- What?!
- A... A...
- You all right?

109
00:06:24,114 --> 00:06:24,999
A kid?

110
00:06:24,999 --> 00:06:29,156
Like I said, "what if"! Just "what if."

111
00:06:29,156 --> 00:06:32,632
Gosh... that...

112
00:06:32,632 --> 00:06:35,360
I will be worried.

113
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,899
That's because... you'll be a mom.

114
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:43,404
But I definitely don't object

115
00:06:43,404 --> 00:06:46,476
to having more family members.

116
00:06:48,098 --> 00:06:53,072
Meeting with people, be it children or seniors,

117
00:06:53,072 --> 00:06:57,700
opens you to a new and bigger world. So I'll give you my blessing.

118
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:00,576
Dad...

119
00:07:02,298 --> 00:07:05,704
The parents of that young lady whom you're meeting?

120
00:07:05,704 --> 00:07:08,352
It'll be great if they give you their blessings too.

121
00:07:08,352 --> 00:07:10,852
What nonsense are you talking about?

122
00:07:15,448 --> 00:07:18,838

135
00:08:12,303 --> 00:08:14,494
Aw, bummer...

136
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:18,977
Then can I go to your house and play next time?

Really?

139
00:08:25,978 --> 00:08:32,373
But I had been telling Kyoka-chan nice things about you so that she's impressed.

140
00:08:32,373 --> 00:08:33,630
You met Kyoka-chan?

141
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:38,941
Yup! She came to my house and made curry. It was delicious.

142
00:08:38,941 --> 00:08:40,752
Is that so?

143
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,123
So that's what it was.

144
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:51,065
Thanks, Nijiro. I'll work hard at it.

145
00:08:51,805 --> 00:08:56,355
I'm sure I still stand a chance.

146
00:08:57,736 --> 00:08:59,921
So you're leaving the studio this month?

147
00:08:59,921 --> 00:09:03,629
Yup. I'm clearing my leave.

148
00:09:03,629 --> 00:09:06,951
I'll first rent a room for my lessons and secure customers.

149

Lately, he's been acting suspiciously.

00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:35,692
I'm really curious to find out, but you can't tell me, right?

157
00:09:35,692 --> 00:09:39,135
I really want to tell you, but I can't.

158
00:09:39,135 --> 00:09:41,915
Excuse me, here's your green curry.

162
00:09:50,657 --> 00:09:54,738
Well, I'm starting to like curry lately.

I'll do my best to take care of him.

168
00:10:13,991 --> 00:10:18,275
So, I guess the both of us are going to be quite busy.

169
00:10:18,275 --> 00:10:20,927
Just put your work first, Kyoka-san.

170
00:10:20,927 --> 00:10:23,790
You, too, should put Nijiro-kun first.

171
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,400
We are second in place.

172
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,584
Okay.

173
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:30,379
No need to bother about me.

174
00:10:32,718 --> 00:10:35,605
It's hard to <i>not</i> bother.

175
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:41,478
What's that look for?

176
00:10:43,283 --> 00:10:46,295
- Let's dig in.
- Let's dig in!

177
00:11:09,737 --> 00:11:12,839
You could have just let Nijiro stay over at my place tonight.

178
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,285
But you have an online meeting with New York in the wee hours.

00:11:15,285 --> 00:11:17,267
It'll be hard to wake up in the morning.

180
00:11:17,267 --> 00:11:20,012
Hey, hey, help me pull out the blanket.

181
00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:24,380
- Okay.
- All right, thanks.

182
00:11:27,154 --> 00:11:29,727
Don't be so considerate to your ex-wife.

183
00:11:29,727 --> 00:11:31,991
And don't be too considerate to your girlfriend too.

184
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:33,527
Huh?

185
00:11:38,966 --> 00:11:43,603
Look, I don't really mind if you remarry.

186
00:11:44,577 --> 00:11:47,246
As long as you're properly prepared for it.

187
00:11:47,774 --> 00:11:50,309
I don't plan to remarry.

188
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:56,038
Then don't do anything that will confuse Nijiro.

189
00:11:56,038 --> 00:11:58,256
Confuse him?

190
00:11:59,619 --> 00:12:03,145
The other day, I saw you with your girlfriend

191
00:12:03,145 --> 00:12:05,277
in front of our house.

192
00:12:05,277 --> 00:12:08,594
<i>My phone! Sorry about that.</i>

193
00:12:12,063 --> 00:12:14,753
You shouldn't let a child meet someone who has no plans to get married.

194
00:12:14,753 --> 00:12:18,419
- No, it's not what you thinkー
- You'll wake him up.

195
00:12:32,477 --> 00:12:34,518
You see,

196
00:12:35,206 --> 00:12:37,690
actually,

197
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:43,496
I've been asked to handle an international expo project in Osaka.

198
00:12:44,736 --> 00:12:46,740
Three years.

199
00:12:48,565 --> 00:12:51,638
I haven't given my reply, of course.

200
00:12:51,638 --> 00:12:53,349
Are you going?

201
00:12:53,349 --> 00:12:55,500
Can I go?

202
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,084
And leave him to you?

203
00:13:06,264 --> 00:13:09,267
I mean, will it be okay for me to go?

204
00:13:12,928 --> 00:13:14,573
If I go to Osaka,

205
00:13:14,573 --> 00:13:18,376
there's no such thing as leaving Nijiro to me two days a week.

206
00:13:22,518 --> 00:13:26,406
Well, you should also discuss with your girlfriend,

207
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:28,543
and think it through.

208
00:13:29,067 --> 00:13:31,650
Let me know your decision.

209
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:33,229
Got it.

210
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:37,748
See you.

211
00:14:03,543 --> 00:14:05,217
Yes?

212
00:14:05,826 --> 00:14:06,993
Hayate!

213
00:14:06,993 --> 00:14:08,860
I'm back!

214
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,360
Ha!

215
00:14:10,984 --> 00:14:13,189
It's been a while since I got punched.

216
00:14:13,189 --> 00:14:15,253
What are you happy about?

217
00:14:15,253 --> 00:14:17,850
I was wondering whether it's worth moving out.

218
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:19,865
Where did you go, exactly?

219
00:14:19,865 --> 00:14:22,328
You suddenly up and went, without telling me and Dad.

220
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:26,424
Sorry. The pipes in my apartment have already been repaired.

221
00:14:26,424 --> 00:14:29,275
So I brought my luggage on the way to France.

222
00:14:29,275 --> 00:14:32,555
I see. Glad to see you're doing great.

223
00:14:39,323 --> 00:14:41,472
- You're a manager at a hotel?
- Yes.

224
00:14:41,472 --> 00:14:43,080
How did you end up with that job?

225
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:47,022
The parents of a university friend of mine run a hotel chain in France,

226
00:14:47,022 --> 00:14:48,221
and I was invited over.

227
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:51,325
- Ah, your friend from UCLA?
- That's right.

228
00:14:51,325 --> 00:14:54,068
They have a subsidiary hotel in Malaysia,

229
00:14:54,068 --> 00:14:57,030
and need someone to be stationed there to manage its reopening

230
00:14:57,030 --> 00:15:00,678
as a working vacation hotel. And they said I was the perfect person for the job.

231
00:15:00,678 --> 00:15:03,269
I see. That's amazing.

232
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:05,959
I had been staying in Malaysia.

233
00:15:05,959 --> 00:15:09,572
But we're reopening next year, so I came back to Japan to recruit staff.

234
00:15:09,572 --> 00:15:10,781
Which explains my attire.

235
00:15:10,781 --> 00:15:13,230
Hayate, you look really capable.

236
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:15,560
You've fallen for me even more now, right?

237
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,019
You idiot.

238
00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:18,766
Thanks.

239
00:15:25,459 --> 00:15:28,695
To be honest, one day,

240
00:15:28,695 --> 00:15:33,300
I hope to build a school in Malaysia, for homeless kids from less-privileged families.

241
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:36,457
I'm using this hotel job as a stepping stone for that.

242
00:15:36,457 --> 00:15:39,562
I didn't know that you had such big plans.

243
00:15:39,562 --> 00:15:42,308
You were the one who triggered that idea in me.

244
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:46,399
When we were kids, I spent happy times at your place.

245
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:49,154
That was how I could stay as a kid.

246
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:54,257
It's all thanks to Aunt.

247
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,024
Want to join me?

248
00:16:02,024 --> 00:16:03,922
Sure, I'll go.

249
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:07,818
That's not what I mean. It's a hotel meant for long-term stayovers,

250
00:16:07,818 --> 00:16:11,730
so it's fully furnished with childcare and proper wellness facilities.

251
00:16:12,247 --> 00:16:14,423
There are yoga classes too.

252
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:20,013
It's definitely my dream to teach yoga in a southern country,

253
00:16:20,013 --> 00:16:24,011
but right now, I have to first establish my base in Tokyo.

254
00:16:24,011 --> 00:16:26,055
I guess so.

255
00:16:26,689 --> 00:16:30,940
But if you have any problems, feel free to call me anytime.

256
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:34,392
I'll always put you as my first priority.

257
00:16:34,392 --> 00:16:36,450
Hayate.

258
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:39,718
Whether it's your phone or anything else, I'll fly over to look for it.

259
00:16:39,718 --> 00:16:43,470
Seems like you'll have a hard time without me around.

260
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,396
Oh, I've brought souvenirs.

261
00:16:50,187 --> 00:16:54,213
- For you.
- Wow, thanks.

262
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:59,218
Rock salt! And...

263
00:17:01,331 --> 00:17:03,557
Wow... chocolates.

264
00:17:03,557 --> 00:17:05,350
Give me your hand.

265
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:09,329
Kyoka-chan...

266
00:17:15,053 --> 00:17:18,454
Huh? Wait a minute, Hayate. I...

267
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,746
What?

268
00:17:40,352 --> 00:17:43,032
It'll be easier for you to find your phone.

269
00:17:43,694 --> 00:17:45,598
Thank you.

270
00:17:46,705 --> 00:17:50,003
- It suits you.
- Bling, bling, bling.

271
00:17:50,003 --> 00:17:52,641
I'm sorry.
<i>[LED Tokyo]</i>

I'm Sawada Kyoka. Nice to meet you.

A cat...

00:18:04,968 --> 00:18:06,568
Excuse me?

277
00:18:06,568 --> 00:18:07,885
It's nothing.

This panel analyses the person on screen and generates numerical data.

279
00:18:11,328 --> 00:18:13,526
Our manufacturing process uses new technology

280
00:18:13,526 --> 00:18:16,307
that's carbon-free and environmentally-friendly.

281
00:18:16,307 --> 00:18:18,131
I see.

282
00:18:18,131 --> 00:18:22,168
From today onwards, we will be conducting lessons in here.

283
00:18:22,168 --> 00:18:25,538
I am Sawada Kyoka.
<i>[Is your work going smoothly?]</i>

284
00:18:25,538 --> 00:18:27,440
Since we're doing office yoga,
<i>[Sorry, my day has been chaotic, but I'll survive somehow...]</i>

285
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,876
we'll focus on doing poses
<i>[Sorry, my day has been chaotic, but I'll survive somehow...]</i>

286
00:18:28,876 --> 00:18:33,049
that can help reduce shoulder stiffness and back pain
<i>[Sorry, my day has been chaotic, but I'll survive somehow...]</i>

287
00:18:33,049 --> 00:18:35,893
resulting from high stress.
<i>[Sorry, my day has been chaotic, but I'll survive somehow...]</i>

288
00:18:41,256 --> 00:18:48,072
<i>[The person I met today has "dog" in his name, but he wears a shirt with a cat print]</i>

289
00:19:25,478 --> 00:19:30,838
<i>[Can we discuss about...]</i>

290
00:19:52,476 --> 00:19:54,076
Okay!

00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,130

293
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:19,100
All right.

00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:39,693
<i>I'll get going first. Call me when you reach.</i>

295
00:20:39,693 --> 00:20:42,932

- <i>We've also graduated from child-rearing duties today.</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

<i>Let's do it after she gets married.</i>

301
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,833
<i>Okay, then.</i>

302
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:23,589
If...

303
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:27,421
I get married before her,

304
00:21:27,421 --> 00:21:29,390
what should I do?

305
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:34,259
I'm saying "what if".

306
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:38,221
Just, "what if".

307
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:41,359
I'm home.

308
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:47,386
Jeez, you didn't turn the lights on again.

309
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,277
You're acting strange.

310
00:21:50,277 --> 00:21:52,550
No, I'm not.

311
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:55,372
I was just deep in thought.

312
00:21:55,372 --> 00:21:57,431
Deep in thought.

313
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,002
We're coming in.

314
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:20,916
- Hello.
- Hello.

315
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:25,044
Both of you already know each other?

316
00:22:25,044 --> 00:22:27,792
Speaking of knowing each other,

317
00:22:27,792 --> 00:22:31,483
we met because she had been treating me for my back pain.

318
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:35,649
So sitting here right now makes me all the more awkward.

319
00:22:35,649 --> 00:22:36,976
I'm sorry about that.

320
00:22:36,976 --> 00:22:40,326
Don't be. It's important for us to practice.

321
00:22:40,326 --> 00:22:42,779
- Practice?
- Yes.

322
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:46,422
Well... Ms. Hinata,

323
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:49,217
what are you hobbies?

324
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,810
You're wrong.

325
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:54,775
- Pardon?
- This is not practice.

326
00:22:54,775 --> 00:22:56,475
But...

327
00:22:58,445 --> 00:23:03,043
Will you... go out with me?

328
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:05,798
What?

329
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,911
Oh, I get it.

330
00:23:12,911 --> 00:23:14,590
I see.

331
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:17,869
I thought you were interested in my body.

332
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:24,211
N-No... I mean, my bones. She said my skeleton is rareー

333
00:23:24,211 --> 00:23:25,671
Skeleton?

334
00:23:25,671 --> 00:23:31,751
That's right. There's a miraculous kind of beauty in Sawada-san's shoulder blades.

335
00:23:31,751 --> 00:23:33,096
Thank you.

336
00:23:33,096 --> 00:23:36,187
But that's not all.

337
00:23:36,187 --> 00:23:41,374
I've also questioned myself many times and affirmed it.

338
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:48,646
Sure, there are younger people out there who share the same values as me,

339
00:23:48,646 --> 00:23:52,271
so why must it be Sawada-san, who's a much older senior

340
00:23:52,271 --> 00:23:55,809
with back pain issues and needs aged care in future?

341
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:57,427
So...

342
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:01,769
I spoke too much! I'm so sorry!

343
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,534
Well, if you'll excuse us, we will take our leave from here.

344
00:24:08,534 --> 00:24:10,536
That's right.

345
00:24:10,536 --> 00:24:12,579
I'm so sorry...

346
00:24:12,579 --> 00:24:16,246
- We'll leave you to have a good chat. Please excuse us.
- Please excuse us.

347
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:25,932
I couldn't find the right words to express how I felt,

348
00:24:25,932 --> 00:24:28,461
so I tried looking up the dictionary.

349
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,878
In the section under "love",

350
00:24:31,878 --> 00:24:34,309
it states "liking someone and wanting to meet him or her".

351
00:24:34,309 --> 00:24:36,546
"An unfulfilled desire

352
00:24:36,546 --> 00:24:39,851
of wanting to stay with someone forever".

353
00:24:39,851 --> 00:24:42,582
I was the one who wrote that.

354
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:46,736
I certainly have this unfulfilled desire

355
00:24:46,736 --> 00:24:50,502
of wanting to see you more, to chat with you more.

356
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:53,177
That...

357
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:56,849
is probably love.

358
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:01,015
But at the same time,

359
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:07,208
when I am with you, that desire of mine is fulfilled.

360
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,771
So that's the part where I don't really understand.

361
00:25:11,771 --> 00:25:14,255
I will bring this up for discussion in the next review.

362
00:25:14,255 --> 00:25:17,341
No, that's not what I mean.

363
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,205
Gosh, how should I put it?

364
00:25:21,205 --> 00:25:23,046
Let's see...

365
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:25,792
You see, Iー

366
00:25:25,792 --> 00:25:27,528
I totally get it.

367
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,354
I get it.

368
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:35,949
I was just... a little shaken.

369
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,258
I'm sorry.

370
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:51,392
Please put this on hold for now.

371
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:05,972
This will be my last lesson today.

372
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:14,025
I'll feel very sad to leave this studio.

373
00:26:14,025 --> 00:26:20,058
However, our bodies, and our hearts,

374
00:26:20,058 --> 00:26:22,572
will change with time.

375
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:26,776
I hope that I can welcome a new world,

376
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:33,282
and discover a new me.

377
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:37,627
Work hard, Kyoka Sensei.

378
00:26:37,627 --> 00:26:41,033
All right, let's start with the breathing exercises as usual.

379
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:47,000
- You've worked hard!
- Thank you.

380
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,998
Another great lesson in your own way.

381
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,309
Thank you.

382
00:26:53,309 --> 00:26:55,228
Mikako Sensei?

383
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:03,868
If you keep finding something in your own way, you'll be unhappy.

384
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:07,552
Good luck!

385
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:15,457
Thank you.

386
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:20,401
You're really something, Kyoka-san. You got away with everything.

387
00:27:20,401 --> 00:27:22,850
- I want to learn from you!
- What?

388
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:27,120
Be it going independent, or romancing a single father... everything!

389
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,148
But between work and family,

390
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:33,752
we've agreed to prioritize the one that's important to us.

391
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:36,543
That's why we can hardly see each other,

392
00:27:36,543 --> 00:27:38,834
and we're cautious about disturbing each other on the phone.

393
00:27:38,834 --> 00:27:40,807
I guess so.

394
00:27:40,807 --> 00:27:43,912
Riho-san, how can you listen to all this so calmly?

395
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:47,007
You ordered tea today? Come on, drink with us.

396
00:27:47,007 --> 00:27:49,839
Nah, I had a drop too much yesterday.

397
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:53,902
Living in your own way means you don't have the freedom to get married.

398
00:27:53,902 --> 00:27:55,496
In my own way?

399
00:27:55,496 --> 00:27:59,966
You're trying to balance both sides, that's why you set this rule, right?

400
00:27:59,966 --> 00:28:02,836
- Yeah.
- I can't do that.

401
00:28:02,836 --> 00:28:06,140
I've thrown away all of Kazuma's outdoor equipment.

402
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:09,056
- What? His tent, and everything?
- Everything.

403
00:28:09,056 --> 00:28:12,446
He may be staying at home with me now,

404
00:28:12,446 --> 00:28:14,361
but Kazuma doesn't seem happy.

405
00:28:14,361 --> 00:28:17,291
I think my plan has failed...

406
00:28:17,291 --> 00:28:19,540
That's why you're so unsettled today.

407
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:22,669
Kyoka, if your boyfriend is like Suzu's,

408
00:28:22,669 --> 00:28:26,070
and tells you not to go independent, will you break up?

409
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:29,185
Well, I don't think...

410
00:28:30,627 --> 00:28:32,920
<i>[Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Kawagoe Prefecture]</i>

411
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,722
Regarding group dating for seniors, the locals are active people.

412
00:28:35,722 --> 00:28:37,571
They can even do it while walking around town.

413
00:28:37,571 --> 00:28:39,294
It will also be good publicity for the area.

414
00:28:39,294 --> 00:28:41,655
- I see.
- Yup.

415
00:28:41,655 --> 00:28:43,658
Well, then...

416
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:48,362
Huh?

417
00:28:48,362 --> 00:28:51,100
Please excuse me for a moment.

418
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,023
Hello? This is Higashimura.

419
00:28:55,023 --> 00:28:57,564
Nijiro-kun is having a fever.

420
00:28:57,564 --> 00:29:01,306
It was over 37 degrees Celsius, and we've been monitoring him,

421
00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:03,742
but his temperature is now 38 degrees Celsius.

422
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:07,320
<i>Children may seem fine even if they have a fever, but...</i>

423
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:10,732
I understand. I'll pick him up as soon as possible.

424
00:29:10,732 --> 00:29:13,690
I'm not near the area right now, so it won't be that soon.

425
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:17,593
I'll let you know again the time I can reach there.

426
00:29:17,593 --> 00:29:19,550
Bye.

the cost of the monitor for this panel for six months.

434
00:29:56,423 --> 00:30:00,193
I'm sorry, but I'm not in a position give you an answer for that.

435
00:30:00,193 --> 00:30:03,386
Inukai is currently in a meeting. Let me go check with him.

436
00:30:03,386 --> 00:30:05,818
Sure, thank you.

437
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:13,926
Hello?

438
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,526
Yes.

439
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:20,348
What?

440
00:30:20,348 --> 00:30:22,957
I want to pick him up as soon as possible,

441
00:30:22,957 --> 00:30:25,902
but I'm in Kawagoe right now, and it'll take some time.

442
00:30:25,902 --> 00:30:28,722
I know that this breaches the rule between us, but...

443
00:30:28,722 --> 00:30:34,600
What are you talking about? I'll go pick Nijiro-kun up right now.

444
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:38,519
Sorry, and thanks so much.

445
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:39,682
Okay.

446
00:30:39,682 --> 00:30:43,315
Got it. Bye.

447
00:30:43,315 --> 00:30:45,441
Sorry to keep you waiting.

448
00:30:45,441 --> 00:30:46,941
Please sit.

449
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:52,639
I've heard about your request regarding the monitor.

450
00:30:52,639 --> 00:30:56,683
We'll need to look at the detailed figures for a bit. Are you okay to discuss it now?

451
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:59,991
It's not really a good time right now.

452
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:03,592
I'm sorry, but I have an urgent matter to attend to.

453
00:31:03,592 --> 00:31:05,678
I am very sorry.

454
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:12,786
Sawada-san, this is just my opinion,

455
00:31:12,786 --> 00:31:17,138
but to succeed, you must not get your priorities wrong.

456
00:31:17,138 --> 00:31:20,864
I don't know what matter you have to attend to, but to you,

457
00:31:20,864 --> 00:31:24,856
isn't it your priority right now to discuss your request with me?

458
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:37,091
Sorry, could you excuse me for a moment?

459
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:43,707
We've settled on the stocks. Can you affirm your commitment to lease them for one year?

460
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:47,452
Sawada-san?

461
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:52,212
Erm... I'm very sorry.

462
00:31:52,212 --> 00:31:56,306
Could I excuse myself for today, after all?

463
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,411
I am very sorry.

464
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,552
How's Nijiro-kun?

465
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,725
Kyoka-chan.

466
00:32:13,725 --> 00:32:15,379
Thanks.

467
00:32:15,379 --> 00:32:18,740
Fuwa Sensei also brought him to the hospital.

468
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:22,196
<i>Thank you.</i>

469
00:32:22,196 --> 00:32:24,534
<i>Shall we?</i>

470
00:32:24,534 --> 00:32:27,156
I'm glad it's just a common flu.

471
00:32:27,156 --> 00:32:29,082
I'm free anyway.

472
00:32:29,082 --> 00:32:31,153
Hayate...

473
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:37,187
Thank you so much for your help.

474
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,903
On the way home, Nijiro-kun said he's fine.

475
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:46,150
He told me he doesn't want to bother his dad and mom.

476
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:50,488
I'm not trying to lecture you.

477
00:32:50,488 --> 00:32:54,201
I just wanted to tell you that Nijiro is a kind boy

478
00:32:54,201 --> 00:32:57,501
who knows that his parents are working hard for him.

479
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:02,994
If something like this happens again, don't hesitate to call me.

480
00:33:02,994 --> 00:33:05,702
My working hours are flexible.

481
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:09,282
I'll get going then. See you.

482
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:21,383
Sorry. I did promise that I'll go pick him up.

483
00:33:21,383 --> 00:33:24,644
Don't be. Thanks for helping to call Fuwa Sensei.

484
00:33:24,644 --> 00:33:27,490
He was able to pick him up earlier than we do.

485
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,336
Is there anything you need?

486
00:33:31,336 --> 00:33:35,721
I'll buy some drinks and Nijiro's favorite food.

487
00:33:35,721 --> 00:33:37,911
In that case, can I trouble you?

488
00:33:37,911 --> 00:33:40,347
"Strawberry yogurt".

489
00:33:41,074 --> 00:33:43,430
Maybe egg tofu, too.

490
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:46,510
"Egg tofu"...

491
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:53,921
- How's Niji?
- It's just the flu. He's sleeping now.

492
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:06,603
Kyoka-san, come in...

493
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,718
Takamizawa-san?

494
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,820
Huh?

495
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:24,550
<i>[Cooling Patches]</i>

496
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:34,003
He's sound asleep.

497
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:38,782
His fever should subside after sleeping through the night.

498
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:51,212
I'm sorry.

499
00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:57,009
I knew about the both of you, but I kept quiet about it.

500
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:08,880
But you see, I did get a bit of fun out of that.

501
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:21,496
I also like you, Kyoka-san.

502
00:35:21,496 --> 00:35:24,558
I feel that you will succeed, given your passion in your work,

503
00:35:24,558 --> 00:35:26,677
and I want to cheer you on.

504
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:31,727
But...

505
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,735
if you don't plan to become a mother,

506
00:35:34,735 --> 00:35:38,004
I hope you won't get involved only half-heartedly with Nijiro.

507
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,041
You're mistaken.

508
00:35:41,041 --> 00:35:43,458
- Kyoka-san is-
- Let me finish.

509
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:47,107
You are free to date and have fun.

510
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:52,872
But if you remarry,

511
00:35:52,872 --> 00:35:55,651
I'm just being selfish here...

512
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:01,616
I want it to be someone who can be a good mother to Nijiro.

513
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,372
Someone better than me.

514
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:13,887
In this day and age, in this country,

515
00:36:13,887 --> 00:36:18,068
it's hard for women to manage on all fronts.

516
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:21,086
To shoulder everything alone

517
00:36:21,086 --> 00:36:23,518
is a huge undertaking.

518
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:26,928
I...

519
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:35,799
couldn't do that.

520
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:44,441
Please think about it carefully.

521
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:48,425
I hope you can do that.

522
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:53,425
Got it.

523
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:00,990
Thanks for your help.

524
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:23,562
I'm sorry.

525
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:29,299
But... I have to speak my mind.

526
00:37:34,410 --> 00:37:36,828
Take up that job offer in Osaka.

527
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:38,841
What?

528
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:41,337
It's okay.

529
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:45,903
Except, I have a request.

530
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:53,690
You were home?

531
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:55,996
But you didn't turn the lights on.

532
00:37:57,080 --> 00:38:00,544
Yeah, there's a lot on my mind.

533
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:15,073
I...

534
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:23,333
really... want to find it.

535
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:28,578
The new me.

536
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,898
But what in the world is that?

537
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:47,264
When I kept thinking about the person I love,

538
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,369
night came before I knew it.

539
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:59,150
I'm no different from you, Dad.

540
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:04,108
Well, I'm not really...

541
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,127
I forgot to tell you this.

542
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:21,478
If you... have found...

543
00:39:21,478 --> 00:39:23,784
your new world,

544
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:28,255
I'll give you my blessing.

545

It's Seita-san.

00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:00,788
Higashimura Seita-san.

548
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:12,481

- Did you take the smaller one?
- I don't think so.

Hot.

590

That person's name is called Inukai,

591
00:43:38,719 --> 00:43:43,058
but he always wears a T-shirt with cat prints, so I was rather amused.

592
00:43:43,058 --> 00:43:46,212
I've been wanting to tell you about that,

593
00:43:46,212 --> 00:43:47,884
but I didn't want to text you only for that.

594
00:43:47,884 --> 00:43:49,976
I really don't mind if you do.

595
00:43:49,976 --> 00:43:54,341
Such things only have meaning if we meet and talk about it. Don't you think so?

596
00:43:54,341 --> 00:43:55,653
Meet?

597
00:43:55,653 --> 00:43:58,441
That's right. We meet.
