00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,637
Let's end it.

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,664
What?

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,974
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:17,715
After that, I gave it much consideration.

5
00:00:17,715 --> 00:00:23,223
I hope that I can become a good wife to you someday.

6
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:26,230
I want to work hard to become Nijiro-kun's mother.

7
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:28,596
You don't have to do it.

8
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:35,431
Because you will not be the Kyoka-san that I know.

9
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:36,819
However...

10
00:00:36,819 --> 00:00:38,784
It's not possible.

11
00:00:38,784 --> 00:00:43,021
I can't continue this relationship anymore.

12
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:48,615
Previously, I wanted a wife who would change my clothes.

13
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:50,817
Didn't I say that?

14
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:57,416
Originally, I didn't want a normal marriage,

15
00:00:57,416 --> 00:00:59,754
it is just impossible

16
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:03,504
for me to continue.

17
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,667
It's my fault.

18
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:11,197
I already knew that things would not go well, but...

19
00:01:11,197 --> 00:01:13,148
Seita-san.

20
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:16,476
It was an enjoyable time.

21
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,714
Thank you.

22
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:25,884
And I'm really sorry.

24
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:52,312
What's wrong?

25
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:54,963
I reject to our dating.

26
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,477
I'm sorry.

27
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,323
Excuse me,

28
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,190
but can I know the reason?

29
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:17,103
You can be happy under normal circumstances.

30
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:20,178
I'm not good enough for you.

31
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,500
Thank you for everything.

32
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:43,217
Welcome home.

33
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:47,067
You're late today,

34
00:02:47,067 --> 00:02:49,102
though it's fine with me.

35
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:51,519
Did you go out with Higashimura-san?

36
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:54,870
I see.

37
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,312
He's a good person.

38
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,511
I think so, too.

39
00:03:02,511 --> 00:03:04,144
That's good.

40
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:06,842
Goodnight.

<i>[Is Love Sustainable?]</i>
<i>[Episode 9]</i>

42
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,813
Did Sawada-san reject you?

43
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:38,457
Yes. I think I do not appeal to him at all.

44
00:03:38,457 --> 00:03:41,303
I give up on getting married.

45
00:03:41,303 --> 00:03:43,623
You don't have to give up.

46
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:49,195
Anyway, I think I will stop marriage hunting for the moment.

47
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:53,530
A rejection might not mean

48
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:57,637
that he is not satisfied with you.

49
00:03:57,637 --> 00:04:01,946
Sometimes it might be due to consideration that not getting married is better for the other party.

50
00:04:01,946 --> 00:04:03,376
I understand that.

51
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:07,011
Sawada-san is probably worried about his age,

52
00:04:07,011 --> 00:04:09,741
my first marriage and his remarrying,

53
00:04:09,741 --> 00:04:14,410
and he has many other considerations for my sake.

54
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:19,797
But I hope that he could be strong enough

55
00:04:19,797 --> 00:04:23,129
to overcome his own kindness and rationale.

56
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:26,945
Because I'm really thinking about marriage.

57
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:33,042
What does happiness mean, in normal circumstance?

58
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:35,342
In normal circumstance?

59
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,879
Please excuse me my question.

60
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:48,430
Hello. Sorry to disturb.

61
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,810
Thank you for doing the check for me.

00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:54,125
About the tumor biopsy result,

63
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:56,896
it takes about a week.

64
00:04:56,896 --> 00:05:00,898
Then can you schedule the next consultation when the results are out?

65
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:03,931
Thank you.

66
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,698
Okay, see you.

67
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,537
Place your fingers together behind your back.

68
00:05:19,537 --> 00:05:23,477
If you can do it easily, you can flip your palm over.

69
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:30,229
Open your chest up for that slouch during desk work.

70
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:47,952
The turtle parent and child.

71
00:05:47,952 --> 00:05:50,771
That cloud looks like a turtle.

72
00:05:50,771 --> 00:05:52,285
Doesn't it?

This is good. Try it.

75
00:06:06,212 --> 00:06:07,512
Really?

76
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:12,571
- This is really good.
- Right?

77
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:19,780
I really appreciate what you did.

78
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:20,891
No worries.

79
00:06:20,891 --> 00:06:23,101
Nijiro has already cheered up.

80
00:06:23,101 --> 00:06:26,237
He was really noisy in school today.

81
00:06:26,237 --> 00:06:28,049
I see.

82
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:35,872
How is it with Higashimura-san and you?

83
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,811
What?

84
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:42,685
I was dumped.

85
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,743
But I'm totally fine.

86
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:56,917
For now, I still need to buck up in my work.

87
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:59,020
Love does not matter anymore.

88
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:02,956
This time, I was shaken up

89
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:05,281
and it affected my work.

90
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:09,730
I need to live again with my job.

91
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,565
Kyoka-chan.

92
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:15,267
Office yoga is going well.

93
00:07:15,267 --> 00:07:17,904
My students recommended me to other companies,

94
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:19,909
and I've been asked to open my own studio.

95
00:07:19,909 --> 00:07:21,315
Kyoka-chan.

96
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:23,577
My followers on Instagram also increased.

97
00:07:23,577 --> 00:07:27,065
If one-tenth of my followers become my students,

98
00:07:27,065 --> 00:07:28,846
I'll be able to maintain my own studio.

99
00:07:28,846 --> 00:07:30,073
Kyoka-chan.

100
00:07:30,073 --> 00:07:33,084
But I'm wondering if I should do online yoga.

101
00:07:33,084 --> 00:07:35,805
- Kyoka-chan...
- Excuse me, can I have two beers?

102
00:07:35,805 --> 00:07:37,603
Yes, no problem.

103
00:07:37,603 --> 00:07:40,639
Let's drink today, okay?

104
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,269
The moon is beautiful.

105
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:53,933
I'll take a photo.

106
00:07:53,933 --> 00:07:56,525
I need to upload it on Instagram.

107
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,520
Okay.

108
00:08:00,846 --> 00:08:02,710
It doesn't look good.

109
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:09,397
The photo didn't turn out well.

110
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,386
I wonder how I can take it beautifully.

111
00:08:13,386 --> 00:08:15,059
Kyoka-chan.

112
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,258
This has become mandatory.

113
00:08:18,258 --> 00:08:21,527
Well, this is part of the marketing.

114
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,409
Look, this is very convenient.

115
00:08:25,409 --> 00:08:27,306
Thank you.

116
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:30,973
It's okay not to be smiling all the time.

117
00:08:30,973 --> 00:08:34,470
You can sulk and pout, or even slack in your work.

118
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:36,394
Even if you were to lose your smartphone,

119
00:08:36,394 --> 00:08:39,402
people will not dislike you.

120
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,202
You are a good person,

121
00:08:43,202 --> 00:08:46,138
and I know that you are a good woman now.

122
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,298

123
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:00,406
I'm glad to have a childhood friend like you.

124
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,143
Thank you.

125
00:09:03,143 --> 00:09:05,304
Then, goodnight.

126
00:09:05,304 --> 00:09:06,902
See you.

127
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:16,589
So, you've been approved of shorter working hours?

128
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,502
Thank you.

129
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:24,673
But is that really what you want?

130
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,925
Didn't they say that you won't be able to go back to the headquarters?

131
00:09:28,925 --> 00:09:31,115
Well, I'm fine with that.

132
00:09:31,115 --> 00:09:33,248
As long as I can receive child support.

133
00:09:33,248 --> 00:09:37,151
You don't need to worry about going to Osaka.

134
00:09:37,151 --> 00:09:41,128
I understand. I'll keep my promise.

135
00:09:41,128 --> 00:09:44,123
Papa, can I eat ice-cream?

136
00:09:44,123 --> 00:09:46,891
Of course not. You just brushed your teeth, right?

137
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:54,059
Nijiro said it's fine for me to go to Osaka,

138
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,674
but I wonder how he really feels.

139
00:09:57,674 --> 00:10:01,767
I'll talk to him again.

140
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,413
Thank you.

141
00:10:03,413 --> 00:10:04,997
Another thing I want to ask,

142
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,671
how's your relationship with Kyoka-san?

143
00:10:09,671 --> 00:10:13,379
We drew a clear line.

144
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:15,259
Look what I have!

145
00:10:15,259 --> 00:10:18,404
Hey, Niji.

146
00:10:18,404 --> 00:10:21,955
I will brush my teeth again later.

147
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:25,224
Say thanks to yourself.

148
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:30,092
Thank you.

149
00:10:30,092 --> 00:10:34,200
This will end our lesson today.

150
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,107
Sorry for the sudden visit.

151
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:52,963
I've heard about the panel yoga.

152
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:58,848
Nijiro had a fever on the day that you did not go for the meeting, right?

153
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,862
I'm really sorry about it.

154
00:11:01,862 --> 00:11:04,417
I made the decision myself.

155
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:09,654
And I won't meet Nijiro-kun again.

156
00:11:09,654 --> 00:11:12,375
I'm sorry to have caused a fuss.

157
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:18,180
- Kyoka-san, is that really all right with you?
- Work is my first priority now.

158
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:23,180
I will try to my best to be independent in my yoga job.

159
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:28,221
Sorry that I couldn't help in any way.

160
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:33,445
No. You've helped by telling me so much.

161
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,963
About missing the meeting,

162
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:40,503
can you keep it from Seita-san?

163
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,159
That's not...

164
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:44,659
Please.

165
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:00,127
- Please take care.
- Thank you.

166
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:05,416
Doctor, you've had a long day.

167
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:08,851
It's already late, but what about lunch?

168
00:12:08,851 --> 00:12:11,130
I have no appetite.

169
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:13,455
You look tired.

170
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,994
It's tough to be rejected at this age.

171
00:12:17,994 --> 00:12:20,511
What?! You were rejected by the other party?

172
00:12:20,511 --> 00:12:23,526
Yes, now I'm reminded of it again.

173
00:12:23,526 --> 00:12:25,886
My chest still hurts from being rejected.

174
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:33,330
Doctor, are you all right?

175
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:35,189
Should I call the ambulance?

176
00:12:35,189 --> 00:12:36,943
I'm all right.

177
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:41,629
So, it has not ended well with the single father.

178
00:12:41,629 --> 00:12:44,264
- Yes.
- It must be difficult for you.

179
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:45,966
Well...

180
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:49,601
Aren't you eating a bit too much?

181
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:52,538
You eat some, too.

182
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:56,101
Even though you are dumped, you still need to have a life.

183
00:12:56,101 --> 00:12:58,712
I'm eating. Don't worry.

184
00:12:58,712 --> 00:13:01,413
I only returned to who I was originally.

185
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:05,316
No wish for marriage. My dream comes first.

186
00:13:05,316 --> 00:13:07,545
You don't even want to fall in love, right?

187
00:13:07,545 --> 00:13:10,590
You've surpassed your original self.

188
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,735
Sorry I'm late.

189
00:13:12,735 --> 00:13:14,794
You must have had a tough day.

190
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,389
- Is Hinata-san okay?
- Yes.

191
00:13:17,389 --> 00:13:20,334
But she needs to be hospitalized today.

192
00:13:20,334 --> 00:13:23,682
I see. Hope she will be fine.

193
00:13:23,682 --> 00:13:26,251
- How about the clinic?
- It will be closed for a week.

194
00:13:26,251 --> 00:13:28,553
Excuse me, beer please.

195
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:35,148
It's piping hot!

196
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:37,552
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

197
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,687
What is that? What happened?

198
00:13:40,687 --> 00:13:44,590
I can do this myself. You came home late yesterday, right?

199
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,738
Did you go out with Higashimura-san?

200
00:13:46,738 --> 00:13:48,845
- What?
- Aren't you two going out?

201
00:13:48,845 --> 00:13:53,399
I will settle my breakfast myself.

202
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:56,635
If you were to leave this house,

203
00:13:56,635 --> 00:14:00,138
I will need to live by myself.

204
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,984
It's ended.

205
00:14:03,984 --> 00:14:05,689
Eh?

206
00:14:05,689 --> 00:14:09,114
And it's just started not long ago, so it's not really important.

207
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:10,921
You've liked him, so why?

208
00:14:10,921 --> 00:14:13,686
That reminds me. Father, do you know?

209
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,194
Hinata-san is hospitalized.

210
00:14:15,194 --> 00:14:17,546
Don't change the topic.

211
00:14:17,546 --> 00:14:19,045
- Eh?
- Yesterday.

212
00:14:19,045 --> 00:14:21,732
Suzu said she collapsed in the clinic.

213
00:14:21,732 --> 00:14:23,577
Collapsed?

214
00:14:23,577 --> 00:14:25,932
- Yes.
- What sickness is she suffering from? How is she now?

215
00:14:25,932 --> 00:14:30,169
I don't know about that. I just know that she's hospitalized.

216
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:36,576
Don't tell me the person that you like...

217
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:38,378
Which hospital is she in?

218
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:00,135
Hinata-san.

219
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:02,602
Sawada-san.

220
00:15:02,602 --> 00:15:04,763
Sorry to visit without informing.

221
00:15:04,763 --> 00:15:05,849
No worries.

222
00:15:05,849 --> 00:15:09,041
Sorry, but I heard that you collapsed, so I had to...

223
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:15,213
How are you feeling?

224
00:15:15,213 --> 00:15:17,239
It's due to overworking.

225
00:15:17,239 --> 00:15:20,184
So, you are hospitalized just due to overworking?

226
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:28,190
Actually, a tumour in my chest was found during a check-up,

227
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:31,717
and I'm waiting for the biopsy results.

228
00:15:31,717 --> 00:15:33,522
Then suddenly, I felt dizzy...

229
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,847
So, I'm unable to continue with marriage hunting for a while.

230
00:15:37,847 --> 00:15:39,460
Excuse me.

231
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:47,614
Sorry for being imprudent,

232
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:50,386
but I would like to take my words back.

233
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,558
If you...

234
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:00,781
If your feelings have not changed,

235
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:04,242
I would like to date you.

236
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,278
I reject your offer.

237
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:08,418
Eh?

238
00:16:08,418 --> 00:16:12,981
If the result shows a problem, I would only be a burden to you.

239
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,247
I'm now in this state,

240
00:16:16,247 --> 00:16:19,247
so you are just... taking pity on me.

241
00:16:19,247 --> 00:16:22,572
No, you are mistaken.

242
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:26,368
But to think that you might be gone,

243
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:33,403
I won't be able to take it.

244
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:40,586
I would like to continue my life together with you.

245
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:46,603
If I can live in this world together with you,

246
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:49,160
I mean if it's possible,

247
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:53,291
I will be a happy man.

248
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,405
I also hope that

249
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:01,988
you can share my happiness.

250
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,935
If it's really possible,

251
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:17,202
I will also be happy.

252
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:25,410
Be happy as normal.

253
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,820
Hinata-san.

254
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:34,625
Please take good care of me.

255
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:37,398
I'll be looking forward.

256
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,705
Excuse me, Dr. Matsuo wants to see you.

257
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:56,408
Okay.

258
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,350
<i>[Conference Room]</i>

259
00:18:16,131 --> 00:18:17,363
Menopause?

260
00:18:17,363 --> 00:18:19,599
I'll go straight to the point.

261
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:23,804
The tumor is benign, and there are no other problems.

262
00:18:23,804 --> 00:18:26,406
However, look at this.

263
00:18:26,406 --> 00:18:29,557
Really, the oestradiol count is low.

264
00:18:29,557 --> 00:18:31,811
It's a bit early,

265
00:18:31,811 --> 00:18:35,272
but we've reached that age.

266
00:18:35,272 --> 00:18:38,485
Replenishing your hormones will make it better.

267
00:18:38,485 --> 00:18:42,595
So, that's why.

268
00:18:42,595 --> 00:18:46,036
Dizziness, sleeplessness and heart palpitations,

269
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:51,215
what about the feeling in my chest?

270
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:54,945
Did I make a mistake?

271
00:18:54,945 --> 00:18:56,902
No way...

272
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:58,111
Are you all right?

273
00:18:58,111 --> 00:19:00,847
Yes, I feel happy.

274
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:10,071
I'm glad to hear that.

275
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,798
It's really good news.

276
00:19:13,798 --> 00:19:17,200
Yes, I can be discharged immediately.

277
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:28,345
A long and beautiful humerus.

278
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,852
A serious relationship? With Hinata-san?

279
00:19:35,852 --> 00:19:37,672
Yes, that's right.

280
00:19:37,672 --> 00:19:39,991
That's good news.

281
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:43,127
Congratulations.

282
00:19:43,127 --> 00:19:44,885
Let's have a celebration.

283
00:19:44,885 --> 00:19:47,903
Where's the expensive wine that we got?

284
00:19:47,903 --> 00:19:49,570
There's no need to celebrate.

285
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:55,071
Why? There might not be a next time.

286
00:19:55,071 --> 00:19:57,874
Hey, Kyoka.

287
00:19:57,874 --> 00:19:59,944
Regarding the matter with Higashimura-san and you...

288
00:19:59,944 --> 00:20:02,546
That's enough.

289
00:20:02,546 --> 00:20:04,245
I found it.

290
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:09,920
I'm not looking forward to my own happiness.

291
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:14,925
Actually, my intention was to get Kyoka into marriage.

292
00:20:14,925 --> 00:20:17,599
I only want her to be happy as a normal person.

293
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:19,493
Happy as a normal person?

294
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,723
Hey, Kyoka. Don't tell me it's because of...

295
00:20:22,723 --> 00:20:25,893
We really don't know what to expect in life.

296
00:20:25,893 --> 00:20:30,611
In the beginning, you started marriage hunting because of me.

297
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,979
Mother will be happy to hear this, too.

298
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:39,726
- What did Hinata-san say?
- What?

299
00:20:39,726 --> 00:20:43,219
In marriage hunting, do you propose immediately?

300
00:20:43,219 --> 00:20:46,100
Don't tell me you have proposed successfully?

301
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:49,304
As a lexicographer, what do you say to propose?

302
00:20:49,304 --> 00:20:51,235
What do you mean?

303
00:20:51,235 --> 00:20:56,389
So, did you say that you "like" her?

304
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,012
No, I did not.

305
00:20:59,012 --> 00:21:00,277
No?

306
00:21:00,277 --> 00:21:02,229
Yes, I did not.

307
00:21:02,229 --> 00:21:04,480
<i>[Hinata Akari-sama]</i>

308
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,940
<i>Good evening.</i>

309
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:10,514
<i>I'm glad that you have been discharged safely.</i>

310
00:21:10,514 --> 00:21:14,784
<i>Today, I would like to tell you about how I feel,</i>

311
00:21:14,784 --> 00:21:19,673
<i>thus I am writing this mail to you.</i>

312
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:27,931
<i>I like you, Hinata Akari-san.</i>

313
00:21:27,931 --> 00:21:30,350
<i>I've always liked you.</i>

314
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:31,530
<i>[I like you Hinata Akari-san. I've always liked you. It should be way before you had any feelings for me.]</i>

315
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:34,508
<i>It should be way before you had any feelings for me.</i>

316
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:38,985
<i>At that time, my feelings were unsettled.</i>

317
00:21:38,985 --> 00:21:41,279
<i>As a lexicographer,</i>

318
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:44,407
<i>I'm unable to convey myself in speech properly,</i>

319
00:21:44,407 --> 00:21:46,876
<i>so I would like to use words to express myself.</i>

320
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,557
Hinata-san.

321
00:21:49,557 --> 00:21:52,059
Sorry that I'm late.

322
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,316
Do I look weird?

323
00:21:56,316 --> 00:21:57,146
No.

324
00:21:57,146 --> 00:22:01,169
I just thought that I'm blessed to date a lexicographer.

325
00:22:01,169 --> 00:22:03,076
You are making me blushed.

326
00:22:03,076 --> 00:22:04,423
Shall we go?

327
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:05,880
Okay.

328
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:28,213
Frankly speaking,

329
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:31,351
we might be on a date now,

330
00:22:31,351 --> 00:22:33,394
but I'm thinking

331
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:37,507
if you will enjoy our date.

332
00:22:37,507 --> 00:22:41,315
I'm both embarrassed and worried.

333
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,583
The reason that I collapsed was

334
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:50,402
due to menopause that led to poor health.

335
00:22:50,402 --> 00:22:52,922
- Menopause?
- Yes.

336
00:22:52,922 --> 00:22:55,562
Of course, I would like to stay young,

337
00:22:55,562 --> 00:22:59,546
but once you are after forty, you can feel the age and difference, right?

338
00:22:59,546 --> 00:23:00,990
That's true.

339
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:05,104
Therefore from now on, we should walk more to be healthy.

340
00:23:05,104 --> 00:23:09,957
Well, for both man and woman,

341
00:23:09,957 --> 00:23:12,639
there are medical approaches to stay healthy.

342
00:23:12,639 --> 00:23:14,836
For this, you can leave it to me.

343
00:23:14,836 --> 00:23:16,403
No problem.

344
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:21,837
Today, shall we go eat something?

345
00:23:21,837 --> 00:23:23,610
Yes.

346
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:28,141
Wrap your shoulders with your fingers gently,

347
00:23:28,141 --> 00:23:31,704
and turn your elbows in big circles.

348
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:35,020
It feels good.

349
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:37,081
Recently, wearing the suit is making my body stiff.

350
00:23:37,081 --> 00:23:38,800
That's right.

351
00:23:43,807 --> 00:23:45,322
I can see your pyjamas.

352
00:23:45,322 --> 00:23:46,610
What? Really?

353
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:48,389
Look behind you.

354
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:52,768
The room is too small.

355
00:23:52,768 --> 00:23:55,087
Be careful when you are doing this with other people.

356
00:23:55,087 --> 00:23:56,965
Okay.

357
00:23:56,965 --> 00:23:59,521
Oh yes.

358
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:02,005
Next Tuesday evening,

359
00:24:02,005 --> 00:24:04,949
there will be a yoga event on the building rooftop.

360
00:24:04,949 --> 00:24:06,144
Would you like to come?

361
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:08,565
I will be there, for sure.

362
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:12,985
That day, it's going to be a full moon night.

363
00:24:12,985 --> 00:24:16,306
Ah, a full moon in June...

364
00:24:16,306 --> 00:24:18,070
I think it's a strawberry moon.

365
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:20,092
Yes, it is.

366
00:24:20,092 --> 00:24:22,541
You really know a lot.

367
00:24:22,541 --> 00:24:25,320
Send me the venue later.

368
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,466
Okay.

369
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:31,803
Hey, do you want to come for dinner tomorrow?

370
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:33,673
We have a celebration to make.

371
00:24:33,673 --> 00:24:35,173
A celebration?

372
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:37,980
Hayate.

373
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,942
Uncle!

374
00:24:39,942 --> 00:24:42,881
Congratulations!

375
00:24:42,881 --> 00:24:44,651
I'm happy that you are finally with Ms. Hinata.

376
00:24:44,651 --> 00:24:48,981
I'm also happy that you are a manager now!

377
00:24:48,981 --> 00:24:51,694
Both of you, please move the dishes to the table.

378
00:24:51,694 --> 00:24:54,402
Let's do it.

379
00:24:54,402 --> 00:24:55,946
Is it Malaysia?

380
00:24:55,946 --> 00:24:58,155
- Yes.
- That's fantastic.

381
00:24:58,155 --> 00:24:59,923
Please come and visit me.

382
00:24:59,923 --> 00:25:03,636
That's right. Kyoka starts losing her phone when you are not here.

383
00:25:03,636 --> 00:25:06,470
Because you are always leaving your towel on top of it.

384
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:09,823
The towel dropped when you are looking for your stuff.

385
00:25:09,823 --> 00:25:11,712
What a waste of my effort to fold the towels.

386
00:25:11,712 --> 00:25:13,886
Really?

387
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:17,651
It feels so good to be here.

388
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,388
But Uncle, now you know how to fold the laundry?

389
00:25:22,388 --> 00:25:25,962
I'm learning bit by bit, because you are not around.

390
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:33,998
- I'm thinking of moving out soon.
- Eh?

391
00:25:34,009 --> 00:25:37,768
Because if I'm around,
it won't be easy to invite Hinata-san to the house.

392
00:25:37,768 --> 00:25:40,869
- You don't have to...
- That's not all.

393
00:25:40,869 --> 00:25:44,747
I'm also planning to start the online yoga more seriously.

394
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:48,154
So, it's inconvenient to do it in this house.

395
00:25:48,154 --> 00:25:49,833
Yes, the house will be in the video background.

396
00:25:49,833 --> 00:25:51,786
That's right.

397
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:57,255
Father is also more independent now.

398
00:25:57,255 --> 00:25:59,109
So, things will go well, right?

399
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,434
Anyway, you won't be staying with me forever.

400
00:26:02,434 --> 00:26:04,554
You will leave this house...

401
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:07,090
No, nothing.

402
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:15,411
I've decided to remain single for the rest of my life.

403
00:26:15,411 --> 00:26:18,110
Anyway, I won't have any problem to remain single.

404
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:20,775
I can live well alone.

405
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,784
I'm not worried about your life,

406
00:26:25,784 --> 00:26:28,353
but you don't have to make such a firm decision.

407
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:34,444
When your life continues,

408
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:38,386
there are bound to be changes that will come along.

409
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,877
- See you.
- You can just stay over.

410
00:26:49,877 --> 00:26:52,877
Hayate is busy now.

411
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:56,169
See you. Thanks for coming.

412
00:26:58,090 --> 00:26:59,970
Thank you for inviting me.

413
00:27:00,863 --> 00:27:02,248
See you.

414
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:16,900
Hayate, here you are.

415
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,639
Thank you.

416
00:27:18,639 --> 00:27:22,035
It's unusual for you to forget things like me.

417
00:27:22,035 --> 00:27:23,550
I did it on purpose.

418
00:27:24,766 --> 00:27:27,413
If you are going to move out,

419
00:27:27,413 --> 00:27:29,391
do you want to live together?

420
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:33,212
It would be a great help if you are around.

421
00:27:33,212 --> 00:27:35,450
I don't mean that.

422
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:44,230
If you are going to be alone, I'd feel troubled.

423
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:55,962
Goodnight.

424
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,053
Yoko-san.

425
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:18,600
There's a change of plans.

426
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:26,833
Is that so? I'm happy to hear.

427
00:28:26,833 --> 00:28:29,333
Congratulations on proceeding to a serious relationship.

428
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:30,657
Thank you.

429
00:28:30,657 --> 00:28:33,903
I'm really happy to hear the good news.

430
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:39,439
I heard from Kyoka.

431
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:42,937
Her relationship with you...

432
00:28:42,937 --> 00:28:44,850
It's a pity.

433
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:48,095
I'm sorry.

434
00:28:48,095 --> 00:28:50,365
No, you don't need to be.

435
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:55,658
When my ex-wife passed away,

436
00:28:55,658 --> 00:28:59,354
I wanted Kyoka to be happy.

437
00:28:59,354 --> 00:29:02,421
And we've received much concern from your company.

438
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:09,349
My daughter hopes for a normal happy life,

439
00:29:09,349 --> 00:29:12,534
and she might be little blunt to say it to you.

440
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,596
I'm sorry about it.

441
00:29:15,596 --> 00:29:17,260
No, it's fine.

442
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:22,966
It's also my fault

443
00:29:22,966 --> 00:29:25,805
that this has ended up in an ambiguous situation,

444
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:29,368
but there's a reason behind it.

445
00:29:29,368 --> 00:29:31,045
A reason?

446
00:29:31,045 --> 00:29:32,711
Yes.

447
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:37,029
Actually...

448
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:49,140
<i>[Wis Kids]</i>

449
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:51,160
- Let's eat dinner.
- Dinner, dinner.

450
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,998
Nijiro.

451
00:29:52,998 --> 00:29:54,289
Wait a moment.

452
00:29:54,289 --> 00:29:55,649
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

453
00:29:55,649 --> 00:29:58,444
- Let's eat dinner!
- What are you drawing?

454
00:29:58,444 --> 00:29:59,940
Let's see...

455
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:06,152
It seems that you've split up with her.

456
00:30:06,152 --> 00:30:07,735
Yes.

457
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:11,523
But don't worry about it.

458
00:30:11,523 --> 00:30:14,543
She's moving on independently, so you don't need to worry.

459
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:18,794
It seems that she's going to live alone.

460
00:30:18,794 --> 00:30:20,533
How did you know about it?

461
00:30:20,533 --> 00:30:22,033
That's because...

462
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:26,509
You'd better not get involved half-heartedly.

463
00:30:26,509 --> 00:30:28,338
And you don't need to be kind to her.

464
00:30:28,338 --> 00:30:30,631
Nijiro, get prepared to go.

465
00:30:30,631 --> 00:30:32,438
Yes.

466
00:30:32,438 --> 00:30:35,280
Nijiro, it's time to go home.

467
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,110
Okay.

468
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:49,539
- I'm home.
- Welcome back.

469
00:30:49,539 --> 00:30:51,994
What are you looking at?

470
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:54,940
This is so nostalgic.

471
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:58,081
You and Mother were so young.

472
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:04,129
The other time, you asked me the meaning of marriage.

473
00:31:04,129 --> 00:31:06,007
Yes, I did.

474
00:31:06,007 --> 00:31:07,936
But you don't have to answer that.

475
00:31:07,936 --> 00:31:10,166
I have no interest in marriage now.

476
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,863
I thought the same, too.

477
00:31:13,863 --> 00:31:15,173
Eh?

478
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:18,710
I wanted to know the meaning of marriage,

479
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,514
so I got married.

480
00:31:20,514 --> 00:31:22,515
What are you talking about?

481
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:26,418
Yoko-san was my junior at the seminar class at university.

482
00:31:26,418 --> 00:31:28,717
She was cheerful and popular with the guys.

483
00:31:28,717 --> 00:31:31,714
However, I did not know her well.

484
00:31:31,714 --> 00:31:35,814
I guess that. She's totally different from you.

485
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:41,600
Therefore, that day was seven years after I graduated.

486
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:46,840
At that time, I was just a poor university lecturer,

487
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:50,944
and I went to visit a professor at the hospital.

488
00:31:50,944 --> 00:31:56,215
Professor, how are you feeling?

489
00:31:57,690 --> 00:32:00,044
You can see for yourself.

490
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,731
Please excuse me.

491
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:10,000
Sawada-kun, you are honest and hardworking.

492
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,569
You will definitely become an excellent academic in future.

493
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:16,785
Thank you very much.

494
00:32:16,785 --> 00:32:18,445
However,

495
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:25,063
if you were to continue like this, you cannot become a lexicographer.

496
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:29,871
Why is that so?

497
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:34,859
Because you are not living a life.

498
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:39,989
Words are not just in the books,

499
00:32:39,989 --> 00:32:44,229
but it's alive within the people.

500
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:47,232
Alive?

501
00:32:47,232 --> 00:32:52,565
Sawada-kun, how would you explain

502
00:32:52,565 --> 00:32:55,667
the word "alive"?

503
00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:03,454
Breathing and in existence.

504
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:08,361
Am I correct to say that?

505
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:14,019
Something that is ever-changing.

506
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:17,180
How is that?

507
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:19,995
Ever-changing?

508
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:25,269
Live your life to the fullest.

509
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:30,074
I was unable to say anything.

510
00:33:30,074 --> 00:33:34,279
I didn't connect with people and just indulged myself in books.

511
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:37,856
I didn't laugh with anyone, nor had any quarrels.

512
00:33:37,856 --> 00:33:41,483
I just lived day by day the same way as I did the day before.

513
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,556
And then I met her on my way home.

514
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:49,305
I mean your mother.

515
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:52,175
Are you all right?

516
00:33:52,175 --> 00:33:55,501
I'm sorry, but my tummy...

517
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,046
Sawada-san.

518
00:33:59,046 --> 00:34:00,736
Eh?

519
00:34:00,736 --> 00:34:02,247
Ah.

520
00:34:02,247 --> 00:34:05,416
- I'm Hirose.
- Ah, Hirose-san.

521
00:34:05,416 --> 00:34:07,479
Are you all right?

522
00:34:07,479 --> 00:34:12,417
I'm sorry, but can you bring me to the bench?

523
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:20,554
Are you all right?

524
00:34:20,554 --> 00:34:22,563
I'm fine.

525
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,379
- I'll go call a nurse.
- No, I'm fine.

526
00:34:29,379 --> 00:34:30,820
I just need to take a rest.

527
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:32,671
Should I get you some water?

528
00:34:32,671 --> 00:34:34,536
It's okay.

529
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:41,647
Is there anything that I can help?

530
00:34:41,647 --> 00:34:43,493
Then...

531
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:47,852
can you marry me?

532
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:57,107
Ah, I'm so sorry.

533
00:34:57,107 --> 00:35:00,155
Please ignore me. You can just leave.

534
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:04,332
Okay.

535
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:12,604
Okay.

536
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,447
Let's get married.

537
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:22,788
Eh? What?!

538
00:35:22,788 --> 00:35:25,674
What are you talking about? I don't understand at all.

539
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:29,363
That time,

540
00:35:29,363 --> 00:35:32,143
if I did not meet Yoko-san,

541
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:36,655
I would still be buried in the books.

542
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:41,457
I would have no chance to quarrel with you.

543
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:46,931
That was the moment of my life.

544
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:49,782
During that time,

545
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:54,222
the baby in Mother's stomach was?

546
00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:57,895
It's you.

547
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,358
No way.

548
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:05,356
Your mother found out that she was pregnant after breaking up with her boyfriend at that time.

549
00:36:05,356 --> 00:36:07,727
She thought of giving birth to the baby alone.

550
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,607
However, she was not in her pink of health.

551
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:19,939
If anything were to happen to her,

552
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:23,515
she wanted someone to look after her child.

553
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:26,585
So,

554
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:30,255
Father and I...

555
00:36:30,255 --> 00:36:34,796
Yes, we are not related by blood.

556
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:41,927
<i>Rintaro-san,</i>

557
00:36:41,927 --> 00:36:45,387
<i>thank you for accepting my proposal that day.</i>

558
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:50,900
The meaning of marriage?

559
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,551
<i>Regarding that,</i>

560
00:36:52,551 --> 00:36:54,617
<i>I still do not know.</i>

561
00:36:57,710 --> 00:37:02,154
I know the whereabouts of your real father.

562
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:14,811
Father.

563
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,039
Father...

564
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:24,168
Yes, I am your father.

565
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:34,917
Actually, I was intending to tell you upon your graduation,

566
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,633
but I wasn't able to say it.

567
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:40,104
Rintaro-san.

568
00:37:40,104 --> 00:37:41,250
Yes?

569
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:43,262
About Kyoka...

570
00:37:43,262 --> 00:37:45,174
I know.

571
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,866
When she gets married, I will let her know.

572
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:56,295
Can you do it without me?

573
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,382
I'm not sure.

574
00:37:59,382 --> 00:38:01,042
Mother.

575
00:38:01,042 --> 00:38:04,006
I made milk tea. Can you drink?

576
00:38:04,006 --> 00:38:06,067
Thank you.

577
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:11,930
Therefore, I made a promise to tell you when you get married.

578
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:19,284
It smells great.

579
00:38:19,284 --> 00:38:22,170
However, you said that you do not want to get married.

580
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,176
Are you disappointed?

581
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,299
No, I'm shocked.

582
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:36,019
Do people get married this way?

583
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:42,864
However...

584
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,328
I was very happy.

585
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:53,402
I found a gem that I could not have found elsewhere.

586
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:57,605
Father.

587
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:05,363
I also managed to become a father.

588
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:09,691
Therefore, I also hope that

589
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:13,562
you can live your life to the fullest.

590
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,526
Father.

591
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:26,591
Thank you for getting married with Mother.

592
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,554
Finally...

593
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:37,245
I understand the meaning of marriage.

594
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:43,598
You only know it now?

595
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:46,985
Here you go.

596
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:05,226
Actually,

597
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:10,008
Kyoka is not related by blood to me.

598
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:16,656
I will let her know about it, but I'm not sure how she will take it.

599
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:20,848
Why did you tell me such an important matter?

600
00:40:20,848 --> 00:40:25,416
I became her father,

601
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:31,730
and I'm happy to do that.

602
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:36,635
She's my daughter.

603
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,795
Therefore,

604
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:45,009
I hope that you can believe in her.

605
00:41:09,169 --> 00:41:11,608
<i>[Moon Night Yoga]</i>

606
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:34,140
<i>[Moon Night Yoga]</i>

607
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:40,132
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

608
00:41:40,132 --> 00:41:43,957
Please place your mat at your desired spot.

609
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:50,568
<i>Sorry, the meeting is extended.</i>

610
00:41:50,568 --> 00:41:52,350
<i>I won't be able to make it for the lesson.</i>

611
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:55,016
<i>If it ends early, I will be there.</i>

612
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:03,928
Point your feet to the floor,

613
00:42:03,928 --> 00:42:06,625
and face the front.

614
00:42:06,625 --> 00:42:10,779
Lower your tailbone and lift your arms up.

615
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:14,869
This is the crescent pose.

616
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,700
Excuse me. I'll take my leave first.

617
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:20,570
Goodbye.

618
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:25,753
The full moon slowly reduces in size.

619
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:29,664
Everything is ever-changing,

620
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:34,469
Including shaped and shapeless things.

621
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:38,700
Of course, that includes yourself, too.

622
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:42,921
You laugh and you cry.

623
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:49,943
Your heart gets shaken, and time itself is transient.

624
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:56,001
Or rather, your heart needs to continue beating,

625
00:42:56,001 --> 00:42:59,337
even though you are a calm person.

626
00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:09,600
That means, a change is equal to the meaning of living.

627
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:15,405
Not everything goes accordingly to your plan,

628
00:43:17,770 --> 00:43:22,684
things that you have not thought of happens in a normal day.

629
00:43:22,684 --> 00:43:26,629
Let's make the most out of our lives.

630
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,818
Old lady, I'll help you.

631
00:43:38,818 --> 00:43:42,086
- I'll carry it.
- Thank you.

632
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:04,820
credits

633
00:44:06,590 --> 00:44:08,647
Kyoka-chan, well done.

634
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:10,687
Thank you.

635
00:44:21,770 --> 00:44:23,328
Kyoka-chan.

636
00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:25,673
Let's get married.

637
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:27,708
What?

638
00:44:27,708 --> 00:44:30,169
Let's go to Malaysia together.

639
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,006
Are you serious?

640
00:44:33,006 --> 00:44:34,958
Of course.

641
00:44:34,958 --> 00:44:38,176
My legs are trembling now.

642
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:44,913
Kyoka-chan, you are my miracle.

643
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,576
You are the first person that I really like.

644
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:52,226
I liked you when I was a child,

645
00:44:52,226 --> 00:44:54,530
but I like you even more now.

646
00:44:56,490 --> 00:44:59,160
I will be your wife.

647
00:45:00,890 --> 00:45:04,556
To be a good wife after marriage,

648
00:45:04,556 --> 00:45:07,496
that's what you are worried about.

649
00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:12,954
You can just be yourself, just lazy or careless.

650
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:17,653
I want to become a person like your mother.

651
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:20,186
You don't need to change anything.

652
00:45:20,186 --> 00:45:23,889
Just do your yoga, and always be happy.

653
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:32,516
When I went to your house last time,

654
00:45:32,516 --> 00:45:35,834
I felt lonely when I said "Thanks for inviting me."

655
00:45:35,834 --> 00:45:39,888
I want to say "I'm back" instead.

656
00:45:40,590 --> 00:45:42,407
Kyoka-chan,

657
00:45:48,510 --> 00:45:51,116
I want to be your real family.

658
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:54,482
Family?

659
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:59,050
A family member does not change like a lover.

660
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:02,380
I will always treat you with importance.
