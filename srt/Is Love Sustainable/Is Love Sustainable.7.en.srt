00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:52,999
Otherwise, there was no explaining why you'd reject being a manager.

Sorry, Ma'am.

142
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:03,979

Of course not!

- Ah, my apologies.

00:10:55,622 --> 00:10:57,631
- You were saying?
- And some blue cheese.

175
00:10:57,631 --> 00:11:02,158
Right. In short, I want to keep my lessons cheap.

176
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:06,633
That's not a business you'd be running, but a volunteer service.

00:11:13,367 --> 00:11:18,688
and teaching yoga to workers on break is a solid, good idea.

180
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:22,782
By the way, are you married?

181
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:24,345
- Married?
- Yup.

182
00:11:24,345 --> 00:11:28,653
Sorry I need to ask, or else we're stepping on eggshells forever.

183
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,892
Since I aim to start a business,

184
00:11:31,892 --> 00:11:34,449
my partner understands that marriage is not my priority.

185
00:11:34,449 --> 00:11:36,719
Dating without marrying?!

186
00:11:36,719 --> 00:11:38,361
What sort of guy is that generous?

187
00:11:38,361 --> 00:11:42,227
He's an honest to good guy, nothing weird.

188
00:11:42,227 --> 00:11:44,971
- And he doesn't care about marriage?
- Yes.

189
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:47,507
God, I get that.

190
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:50,370
I'm not dating to get married again.

191
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:52,850
Again?

192
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:56,592
Oh, I'm once divorced with a child.

193
00:11:56,592 --> 00:11:59,678
My partner cares for the kid,

194
00:11:59,678 --> 00:12:02,667
but he lets us meet often.

195
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:10,840
You see, I couldn't balance work and family.

196
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,203
I left our son with his dad, thinking he'd be happier there.

197
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,284
I...

198
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:28,294
have a friend? Who's in a similar situation.

199
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:32,852
Even after the divorce, they care for their child together.

200
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:37,957
Exactly! A big change from a fight-filled married life, for sure.

201
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:41,258
But we have one rule.

202
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:49,036
"Don't hurt our child." So long as he abides by our rule,

203
00:12:49,036 --> 00:12:52,440
I'll wish for his happiness.

204
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,735
A rule...

205
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:58,276
Yup. Of course, I have to follow it too.

206
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:03,395
In fact, I've decided it's the one rule I'll stick to for life.

207
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:07,187
Sounds like we've all got lots going on.

208
00:13:07,187 --> 00:13:09,890
I wanted to ask why the Kansai dialect?

209
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:15,653
Because I'm an Osaka-born Tokyoite, married to an Australian. I'm a double-whammy!

210
00:13:15,653 --> 00:13:17,831
- Kyoka-san, ignore her.
- I've even got a sister-

211
00:13:17,831 --> 00:13:19,967
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

212
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:21,900
She's such a jester! Which reminds me-

213
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,300
- It's fine.
- It was pleasant to talk to you before.

214
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:29,667
Thankfully, the consultant I met said she'd continue to help.

215
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:36,106
First things first is finding a studio.

216
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:39,528
That's definitely something I can help with.

217
00:13:39,528 --> 00:13:41,347
- Huh?
- Remember,

218
00:13:41,347 --> 00:13:44,524
I worked longer in real-estate,

219
00:13:44,524 --> 00:13:47,379
not in marriage counseling.

220
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:49,710
Still...

221
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:53,308
- Would you rather I don't?
- No, I'm grateful, really.

222
00:13:53,308 --> 00:13:56,202
But wouldn't that be too much for you?

223
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:59,038
I mean, aren't we...

224
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,976
A proposition.

225
00:14:04,976 --> 00:14:06,446
Go ahead.

226
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:08,451
Let's set some rules.

227
00:14:08,451 --> 00:14:10,050
Rules?

228
00:14:10,651 --> 00:14:13,020
First. No matter what happens,

229
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:15,833
I want you to always prioritize Nijiro.

230
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:19,664
Thank you.

231
00:14:19,664 --> 00:14:21,921
In that case,

232
00:14:21,921 --> 00:14:24,145
please prioritize work and going independent.

233
00:14:24,145 --> 00:14:26,658
I will, thank you.

234
00:14:26,658 --> 00:14:29,203
Let's not force our relationship.

235
00:14:29,203 --> 00:14:33,203
After all, I'd like... us

236
00:14:33,203 --> 00:14:35,471
to last.

237
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:38,076
Of course.

238
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:43,039
Then may I propose a rule as well?

239
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:44,539
Go ahead.

240
00:14:44,539 --> 00:14:47,446
Let's keep our relationship a secret, not only from Nijiro,

241
00:14:47,446 --> 00:14:50,256
but from Sawada-san as well.

242
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:53,354
- Don't mind my father-
- I know he will worry.

243
00:14:53,354 --> 00:14:58,311
After all, you're dating someone once divorced, and with a child.

244
00:14:58,311 --> 00:15:01,303
- I really don't mind-
- And one more rule.

245
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:08,858
If you wish to get married, feel free to tell me.

246
00:15:08,858 --> 00:15:12,401
We can end our relationship, right then and there.

247
00:15:12,401 --> 00:15:14,510
Seita...

248
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,758
Anything other rules?

249
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:32,254
That's my drink.

250
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,477
What?

251
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,171
Oh god, why am I like this...

252
00:15:38,171 --> 00:15:42,842
How about our last rule be "don't mind the small things"?

253
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:47,123
Sounds great for a klutz like me.

254
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,441
In that case...

255
00:15:49,441 --> 00:15:51,430
One last favor.

256
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:52,830
Yes?

257
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,220
Next time we're free...

258
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:58,975
I'd like to go on a date.

259
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:01,693
Of course.

260
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,896
<i>[{...andU} Marriage Match-Up Request]</i>

261
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:07,877

00:16:07,877 --> 00:16:12,179
"For more specific information, please visit my profile..."

263
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:14,927
How bothersome.

264
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:22,682
Thank you for the simple introduction.

265
00:16:22,682 --> 00:16:24,482
I'd love to..

266
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:44,003
Dear Sawada-san. Good evening.

267
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:51,154
Dearest... Salutations?

268
00:16:55,380 --> 00:17:00,553
<i>Hello, Hinata speaking. Your radio show was quite interesting.</i>

269
00:17:00,553 --> 00:17:05,345
<i>I hope to hear more about it, on our next walk.</i>

270
00:17:05,345 --> 00:17:07,564
<i>See you again.</i>

271
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,363
Hinata-san?

272
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,202
<i>A Humble Request.</i>

282
00:17:45,382 --> 00:17:47,776
A date?

283
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:53,264
N-No, this is-

284
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,711
If you're home, say so!

285
00:17:57,711 --> 00:18:01,750
You don't hear me while working anyways.

286
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,540
So, what date?

287
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:07,620
- Are you giving marriage hunting a go again?
- N-No!

288
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:11,263
If anything, I want you to go on a date or two.

289
00:18:11,263 --> 00:18:15,500
All right, listen up. I...

290
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:20,830
I'm tired. Yeah, tired.

291
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,607
Huh?

292
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:29,208
- Morning, Niji.
- Morning.

293
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,010
Get your shoes on.

294
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:33,079
Nijiro, your hat.

295
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:35,181
Thanks.

296
00:18:35,181 --> 00:18:37,027
- Have fun.
- Of course.

297
00:18:37,027 --> 00:18:39,418
What's with the get up?

298
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:42,407
You usually wear sweats on days off.

299
00:18:42,407 --> 00:18:45,124
Oh, this? I have errands to run.

300
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,054
Yeah.

301
00:18:51,054 --> 00:18:53,466
Errands, huh?

302
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:56,369
- See you!
- Have fun.

303
00:18:56,369 --> 00:19:00,136
And after your "errands", did you book dinner with a nice view?

304
00:19:00,136 --> 00:19:01,908
Or does she prefer a nice retreat?

305
00:19:01,908 --> 00:19:04,333
I don't know!

306
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,181
Aw, don't be shy. We're free to date, remember?

307
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:11,683
Let's both do our best, okay?

308
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:21,226
<i>Sorry! May I delay our meet-up by thirty minutes?</i>

309
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:38,110
Sorry, I'm late!

310
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:40,012
You didn't need to rush.

311
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:43,850
But that would waste our whole day together...

312
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:47,987
We're not pressed, so let's relax, and go wherever you'd like.

313
00:19:47,987 --> 00:19:52,391
Then I'd like to visit places you like frequenting.

314
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:54,736
Places I like?

315
00:19:54,736 --> 00:19:57,296
Yes. Give me the grand tour, okay?

316
00:19:57,296 --> 00:20:00,335
Erm... What?

317
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,215
- Places I like...
- Anywhere, really.

318
00:20:04,215 --> 00:20:05,559
- Anywhere?
- Anywhere.

319
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:07,040
Wherever I'd like, huh?

320
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,810

Your help means the world.

330
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:47,610
What a relief.

331
00:20:47,612 --> 00:20:49,454
You've reverted to normal.
<i>(T/N: Before, she addressed him extremely formally)</i>

332
00:20:49,454 --> 00:20:51,583
Oh, my email?

333
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,487
I became overly conscious of your role as editor,

334
00:20:54,487 --> 00:20:56,304
and fumbled a bit...

335
00:20:56,304 --> 00:20:58,579
There's no need to be overly articulate.

336
00:20:58,579 --> 00:21:04,609
If anything, modern language is what we, dictionary editors, wish to record.

337
00:21:04,609 --> 00:21:06,872
- I will keep that in mind.
- Wonderful.

338
00:21:06,872 --> 00:21:10,160
- Then I look forwards to today.
- Likewise.

339
00:21:12,072 --> 00:21:15,062
Will this suffice as our first destination?
<i>[Calligraphy Exhibit]</i>

340
00:21:15,062 --> 00:21:17,264
Calligraphy? Sounds interesting.

341
00:21:17,264 --> 00:21:18,878
Have you already been?

342
00:21:18,878 --> 00:21:23,120
No, this is a first. I don't visit exhibits regularly.

343
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,406
- Is that so?
- Yes.

344
00:21:25,406 --> 00:21:27,129
Then I'm glad. Shall we?

345
00:21:27,129 --> 00:21:28,629
Yes.

346
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:34,682
I'd love a lamp like this, but I'm afraid Nijiro would break it.

347
00:21:34,682 --> 00:21:39,042
I never knew you enjoyed interior design.

348
00:21:39,042 --> 00:21:42,036
Truth be told, I use to be all about houses.

349
00:21:42,036 --> 00:21:44,659
- Really?
- Yes, especially architecture.

350
00:21:44,659 --> 00:21:47,188
I even got an interior design license,

351
00:21:47,188 --> 00:21:50,824
and applied for work but to no avail, unfortunately.

352
00:21:50,824 --> 00:21:55,100
That's when I realized selling homes wasn't so bad either.

353
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,132
I see.

354
00:21:57,132 --> 00:22:02,650
But look at me now. Somehow, I've become a marriage counselor.

355
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:09,874
Still, I have my moments where I think the job is nice.

356
00:22:09,874 --> 00:22:13,421
In fact, I've been invited to a wedding tomorrow.

357
00:22:13,421 --> 00:22:15,670
Do you remember Segawa-san?

358
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:19,702
- The dango man?
- Yes.

359
00:22:19,702 --> 00:22:23,844
So he found someone to marry? That's wonderful!

360
00:22:23,844 --> 00:22:28,281
Indeed. He said he owed it all to you.

361
00:22:28,281 --> 00:22:30,541
I didn't do much, really.

362
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:36,494
Your job makes people happy. That's such a treat, you know?

363
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:38,876
I guess so.

364
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:46,269
W-What shall we do for lunch?

365
00:22:46,269 --> 00:22:49,357
I only visit curry places...

366
00:22:49,357 --> 00:22:53,204
- I'm fine with curry.
- No, not this time.

367
00:22:53,204 --> 00:22:55,110
This is supposed to be a special day...

368
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,932
I just don't have anything

369
00:23:03,932 --> 00:23:07,753
I'm passionate about like you are with yoga.

370
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:09,423
At the core, I'm a boring guy.

371
00:23:09,423 --> 00:23:12,548
That's not true.

372
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:18,780
For now, let's explore the area for a nice place.

373
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,380
Great idea.

374
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:24,910
Looks like there's a highly rated Italian place near by.

375
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:26,600
<i>[Trattoria Quadrifoglio]</i>

376
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,420
<i>[Daikanyama Park]</i>

377
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:36,664
Nice weather today, isn't it?

378
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:41,337
Right this way.

379
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,971
Some of the oldest scripts were written during the Yin Dynasty,

380
00:23:46,971 --> 00:23:50,632
on turtle shells and animal bones.

381
00:23:50,632 --> 00:23:53,844
Nowadays, this is called "oracle bone script"-

382
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:58,756
Are we here because I have a thing for bones?

383
00:23:58,756 --> 00:24:03,110
My apologies. I couldn't think of any other way

384
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:06,182
of covering both our interests...

385
00:24:06,182 --> 00:24:09,177
You must be bored, yes?

386
00:24:09,177 --> 00:24:12,397
Truth be told, the appeal is lost on me.

387
00:24:12,397 --> 00:24:14,059
Still, I'm glad we're here.

388
00:24:14,059 --> 00:24:16,271
- Is that so?
- Yes.

389
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:21,639
Is that what I think it is?

390
00:24:21,639 --> 00:24:25,709
What a wonder!

391
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:42,292
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

392
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:49,233
It feels so nice out here.

393
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:52,958
A picnic was definitely the right choice.

394
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:55,806
Are you sure?

395
00:24:55,806 --> 00:24:58,498
Of course! This is what I wanted from today.

396
00:24:58,498 --> 00:25:00,650
- "This"?
- Yup.

397
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:04,649
Dinner will be more proper then.

398
00:25:04,649 --> 00:25:06,917
Don't force yourself.

399
00:25:06,917 --> 00:25:10,821
Let's see how we feel in the moment, okay?

400
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,438
Oh, it's an ant.

401
00:25:16,438 --> 00:25:18,830
These ants are all female.

402
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:21,363
- No way, really?
- Really.

403
00:25:24,087 --> 00:25:27,574
Can you guess their age?

404
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,230
An ant's age? Impossible.

405
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:33,911
Well, they're all grannies.

406
00:25:33,911 --> 00:25:35,482
How can you tell?

407
00:25:35,482 --> 00:25:37,182
If you look carefully,

408
00:25:37,182 --> 00:25:41,075
you'll see their stomachs are striped.

409
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,826
You're lying.

410
00:25:44,826 --> 00:25:46,461
I am.

411
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:50,493
Jeez, seriously?

412
00:25:50,493 --> 00:25:54,999
Since it's dangerous outside, young ants stay underground

413
00:25:54,999 --> 00:25:58,293
to preserve their lifespan, while the elders work outside.

414
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:02,329
What was that about "no passions"?

415
00:26:02,329 --> 00:26:04,800
You seem to love animals.

416
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,789
That's because Nijiro loves the zoo, so we go often.

417
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:14,485
I learn the fun facts while we're there.

418
00:26:14,485 --> 00:26:18,188
Not like it's useful in any way though.

419
00:26:18,188 --> 00:26:20,223
Still, it's a fun listen.

420
00:26:20,223 --> 00:26:23,214
You're not boring at all.

421
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:30,224
That must've been a bore for you.

422
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:35,506
Yes, it was. However, I had more fun than expected.

423
00:26:35,506 --> 00:26:39,243
How so? Did you like turtle shell? The cow bone?

424
00:26:39,243 --> 00:26:42,345
- Well -
- Or perhaps the boar?

425
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:46,250
No, I enjoyed watching you at the exhibit,

426
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:49,152
- very much so.
- Me?

427
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:53,414
Yes, I enjoy spending time with you.

428
00:26:53,414 --> 00:26:58,250
But I never enjoy myself with prospective marriage partners...

429
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:00,564
I wonder why?

430
00:27:00,564 --> 00:27:04,423
That's because I'm not a target of interest. There's room to relax.

431
00:27:04,423 --> 00:27:06,804
No, that's not true.

432
00:27:06,804 --> 00:27:08,204
Pardon?

433
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:13,610
Sorry, no, I didn't mean it that way.

434
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:19,183
Goodness... I'm hopeless, even past forty.

435
00:27:19,183 --> 00:27:23,490
Although I've had my fair share of romance,

436
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:27,454
marriage makes it all the more confusing.

437
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:33,099
How did you and your wife decide to get married?

438
00:27:33,099 --> 00:27:37,862
Our marriage was anything but normal...

439
00:27:37,862 --> 00:27:40,784
Anyhow, my story is most certainly a bad example.

440
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:48,222
I wonder if there's some trick to marriage out there.

441
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:54,571
Did you know? "Trick" was originally written with the character for "bone".

442
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:57,137
Makes sense.

443
00:27:57,137 --> 00:27:59,011
Though we're structured the same,

444
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:01,959
our bones are all different shapes, right?

445
00:28:01,959 --> 00:28:03,487
Yes, indeed.

446
00:28:03,487 --> 00:28:08,659
While I don't know the trick to marriage and human relations,

447
00:28:08,659 --> 00:28:12,415
I know the trick to handling myself.

448
00:28:12,415 --> 00:28:14,324
Yourself...

449
00:28:14,324 --> 00:28:17,841
Since I must humor myself for life,

450
00:28:17,841 --> 00:28:22,579
I wish to remain true to who I am.

451
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:26,005
Remain true to yourself...

452
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,144
Yes, you're entirely right.

453
00:28:31,144 --> 00:28:34,881
It's best to avoid what makes one unhappy.

454
00:28:34,881 --> 00:28:39,711
But the result of that is being taken to a calligraphy exhibit...

455
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:48,211
Huh? My chest...

456
00:28:48,211 --> 00:28:49,966
Is something the matter?

457
00:28:49,966 --> 00:28:53,150
- No, I'm fine.
- Hinata-san!

458
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:10,481
Taking a moment to breathe sure feels good.

459
00:29:10,481 --> 00:29:12,820
Who knows? Maybe I do like yoga.

460
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:16,954
Sorry, an amateur's getting ahead of himself.

461
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:23,661
I see just how you come to appreciate lots of things.

462
00:29:23,661 --> 00:29:25,061
Huh?

463
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:29,586
You're much better suited for yoga than me.

464
00:29:29,586 --> 00:29:32,271
What? Of course, I'm not.

465
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:36,440
You are. Yoga is all about enjoying the moment.

466
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:45,149
To me, buses were always just a mode of transportation.

467
00:29:45,149 --> 00:29:46,835
Never anything more.

468
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:50,121
But you thought otherwise.

469
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:55,530
<i>I thought it'd be nice to just hop on the first bus wherever.</i>

470
00:30:00,234 --> 00:30:04,068
Ever since I was young,

471
00:30:04,068 --> 00:30:08,239
I always worked towards set goals.

472
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:13,361
In exchange, I couldn't do anything else.

473
00:30:13,361 --> 00:30:16,196
As proof, my room's a mess.

474
00:30:16,196 --> 00:30:19,313
How to put this...

475
00:30:19,313 --> 00:30:24,307
I think my whole life has revolved around "goals."

476
00:30:24,307 --> 00:30:28,091
Even now, I can only focus on my startup.

477
00:30:28,091 --> 00:30:30,318
But that's respectable.

478
00:30:39,563 --> 00:30:43,040
When I ride a bus,

479
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:46,594
I either sleep, check my phone,

480
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:51,355
study business ,or anything else feels wasteful.

481
00:30:53,718 --> 00:30:56,053
That's real admirable.

482
00:31:00,391 --> 00:31:04,470
On the other hand, you enjoy the ride.

483
00:31:05,897 --> 00:31:08,720
I never even considered simply "enjoying" the moment.

484
00:31:10,576 --> 00:31:14,405
It's all thanks to Nijiro's vehicle phase.

485
00:31:14,405 --> 00:31:17,178
We use to tour buses all the time.

486
00:31:19,014 --> 00:31:23,080
Being a dad sounds fun.

487
00:31:38,362 --> 00:31:40,307
Seita-san...

488
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:48,509
I'm glad I met the current version of you.

489
00:31:52,412 --> 00:31:57,550
I love the way you are

490
00:31:58,549 --> 00:32:00,674
with Nijiro-kun in your life.

491
00:33:31,908 --> 00:33:34,001
Did I wake you?

492
00:34:10,184 --> 00:34:12,283
Oh, s-sorry.

493
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:13,794
<i>[Anna]</i>

494
00:34:15,410 --> 00:34:17,123
One moment.

495
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:21,454
Hello? What's up?

496
00:34:21,454 --> 00:34:22,892
Huh?

497
00:34:25,385 --> 00:34:26,969
Nothing we can do about that.

498
00:34:26,969 --> 00:34:29,923
All right, I'm on my way.

499
00:34:29,923 --> 00:34:31,568
See you.

500
00:34:32,406 --> 00:34:35,740
Sorry. Nijiro was with his mom today,

501
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,752
but work called her in.

502
00:34:37,752 --> 00:34:40,557
I have to get him, and head home for the day.

503
00:34:40,557 --> 00:34:41,780
I'm so sorry, really.

504
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:45,390
No worries. Prioritize Nijiro-kun, remember?

505
00:34:46,453 --> 00:34:48,705
I'll at least help clean.

506
00:34:48,705 --> 00:34:50,481
- I got that.
- Thank you.

507
00:35:00,622 --> 00:35:02,262
Actuall...

508
00:35:05,539 --> 00:35:08,363
- Sorry for the wait.
- Likewise. A client's in trouble.

509
00:35:08,363 --> 00:35:10,940
- No worries.
- Gosh, there's the call.

510
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:13,847
- Sorry, Niji. See you around.
- Bye!

511
00:35:13,847 --> 00:35:16,542
- See you.
- Hello?

512
00:35:17,338 --> 00:35:19,775
- What did you two do today?
- Watch a movie.

513
00:35:19,775 --> 00:35:21,567
Cool.

514
00:35:25,138 --> 00:35:27,450
W-Who's texting me?

515
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:30,449
O-Oh, it's Kyoka-san!

516
00:35:31,493 --> 00:35:37,098
What? She says she's nearby! How timely!

517
00:35:37,871 --> 00:35:39,761
Kyoka-chan!

518
00:35:39,761 --> 00:35:42,313
Nijiro-kun!

519
00:35:44,566 --> 00:35:47,335
- Good day today?
- Yup.

520
00:35:48,703 --> 00:35:52,139
Since we're all here, shall we grab dinner somewhere?

521
00:35:52,139 --> 00:35:54,109
Great idea!

522
00:35:54,109 --> 00:35:56,511
Let's eat whatever Nijiro-kun wants tonight.

523
00:35:56,511 --> 00:35:58,237
What will it be, Nijiro?

524
00:35:58,237 --> 00:36:01,745
- My choice? Yay! Then curry!
- Aside from curry.

525
00:36:01,745 --> 00:36:04,205
But you said my choice...

526
00:36:04,205 --> 00:36:06,992
Curry sounds great! What sort of curry?

527
00:36:06,992 --> 00:36:08,790
Curry at home.

528
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:10,148
Huh?

529
00:36:10,148 --> 00:36:12,812
L-Let's eat outdoors tonight, okay?

530
00:36:12,812 --> 00:36:14,696
I don't get a choice at all.

531
00:36:14,696 --> 00:36:18,033
You had my curry recently at camp, remember?

532
00:36:18,033 --> 00:36:20,669
Then I want to try Kyoka-chan's recipe.

533
00:36:20,669 --> 00:36:24,030
What sorta curry do you make?

534
00:36:24,871 --> 00:36:26,782
I'm curious too.

535
00:36:26,782 --> 00:36:28,901
Really?

536
00:36:30,157 --> 00:36:33,115
Listen, my curry is just plain ole' curry, okay?

537
00:36:33,115 --> 00:36:35,163
I'm no cook.

538
00:36:35,163 --> 00:36:39,774
That's okay! It's hard to mess up curry.

539
00:36:39,774 --> 00:36:42,627
- Right?
- The pressure's on...

540
00:36:42,627 --> 00:36:45,447
A-Actually, I'd like to go on ahead

541
00:36:45,447 --> 00:36:49,107
and clean up a bit. Could you come with Nijiro, slowly?

542
00:36:49,107 --> 00:36:51,310
Sure thing.

543
00:36:54,073 --> 00:36:56,014
Wait, my dry-cleaning!

544
00:36:56,014 --> 00:36:59,266
I completely forgot they have my clothes for the wedding tomorrow...

545
00:36:59,266 --> 00:37:00,975
What should I do...

546
00:37:00,975 --> 00:37:03,898
If you'd like, I can go get it

547
00:37:03,898 --> 00:37:06,085
while you clean up.

548
00:37:06,085 --> 00:37:07,160
But...

549
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,743
I'm hungry.

550
00:37:09,743 --> 00:37:11,373
I don't mind.

551
00:37:11,373 --> 00:37:13,239
Then thank you.

552
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:22,503
Let's see here...

553
00:37:24,144 --> 00:37:25,476
Good evening.

554
00:37:25,476 --> 00:37:27,245
I'd like to pick up this order.

555
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:28,961
For Higashimura-sama, yes?

556
00:37:28,961 --> 00:37:31,325
One moment.

557
00:37:31,325 --> 00:37:32,981
Nijiro?

558
00:37:32,981 --> 00:37:35,620
Miki-chan's mom!

559
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:38,865
Nice to meet you! You must be Nijiro-kun's mother.

560
00:37:38,865 --> 00:37:39,841
Oh, I'm...

561
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:43,475
She's not my mom. She's dad's friend.

562
00:37:43,475 --> 00:37:44,519
Is that so?

563
00:37:44,519 --> 00:37:46,514
Mom's at work right now.

564
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:49,291
Tomorrow's my day with mom.

565
00:37:49,291 --> 00:37:51,569
Day with...

566
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:54,341
Oh, I see.

567
00:37:54,341 --> 00:37:56,161
You're so mature, Nijiro-kun.

568
00:37:56,161 --> 00:37:58,240
No, I'm not.

569
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,647
Actually, mom lives in the same apartment!

570
00:38:00,647 --> 00:38:02,647
The same apartment?

571
00:38:02,647 --> 00:38:03,773
Yup!

572
00:38:03,773 --> 00:38:07,542
That's... unusual! Because... right?

573
00:38:07,542 --> 00:38:11,079
They must be a... progressive family?

574
00:38:11,079 --> 00:38:14,182
Yes! Progressive indeed.

575
00:38:14,182 --> 00:38:16,884
What's progressive?

576
00:38:18,742 --> 00:38:21,208
Nijiro-kun, you're a lucky boy.

577
00:38:21,208 --> 00:38:24,159
Not everyone gets two homes! I'm jealous.

578
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:26,371
Your mom's place has a great view, right?

579
00:38:26,371 --> 00:38:29,329
Yup! You can even see Mt. Fuji!

580
00:38:29,329 --> 00:38:31,833
Cool! Where'd she take you today?

581
00:38:31,833 --> 00:38:33,311
The movies.

582
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:38,385
I don't go with dad, cause he always falls asleep.

583
00:38:38,385 --> 00:38:41,494
But I heard he likes zoos.

584
00:38:41,494 --> 00:38:45,781
Sounds like you get double the fun.

585
00:38:45,781 --> 00:38:47,381
Yup!

586
00:38:49,794 --> 00:38:51,886
Hello, is my formal wear ready?

587
00:38:51,886 --> 00:38:53,967
Ah, one moment.

588
00:38:53,967 --> 00:38:56,469
- Good evening.
- Hello.

589
00:38:58,461 --> 00:39:00,023
Thank you.

590
00:39:00,023 --> 00:39:02,731
This? It's nothing.

591
00:39:06,134 --> 00:39:08,736
<i>Bon appetit!</i>

592
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,321
Yum!

593
00:39:14,321 --> 00:39:16,503
Really?

594
00:39:17,891 --> 00:39:21,398
- Dad, now you can eat your carrots too.
- True.

595
00:39:21,398 --> 00:39:22,998
I'm glad you like it.

596
00:39:22,998 --> 00:39:26,521
Mom always said shredding the carrots

597
00:39:26,521 --> 00:39:28,261
saved time.

598
00:39:28,261 --> 00:39:30,358
So this is a Sawada family recipe?

599
00:39:30,358 --> 00:39:32,058
Yup.

600
00:39:32,058 --> 00:39:34,930
Next time, let's shred our carrots too.

601
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:36,577
Niji, you've got-

602
00:39:36,577 --> 00:39:39,079
You have curry on your cheek.

603
00:39:40,355 --> 00:39:42,266
There, all wiped up.

604
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:13,664
Look over here you two.

605
00:40:13,664 --> 00:40:16,418
And cheese!

606
00:40:16,418 --> 00:40:18,366
<i>Thanks for the delicious curry.</i>

607
00:40:18,366 --> 00:40:20,760
Thank you.

608
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,666
Say cheese!

609
00:40:22,666 --> 00:40:24,973
<i>Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!</i>

610
00:40:24,973 --> 00:40:27,373
Yes!

611
00:40:31,798 --> 00:40:34,189
- Want a bite of this strawberry too?
- Lucky you, Niji.

612
00:40:34,189 --> 00:40:36,425
Then I'll take a picture.

613
00:40:36,425 --> 00:40:40,266
- Say cheese!
- Strawberry!

614
00:40:49,444 --> 00:40:51,544
Thank you.

615
00:40:51,544 --> 00:40:55,074
- I see Nijiro-kun's a fast sleeper.
- Yeah, it's always so sudden.

616
00:40:55,074 --> 00:40:57,320
Like father like son.

617
00:41:03,384 --> 00:41:07,555
So this is what daily life is like at your place.

618
00:41:10,711 --> 00:41:13,405
A day never repeats itself.

619
00:41:13,941 --> 00:41:15,932
Why?

620
00:41:16,826 --> 00:41:22,380
Nijiro-kun's a growing boy. He'll be different come tomorrow.

621
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:26,174
In fact, so will we. Aging stops for no one.

622
00:41:27,141 --> 00:41:31,312
That's why I want to remember every little detail

623
00:41:31,312 --> 00:41:34,315
each day brings.

624
00:41:34,315 --> 00:41:37,624
<i>Give me the grand tour, okay?</i>

625
00:41:39,063 --> 00:41:41,735
<i>Nice weather today, isn't it?</i>

626
00:41:41,735 --> 00:41:45,290
<i>Taking a moment to breath sure feels good.</i>

627
00:41:45,905 --> 00:41:50,900
<i>Seita-san, I'm glad I met the current version of you.</i>

628
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:55,649
<i>I love the way you are</i>

629
00:41:55,649 --> 00:41:57,802
<i>with Nijiro-kun in your life.</i>

630
00:42:04,124 --> 00:42:07,124
Sorry. I'm speaking nonsense, aren't I?

631
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:13,460
♫ <i>No matter how far away and small the corner may be</i> ♫

632
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:20,210
♫ <i>I bring it into focus</i> ♫

633
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:27,170
♫ <i>Even your slovenly swaying back</i> ♫

634
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:28,814
May I?

635
00:42:29,783 --> 00:42:33,746
We still haven't taken one together.

636
00:42:44,619 --> 00:42:48,088
- Here I go.
- Okay.

637
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:55,360
♫ <i>I want you alone to reflect yourself</i> ♫

638
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:58,584
- I'll see you out and downstairs-
- No, it's okay.

639
00:42:58,584 --> 00:43:00,584
I'll be fine.

640
00:43:00,584 --> 00:43:02,773
Then I'll see you later.

641
00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:05,483
See you.

642
00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:12,200
♫ <i>You're in the center of my eyes</i> ♫

643
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:19,990
♫ <i>Who is being reflected?</i> ♫

644
00:43:19,990 --> 00:43:23,958
Holy crap... This is...

645
00:43:26,027 --> 00:43:28,000
sort of nice.

646
00:43:29,731 --> 00:43:32,433
Marriage, huh?

647
00:43:34,781 --> 00:43:37,006
No, stop it.

648
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:47,780
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by

650
00:43:52,099 --> 00:43:53,699
Huh?

651
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:57,534
God, I'm tired.

652
00:43:58,269 --> 00:44:00,377
Kyoka-san!

653
00:44:00,377 --> 00:44:03,544
Phew, I made it.

654
00:44:03,544 --> 00:44:05,181
- Here. Your phone.
- Oh!

655
00:44:05,181 --> 00:44:08,748
My phone! Sorry about that.

656
00:44:08,748 --> 00:44:10,938
He brought her home?

657
00:44:11,932 --> 00:44:13,947
What about Nijiro?

658
00:44:13,947 --> 00:44:16,954
- I'm almost out.
- No, I insist.

659
00:44:23,864 --> 00:44:25,357
<i>Yes, I am Sawada Kyoka.</i>

660
00:44:25,357 --> 00:44:26,610
<i>You know, the yoga breathing?</i>

661
00:44:26,610 --> 00:44:29,965
<i>The yoga instructor is now your girlfriend?</i>

662
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:34,862
<i>My partner understands that marriage is not my priority.</i>

663
00:44:36,664 --> 00:44:42,844
This might be...

664
00:44:42,844 --> 00:44:45,036
breaking the rules.

I can't keep quiet

677
00:45:52,519 --> 00:45:56,156
about this forever...

678
00:46:02,329 --> 00:46:06,187
Step in place, between your hands.

679
00:46:06,187 --> 00:46:08,857

683
00:46:19,677 --> 00:46:24,551
Breathe in, lift your arms...

684
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:29,810
and exhale, placing them in front of your chest.

685
00:46:32,587 --> 00:46:36,387
Let us relish this moment of peace.

686
