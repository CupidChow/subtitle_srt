2
00:00:07,407 --> 00:00:08,575
I'm home.

3
00:00:08,575 --> 00:00:11,512
Welcome back. You're back late today.

4
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:15,415
I had to cover the last class today.

5
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:17,218
Have you had dinner?

6
00:00:19,746 --> 00:00:22,990
It's so late already. I'll just have some yogurt.

7
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:24,824
I suppose.

8
00:00:24,824 --> 00:00:28,829
But if you made me something, I'll have a bit of it now.

9
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:34,040
It's fine. I'll whip it up into soup tomorrow morning for you.

10
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:37,146
I'm so grateful!

11
00:00:37,146 --> 00:00:40,450
You worked hard today, didn't you?

12
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:44,570
Hayate, you're so amazing.

13
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:46,317
In what way?

14
00:00:51,318 --> 00:00:55,468
I bet you've made quite a few girls cry.

15
00:00:55,468 --> 00:00:57,168
This is different.

16
00:00:57,168 --> 00:00:59,560
Then answer it.

17
00:01:00,751 --> 00:01:03,040
Oh, you're worried about who it is?

18
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:08,520
I'm not interested in dishonest guys that ignore calls every night.

19
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,643
I'm exhausted.

20
00:01:20,387 --> 00:01:23,182
I worked hard today, huh?

21
00:01:23,182 --> 00:01:25,118
<i>I can't work hard!</i>

22
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:28,621
<i>If working hard means ending up like you, I don't want to work hard!</i>

23
00:01:40,901 --> 00:01:42,669
- I'm off.
- Okay.

24
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:44,104
Where's my phone?

25
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:47,307
There you go again!

26
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:50,043
Didn't you have your phone when you were putting dishes in the sink?

27
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:51,778
Did I?

28
00:01:54,747 --> 00:01:56,617
I put the milk back with it!

29
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:58,357
Go on, you'll be late.

30
00:01:58,357 --> 00:02:00,068
- I'm off!
- I'm heading out.

31
00:02:00,068 --> 00:02:01,754
See you later.

32
00:02:01,754 --> 00:02:04,409
My phone's so cold!

33
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:10,340
They look surprisingly good together.

34
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,510
Don't they?

35
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:14,334
Do you want dinner tonight?

36
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:18,472
No thanks. I have an entrepreneurship seminar tonight, so I'll be late.

37
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,908
- An entrepreneurship seminar?
- Yeah.

38
00:02:20,908 --> 00:02:25,190
I want to have my own studio someday, so I'm studying up.

39
00:02:25,995 --> 00:02:28,526
What kind of people go to an entrepreneurship seminar?

40
00:02:28,526 --> 00:02:30,417
All kinds.

41
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:33,887
Seita attends them too. That's how I met him.

42
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:38,346
Sounds like a better place to meet people than a marriage party.

43
00:02:38,346 --> 00:02:42,863
I told you, I don't have time to think about marriage.

44
00:02:42,863 --> 00:02:44,164
Why not?

45
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,998
Because it's not easy having a studio!

46
00:02:46,998 --> 00:02:50,928
Finding a place, raising money, getting customers...

47
00:02:50,928 --> 00:02:55,709
If I were married, I'd never be able to think about my in-laws.

48
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:59,228
Then why don't you marry someone who can help you?

49
00:02:59,228 --> 00:03:01,512
There's hardly any men like that.

50
00:03:01,512 --> 00:03:02,991
They exist right here!

51
00:03:02,991 --> 00:03:06,213
I bet I could do housework and childcare better than you.

52
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,288
You're absolutely right about that.

53
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:10,390
Come on!

54
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:14,561
Anyway, my main priority right now is having my own studio.

55
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:17,201
You really do work hard, Kyoka.

56
00:03:17,201 --> 00:03:19,299
I don't know about that...

57
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:21,350
Oh, the bus is here.

58
00:03:23,707 --> 00:03:32,414
<i>[Is Love Sustainable?]</i>
<i>[Episode 4]</i>

59
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,982
Good morning.

60
00:03:34,982 --> 00:03:39,474
I think it's a good thing that you encourage your students.

61
00:03:39,474 --> 00:03:41,498
But...

62
00:03:41,498 --> 00:03:44,553
Try not to use phrases like, "Work hard," or "You can do it,"

63
00:03:44,553 --> 00:03:47,995
since this can put pressure on the student.

64
00:03:47,995 --> 00:03:49,196
I'm sorry.

65
00:03:49,196 --> 00:03:53,166
But that student was losing motivation. I wanted them to come to the next lesson.

66
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:56,774
Then don't say, "Work hard."

67
00:03:56,774 --> 00:03:58,332
Say, "You've worked so hard."

68
00:03:58,332 --> 00:04:01,484
Students are here because they want recognition and praise.

69
00:04:01,484 --> 00:04:06,081
It's our job to tell when what they want to hear and make them feel good.

70
00:04:06,081 --> 00:04:08,114
Saying encouraging words to our students

71
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:09,883
is one of the services we provide.

72
00:04:09,883 --> 00:04:11,251
A service...

73
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,889
Social media is also important for attracting customers.

74
00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:15,388
Learn from Ms. Mikako's example.

75
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:17,524
Hey! Look at this!

76
00:04:17,524 --> 00:04:19,344
Okay, okay.

77
00:04:19,344 --> 00:04:23,229
A man who can cook well is so sweet!

78
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:25,687
That's Hayate's...

79
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:28,368
Huh? What's that?

80
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:30,346
Where have I seen that bottle before?

81
00:04:30,346 --> 00:04:32,801
Isn't that an older-sister type of bottle?

82
00:04:32,801 --> 00:04:36,339
- He has an older sister?
- I mean, in a general sense.

83
00:04:36,339 --> 00:04:37,911
- I see!
- Kyoka Sensei?

84
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:40,606
- A moment.
- Sure.

85
00:04:41,674 --> 00:04:43,951
Me?

86
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:47,054
Yes. The three studios in western Tokyo...

87
00:04:47,054 --> 00:04:49,857
I'd like you to manage them.

88
00:04:49,857 --> 00:04:51,336
Oh...

89
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:54,094
Is there a problem?

90
00:04:54,094 --> 00:04:58,820
No. It's just, we're expanding and getting more students.

91
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:02,135
I feel like I haven't been able to face each and every one of them.

92
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,070
You mean you can't do it?

93
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,439
No, I'm very grateful.

94
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:10,242
Could I have some time to consider it?

95
00:05:10,242 --> 00:05:13,607
Sure. Think it over carefully.

96
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:20,854
Being a manager might be hard at first.

97
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:25,048
But it'll be easier work, even when your personal life gets busier in the future.

98
00:05:25,048 --> 00:05:30,360
Don't you think about getting married and having kids?

99
00:05:31,225 --> 00:05:34,241
Well, actually, the pain in my shoulder is already-

100
00:05:34,241 --> 00:05:35,678
Sawada-san.

101
00:05:35,678 --> 00:05:37,743
Yes?

102
00:05:37,743 --> 00:05:39,692
I...

103
00:05:41,659 --> 00:05:44,378
adore you.

104
00:05:44,378 --> 00:05:45,794
What?

105
00:05:46,606 --> 00:05:48,988
Your...

106
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:54,053
skeleton.

107
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:56,222
- My skeleton?
- Yes.

108
00:05:56,222 --> 00:06:00,960
This part here, your acromion...

109
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,873
It's so thin and smooth.

110
00:06:04,873 --> 00:06:07,775
It's so elegant.

111
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:11,495
Here?

112
00:06:11,495 --> 00:06:13,169
Yes.

113
00:06:15,129 --> 00:06:17,317
Right here.

114
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:22,746
- Excuse me.
- It's okay.

115
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:27,787
I apologize about the other day.

116
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:29,756
No, no...

117
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:33,526
<i>I'm pathetic...</i>

118
00:06:38,265 --> 00:06:43,272
I just thought that I could talk to you about anything.

119
00:06:46,192 --> 00:06:49,395
I have a bone fetish.

120
00:06:49,395 --> 00:06:51,044
B-Bone fetish?

121
00:06:51,044 --> 00:06:53,546
I've loved the shape of bones since I was little.

122
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:57,217
They're so beautiful. Before I knew it, I became an orthopedic surgeon.

123
00:06:57,217 --> 00:06:59,286
What do you mean by "bone fetish"?

124
00:06:59,286 --> 00:07:02,499
My! You'd ask something like that?

125
00:07:02,499 --> 00:07:05,044
I've never met a man like you before.

126
00:07:05,044 --> 00:07:07,761
Guys usually run away because it's so weird.

127
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:11,365
I'm weird too. I'm interested in the phrase "bone fetish."

128
00:07:11,365 --> 00:07:14,167
- Really?
- I've loved words since I was a child.

129
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:16,950
I became a lexicographer.

130
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,882
We're quite similar, aren't we?

131
00:07:18,882 --> 00:07:21,025
We are!

132
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:25,646
When I thought about it, with the person I met the other day,

133
00:07:25,646 --> 00:07:30,017
There wasn't a single "kyun."

134
00:07:30,017 --> 00:07:31,799
"Kyun"?

135
00:07:31,799 --> 00:07:33,324
Yes.

136
00:07:33,324 --> 00:07:35,275
"Kyun."

137
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:45,070
Well, your treatment is done for today.

138
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:47,610
Please take care of yourself.

139
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:52,529
Thank you very much.

140
00:07:55,158 --> 00:07:56,577
Also...

141
00:07:56,577 --> 00:08:02,310
if you'd like, could we sometimes go on walks together?

142
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:10,800
For your back health, and to discuss my marriage hunting.

143
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:14,486
Sure!

144
00:08:14,486 --> 00:08:21,291
Last time, I spoke about the importance of interviewing senior entrepreneurs as role models.

145
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:23,786
But what's even more important and difficult

146
00:08:23,786 --> 00:08:27,853
is interviewing yourself through journaling.

147
00:08:27,853 --> 00:08:32,278
Kyoka-san, journaling is also referred to as "writing meditation", right?

148
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:35,114
That's right. That mindset also exists in yoga.

149
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:38,552
Start writing down words that come to you in a notebook.

150
00:08:38,552 --> 00:08:42,555
We'll start journaling for the next three minutes.

151
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:45,959
The theme will be "things that are important to me."

152
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:49,444
All right? Begin.

153
00:08:49,444 --> 00:08:52,095
<i>Things that are important to me...</i>

154
00:08:52,843 --> 00:08:54,584
<i>Yoga.</i>

155
00:08:56,403 --> 00:08:58,449
<i>Independence.</i>

156
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:02,845
<i>My own studio.</i>

157
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,928
<i>Funding.</i>

158
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:09,344
<i>Time.</i>

159
00:09:10,702 --> 00:09:12,735
<i>Attracting customers.</i>

160
00:09:13,693 --> 00:09:15,610
<i>Friends.</i>

161
00:09:16,341 --> 00:09:18,183
<i>Beer.</i>

162
00:09:20,183 --> 00:09:22,228
<i>An island in the south...</i>

163
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,112
<i>Like Hawaii.</i>

164
00:09:25,465 --> 00:09:27,381
<i>Chocolate.</i>

165
00:09:27,381 --> 00:09:29,627
<i>Sweets.</i>

166
00:09:30,155 --> 00:09:32,374
<i>Okonomiyaki.</i>

167
00:09:34,479 --> 00:09:36,605
<i>Dad...</i>

168
00:09:38,576 --> 00:09:41,528
<i>Freedom from him, that is.</i>

169
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:49,120
<i>[Freedom from Father]</i>

170
00:09:55,229 --> 00:09:57,721
There's one more seminar left.

171
00:09:57,721 --> 00:09:58,841
That's right.

172
00:09:58,841 --> 00:10:03,567
Do you want to go somewhere we can relax?

173
00:10:03,567 --> 00:10:04,838
The studio today was a little-

174
00:10:04,838 --> 00:10:07,841
Wouldn't it be better to go straight home?

175
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:08,675
What?

176
00:10:08,675 --> 00:10:11,512
I mean, I'm sure dinner is waiting for you.

177
00:10:11,512 --> 00:10:14,614
- Not really-
- That reminds me.

178
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:19,586
Would you be able to meet with a female entrepreneur role model the day after tomorrow?

179
00:10:19,586 --> 00:10:22,834
Yes. Thank you.

180
00:10:22,834 --> 00:10:25,224
I'll see you the day after tomorrow, then.

181
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:26,797
Right.

182
00:10:46,605 --> 00:10:48,707
- Welcome home!
- Hey Dad!

183
00:10:48,707 --> 00:10:51,549
- Bye, Mom.
- Have a good night!

184
00:10:51,549 --> 00:10:53,529
Go right to bed.

185
00:10:55,289 --> 00:10:57,847
You got home early today.

186
00:10:57,847 --> 00:10:59,884
Have a fight with your girlfriend?

187
00:10:59,884 --> 00:11:01,807
I told you, I don't have a girlfriend.

188
00:11:01,807 --> 00:11:04,731
But you've been late every week on the same day.

189
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:07,569
I've just been going to a seminar.

190
00:11:07,569 --> 00:11:09,901
You've really got no guts.

191
00:11:09,901 --> 00:11:11,682
Are you okay with that?

192
00:11:11,682 --> 00:11:14,373
If she doesn't want me, there's nothing I can do.

193
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:17,305
"She"? Oh? What's this?

194
00:11:19,004 --> 00:11:20,602
What is it?

195
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:22,738
Well...

196
00:11:23,439 --> 00:11:25,158
the day after tomorrow.

197
00:11:25,158 --> 00:11:27,521
Could you take care of Nijiro until dinner?

198
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:31,440
I have to meet up with someone. For work.

199
00:11:32,057 --> 00:11:34,126
He can spend the night, you know.

200
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:37,260
Good luck! With "work."

201
00:11:46,773 --> 00:11:48,460
Kyoka Sensei!

202
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:50,738
Always looking down like that is going to age you.

203
00:11:50,738 --> 00:11:52,291
Hayate.

204
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:54,076
Welcome home. You're back early.

205
00:11:54,076 --> 00:11:55,774
Yeah.

206
00:11:55,774 --> 00:11:57,721
Want some dinner?

207
00:11:58,469 --> 00:12:00,142
Sure.

208
00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:07,394
That smells so good! What is it?

209
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:10,101
I added a little Italian dressing.

210
00:12:11,472 --> 00:12:13,399
Chikuwa?

211
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:16,935
Fish? And radish?

212
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:22,140
Let's use the Chinese plate, then.

213
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,506
"Kyun"?

214
00:12:27,506 --> 00:12:29,750
That's a "kyun"!

215
00:12:31,121 --> 00:12:32,419
Dad, are you eating dinner too?

216
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:34,787
No, no! I don't mean to intrude!

217
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:38,704
It's great, but as your father, you know...

218
00:12:38,704 --> 00:12:40,126
What?

219
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:42,547
I'm going to practice walking to the park.

220
00:12:42,547 --> 00:12:44,814
Practice walking?

221
00:12:45,966 --> 00:12:49,918
When he's concentrating on his manuscript, he's always like this.

222
00:12:49,918 --> 00:12:52,468
Thank you for the food!

223
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:04,319
No way! How is this so delicious?

224
00:13:04,319 --> 00:13:08,120
Food someone else makes for you really is amazing!

225
00:13:09,523 --> 00:13:12,155
Did something happen today?

226
00:13:12,155 --> 00:13:14,727
Lots of stuff.

227
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:16,896
You can't talk to me about it.

228
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:19,094
It's not like that.

229
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:24,045
I'm hesitating about going independent.

230
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:28,343
Did something happen at the seminar?

231
00:13:28,343 --> 00:13:30,090
No.

232
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:33,546
The President said she'd move me up

233
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:35,934
to manage studios.

234
00:13:35,934 --> 00:13:37,818
What? That's amazing!

235
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:39,686
Even though it won't be my studio,

236
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:43,601
I might be able to make it like my own.

237
00:13:43,601 --> 00:13:48,127
If I stay at the company, I could have more personal time.

238
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:52,330
Oh! Are you finally starting to think about marrying me?

239
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:55,344
Huh? What are you going on about?

240
00:13:56,206 --> 00:13:58,538
It's just...

241
00:13:58,538 --> 00:14:01,507
I'm just scared of going independent.

242
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:06,968
That's not good, right? I have to work hard.

243
00:14:10,398 --> 00:14:13,022
You don't have to work that hard, you know.

244
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,120
If it's not what you want.

245
00:14:16,752 --> 00:14:19,545
I mean, you already work so hard.

246
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:25,494
You're nice, Hayate.

247
00:14:27,493 --> 00:14:31,237
I've only started thinking that way recently.

248
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:34,046
Why is that? Were you born that way?

249
00:14:34,046 --> 00:14:38,783
Do you ever get angry, frustrated, and think, "Work harder!"?

250
00:14:38,783 --> 00:14:41,015
I do, but...

251
00:14:44,082 --> 00:14:46,001
For me,

252
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:51,082
things were different with my parents.

253
00:14:52,693 --> 00:14:54,647
Even though my parents fought,

254
00:14:54,647 --> 00:14:57,865
things would just get worse if I got angry too.

255
00:14:57,865 --> 00:15:00,655
It was best not to get involved.

256
00:15:01,856 --> 00:15:03,636
That's so mature.

257
00:15:10,124 --> 00:15:12,079
You should answer it.

258
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:16,052
If you ignore a girl's calls, she'll really hate you.

259
00:15:16,052 --> 00:15:19,322
Don't worry. This person will never be discouraged.

260
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:31,381
- Hey, Kyoka.
- Yeah?

261
00:15:34,068 --> 00:15:36,925
I'll have some fried rice, after all.

262
00:15:36,925 --> 00:15:39,926
There's none left for you now!

263
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:44,190
<i>[Sanseido Corporation]</i>

264
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:48,782
"Kyun."

265
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:51,951
No, "Kyun."

266
00:15:56,533 --> 00:15:59,259
Oh! "Kyun", right?

267
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:01,128
"Kyun".

268
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:04,442
A "kyun" from my pocket.

269
00:16:04,442 --> 00:16:06,988
That's what it means.

270
00:16:07,701 --> 00:16:13,772
"Kyun-kyun" and "kyun-to" are already listed as adverbs used to describe a heart fluttering at something lovely.

271
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:16,622
But "kyun" is used in a different way.

272
00:16:16,622 --> 00:16:18,379
Let's investigate this one carefully.

273
00:16:18,379 --> 00:16:21,181
Essentially, it's an expression of romance, right?

274
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:23,226
Like a heart-thumping, right?

275
00:16:23,226 --> 00:16:25,902
That would be a heart attack.

276
00:16:26,496 --> 00:16:30,790
"Doki-doki" is used to describe a heart fluttering in girls' manga.

277
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:34,327
From there, the expression changed to "tokkun-tokkun."

278
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:38,731
Recently, the expression seems to be "tunku-tunku."

279
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:40,009
"Tuku-tuku?"

280
00:16:40,009 --> 00:16:41,334
No.

281
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:43,003
"Tunku-tunku!"

282
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:45,605
"Tunku-tunku?"

283
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:51,110
It's been so long since I've felt such emotions, these visceral expressions are beyond me.

284
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:54,058
Why not go to a matchmaking service?

285
00:16:54,058 --> 00:16:55,481
Oh! No, no...

286
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:58,284
Well, a matchmaking service isn't really about love.

287
00:16:58,284 --> 00:17:00,598
It's about getting married, right?

288
00:17:00,598 --> 00:17:01,761
I see.

289
00:17:01,761 --> 00:17:05,530
In other words, love and marriage are different discussions?

290
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:11,028
After all, even if you know you're not one for marriage...

291
00:17:11,028 --> 00:17:15,610
<i>someone might unexpectedly make your heart go pitter-patter.</i>

292
00:17:17,404 --> 00:17:20,108
That's "kyun."

293
00:17:25,779 --> 00:17:27,900
I'm sorry for making you wait!

294
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:31,116
It's no trouble. You look different today.

295
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:33,752
I look weird, don't I?

296
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:35,555
Since this is about business,

297
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:38,625
I thought I should look presentable. I borrowed it from a friend.

298
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:41,671
No, you look lovely.

299
00:17:41,671 --> 00:17:44,470
Oh. Thank you.

300
00:17:45,517 --> 00:17:47,701
It's over there. Shall we get going?

301
00:17:47,701 --> 00:17:49,379
Sure!

302
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:56,302
Adachi-san was my first client when I started as a consultant.

303
00:17:56,302 --> 00:18:00,112
She ran a personal gym and was very successful.

304
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:02,915
- Okay.
- I checked yesterday...

305
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:06,952
I'm sorry. The "personal gym" concept seems to have changed...

306
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:08,901
A "couple gym"?

307
00:18:08,901 --> 00:18:13,137
"Couples gyms" have apparently gone viral.

308
00:18:13,137 --> 00:18:14,961
Higashimura-san!

309
00:18:14,961 --> 00:18:16,929
Adachi-san. Thank you so much for today.

310
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,072
Not at all!

311
00:18:18,072 --> 00:18:19,131
This is...

312
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:22,200
I'm Sawada. Thank you for making time for us in your busy-

313
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,936
It's so nice to meet you!

314
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,206
I'm so happy to meet you!

315
00:18:26,206 --> 00:18:29,441
Well, first things first... This way!

316
00:18:30,744 --> 00:18:32,782
What's this?

317
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:38,130
Oh? Here, here, here! Get a little closer together.

318
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:41,365
There you go! You make a heart!

319
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:45,950
Okay! Let's get started. This way, please.

320
00:18:48,369 --> 00:18:51,720
Okay! You'll be leaning on each others bodies.

321
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,727
First are stretches.

322
00:18:53,727 --> 00:18:57,219
Start stretching. Go ahead.

323
00:18:58,072 --> 00:19:00,217
Okay.

324
00:19:00,217 --> 00:19:02,092
That's right, hold hands.

325
00:19:02,092 --> 00:19:05,574
Good. Hold hands very tightly.

326
00:19:05,574 --> 00:19:07,998
Breathe together now. Okay!

327
00:19:07,998 --> 00:19:12,094
Now pull! Pull back.

328
00:19:12,094 --> 00:19:13,119
I'm sorry.

329
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:15,165
- I can't, I can't do it!
- Okay, okay, okay.

330
00:19:15,165 --> 00:19:17,401
A little more, stretch!

331
00:19:17,401 --> 00:19:20,738
Now raise your head, lift the corners of your mouth,

332
00:19:20,738 --> 00:19:23,062
and smile!

333
00:19:23,062 --> 00:19:25,698
Good, a little more!

334
00:19:25,698 --> 00:19:27,534
All right, next!

335
00:19:27,534 --> 00:19:31,738
Hold opposite hands.

336
00:19:31,738 --> 00:19:34,227
Make a heart!

337
00:19:34,227 --> 00:19:36,243
Squeeze!

338
00:19:36,243 --> 00:19:39,379
Seita, work hard now!

339
00:19:42,049 --> 00:19:44,118
You doing okay?

340
00:19:44,118 --> 00:19:46,954
Okay, one!

341
00:19:47,806 --> 00:19:49,400
Oh? What's wrong, Seita?

342
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,091
It's not going up. Work hard, Seita-san!

343
00:19:51,091 --> 00:19:53,509
And two!

344
00:19:54,214 --> 00:19:59,366
Seita-san!

345
00:20:02,436 --> 00:20:05,639
- What's wrong, Seita-san?
- Hold on!

346
00:20:05,639 --> 00:20:08,374
Now, we can't tell what our own bodies are doing.

347
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:13,813
Kyoka-san, please tell Seita-san what he's doing right and wrong.

348
00:20:13,813 --> 00:20:17,284
Okay. Raise your left shoulder.

349
00:20:17,284 --> 00:20:18,118
Okay.

350
00:20:18,118 --> 00:20:21,498
Don't arch your back. Flex your core.

351
00:20:21,498 --> 00:20:22,277
Okay.

352
00:20:22,277 --> 00:20:23,822
Work hard!

353
00:20:23,822 --> 00:20:26,277
Just two more times!

354
00:20:26,277 --> 00:20:27,838
Good job!

355
00:20:27,838 --> 00:20:30,174
One more time!

356
00:20:30,174 --> 00:20:32,765
You did it!

357
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:34,769
Amazing!

358
00:20:37,748 --> 00:20:39,127
That hurts.

359
00:20:39,127 --> 00:20:40,806
- I'm so worn out.
- It looks like it hurts!

360
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:43,309
Here I go!

361
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:45,556
"Kyun"! Do a "kyun"!

362
00:20:45,556 --> 00:20:48,327
- What's "kyun"?
- "Kyun"! This!

363
00:20:48,327 --> 00:20:51,446
Okay, "kyun"!

364
00:20:51,446 --> 00:20:53,497
Kyun, kyun, kyun!

365
00:20:53,497 --> 00:20:55,499
Okay. Thank you very much.

366
00:20:55,499 --> 00:20:57,093
- Sure.
- Thank you.

367
00:20:57,093 --> 00:20:58,645
How was it?

368
00:20:58,645 --> 00:21:00,259
It was really interesting.

369
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,827
It was very tiring, though.

370
00:21:03,463 --> 00:21:08,178
You know, I've seen many clients quit coming to the gym.

371
00:21:08,178 --> 00:21:12,149
But couples that come encourage each other and keep coming.

372
00:21:12,149 --> 00:21:15,526
It's hard for someone to work so hard all alone.

373
00:21:15,526 --> 00:21:18,225
That's why you targeted couples?

374
00:21:18,225 --> 00:21:21,682
But didn't you feel it when you held hands during training?

375
00:21:21,682 --> 00:21:25,390
Some things are communicated better through physical contact than words.

376
00:21:27,688 --> 00:21:31,540
And if they break up, they start coming to my normal personal gym.

377
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:35,478
For broken-hearted clients, I have a "get hot and get revenge" course.

378
00:21:35,478 --> 00:21:39,522
For clients getting married, I introduce them to my "bridal fitness" course.

379
00:21:39,522 --> 00:21:43,325
The important thing is how to sell the course with a story.

380
00:21:44,042 --> 00:21:46,083
I'm learning so much.

381
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:48,676
Sawada, why did you start yoga?

382
00:21:49,343 --> 00:21:51,653
I was so busy as my old job,

383
00:21:51,653 --> 00:21:53,393
I overworked myself.

384
00:21:53,393 --> 00:21:56,215
A junior told me that if working hard meant ending up like me,

385
00:21:56,215 --> 00:21:58,729
she didn't want to work hard.

386
00:21:58,729 --> 00:22:01,259
Oh my! That's tough.

387
00:22:01,259 --> 00:22:05,454
But after I found yoga, I realized...

388
00:22:05,454 --> 00:22:07,404
Hearing the phrase "work hard"

389
00:22:07,404 --> 00:22:11,007
is tough for someone who is already working hard.

390
00:22:12,032 --> 00:22:18,438
That's why I want to open a personalized yoga studio

391
00:22:18,438 --> 00:22:22,929
where I can be closely aligned with my student's minds and bodies.

392
00:22:22,929 --> 00:22:25,280
That's what I wanted, at least.

393
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,645
But now I'm wavering.

394
00:22:27,645 --> 00:22:29,298
What?

395
00:22:29,298 --> 00:22:34,435
The studio I'm working for now asked me to be a manager.

396
00:22:34,435 --> 00:22:36,859
You should find a business partner.

397
00:22:36,859 --> 00:22:40,005
Someone who can help you out.

398
00:22:40,715 --> 00:22:45,242
You don't want a difficult man if you're a woman starting a business!

399
00:22:45,242 --> 00:22:49,068
But Higashimura-san should be okay.

400
00:22:49,068 --> 00:22:51,579
Oh, no, we're not like that.

401
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:53,556
- Really?
- Yes.

402
00:22:53,556 --> 00:22:59,996
Seriously? My intuition's never been wrong before.

403
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:06,625
She's an interesting person, isn't she?

404
00:23:08,993 --> 00:23:14,866
I guess to successfully start a business, you need to be that powerful.

405
00:23:19,115 --> 00:23:22,338
Did you really give up on starting your own studio?

406
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:28,230
Yoga is important to me...

407
00:23:28,941 --> 00:23:31,491
- But Seita-san-
- Please do your best!

408
00:23:32,211 --> 00:23:34,557
You have to keep working hard.

409
00:23:35,445 --> 00:23:38,700
You're saying that to me?

410
00:23:39,315 --> 00:23:41,394
I'm sorry.

411
00:23:42,392 --> 00:23:45,698
I couldn't find the right words.

412
00:23:45,698 --> 00:23:48,661
But you said that going independent was your dream!

413
00:23:48,661 --> 00:23:51,330
That's right. It's my dream.

414
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:53,800
I saved up money for it.

415
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:58,406
I went to different studios to introduce myself to students.

416
00:23:58,406 --> 00:24:00,487
I even went to seminars...

417
00:24:01,852 --> 00:24:05,989
But that's...

418
00:24:07,236 --> 00:24:10,900
Why are you wavering now, after all that?

419
00:24:13,252 --> 00:24:16,305
If I move over to management,

420
00:24:16,305 --> 00:24:19,129
I'll have more personal time.

421
00:24:19,129 --> 00:24:21,789
- Then..
- Personal time?

422
00:24:22,651 --> 00:24:26,888
Is that more important than your dream?

423
00:24:26,888 --> 00:24:29,713
What? That's...

424
00:24:29,713 --> 00:24:33,443
You said you wanted to go independent, so it wasn't the time to get married.

425
00:24:33,443 --> 00:24:36,084
That's why I was so...

426
00:24:37,811 --> 00:24:40,717
You should do more journaling!

427
00:24:40,717 --> 00:24:43,419
You don't understand what you're giving up!

428
00:24:43,419 --> 00:24:46,029
- Yes, I do!
- No, you don't!

429
00:24:46,029 --> 00:24:48,956
If you work hard, you will get the thing you want most!

430
00:24:48,956 --> 00:24:51,158
Why are you giving up?

431
00:24:51,158 --> 00:24:53,660
Why are you so upset?

432
00:24:58,742 --> 00:25:00,462
I...

433
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:04,584
never got what I wanted most.

434
00:25:05,206 --> 00:25:10,159
Not in college, in work, or in club tournaments...

435
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:12,955
I never got what I wanted most.

436
00:25:12,955 --> 00:25:16,720
I even got transferred to a matchmaking service, a job I don't like.

437
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:22,899
But I thought that work was done for your family. It meant prioritizing something other than yourself.

438
00:25:22,899 --> 00:25:25,461
I thought that's what it meant to be an adult.

439
00:25:25,461 --> 00:25:28,041
So I managed somehow.

440
00:25:28,041 --> 00:25:29,896
That's why

441
00:25:31,408 --> 00:25:35,348
when you told me about your dreams and goals,

442
00:25:35,348 --> 00:25:38,180
and declared that you had no intention of getting married,

443
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:41,978
I just...

444
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:45,055
Work hard!

445
00:25:45,055 --> 00:25:48,057
You have to work hard!

446
00:25:49,222 --> 00:25:50,549
If you don't work hard now-

447
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:53,653
Who do you think is to blame for your troubles?

448
00:25:56,074 --> 00:26:00,391
You don't know anything about how I feel.

449
00:26:01,825 --> 00:26:04,434
Thank you for today.

450
00:26:17,579 --> 00:26:19,245
That's going down easy!

451
00:26:19,245 --> 00:26:21,841
I haven't seen you dressed like that in ages!

452
00:26:21,841 --> 00:26:24,978
You've dressed casually since starting yoga.

453
00:26:24,978 --> 00:26:27,347
Thank you for this.

454
00:26:29,031 --> 00:26:31,918
Also, you left your business cards in the pocket.

455
00:26:31,918 --> 00:26:33,494
When did you become a manager?

456
00:26:33,494 --> 00:26:36,194
What? Riho-san, you're a manager?

457
00:26:36,194 --> 00:26:39,032
It's true!

458
00:26:39,032 --> 00:26:41,968
You should've said! Let's celebrate!

459
00:26:41,968 --> 00:26:43,458
Aren't you one of the first of your cohort to get promoted?

460
00:26:43,458 --> 00:26:45,137
I don't want to celebrate.

461
00:26:45,137 --> 00:26:47,107
I'm just exhausted from getting promoted.

462
00:26:47,107 --> 00:26:50,177
Isn't it amazing that they promote a woman at a car company?

463
00:26:50,177 --> 00:26:52,678
What I want isn't a manager's title,

464
00:26:52,678 --> 00:26:55,781
it's a husband with a manager's title!

465
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:57,684
I don't want to get promoted!

466
00:26:57,684 --> 00:27:00,854
Your superiors probably like that lack of ambition.

467
00:27:00,854 --> 00:27:03,854
Are you going to quit once you get married?

468
00:27:03,854 --> 00:27:06,079
I want to keep my job until I have children.

469
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:08,227
When I look at my superiors with children,

470
00:27:08,227 --> 00:27:10,556
they're exhausted from balancing work and a family.

471
00:27:10,556 --> 00:27:13,894
Seriously! Waking up at 5:00 a.m. to make the family lunches,

472
00:27:13,894 --> 00:27:15,702
and never cutting corners with beauty

473
00:27:15,702 --> 00:27:17,704
like the career women in magazines? Impossible!

474
00:27:17,704 --> 00:27:20,139
You're the opposite, right, Kyoka?

475
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:24,660
You value independence most, so you'll maintain a personal life without getting married.

476
00:27:25,489 --> 00:27:28,026
I'm not sure now.

477
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:32,519
Does this have to do with that single father?

478
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:34,854
Excuse me. One more beer here.

479
00:27:34,854 --> 00:27:37,142
- Me too.
- Me too!

480
00:27:37,142 --> 00:27:38,958
It's certainly not easy,

481
00:27:38,958 --> 00:27:42,160
juggling work and a partner with a kid.

482
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,857
Yeah. Even if you have a career role model,

483
00:27:43,857 --> 00:27:46,199
there aren't really any role models as women, are there?

484
00:27:46,199 --> 00:27:49,099
Suzu, your priority should be getting out of that lazy living-together situation.

485
00:27:49,099 --> 00:27:50,860
Is Kazuma-kun camping alone again today?

486
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:51,672
Yeah.

487
00:27:51,672 --> 00:27:55,870
If there are two things that are most important to you,

488
00:27:56,709 --> 00:27:59,549
<i>what do you do then?</i>

489
00:28:05,118 --> 00:28:07,605
<i>[Things that are imporant to me:]</i>

490
00:28:07,605 --> 00:28:10,694
<i>[Nijiro, A family-friendly job, Time, Coexistence,]</i>

491
00:28:10,694 --> 00:28:12,923
<i>[Money, Health, Rest, Curry, Kyoka-san]</i>

492
00:28:30,421 --> 00:28:32,436
I don't know the number.

493
00:28:32,436 --> 00:28:34,782
Oh, I see.

494
00:28:34,782 --> 00:28:38,383
It's late. Kyoka's not back yet, huh?

495
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:41,410
I'm going to take a bath.

496
00:29:01,571 --> 00:29:04,494
<i>[3 missed calls: Mom]</i>

497
00:29:15,088 --> 00:29:17,033
Want to drink, Kyoka-chan?

498
00:29:17,033 --> 00:29:19,746
I'm okay. I've already drank tonight.

499
00:29:19,746 --> 00:29:21,550
I see.

500
00:29:22,663 --> 00:29:25,729
I'm going to go to your yoga lesson again on Wednesday.

501
00:29:25,729 --> 00:29:28,100
The one for beginners.

502
00:29:34,241 --> 00:29:35,825
Uncle, can I have a beer?

503
00:29:35,825 --> 00:29:37,098
Sure.

504
00:29:37,098 --> 00:29:38,665
Why don't you answer it?

505
00:29:38,665 --> 00:29:41,405
She'll give up before long.

506
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:49,135
If I tell her I'm dating you, she'll give up immediately.

507
00:29:50,902 --> 00:29:52,869
Hayate-kun.

508
00:29:52,869 --> 00:29:54,431
Yeah?

509
00:29:55,591 --> 00:29:58,518
It's your mom, isn't it? All these calls.

510
00:30:01,147 --> 00:30:06,366
I'm sorry. When it rang earlier, I saw the missed call notification.

511
00:30:09,132 --> 00:30:12,505
It's fine. I don't mind that you saw it.

512
00:30:15,292 --> 00:30:19,799
I haven't seen her at all since I left high school.

513
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:23,539
Since I came back to Japan and saw her once, she's been relentless.

514
00:30:24,601 --> 00:30:26,482
She's probably worried.

515
00:30:26,482 --> 00:30:28,572
You should tell her you're staying here.

516
00:30:28,572 --> 00:30:31,689
- I can tell your mom-
- No, that's okay.

517
00:30:31,689 --> 00:30:34,812
I text her sometimes over LINE.

518
00:30:34,812 --> 00:30:38,715
I want us to be distant enough that I can occasionally give her updates.

519
00:30:38,715 --> 00:30:41,587
I can be nice to her that way.

520
00:30:51,883 --> 00:30:55,770
If we get closer, I'll say something I shouldn't and get into an argument with her.

521
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,631
It's annoying.

522
00:31:06,127 --> 00:31:11,354
Arguments between you two are annoying, but they're funny. I love them.

523
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,679
Hayate.

524
00:31:26,679 --> 00:31:29,486
It's annoying, but maybe you should just...

525
00:31:31,987 --> 00:31:33,773
Delicious!

526
00:31:34,585 --> 00:31:36,871
Work harder...

527
00:31:36,871 --> 00:31:39,933
Well, I'm off to bed.

528
00:31:39,933 --> 00:31:42,037
Sleep well.

529
00:31:48,441 --> 00:31:50,743
- I've come to pick up Tsukasa.
- Hello.

530
00:31:50,743 --> 00:31:52,432
Tsukasa's mom has come to pick him up.

531
00:31:52,432 --> 00:31:56,148
- Okay.
- Tsukasa, it's time to go home.

532
00:31:56,148 --> 00:32:00,851
- See you, Hayate Sensei!
- See you, Tsukasa!

533
00:32:00,851 --> 00:32:03,440
- Thank you very much.
- Bye bye.

534
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,940
Did you have fun day?

535
00:32:17,737 --> 00:32:20,839
- Hello.
- Hello.

536
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:23,041
Good evening.

537
00:32:31,084 --> 00:32:35,620
Today, first of all, relax your shoulders.

538
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,066
Please lie down and face upwards.

539
00:32:42,595 --> 00:32:45,464
While slowly breathing,

540
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:48,177
relax your bodies.

541
00:32:48,177 --> 00:32:49,654
Close your eyes.

542
00:32:49,654 --> 00:32:54,206
The muscles in your neck, shoulders, hands, legs,

543
00:32:54,206 --> 00:32:56,442
"Plop"... let go of them all.

544
00:32:56,442 --> 00:33:01,212
Excuse me, your eyebrow muscles are still tight.

545
00:33:01,212 --> 00:33:03,715
Don't clench your teeth.

546
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:07,465
Normally, we unconsciously work hard at what we do,

547
00:33:07,465 --> 00:33:12,380
so it's harder to let go of strength, than take it in.

548
00:33:13,716 --> 00:33:16,409
Be it smiling,

549
00:33:16,409 --> 00:33:18,830
holding back tears,

550
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:21,040
or suppressing our anger,

551
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:24,183
your face uses strength to do that.

552
00:33:24,183 --> 00:33:28,681
Relax the muscles you use to protect your feelings.

553
00:33:28,681 --> 00:33:32,150
Just feel yourself.

554
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:34,333
At this moment, deep in your heart,

555
00:33:34,333 --> 00:33:37,095
are you smiling?

556
00:33:37,095 --> 00:33:39,695
Or crying?

557
00:33:39,695 --> 00:33:42,249
Or are you angry?

558
00:33:42,923 --> 00:33:46,900
It's hard to try to know yourself.

559
00:33:49,081 --> 00:33:53,580
What makes you realize your true feelings,

560
00:33:54,348 --> 00:33:57,770
may sometimes be the presence of someone else.

561
00:33:59,217 --> 00:34:01,847
<i>When I think of that person,</i>

562
00:34:02,695 --> 00:34:06,508
<i>why does my heart feel warm?</i>

563
00:34:08,941 --> 00:34:12,266
<i>When I think of that person,</i>

564
00:34:12,266 --> 00:34:15,071
<i>why do I feel sad?</i>

565
00:34:22,061 --> 00:34:24,967
Did you manage to feel yourself?

566
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:31,134
You don't have to work hard to relax.

567
00:34:31,134 --> 00:34:36,651
The phrase "work hard" is hardly used in yoga.

568
00:34:36,651 --> 00:34:40,713
All right, sit up now,

569
00:34:40,713 --> 00:34:44,916
and raise your arms starting from the center of your back.

570
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:47,506
Press your hands together above your head,

571
00:34:47,506 --> 00:34:51,109
and bring them down to the front of your chest.

572
00:34:53,499 --> 00:34:55,317
But...

573
00:34:57,334 --> 00:34:58,432
"Work hard."

574
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:00,596
<i>Work hard.</i>

575
00:35:01,178 --> 00:35:02,645
"Work hard."

576
00:35:02,645 --> 00:35:04,847
<i>You have to work hard!</i>

577
00:35:09,114 --> 00:35:11,233
"Work hard."

578
00:35:15,567 --> 00:35:19,436
Even then, we still want to say it.

579
00:35:19,436 --> 00:35:21,522
"Work hard"

580
00:35:21,522 --> 00:35:24,222
is also a form of kindness.

581
00:35:26,912 --> 00:35:29,066
To our lover

582
00:35:29,066 --> 00:35:31,476
our friends,

583
00:35:31,476 --> 00:35:33,875
our family,

584
00:35:33,875 --> 00:35:35,467
we laugh,

585
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:36,983
we cry,

586
00:35:36,983 --> 00:35:39,167
we get angry.

587
00:35:40,633 --> 00:35:43,476
Accepting ourselves as we are

588
00:35:43,476 --> 00:35:46,242
may be hard at times,

589
00:35:48,948 --> 00:35:50,889
but let's work hard,

590
00:35:50,889 --> 00:35:54,918
and accept ourselves the way we are.

591
00:35:56,721 --> 00:36:00,708
And when you are tired of working hard,

592
00:36:00,708 --> 00:36:03,323
you can come here, and together with me,

593
00:36:03,323 --> 00:36:08,450
"Plop"... let's let go of the stress.

594
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,629
All right,

595
00:36:10,629 --> 00:36:17,149
well then, bend forward until your tummy touches your feet.

596
00:36:26,458 --> 00:36:27,953
The towel...

597
00:36:27,953 --> 00:36:29,650
Here you go.

598
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:31,356
Oh, thanks.

599
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,001
Hello?

600
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:58,427
Oh, sorry, I was busy with work.

601
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:04,043
Actually, it's not that.

602
00:37:05,391 --> 00:37:09,296
I just didn't want to speak to you, Mom.

603
00:37:11,397 --> 00:37:13,101
Yup...

604
00:37:21,633 --> 00:37:23,509
I'm turning in for the night.

605
00:37:23,509 --> 00:37:24,893
Okay.

606
00:37:24,893 --> 00:37:27,838
- Good night.
- Good night.

607
00:38:02,741 --> 00:38:04,749
You're drooling.

608
00:38:04,749 --> 00:38:08,485
Huh? Sorry, I dozed off.

609
00:38:08,485 --> 00:38:09,678
Hayate...

610
00:38:09,678 --> 00:38:13,806
You're really something. You're even good at letting out stress.

611
00:38:22,252 --> 00:38:24,036
Thanks.

612
00:38:24,036 --> 00:38:26,074
I managed to speak to her.

613
00:38:30,276 --> 00:38:32,527
You've worked hard.

614
00:38:58,490 --> 00:39:01,793
Can I go "plop" together with you?

615
00:39:02,774 --> 00:39:04,798
Sure.

616
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:33,998
So, I tried adding a requirement, that my partner must be an animal lover.

617
00:40:33,998 --> 00:40:37,535
But I didn't get a lot of matches.

618
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:40,792
But I found one person who's cool.

619
00:40:40,792 --> 00:40:43,041
This is rather tiring.

620
00:40:43,041 --> 00:40:46,044
- Was I walking too fast?
- Oh, no, no.

621
00:40:46,044 --> 00:40:47,900
Sorry to make you walk at my pace.

622
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:50,736
Likewise, you had to join me because of my back.

623
00:40:50,736 --> 00:40:55,120
I felt that you know me better than I know myself,

624
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:58,222
- so I wanted to hear your opinions.
- You flatter me.

625
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:07,240
Oh! Look at that! A turtle!

626
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:12,404
A turtle's shoulder blades are inside the rib cage. Did you know?

627
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:18,356
Are you having spasms?

628
00:41:18,356 --> 00:41:21,933
No, it's probably what they call,

629
00:41:21,933 --> 00:41:23,631
a "kyun"!

630
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:26,009
Huh?

631
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:30,828
Today is the last day of the seminar.

632
00:41:30,828 --> 00:41:32,754
Compared to the first day you came,

633
00:41:32,754 --> 00:41:36,149
have you experienced any change in your awareness?

634
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:39,871
Surprisingly, there are only a few people

635
00:41:39,871 --> 00:41:43,595
who have something they want to do, or have.

636
00:41:43,595 --> 00:41:47,512
There are even fewer people who attempt to achieve that.

637
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:52,651
I hope you all can realize the dream you've set out to achieve.

638
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:08,442
The seminar ends today, huh?

639
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:12,220
It ends today.

640
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:17,425
It's raining.

641
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:33,981
I'll walk you home.

642
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:37,178
Thank you.

643
00:42:55,630 --> 00:42:59,774
The rain has stopped.

644
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:02,631
Yes, it has.

645
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:16,454
Thank you for walking me all the way home.

646
00:43:16,454 --> 00:43:19,963
No problem. It's the last time, after all.

647
00:43:24,490 --> 00:43:29,303
Well... I'm really sorry for what I said the other day.

648
00:43:29,303 --> 00:43:31,916
No, likewise.

649
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:36,640
I've decided to give up on being an entrepreneur.

650
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:40,478
I've given it a lot of thought.

651
00:43:40,478 --> 00:43:45,366
Being an entrepreneur can't guarantee a stable income, and I can't drag Nijiro into this.

652
00:43:45,366 --> 00:43:48,237
While writing in my note book,

653
00:43:48,237 --> 00:43:50,644
the things and people

654
00:43:50,644 --> 00:43:53,101
who matter to me, become clearer.

655
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,901
Is that so?

656
00:43:56,901 --> 00:44:00,505
That's why I thought I should tell you this.

657
00:44:00,505 --> 00:44:02,093
I'm sorry.

658
00:44:02,093 --> 00:44:06,411
It's also important to have your own personal time, right?

659
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:09,911
I...

660
00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:14,806
have decided to go independent, after all.

661
00:44:14,806 --> 00:44:16,524
What?

662
00:44:16,524 --> 00:44:20,356
Thanks to you, I finally woke up.

663
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:26,417
The phrase "work hard" is not that bad, after all.

664
00:44:26,417 --> 00:44:30,200
What's important is who you say it to, and how.

is important in attracting customers.

I'm not very good at it, but I'll give it a try.

684
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:48,653
But when I've run out of ideas,

685

topics like curry, marriage parties,

686
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:54,800
or couple gyms,

687
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:58,770
things that are related to you, is it okay to post about them?

688
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,837
I'm not sure about the couple's gym, though.

689
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:06,952
We're still considered rivals, right?

690
00:46:06,952 --> 00:46:08,440
