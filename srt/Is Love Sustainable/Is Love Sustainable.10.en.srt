1
00:00:01,741 --> 00:00:03,577
Let's get married.

2
00:00:04,648 --> 00:00:05,556
What?

3
00:00:05,556 --> 00:00:08,242
I will be your "wife."

4
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:11,894
I want to be your real family.

5
00:00:12,616 --> 00:00:14,081
Family?

6
00:00:14,081 --> 00:00:16,943
A family member does not change like a lover.

7
00:00:17,902 --> 00:00:20,750
I will always treat you with importance.

8
00:00:23,076 --> 00:00:27,250
Hayate... I...

9
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:29,828
You must be surprised, right?

10
00:00:29,828 --> 00:00:31,328
Yeah.

11
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:33,599
Yup.

12
00:00:34,902 --> 00:00:37,403
Well... I...

13
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:41,811
I'm happy that you're thinking about it.

14
00:00:41,811 --> 00:00:44,406
- Butー
- Think about it.

15
00:00:44,406 --> 00:00:46,891
Think lots and lots about me.

16
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:50,406
Don't be so quick to give me an answer.

17
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:57,023
There's still time until the day I go to Malaysia.

18
00:00:58,292 --> 00:00:59,535
Okay.

19
00:00:59,535 --> 00:01:02,522
"Okay"? Just be your usual self.

20
00:01:02,522 --> 00:01:05,324
Ah... all right.

21
00:01:07,346 --> 00:01:10,037
I was so nervous!

22
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:14,671
I can't believe I proposed.

23
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:20,113
Of course, I hope you don't mind my crazy approach.

24
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:25,184
I got it. I'll think about it.

25
00:01:25,184 --> 00:01:26,828
Great.

26
00:01:32,758 --> 00:01:35,580
Wow... the full moon is beautiful.

27
00:01:36,342 --> 00:01:37,888
Yeah.

28
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:06,262
Good evening.

29
00:02:08,525 --> 00:02:10,230
Good evening.

30
00:02:11,198 --> 00:02:13,470
Seeing you here

31
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,119
is not a coincidence, I suppose?

32
00:02:17,838 --> 00:02:19,796
No, it's not.

33
00:02:23,777 --> 00:02:26,202
I'm afraid you're too late.

34
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:29,639
You're too late.

35
00:02:31,852 --> 00:02:33,917
We're already...

<i>[Thanks]</i>

42
00:03:45,786 --> 00:03:49,296
Kyoka-san and Higashimura-san were dating?

43
00:03:49,296 --> 00:03:53,099
Yes. But it seems they broke up.

44
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:57,537
Except that Kyoka probably still has feelings for him.

45
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:06,196
Well, when you turned down my request to go out,

46
00:04:06,196 --> 00:04:08,798
this was what Higashimura-san said.

47
00:04:08,798 --> 00:04:12,939
The reason for rejecting someone is because the other party would be better off not marrying,

48
00:04:12,939 --> 00:04:15,188
and there's no other option.

49
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:17,254
I'm sure that was...

50
00:04:17,254 --> 00:04:21,828
Nevertheless, I can't do much as her dad.

51
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:24,545
You're a good father, Sawada-san.

52
00:04:24,545 --> 00:04:28,525
You were willing to go marriage hunting for the sake of your daughter.

53
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:34,946
But of course, I'd still hope my daughter will also be happy.

54
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:45,226
Listen, is it okay if I visit your home next time?

55
00:04:45,226 --> 00:04:48,564
I also hope to properly greet Kyoka-san.

56
00:04:50,744 --> 00:04:54,968
Mom, you had a whirlwind of a wedding, right?

57
00:04:56,021 --> 00:04:57,947
Thank you.

58
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:02,469
I was hoping to ask you about it.

59
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:06,596
What's so great about a marriage?

60
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:13,890
By the way, what was the divorce form all about?

61
00:05:14,456 --> 00:05:16,450
You're back.

62
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,209
Went walking with Hinata-san?

63
00:05:18,209 --> 00:05:19,660
Yeah.

64
00:05:20,909 --> 00:05:23,957
Oh, I was just discussing some stuff with Mom.

65
00:05:23,957 --> 00:05:26,193
- About what?
- I'm not telling you.

66
00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:28,628
Why not?

67
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:30,166
It's not something I can tell my dad.

68
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:32,677
Dads can be maternal, too.

69
00:05:32,677 --> 00:05:34,308
Maternal, huh?

70
00:05:34,308 --> 00:05:37,489
I fed you milk and changed your diapers, after all.

71
00:05:37,489 --> 00:05:40,709
That was so long ago.

72
00:05:40,709 --> 00:05:42,812
Oh, right.

73
00:05:43,689 --> 00:05:46,012
I'm thinking of introducing Ms. Hinata to our family.

74
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,848
She also wants to meet you.

75
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:50,541
Oh, sure.

76
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:54,321
But what should I do? I've to make her feel at home.

77
00:05:54,321 --> 00:05:57,276
She's not expecting you to do that anyway.

78
00:05:57,276 --> 00:05:59,947
What does Hinata-san like?

79
00:05:59,947 --> 00:06:02,187
If I must say...

80
00:06:02,187 --> 00:06:04,531
Bones? Maybe boned meat.

81
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:06,533
Boned meat?

82
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:09,318
What the heck is that?

83
00:06:09,318 --> 00:06:14,130
Kyoka... ever since then, you and Higashimura-sanー

84
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:16,829
Oh, the laundry.

85
00:06:16,829 --> 00:06:19,431
Hang out your own clothes, Dad.

86
00:06:20,614 --> 00:06:25,519
This time, your handsome, high-spec childhood friend proposed to you under the full moon?

87
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:27,521
My, how fortunate you are!

88
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:30,023
Now that you mention it, yeah, I'm thankful.

89
00:06:30,023 --> 00:06:32,292
Of course, you are, even if I don't mention it.

90
00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:34,287
I'll say "yes" immediately.

91
00:06:34,287 --> 00:06:36,463
Conditions are really good for you.

92
00:06:36,463 --> 00:06:39,799
And you can just be yourself without having to change things to suit him.

93
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:41,801
He's a nice guy, too.

94
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:43,337
He is a nice guy.

95
00:06:43,337 --> 00:06:47,207
That's why it's so hard for me to reply to him, given such good conditions.

96
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:51,523
Anyway, you have plenty of time, so think through it carefully.

97
00:06:51,523 --> 00:06:54,610
For me, I've no choice but to get married.

98
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:58,451
Huh? What do you mean by that?

99
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:02,321
It's a shotgun wedding for me. With that Sam I was talking about.

100
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:04,791
What?!

101
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:07,502
That's why you refrained from alcohol at that time?

102
00:07:07,502 --> 00:07:11,607
It wasn't on a spur of the moment. I've thought things through.

103
00:07:11,607 --> 00:07:14,000
There's no guarantee I can give birth in the future,

104
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,936
and I do want kids of my own.

105
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:18,839
Well, in a way, this is good enough for me.

106
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:22,815
I'm already quite fortunate, so I made up my mind.

107
00:07:22,815 --> 00:07:25,785
What, that's not fair.

108
00:07:25,785 --> 00:07:27,447
You two are so lucky.

109
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,549
Not fair? I worried a lot over it.

110
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:32,786
There are marriages like that too.

111
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:36,489
If that's what you've decided, we'll give you our blessing.

112
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:38,508
Congratulations.

113
00:07:38,508 --> 00:07:40,360
Thank you.

114
00:07:41,782 --> 00:07:44,364
All right, I've decided.

115
00:07:44,364 --> 00:07:46,366
I'll stop cohabiting.

116
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:48,802
I'll focus solely on my work!

117
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:51,593
Let's give a toast!

118
00:07:51,593 --> 00:07:53,340
To our futures.

119
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:56,312
<i>Cheers!</i>

120
00:08:00,247 --> 00:08:04,403
It's just that he's a part-timer who wants to be a househusband.

121
00:08:04,403 --> 00:08:07,354
I was hoping that I could be a housewife.

122
00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:09,856
But this arrangement seems to work better for you.

123
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:13,621
The higher you climb, the happier you are.

124
00:08:13,621 --> 00:08:17,163
It's important to have an ambition,

125
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:20,907
but at the same time, be realistic about the things you cannot achieve,

126
00:08:20,907 --> 00:08:23,536
in order to prevent discontent from building up inside you.

127
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:27,507
<i>I get what you mean. I tend to compare myself to others.</i>

128
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:31,367
<i>Okay. Place your hands back on your chest.</i>

129
00:08:31,367 --> 00:08:35,950
In yoga, there's a teaching about "being satisfied with one's lot."

130
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:39,185
It's not about giving up,

131
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:45,688
but to be content with the environment that you are currently in.

132
00:08:45,688 --> 00:08:49,633
<i>Really? Are all yoga instructors able to do that?</i>

133
00:08:49,633 --> 00:08:54,110
No. I also often remind myself too.

134
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:56,536
For me,

135
00:08:56,536 --> 00:09:01,441
<i>I'm happy and blessed to have my family and friends around me.</i>

136
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:07,063
<i>If I want anything more, I feel like I may get punished for being too greedy.</i>

137
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:12,272
<i>How did you find your first yoga session,</i>

138
00:09:12,272 --> 00:09:14,788
<i>- Nekota-san?
- I had fun!</i>

139
00:09:14,788 --> 00:09:19,702
<i>I thought yoga is about having to keep quiet, but I was wrong.</i>

140
00:09:19,702 --> 00:09:23,222
That's right. I want my students to be relaxed

141
00:09:23,222 --> 00:09:25,958
and chat with me during my lessons.

142
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:28,144
<i>That's wonderful!</i>

143
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,939
Dad, what are you doing?

144
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:35,175
I thought I'd do a bit of yoga too.

145
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:38,177
- If you do it too quickly, you'll hurt your back.
- Ouch...

"He who is mortal but follows the way shalt enjoy longevity."

150
00:09:51,858 --> 00:09:54,027
I don't get what you're talking about.

Those are Lao Tzu's words.

153
00:10:03,148 --> 00:10:05,501
<i>you're actually looking for.</i>

154
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:09,325
<i>By accepting what you have right now,</i>

155
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:13,448
<i>how would you know what really makes you contented?</i>

156
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,357
<i>Huh? Why?!</i>

157
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:26,611
<i>What about you?</i>

158
00:10:49,349 --> 00:10:53,703
Where are you right now?

159
00:11:11,088 --> 00:11:13,621
<i>[Sawada Kyoka: Where are you right now?]</i>

160
00:11:30,957 --> 00:11:32,696
Sorry to ask you out so suddenly.

161
00:11:32,696 --> 00:11:34,360
Oh, it's fine.

162
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,680
Well... did something happen?

163
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:43,936
Even if nothing happened, we shouldn't be meeting, right?

164
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,672
Sorry.

165
00:11:48,672 --> 00:11:50,272
Don't be.

166
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:56,832
D-Does this have to do with your dad?

167
00:11:56,832 --> 00:11:58,618
Huh?

168
00:11:58,618 --> 00:12:04,457
Things are going well between my dad and Hinata-san.

169
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:07,022
Then what about you?

170
00:12:07,022 --> 00:12:11,093
Well... you see,

171
00:12:11,093 --> 00:12:13,423
I'm thinking of moving out.

172
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:19,252
<i>Kyoka is not related by blood to me.</i>

173
00:12:19,252 --> 00:12:22,109
Listen, I'm sure it doesn't mean

174
00:12:22,109 --> 00:12:26,495
that your dad feels you're not important to him anymore.

175
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:29,115
If he hadn't loved you, he wouldn't have raised you up.

176
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:31,944
More than anything, he'd want you to be happy.

177
00:12:31,944 --> 00:12:34,087
Your dad loves you very much.

178
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:36,022
Please believe in him.

179
00:12:36,022 --> 00:12:41,473
Me moving out has got nothing to do with my dad.

180
00:12:42,696 --> 00:12:44,531
<i>Let's go to Malaysia together.</i>

181
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:46,742
<i>I'm afraid you're too late.</i>

182
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:52,222
Oh... but of course.

183
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:56,017
Okay, I see.

184
00:12:58,556 --> 00:13:01,696
If I were your dad, I'd be proud

185
00:13:01,696 --> 00:13:05,772
to have raised my child to be such a good person.

186
00:13:05,772 --> 00:13:10,610
I'd want my precious daughter to choose what makes her happiest.

187
00:13:11,253 --> 00:13:15,318
- Enough about my dad already.
- That's what I think too.

188
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:19,036
No matter where you go,

189
00:13:19,036 --> 00:13:21,001
whoever you are with,

190
00:13:21,001 --> 00:13:23,966
as long as you are happy,

191
00:13:23,966 --> 00:13:26,306
it's enough for me.

192
00:13:31,949 --> 00:13:34,614
I have to go pick up Nijiro.

193
00:13:34,614 --> 00:13:36,538
Seita-san.

194
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:42,375
There's one more thing I want to tell you.

195
00:13:57,404 --> 00:14:01,080
Today, I gave online yoga lessons to a student.

196
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:04,650
Her name is Nekota-san.
<i>(T/N: "Neko"  means "cat" in Japanese)</i>

197
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:07,711
But she was wearing a T-shirt with panda prints.

198
00:14:09,034 --> 00:14:15,096
In Chinese, "panda" is written as "bear" and "cat", so it applies, I guess.

199
00:14:15,096 --> 00:14:17,239
It applies, right?

200
00:14:19,285 --> 00:14:21,463
"Bear" and "cat".

201
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:26,523
Indeed, that sums up what a panda is, right?

202
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:38,794
Goodbye.

203
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:53,026
Hayate Sensei is going to be very busy, so he will be leaving the school this month.

204
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:55,028
<i>What?!</i>

205
00:14:55,028 --> 00:14:58,085
I'll be very sad to leave all of you,

206
00:14:58,085 --> 00:15:00,811
but let's play as much as we can until then, alright?

207
00:15:00,811 --> 00:15:03,368
<i>Okay!</i>

208
00:15:03,368 --> 00:15:06,442
What are you doing?

209
00:15:06,442 --> 00:15:09,609
- See you!
- See you.

210
00:15:09,609 --> 00:15:11,844
Thank you very much.

211
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:16,528
Nijiro.

212
00:15:16,528 --> 00:15:18,084
You're quitting?

213
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:21,069
Yup. Sorry.

214
00:15:21,069 --> 00:15:27,585
I want to be a kind teacher like you in the future.

215
00:15:27,585 --> 00:15:28,578
What?

216
00:15:28,578 --> 00:15:34,520
I've been working hard so that I can talk to you in English.

217
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:39,341
When I grow up, let's chat in English.

218
00:15:39,341 --> 00:15:41,484
Nijiro...

219
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,912
Thank you!

220
00:15:53,353 --> 00:15:56,688
- Nijiro.
- Dad!

221
00:15:59,418 --> 00:16:03,982
Hayate Sensei is leaving this month.

222
00:16:03,982 --> 00:16:06,388
Thank you for your support.

223
00:16:06,388 --> 00:16:08,773
You're going to Malaysia, right?

224
00:16:08,773 --> 00:16:11,674
Yes. You heard about it?

225
00:16:11,674 --> 00:16:12,639
Yeah.

226
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,941
Good luck, Hayate Sensei.

227
00:16:14,941 --> 00:16:17,110
You too, Nijiro.

228
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:19,141
<i>Yeah!</i>

229
00:16:19,701 --> 00:16:21,901
Good luck.

230
00:16:21,901 --> 00:16:24,066
Thank you.

231
00:16:41,701 --> 00:16:43,061
Yummy!

232
00:16:43,061 --> 00:16:46,620
Malaysian food isn't as spicy as I thought.

233
00:16:47,188 --> 00:16:49,741
You met up with Higashimura-san?

234
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:54,113
Yup. For a short while.

235
00:16:55,014 --> 00:17:00,109
But Seita-san and I are no longer in that kind of relationship.

236
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:02,832
About what you said,

237
00:17:02,832 --> 00:17:06,698
I'll properly think about it, aside from my issue with Seita-san.

238
00:17:07,293 --> 00:17:08,993
Thank you.

239
00:17:10,495 --> 00:17:12,865
Oh, Hinata-san is coming over to visit.

240
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,067
What should I cook?

241
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:18,688
Maybe I should cook this Bak Kut Teh. It has boned meat.
<i>(T/N: A Chinese dish of pork rib cooked in broth)</i>

242
00:17:18,688 --> 00:17:20,406
Shall I go over and cook it for you?

243
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:22,736
That defeats the whole purpose!

244
00:17:22,736 --> 00:17:25,099
As the daughter, I should be the one preparing it.

245
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:26,899
Is that so?

246
00:17:28,482 --> 00:17:30,155
Oh, right.

247
00:17:30,155 --> 00:17:33,608
I wanted you to see this today.

248
00:17:34,287 --> 00:17:37,326
This is how the yoga studio will look like. What do you think?

249
00:17:37,326 --> 00:17:38,719
Well, I haven'tー

250
00:17:38,719 --> 00:17:40,206
It's fine.

251
00:17:40,206 --> 00:17:44,146
Just in terms of ambiance, what's your opinion?

252
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:53,308
Having a yoga studio in such a beautiful hotel...

253
00:17:54,353 --> 00:17:57,486
it's too wonderful for me.

254
00:18:00,085 --> 00:18:02,371
But it's like a dream come true.

255
00:18:03,016 --> 00:18:05,184
We can do it according to what you like.

256
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:07,587
I'll support whatever you choose.

257
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:09,051
Okay.

258
00:18:10,857 --> 00:18:14,744
You're really kind, Hayate.

259
00:18:17,363 --> 00:18:19,675
Nijiro, is this Dad?

260
00:18:19,675 --> 00:18:23,118
Yup. I drew that during art lesson. For Father's Day.

261
00:18:23,118 --> 00:18:25,158
Am I vacuuming the floor here?

262
00:18:25,158 --> 00:18:28,351
You should draw me in a more cool way. This looks like it's for Mother's Day.

263
00:18:28,351 --> 00:18:31,083
But this is what I like about you.

264
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:33,613
I like how you do stuff like Mom.

265
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:38,073
To be honest, you keep things even cleaner than Mom does.

266
00:18:38,073 --> 00:18:40,255
And the curry you cook is better than Mom's.

267
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:42,288
Aw, Nijiro.

268
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:46,506
But on the other hand, Mom's better at guiding me in my homework.

269
00:18:46,506 --> 00:18:49,794
Also, she is better at getting rid of cockroaches.

270
00:18:49,794 --> 00:18:52,198
- And alsoー
- I get it, I get it.

271
00:18:52,198 --> 00:18:55,908
Mom's generally better at stuff, right? Even with work, too.

272
00:18:55,908 --> 00:18:58,987
You're both good at what you do.

273
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:02,465
Thanks.

274
00:19:03,462 --> 00:19:05,487
It's a great drawing.

275
00:19:08,692 --> 00:19:10,292
Mom?

276
00:19:11,988 --> 00:19:13,186
Can I eat it now?

277
00:19:13,186 --> 00:19:14,525
Sure. Dig in.

278
00:19:14,525 --> 00:19:15,614
Yay!

279
00:19:15,614 --> 00:19:18,773
Hey, eat it after dinner.

280
00:19:18,773 --> 00:19:22,559
Next week onwards, I'll be going to and from Osaka more frequently, so will be busier.

281
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:23,967
I can handle things here.

282
00:19:23,967 --> 00:19:25,567
Good.

283
00:19:26,569 --> 00:19:29,852
Before that, there's something I have to tell you.

284
00:19:29,852 --> 00:19:32,575
The day when Nijiro had a fever,

285
00:19:32,575 --> 00:19:36,776
Kyoka-san was in an important meeting with a client I recommended.

286
00:19:36,776 --> 00:19:39,485
She left abruptly to attend to Nijiro.

287
00:19:39,485 --> 00:19:42,077
I only knew about it later.

288
00:19:42,077 --> 00:19:43,755
What?

289
00:19:43,755 --> 00:19:46,815
Because of that, the deal fell through.

290
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:50,022
Kyoka-san told me not to tell you,

291
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:55,009
but I don't feel comfortable not telling you about it.

292
00:19:55,009 --> 00:19:58,907
So, try talking to her one more time.

293
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:03,611
I bought the cake in order to tell you this.

294
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,609
It's already too late.

295
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:13,619
That's the part of you that irks me. Be more decisive.

296
00:20:13,619 --> 00:20:17,156
It's... too late.

297
00:20:28,212 --> 00:20:31,873
Dad, last but not least, remember to vacuum the floor.

298
00:20:31,873 --> 00:20:33,819
Vacuum? But it looks fine.

299
00:20:33,819 --> 00:20:35,516
No, it's not!

300
00:20:35,516 --> 00:20:37,170
- Oh, right.
- What?

301
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:39,606
The photos. What should we do?

302
00:20:39,606 --> 00:20:41,798
Mom's photos.

303
00:20:41,798 --> 00:20:43,042
It'll be awkward.

304
00:20:43,042 --> 00:20:44,808
Just leave them where they are.

305
00:20:44,808 --> 00:20:45,640
Really?

306
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:49,524
If Hinata-san really feels uncomfortable about it,

307
00:20:49,524 --> 00:20:51,801
I'll explain it to her at that time.

308
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,180
Got it.

309
00:20:55,789 --> 00:20:58,615
- She's early! Hurry, hurry!
- She's too early.

310
00:20:58,615 --> 00:21:00,951
- Clean this up.
- Put those away!

311
00:21:00,951 --> 00:21:03,480
- Put them there!
- Throw them in there, all right?

312
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:07,216
- Throw them in?
- Don't forget these.

313
00:21:07,216 --> 00:21:09,359
Everything's clear.

314
00:21:11,088 --> 00:21:12,462
Hello.

315
00:21:12,462 --> 00:21:15,436
Welcome to our home.

316
00:21:15,436 --> 00:21:16,217
Please come in.

317
00:21:16,217 --> 00:21:18,967
- Sorry to intrude.
- Over here.

318
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:22,055
You have a lovely place.

319
00:21:22,055 --> 00:21:26,073
It's an old apartment, but my wife renovated it.

320
00:21:26,073 --> 00:21:27,329
- Your wife did?
- Yes.

321
00:21:27,329 --> 00:21:30,790
Wow, she has great taste.

322
00:21:35,184 --> 00:21:37,613
Can I take a look at the photos?

323
00:21:37,613 --> 00:21:39,313
If you please.

324
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:58,347
She's a cheerful person with a lovely smile.

325
00:21:58,347 --> 00:22:00,470
- Yes.
- That's right.

326
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:03,545
This one was taken when she dressed up as AKB

327
00:22:03,545 --> 00:22:06,742
and won a singing contest.

328
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:09,596
Nice to meet you.

329
00:22:09,596 --> 00:22:11,635
Excuse me for coming over today.

330
00:22:15,369 --> 00:22:17,446
- Please, sit down.
- Okay.

331
00:22:17,446 --> 00:22:19,054
Sit down, please.

332
00:22:19,054 --> 00:22:20,954
Over here.

333
00:22:29,153 --> 00:22:32,253
How is it? This is my first time cooking it, so I'm not that confident.

334
00:22:32,253 --> 00:22:33,746
It's delicious.

335
00:22:33,746 --> 00:22:35,739
So glad to hear that!

336
00:22:35,739 --> 00:22:39,883
When I asked my dad what you like, all he could tell me was boned meat.

337
00:22:39,883 --> 00:22:41,314
What?

338
00:22:41,314 --> 00:22:44,548
I may like bones, but it doesn't have to apply to food too.

339
00:22:44,548 --> 00:22:46,092
Oh, is that so?

340
00:22:46,092 --> 00:22:47,390
Bones?

341
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:50,688
I see. It's related to your job, right?

342
00:22:50,688 --> 00:22:52,516
Well, yes.

343
00:22:52,516 --> 00:22:54,197
Bones have their own unique features too.

344
00:22:54,197 --> 00:22:56,624
The same bone part differs among individuals.

345
00:22:56,624 --> 00:22:57,800
Really?

346
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,203
For Sawada-san, his shoulder blades are particularly beautiful.

347
00:23:00,203 --> 00:23:02,687
- Extremely.
- Extremely.

348
00:23:02,687 --> 00:23:05,489
You have "deboned" me, Hinata-san.

349
00:23:05,489 --> 00:23:07,240
You're so funny!

350
00:23:08,957 --> 00:23:10,551
I see, I see.

351
00:23:10,551 --> 00:23:14,551
The word "bone" is also used to describe a person's appearance and personality.

352
00:23:14,551 --> 00:23:16,451
I don't really understand what you're talking about.

353
00:23:16,451 --> 00:23:18,308
Sorry, I'm bad at explaining things.

354
00:23:18,308 --> 00:23:21,743
- You've heard of this phrase, "have the spine to", right?
- Yes.

355
00:23:21,743 --> 00:23:24,627
Bones can also be used to describe a person's character,

356
00:23:24,627 --> 00:23:29,030
- which explains a bone's unique features.
- I see.

357
00:23:30,098 --> 00:23:32,076
- So sorry.
- Don't be.

358
00:23:32,076 --> 00:23:33,752
Come, let's dig in.

359
00:23:33,752 --> 00:23:36,106
This sixth edition was published in 2008

360
00:23:36,106 --> 00:23:39,141
and it was my first time involved in its publication.

361
00:23:39,141 --> 00:23:42,212
- Wow, you must have been honored to do so.
- I was really honored.

362
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:44,790
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

363
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,956
Thank you very much.

364
00:23:46,956 --> 00:23:49,507
- Please have a seat.
- Okay.

365
00:23:56,470 --> 00:24:03,170
Actually, I wanted to speak with you, that's why I came today.

366
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:04,517
Speak with me?

367
00:24:04,517 --> 00:24:06,246
That's right.

368
00:24:07,537 --> 00:24:11,490
Please give me your permission to marry your dad.

369
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:18,146
I wish to spend the rest of my life leisurely,

370
00:24:18,146 --> 00:24:21,086
together with your dad.

371
00:24:23,713 --> 00:24:25,904
H-Hinata-san...

372
00:24:32,695 --> 00:24:34,646
Hinata-san,

373
00:24:37,956 --> 00:24:40,663
as imperfect as my dad may be,

374
00:24:41,878 --> 00:24:45,311
I shall forever leave him in your care.

375
00:24:48,265 --> 00:24:50,662
Thank you for your blessing.

376
00:24:52,549 --> 00:24:55,494
Thank you for your blessing.

377
00:25:02,055 --> 00:25:06,604
I can never replace your mom,

378
00:25:06,604 --> 00:25:12,263
but I hope to get along well with you from now on.

379
00:25:12,263 --> 00:25:14,020
Of course.

380
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:17,313
Therefore, as your dad's wife,

381
00:25:17,313 --> 00:25:19,375
as his partner,

382
00:25:19,375 --> 00:25:23,135
can I join your family as a new member?

383
00:25:23,135 --> 00:25:26,375
To say I'm your stepmother is not really...

384
00:25:26,375 --> 00:25:28,370
I'm happy to.

385
00:25:29,328 --> 00:25:35,011
As the daughter of your husband,

386
00:25:35,011 --> 00:25:36,680
please welcome me into your family.

387
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,540
Definitely.

388
00:25:49,393 --> 00:25:52,659
- Managed to get a cab?
- Yeah.

389
00:25:53,685 --> 00:25:55,566
Thanks.

390
00:25:55,566 --> 00:25:57,612
Hinata-san was really happy.

391
00:25:57,612 --> 00:26:01,776
You didn't get to propose again.

392
00:26:03,664 --> 00:26:05,269
But I'm relieved.

393
00:26:05,269 --> 00:26:09,460
You and Hinata-san are surprisingly compatible.

394
00:26:10,416 --> 00:26:14,915
But our ages and family backgrounds are vastly different.

395
00:26:14,915 --> 00:26:18,856
I'm sure we'll have our disagreements too, as time goes by.

396
00:26:18,856 --> 00:26:22,059
- Yeah.
- We'll have to talk through it somehow.

397
00:26:22,059 --> 00:26:24,999
You're a language scholar, after all.

398
00:26:24,999 --> 00:26:29,937
If you look up the meaning of "word" in the dictionary,

399
00:26:29,937 --> 00:26:36,340
it states "something used to express an incident, thought, or feeling."

400
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:39,060
Well, okay.

401
00:26:39,877 --> 00:26:42,796
When you were a baby,

402
00:26:42,796 --> 00:26:45,649
words like "Papa", "Mama", "carry",

403
00:26:45,649 --> 00:26:48,152
"yummy", "I like", "No",

404
00:26:48,152 --> 00:26:51,643
"elephant", and "big"...

405
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:56,951
Whenever you remember these words one by one, it shaken my soul.

406
00:26:59,685 --> 00:27:01,504
Oh, right.

407
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:05,613
Words exist because we want to express our feelings to someone.

408
00:27:05,613 --> 00:27:10,454
That was what I taught you, by doing my best to keep talking to you.

409
00:27:11,208 --> 00:27:13,308
Jeez, Dad.

410
00:27:13,308 --> 00:27:16,924
Having someone to whom you want to express your feelings to,

411
00:27:17,621 --> 00:27:19,879
is happiness.

412
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:23,197
Can I ask you something?

413
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:27,030
That divorce form that Mom gave you...

414
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:28,979
What was that for?

415
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,080
<i>[Divorce Form]</i>

416
00:27:45,376 --> 00:27:49,610
When we got married, Yoko-san gave it to me.

417
00:27:50,469 --> 00:27:54,183
What? When you got married?

418
00:27:54,183 --> 00:27:57,450
We had an unusual marriage,

419
00:27:57,450 --> 00:28:00,924
so your Mom said that if I want a divorce in the future,

420
00:28:00,924 --> 00:28:04,004
I can set myself free whenever I want.

421
00:28:05,188 --> 00:28:07,923
For your sake?

422
00:28:07,923 --> 00:28:10,078
I didn't accept that.

423
00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:12,910
Instead of being set free,

424
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:15,972
if I don't have you and Yoko-san with me,

425
00:28:15,972 --> 00:28:18,258
I won't be able to live.

426
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:23,257
So I threw the form away.

427
00:28:23,257 --> 00:28:27,875
Even for a married couple, no matter how often they talk to each other,

428
00:28:27,875 --> 00:28:30,665
there are still things they don't know about each other.

429
00:28:32,589 --> 00:28:36,770
Can I have this form... as a keepsake?

430
00:28:46,998 --> 00:28:49,825
<i>Congratulations on getting married.</i>

431
00:28:49,825 --> 00:28:51,383
Thank you very much.

432
00:28:51,383 --> 00:28:55,190
Have you made any plans for the wedding?

433
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:57,929
Given that we're already at this age,

434
00:28:57,929 --> 00:29:02,549
we're thinking of having just a small, intimate ceremony.

435
00:29:02,549 --> 00:29:06,678
That's right. My mom is also in a nursing home,

436
00:29:06,678 --> 00:29:09,515
- so, remotely?
- Yeah, r-remote wedding?

437
00:29:09,515 --> 00:29:12,518
We'll do a remote wedding. It's really a simple one.

438
00:29:12,518 --> 00:29:15,576
Me too. My family... well...

439
00:29:15,576 --> 00:29:18,412
is only Kyoka, so...

440
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:23,262
Erm... to couples getting married,

441
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:25,243
we would like to request

442
00:29:25,243 --> 00:29:29,096
that you complete our survey on your experience.

443
00:29:29,096 --> 00:29:30,809
Sure.

444
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:35,374
Let's see...

445
00:29:35,374 --> 00:29:39,701
- "In your opinion..."
- "What's the definition of "marriage"?

446
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,683
You don't have to think so hard about it.

447
00:29:44,683 --> 00:29:46,842
It's not that it's hard,

448
00:29:46,842 --> 00:29:51,983
but I'm trying to find the correct word to describe my feelings.

449
00:29:51,983 --> 00:29:54,966
From an occupational viewpoint, I guess it's hard.

450
00:29:54,966 --> 00:29:58,150
What do you think, Higashimura-san?

451
00:29:58,723 --> 00:30:00,529
For me...

452
00:30:02,707 --> 00:30:06,879
it's rather... hard.

454
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,460
I'm back.

455
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:29,971
I guess it's too early to say that?

456
00:30:30,531 --> 00:30:33,099
Sorry to ask you here amidst your busy schedule.

457
00:30:33,099 --> 00:30:34,766
No problem.

458
00:30:38,872 --> 00:30:42,745
Time flies. I'll be flying to Malaysia a week from today.

459
00:30:42,745 --> 00:30:47,045
Oh, right. I've brought some Malaysian desserts.

460
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:48,215
Thanks.

It's delicious but hard to find in Japan.

00:31:12,237 --> 00:31:13,937
It's good.

I... can't get married.

468
00:31:36,001 --> 00:31:40,265
What you mean is... generally, you can't get married?

469
00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:42,368
Or you can't get married to me?

470
00:31:43,901 --> 00:31:46,087
With you, Hayate.

471
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:50,264

00:31:55,058 --> 00:31:56,858
Very well.

The problem doesn't lie with you.

474

Is it Higashimura-san?

475
00:32:11,121 --> 00:32:13,319

476
00:32:14,366 --> 00:32:16,066
No.

477
00:32:16,797 --> 00:32:19,173
I haven't met him since that day.

478
00:32:19,173 --> 00:32:21,565
So it's not about him at all.

479
00:32:23,486 --> 00:32:26,577
- But...
- Then marry me.

ever since we were young.

490
00:33:08,446 --> 00:33:11,819
More than anyone, you didn't want to hurt us,

491
00:33:12,531 --> 00:33:15,450
and didn't want to see anyone cry.

492
00:33:16,881 --> 00:33:19,567
You were really like family.

00:36:21,148 --> 00:36:22,347
The groom's daughter

534
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:25,151
will be sitting at the family-reserved seats.

535
00:36:25,777 --> 00:36:28,518
She's probably lonely sitting there by herself.

537
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,332
Thank you very much.

538
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:08,006
Okay.

final credits

540
00:37:27,735 --> 00:37:29,516
Enough.

541
00:37:30,412 --> 00:37:32,339
This is good enough.

542
00:37:32,886 --> 00:37:35,298
Thank you for coming today.

543
00:37:35,298 --> 00:37:38,419
We look forward to your blessing.

544
00:37:39,413 --> 00:37:42,147
Mother, can you hear me?

545
00:37:42,147 --> 00:37:44,234
Good.

546
00:37:44,234 --> 00:37:46,927
Are you two ready?

547
00:37:46,927 --> 00:37:48,894
- Yes.
- Yes.

548
00:37:55,075 --> 00:37:59,161
All right everyone, this is the moment we've all been waiting for.

549
00:37:59,161 --> 00:38:02,409
Please welcome the bride and groom!

550
00:38:24,137 --> 00:38:26,290
Seita-san?

551
00:38:33,347 --> 00:38:35,433
W-Why are you here?

552
00:38:37,297 --> 00:38:40,833
I need to tell you something.

553
00:38:42,977 --> 00:38:44,777
Well...

554
00:38:45,825 --> 00:38:48,742
Will you be the "dad"?

555
00:38:48,742 --> 00:38:50,161
Excuse me?

556
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:52,665
You don't have to be a mom.

557
00:38:52,665 --> 00:38:54,833
We can have two dads in the family.

558
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:57,325
I can also be the "mom" at times.

559
00:38:57,325 --> 00:38:59,994
Our new family need not take any form.

560
00:38:59,994 --> 00:39:03,731
We don't need to have a normal marriage.

561
00:39:03,731 --> 00:39:05,631
Are you okay with that?

562
00:39:05,631 --> 00:39:07,499
Seita-san...

563
00:39:07,499 --> 00:39:13,974

C-Come to think about it,

565
00:39:15,796 --> 00:39:18,913
proposing to you right here is kind of crazy,

566
00:39:18,913 --> 00:39:23,282
so our marriage itself is not normal in the first place.

567
00:39:23,282 --> 00:39:25,511
I don't know how to say this to you.

568
00:39:25,511 --> 00:39:29,980
That's right. I don't really know what you mean.

569
00:39:30,432 --> 00:39:34,138
I don't understand you, but I want to try.

570
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:36,918
More than anyone else.

571
00:39:36,918 --> 00:39:41,240
I want to hear what you have to say.

572
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:44,471
Then, please listen.

573
00:39:47,074 --> 00:39:49,629
I love you,

574
00:39:49,629 --> 00:39:52,112
to the point that it's not normal.

575
00:39:55,249 --> 00:39:59,949
Will you... please marry me?

576
00:40:07,494 --> 00:40:08,794
Yes.

<i>I will continue working and retain my maiden name, which my patients know and trust by.</i>

594
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,883
<i>Our lifestyles are also different from each other.</i>

595
00:41:37,883 --> 00:41:43,844
However, we will have each other in our hearts.

596
00:41:43,844 --> 00:41:47,271
That is definitely without a doubt.

597
00:41:48,821 --> 00:41:50,110
To be honest,

598
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:53,630
the procedures for these arrangements were no joke.

599
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:57,744
But one thing that we're certain,

600
00:41:57,744 --> 00:42:03,246
is our feelings for each other at this moment.

601
00:42:05,045 --> 00:42:07,759
Given my age right now,

602
00:42:07,759 --> 00:42:10,731
it's hard to see what future we will have.

603
00:42:10,731 --> 00:42:15,771
But as long as we can live each day with happiness,

604
00:42:15,771 --> 00:42:18,974
it's more than enough for us.

605
00:42:18,974 --> 00:42:21,161
I beseech all of you

606
00:42:21,161 --> 00:42:25,274

00:44:03,731 --> 00:44:06,711

00:44:08,821 --> 00:44:11,477
<i>Nijiro, were you dumped by Kanna?</i>

633

Now I understand how you feel, Hayate Sensei.

634
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:17,055
Oops, sorry!

635
00:44:17,055 --> 00:44:19,055
<i>It's fine.</i>

636
00:44:19,055 --> 00:44:22,249
<i>Right now, I'm busy preparing to set up a school here.</i>

637
00:44:22,249 --> 00:44:24,982
<i>It's fun to be surrounded by children like you.</i>

<i>Besides, Nijiro...</i>

640
00:44:28,936 --> 00:44:34,228
The only love that's sustainable, is a love that didn't work out.

641
00:44:39,399 --> 00:44:41,668
All right, let's move on to the next pose.

642
00:44:41,668 --> 00:44:43,804
Place your elbow on your thigh,

643
00:44:43,804 --> 00:44:48,731
and extend your other arm over your head.

644
00:44:48,731 --> 00:44:51,967
Look up towards the sky.

645
00:44:51,967 --> 00:44:55,822
Nijiro, have you packed your luggage? You're going over to Osaka tomorrow, right?

646
00:44:55,822 --> 00:44:59,051
Mom has everything over there, so I can just go empty-handed.

647
00:44:59,051 --> 00:45:01,655
- What about your homework?
- I'm doing it with Kyoka-chan later.

648
00:45:01,655 --> 00:45:04,337
I see. Okay, thanks.

649
00:45:04,337 --> 00:45:07,661
In yoga, there is a belief

650
00:45:07,661 --> 00:45:12,161
that our uniqueness is created by others.

651
00:45:14,241 --> 00:45:17,744
None of you know what that means, right?

652
00:45:20,741 --> 00:45:22,880
Neither did I.

653
00:45:23,579 --> 00:45:27,971
But I only figured it out after meeting a person.

654
00:45:29,917 --> 00:45:34,692
When we entrust ourselves to nature and the passage of time,

655
00:45:34,692 --> 00:45:37,312
and live peacefully

656
00:45:37,312 --> 00:45:40,583
with others and within ourselves,

657
00:45:42,577 --> 00:45:44,836
when we turn around,

658
00:45:45,439 --> 00:45:50,143
we have created a path that we can call our own.

659
00:45:52,265 --> 00:45:56,087
Lastly, we'll end the session by taking a deep breath.

660
00:45:56,087 --> 00:45:57,857
Breathe in.

661
00:45:59,986 --> 00:46:03,199
