<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by

2
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:11,505
Good morning.

3
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:16,575
Mo-rn-ing.

4
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:18,915
Ex-cuse m-e.

5
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:55,985
<i>I think I have a right to look at your face.</i>

6
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,427
No way!

7
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,232
What was that?

8
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:22,421
- Sorry.
- Papa, are you okay?

9
00:01:22,421 --> 00:01:25,641
Since yesterday night, you've been acting weird.

10
00:01:25,641 --> 00:01:27,825
I'm not.

11
00:01:27,825 --> 00:01:29,590
I knew it was impossible.

12
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:32,175
About the camp?

13
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:36,400
Don't tell me that you are afraid of the courage test?

14
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,525
Of course not!

15
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:42,195
You know I have work to do.

16
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,055
Soy sauce.

17
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,985
Soy sauce!

18
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:52,335
Here you are.

19
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:57,215
Kyoka-chan, is something wrong?

20
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:02,415
What? Nothing at all.

21
00:02:02,415 --> 00:02:03,905
- Really?
- Yes.

22
00:02:03,905 --> 00:02:05,955
You didn't eat much yesterday night, too.

23
00:02:05,955 --> 00:02:10,565
Yes, it's weird. Hayate-kun made such delicious food for us.

24
00:02:10,565 --> 00:02:13,175
It's been a long time since I ate tempura.

25
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:16,935
That was extremely delicious. What was that?

26
00:02:16,935 --> 00:02:18,873
<i>Kisu.</i>
(<i>kisu</i>: whiting fish, same pronunciation as "kiss")

27
00:02:18,873 --> 00:02:22,442
The kisu tempura was the most delicious.

28
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:26,305
Is kisu named after the look of its mouth?

29
00:02:26,305 --> 00:02:29,665
The name of kisu comes from ancient Japan,

30
00:02:29,665 --> 00:02:31,652
and it has nothing to do with the English "kiss."

31
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:32,755
In Kansai,

32
00:02:32,755 --> 00:02:35,536
from the Middle Ages, it was recorded in the daily dictionary.

33
00:02:35,536 --> 00:02:39,336
You don't need to tell us that.

34
00:02:39,336 --> 00:02:41,885
Sorry, Hayate.

35
00:02:41,885 --> 00:02:44,365
I know you cooked a lot for us.

36
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:48,995
Pull yourself together!

37
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,725
Kyoka-chan.

38
00:02:51,725 --> 00:02:54,675
Hayate, are you also going out?

39
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,878
I got a reply just now.

40
00:02:57,878 --> 00:03:00,925
Here, the Indian restaurant.

41
00:03:00,925 --> 00:03:03,915
During its free time, you can use it for yoga class.

42
00:03:03,915 --> 00:03:06,275
Really?

43
00:03:06,275 --> 00:03:09,025
You really have good connections.

44
00:03:09,025 --> 00:03:11,485
I knew the owner when we were in India.

45
00:03:11,485 --> 00:03:13,585
Well, yoga is related to India, right?

46
00:03:13,585 --> 00:03:17,755
- Thank you, Hayate.
- My pleasure.

47
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:26,705
Why didn't you punch me away?

48
00:03:26,705 --> 00:03:28,975
Ah... why didn't I?

49
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:31,345
I've gotten used to it, the Caucasian style?

50
00:03:31,345 --> 00:03:33,779
Okay, time to go.

51
00:03:33,779 --> 00:03:35,545
I'm late for the bus.

52
00:03:35,545 --> 00:03:39,195
Am I supposed to feel happy about this?

53
00:03:41,195 --> 00:03:49,721
<i>[Is Love Sustainable?]</i>
<i>[Episode 6]</i>

54
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:53,845
Nijiro, are you going to the camp?

55
00:03:53,845 --> 00:03:55,885
I don't know. What about you, Kana-chan?

56
00:03:55,885 --> 00:04:00,385
I'm going. Let's go together. It will be fun!

57
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,665
What's wrong?

58
00:04:05,665 --> 00:04:10,145
If she doesn't like me, she won't invite me, right?

59
00:04:10,145 --> 00:04:13,615
Kana, she's so cute.

60
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,935
If she doesn't like you, she won't hug you, right?

61
00:04:20,935 --> 00:04:22,630
Hug?

62
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:25,883
She hugged me when I won the game previously.

63
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:29,032
How should I say it?

64
00:04:29,032 --> 00:04:31,443
It's just a friendly gesture overseas.

65
00:04:31,443 --> 00:04:33,843
But in Japan...

66
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,415
What was that exactly?

67
00:04:38,415 --> 00:04:42,295
No, it's not possible.

68
00:04:42,295 --> 00:04:45,945
Hayate Sensei, do you have someone you like as well?

69
00:04:45,945 --> 00:04:49,515
- Yes.
- What kind of person is she?

70
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:55,885
It's fun to be with her.

71
00:04:55,885 --> 00:04:58,050
Fun?

72
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:07,640
Well, she's careless, but easy-going and kind.

73
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,515
Onigiri comes in different shapes and sizes, too.
<i>(T/N: rice balls)</i>

74
00:05:11,515 --> 00:05:15,920
- That's right.
- So, it's Kyoka-chan?

75
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:20,565
Nijiro, you really know a lot about love.

76
00:05:20,565 --> 00:05:22,423
Of course.

77
00:05:22,423 --> 00:05:27,874
Actually, I was thinking of confessing my love to Kana-chan.

78
00:05:27,874 --> 00:05:32,868
The ambiance at the camp is different, and the mood will be right.

79
00:05:32,868 --> 00:05:35,107
Ambiance?

80
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,805
- Thank you for teaching me.
- You're welcome.

81
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:43,345
I will support you and Kyoka-chan.

82
00:05:43,345 --> 00:05:45,515
So, please also support me.

83
00:05:45,515 --> 00:05:47,245
Okay.

84
00:05:47,245 --> 00:05:49,425
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

85
00:05:49,425 --> 00:05:52,030
On a hill with a beautiful sunset,

86
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:53,954
you were kissed with a bang?

87
00:05:53,954 --> 00:05:55,575
<i>How lucky you are!</i>

88
00:05:55,575 --> 00:05:57,915
You are too loud.

89
00:05:57,915 --> 00:06:00,755
"I think I have a right...

90
00:06:00,755 --> 00:06:03,695
to look at your face."

91
00:06:03,695 --> 00:06:05,945
Nobody has ever said that to you before.

92
00:06:05,945 --> 00:06:09,195
- So, what happened after that?
- Nothing.

93
00:06:09,195 --> 00:06:10,265
<i>Huh!?!?</i>

94
00:06:10,265 --> 00:06:13,215
Just as usual, we parted our own ways at the station.

95
00:06:13,215 --> 00:06:15,325
- That's all.
- What?!

96
00:06:15,325 --> 00:06:17,865
What else do you expect?

97
00:06:17,865 --> 00:06:22,135
I don't know what to expect,

98
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:26,385
but I'm working hard to be independent now,

99
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:28,675
and I need to be responsible for Nijiro-kun.

100
00:06:28,675 --> 00:06:31,445
Maybe being ambiguous is the adult thing to do.

101
00:06:31,445 --> 00:06:34,055
What a waste.

102
00:06:34,055 --> 00:06:36,265
Now is the timing to be independent.

103
00:06:36,265 --> 00:06:39,945
You should just go ahead with the person you like. That would be great.

104
00:06:39,945 --> 00:06:42,195
You are young, so you can say that.

105
00:06:42,195 --> 00:06:43,625
Does it have anything to do with age?

106
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:46,755
For adults, you don't get together with someone just because you like him.

107
00:06:46,755 --> 00:06:48,966
When you are thirty, you need to have a strategy.

108
00:06:48,966 --> 00:06:51,946
Then you can change your life afterwards.

109
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:57,715
How do everyone get attached?

110
00:06:57,715 --> 00:07:01,485
The one over there. And over here, too.

111
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:08,400
It looks so easy for everyone to be attached.

112
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:10,870
I can understand that.

113
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:17,061
Akari-san, what was your dream when you were young?

114
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:21,085
I wish to be a wife to someone.

115
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,785
I'm not forcing you to get married.

116
00:07:24,785 --> 00:07:27,165
Really, I had that dream when I was young.

117
00:07:27,165 --> 00:07:29,925
I'm not sure why it has ended like this now.

118
00:07:29,925 --> 00:07:32,645
A wife to someone...

119
00:07:32,645 --> 00:07:35,460
It's unexpectedly normal.

120
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,735
If we get married,

121
00:07:37,735 --> 00:07:40,294
can I call you my "partner" instead?

122
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:45,480
It sounds awkward to call you my "wife".

123
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:49,235
What a gentleman you are.

124
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:52,965
In this case, I like to be fair.

125
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:59,290
The rain is getting heavier.

126
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:01,263
I'll hail a taxi from here to go home.

127
00:08:01,263 --> 00:08:05,760
- I'll take you home.
- No, I'm fine to go back alone.

128
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,735
Then see you again.

129
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,059
<i>It may sound gentlemanly.</i>

130
00:08:17,059 --> 00:08:21,605
<i>However, I don't know why, but I just felt a little weird about it.</i>

131
00:08:21,605 --> 00:08:25,475
Of course, you may feel a bit weird.

132
00:08:25,475 --> 00:08:28,040
Even though you were introduced by the marriage consultant,

133
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,275
you seldom discuss marriage when you meet for the first time.

134
00:08:31,275 --> 00:08:34,135
That's true.

135
00:08:34,135 --> 00:08:35,925
It would be good to meet again, right?

136
00:08:35,925 --> 00:08:37,717
What? Ah...

137
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:39,915
Thank you so much.

138
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,710
I feel more refreshed after talking to you.

139
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:45,325
Is that so?

140
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:51,595
How's your marriage hunting getting along?

141
00:08:51,595 --> 00:08:56,365
I'm busy with work recently, so I'm taking a break from it.

142
00:08:56,365 --> 00:08:58,445
You must be busy.

143
00:08:58,445 --> 00:09:02,765
Quite a bit. Besides the dictionary amendment, I have to prepare speeches

144
00:09:02,765 --> 00:09:05,679
and also sometimes appear on the radio.

145
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:10,045
On the radio? What do you talk about?

146
00:09:10,045 --> 00:09:13,185
I just answer the questions accordingly. It can be boring at times.

147
00:09:13,185 --> 00:09:17,645
That's right. Your work is to amend the dictionary.

148
00:09:17,645 --> 00:09:19,855
The more I think about it, your job is really marvelous.

149
00:09:19,855 --> 00:09:21,885
No, it's nothing great.

150
00:09:21,885 --> 00:09:24,365
If you are that busy, you don't have to spend time walking.

151
00:09:24,365 --> 00:09:25,995
I'm fine with it.

152
00:09:25,995 --> 00:09:29,915
I find it super enjoyable.

153
00:09:29,915 --> 00:09:32,123
"Super" enjoyable?

154
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,415
I've not used "super"

155
00:09:35,415 --> 00:09:38,435
for about two decades.

156
00:09:38,435 --> 00:09:40,805
Sorry to have used such an old term.

157
00:09:40,805 --> 00:09:44,435
It's really a great honor for me

158
00:09:44,435 --> 00:09:47,205
to be able to walk with a walking dictionary.

159
00:09:47,205 --> 00:09:49,345
- Shall we go?
- Let's go.

160
00:09:49,345 --> 00:09:52,965
When the back feels good, walking is a brisk, too.

161
00:09:52,965 --> 00:09:55,125
That's right. You can lift your leg easily.

162
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:56,926
Yes, you are right.

163
00:09:56,926 --> 00:09:59,696
<i>Higher!</i>

164
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:03,921
Hello!

165
00:10:03,921 --> 00:10:06,177
Hello.

166
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:09,910
Put your arms together,
<i>[Sahi Kahna]</i>

167
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:12,875
and bend your elbows.
<i>[Welcome, yoga lessons inside!]</i>

168
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:17,475
Then place your palms together,

169
00:10:17,475 --> 00:10:19,345
and lift your arms.

170
00:10:19,345 --> 00:10:21,585
Sensei, I cannot put my palms together.

171
00:10:21,585 --> 00:10:24,525
I can't do it too.

172
00:10:24,525 --> 00:10:29,135
If you can't, then you can just grab your thumb.

173
00:10:29,135 --> 00:10:33,655
- Oh, I can do it.
- This feels great.

174
00:10:33,655 --> 00:10:36,785
Do you have any other problems with your body?

175
00:10:36,785 --> 00:10:38,815
My legs are swollen.

176
00:10:38,815 --> 00:10:40,325
My whole body is swollen.

177
00:10:40,325 --> 00:10:41,650
I can see that.

178
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:43,640
You are annoying!

179
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:48,380
Then let's do a massage to reduce the swelling.

180
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:52,954
Lift your right foot and place it on your left calf.

181
00:10:52,954 --> 00:10:56,800
Then stamp on it.

182
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,115
Use the block, please.

183
00:10:59,115 --> 00:11:01,655
Please join us again.

184
00:11:01,655 --> 00:11:04,165
I'll be waiting. Thank you.

185
00:11:04,165 --> 00:11:06,795
Please join us again.

186
00:11:06,795 --> 00:11:09,885
- We will, definitely.
- See you next time.

187
00:11:09,885 --> 00:11:13,495
- Thank you so much for everything.
- I need to thank you, too.

188
00:11:13,495 --> 00:11:17,855
If the yoga students would frequent the restaurant, that would be great, too.

189
00:11:17,855 --> 00:11:23,005
Would you like to try my special curry lunch?

190
00:11:23,005 --> 00:11:24,610
Definitely.

191
00:11:33,115 --> 00:11:34,715
This is delicious.

192
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,225
<i>Curry is a great food.</i>

193
00:11:39,225 --> 00:11:43,175
<i>There are many spices, so it's like a herb concoction.</i>

194
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,500
He will like it for sure.

195
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:50,840
- Welcome.
- Kyoka-chan.

196
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,445
Hello.

197
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:15,725
I was just thinking that you might like this curry,

198
00:12:15,725 --> 00:12:17,225
and I'm shocked that you suddenly appeared.

199
00:12:17,225 --> 00:12:19,025
I often come here, because I like its saag curry.

200
00:12:19,025 --> 00:12:21,885
And Nijiro can eat it, too.

201
00:12:21,885 --> 00:12:24,695
Papa always says he wants to try other food,

202
00:12:24,695 --> 00:12:27,982
but he always ends up with the green-colored curry.

203
00:12:27,982 --> 00:12:29,715
That's right.

204
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:31,465
What curry is that?

205
00:12:31,465 --> 00:12:33,185
I think it's chicken curry.

206
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:34,955
Papa, how about trying one spoon of it?

207
00:12:34,955 --> 00:12:36,225
Eh?

208
00:12:36,225 --> 00:12:39,070
But that would be an indirect kiss.

209
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:40,900
Sorry.

210
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,600
What's wrong?

211
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,945
Nothing's wrong.

212
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:52,460
But it's a good idea to conduct yoga here.

213
00:12:52,835 --> 00:12:54,965
Hayate was the one who introduced me to the owner.

214
00:12:54,965 --> 00:12:57,355
He is a friend of the owner.

215
00:12:57,355 --> 00:12:59,005
You mean Fuwa-san?

216
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:05,385
Oh, yes! Kyoka-chan, are you free next weekend?

217
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:08,775
Why? Would you like to go camping with me?

218
00:13:08,775 --> 00:13:12,296
- Camping?
- Nijiro, what are you talking about?

219
00:13:12,296 --> 00:13:15,295
You and Mama can't go, right?

220
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:19,925
Hayate Sensei will also be there, so Kyoka-chan will be fine, too.

221
00:13:19,925 --> 00:13:21,485
Let me think...

222
00:13:21,485 --> 00:13:25,455
Sorry. The school has a camp, but I can't make it.

223
00:13:25,455 --> 00:13:27,435
Then, I will...

224
00:13:27,435 --> 00:13:30,605
You don't have to be bothered about it, really.

225
00:13:30,605 --> 00:13:32,885
I'll bring you for camping next time when I have time.

226
00:13:32,885 --> 00:13:34,925
There's no meaning to it!

227
00:13:34,925 --> 00:13:38,185
Sorry to keep you waiting. Nijiro, this is your usual favorite.

228
00:13:38,185 --> 00:13:40,625
Okay, your curry is here.

229
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,455
- I'm home.
- Welcome back.

230
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:50,755
Seems that it went smoothly. I got a call from Anik.

231
00:13:50,755 --> 00:13:53,275
I owe you a big thank you.

232
00:13:53,275 --> 00:13:57,555
I hope that there will be more students so that I can go independent.

233
00:13:57,555 --> 00:13:59,635
- Good luck to you.
- Thank you.

234
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:03,804
- Do you want to eat anything?
- I want fried rice.

235
00:14:03,804 --> 00:14:05,645
Okay.

236
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,785
Is your school having a camp soon?

237
00:14:10,785 --> 00:14:13,698
Eh? What did you say?

238
00:14:13,698 --> 00:14:17,865
I met Seita-san and Nijiro-kun by coincidence at Anik-san's restaurant.

239
00:14:17,865 --> 00:14:19,665
Really?

240
00:14:19,665 --> 00:14:21,755
They seem to be frequent customers.

241
00:14:21,755 --> 00:14:26,765
And then, Nijiro-kun invited me to go to the camp.

242
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:28,586
Nijiro, that boy.

243
00:14:28,586 --> 00:14:33,576
He looked pitiful when he knew he was unable to go.

244
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,145
But I don't know whether I should step in.

245
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,345
Oh my!

246
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,755
Sorry, I made a mess.

247
00:14:44,755 --> 00:14:48,985
It's so wet. Oh, it's so cold!

248
00:14:51,685 --> 00:14:53,525
Oh no!

249
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:58,431
- For you.
- Thank you.

250
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,355
Change the ambiance.

251
00:15:13,075 --> 00:15:15,525
Come to the camp.

252
00:15:15,525 --> 00:15:16,785
Eh?

253
00:15:16,785 --> 00:15:22,383
Because Nijiro wants to confess his love to a girl he likes.

254
00:15:22,383 --> 00:15:24,415
So, I hope that he can come.

255
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:26,505
A love confession?

256
00:15:26,505 --> 00:15:28,805
That's important.

257
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:34,625
Do you know that people go out without confessing their love in America?

258
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:37,505
Eh? Then how do they start going out?

259
00:15:37,505 --> 00:15:40,240
It's just a feeling.

260
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:44,175
You won't know that for sure, right?

261
00:15:44,175 --> 00:15:45,588
That's true.

262
00:15:45,588 --> 00:15:47,120
What?

263
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,505
Kyoka-chan, let's go to the camp together.

264
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,005
Yes, hello?

265
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:06,605
Yes, I'm okay to talk now.

266
00:16:06,605 --> 00:16:09,525
About the camp,

267
00:16:09,525 --> 00:16:11,505
I will go there.

268
00:16:11,505 --> 00:16:12,775
But you...

269
00:16:12,775 --> 00:16:15,125
I might be overdoing it,

270
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:18,515
but if it is a nuisance to you, please tell me directly.

271
00:16:18,515 --> 00:16:21,355
No, not at all.

272
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:25,755
It will be a great help, and Nijiro will be happy.

273
00:16:25,755 --> 00:16:29,045
But I'm afraid that it disrupts your busy work schedule.

274
00:16:29,045 --> 00:16:31,315
No, not at all.

275
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:36,905
Furthermore, I can promote my yoga classes at the camp.

276
00:16:36,905 --> 00:16:39,305
Will you be alright without Papa and Mama?

277
00:16:39,305 --> 00:16:43,526
Of course! I wanted Kyoka-chan to come with me, too.

278
00:16:43,526 --> 00:16:47,075
Why? Do you like Kyoka-san that much?

279
00:16:47,075 --> 00:16:49,675
It's Hayate Sensei.

280
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,465
We made a promise.

281
00:16:52,465 --> 00:16:55,425
I will support Hayate Sensei,

282
00:16:55,425 --> 00:16:58,655
and he will support me.

283
00:16:58,655 --> 00:17:00,565
What about you?

284
00:17:00,565 --> 00:17:03,655
I'm going to confess my love to the girl I like at the camp.

285
00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:05,805
Confess your love?

286
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,175
I see...

287
00:17:08,175 --> 00:17:11,785
But as an elementary student, what are you going to do after you confess your love?

288
00:17:11,785 --> 00:17:13,675
What do I need to do?

289
00:17:13,675 --> 00:17:15,915
After getting attached...

290
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:24,215
I just love you.

291
00:17:24,215 --> 00:17:27,645
I just want to tell her that.

292
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,206
Only that?

293
00:17:31,206 --> 00:17:34,346
Therefore, please let me go to the camp. I beg you.

294
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,055
I know. Good luck to you.

295
00:17:38,055 --> 00:17:41,335
Yeah!

296
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,700
<i>Let's go!</i>

297
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:58,795
<i>Okay.</i>

298
00:17:58,795 --> 00:18:03,555
We are here!

299
00:18:03,555 --> 00:18:07,485
Put your belongings in the tent and come to the open space.

300
00:18:07,485 --> 00:18:09,005
Are you ready to have fun?

301
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:11,955
<i>Yes!</i>

302
00:18:11,955 --> 00:18:13,645
Come on. Follow me.

303
00:18:13,645 --> 00:18:17,415
- Yeah!
- Nijiro-kun, this is such a nice place.

304
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,289
Nijiro-kun, shall we go?

305
00:18:30,289 --> 00:18:32,919
Wear your cap properly.

306
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,872
- How is it?
- Fantastic!

307
00:18:37,872 --> 00:18:41,400
It's my first time to sleep in a tent.

308
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,493
Kyoka-chan, please take care of Nijiro.

309
00:18:43,493 --> 00:18:45,822
- Sure!
- Wow!

310
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:50,212
Nijiro-kun, could you come here for a moment?

311
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:57,322
It's nice to have a treat, but it would be better to have a rest.

312
00:18:57,322 --> 00:18:59,763
We have no choice since it's the daughter of our business partner.

313
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:01,955
That's right.

314
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:11,789
<i>We've reached the camp safely. No worries!</i>

315
00:19:11,789 --> 00:19:14,759
<i>The camp site is wonderful.</i>

316
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:19,312
Higashimura-san.

317
00:19:19,312 --> 00:19:21,042
Hello.

318
00:19:21,042 --> 00:19:24,752
- It's been a long time.
- Indeed.

319
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:31,446
- Once again, I would like to congratulate you on your wedding.
- Thank you.

320
00:19:31,446 --> 00:19:34,962
It's all thanks to both of you, so I want to give you a treat today.

321
00:19:34,962 --> 00:19:38,162
I was surprised by how fast you decided to go ahead with the wedding.

322
00:19:38,162 --> 00:19:41,182
Actually, we went camping together...

323
00:19:41,182 --> 00:19:42,362
Stop it!

324
00:19:42,362 --> 00:19:44,912
I only said about going camping.

325
00:19:44,912 --> 00:19:49,112
At the camp, we were enjoying ourselves too much.

326
00:19:49,112 --> 00:19:51,732
So, you enjoyed yourselves at the camp?

327
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:54,212
Making food and setting up the tent together,

328
00:19:54,212 --> 00:19:56,602
you got to know each other fast.

329
00:19:56,602 --> 00:19:58,692
That's right.

330
00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:03,352
And in the tent, we did it.

331
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:07,040
Don't say that! It's making me embarrassed!

332
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,401
It's just a fact.

333
00:20:09,401 --> 00:20:12,812
I only said the truth.

334
00:20:12,812 --> 00:20:14,513
Ouch, ouch!

335
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:19,830
What's wrong? Are you all right?

336
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:22,755
Please excuse us. Are you all right?

337
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,080
Oh, come here. Come here!

338
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,900
Get it, get it!

339
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,612
Got it!

340
00:20:32,612 --> 00:20:35,922
Come on, Nijiro!

341
00:20:35,922 --> 00:20:39,692
- Congratulations!
- Well done, Niji-kun.

342
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:48,462
- Hayate Sensei, you are popular among the children.
- Not really.

343
00:20:48,462 --> 00:20:50,832
- You were cool.
- Thank you.

344
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:55,502
What's interesting about working with the kids?

345
00:20:55,502 --> 00:20:59,042
They are truly cute, and the kids are free.

346
00:20:59,042 --> 00:21:02,642
They do things against the adult's common sense, so you discover new things every day.

347
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,540
I see.

348
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:23,032
Now let's make dinner!

349
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:26,032
<i>Yeah!</i>

350
00:21:26,032 --> 00:21:27,942
We are cooking curry.

351
00:21:27,942 --> 00:21:30,426
Nijiro and Kana will do the explanation for us.

352
00:21:30,426 --> 00:21:32,242
<i>Yes!</i>

353
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,653
You will be divided into three teams to cook your own curry.

354
00:21:43,653 --> 00:21:47,523
We'll have a contest to see which curry is the best.

355
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,962
We'll now divide you into your groups.

356
00:21:55,962 --> 00:21:59,202
Firstly, Hayate Sensei is Team A.

357
00:21:59,202 --> 00:22:02,462
Mio Sensei is Team B...

358
00:22:02,462 --> 00:22:04,282
Papa!

359
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:19,895
Papa!

360
00:22:19,895 --> 00:22:23,452
Sorry that I'm late. I'm Nijiro's father.

361
00:22:23,452 --> 00:22:26,252
Nijiro, go on.

362
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:29,286
Have you finished your work?

363
00:22:29,286 --> 00:22:31,372
Yes, no problem at all.

364
00:22:31,372 --> 00:22:32,932
Please take note of the following.

365
00:22:32,932 --> 00:22:36,473
Please be careful when you cut the vegetables.

366
00:22:36,473 --> 00:22:40,673
Be careful with the knife.

367
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,150
Ready...

368
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:45,783
Go!

369
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:49,276
First, let's cut up the vegetables.

370
00:22:49,276 --> 00:22:51,716
Okay, let's do it.

371
00:22:51,716 --> 00:22:54,446
Wash the carrots.

372
00:22:54,446 --> 00:22:57,246
- The peeler is here.
- Kyoka-chan.

373
00:22:57,246 --> 00:22:59,170
Wash the potatoes over there.

374
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:01,300
Okay.

375
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:07,966
Ah, I cut wrongly.

376
00:23:07,966 --> 00:23:11,286
Don't worry. It will still taste good.

377
00:23:11,286 --> 00:23:13,066
Don't worry.

378
00:23:13,066 --> 00:23:15,154
Then let me cut the potatoes.

379
00:23:15,154 --> 00:23:17,637
Kana-chan, you can do the washing.

380
00:23:17,637 --> 00:23:20,207
Thanks, Niji-kun.

381
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:27,908
Hayate Sensei, you are good.

382
00:23:27,908 --> 00:23:30,529
- I know, right?
- This is going to be delicious.

383
00:23:30,529 --> 00:23:32,089
Yes.

384
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:38,406
Nijiro, cut the potatoes this size.

385
00:23:38,406 --> 00:23:42,536
- Look at yours.
- We won't lose for sure.

386
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:48,206
I want Hayate Sensei to win. Papa should help, too.

387
00:23:48,206 --> 00:23:51,306
I want both of them to get closer to each other.

388
00:23:51,306 --> 00:23:53,066
Is this the right thing to do?

389
00:23:53,066 --> 00:23:57,206
You need to be serious in a competition.

390
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:05,090
<i>[Banana]</i>

391
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:12,856
Looks delicious. The meat looks so tender.

392
00:24:12,856 --> 00:24:15,166
- Of course.
- It can melt in your mouth.

393
00:24:15,166 --> 00:24:17,867
Mango jam.

394
00:24:17,867 --> 00:24:20,967
This is definitely going to be delicious.

395
00:24:20,967 --> 00:24:22,424
Looks good.

396
00:24:22,424 --> 00:24:24,156
I've tried many recipes,

397
00:24:24,156 --> 00:24:27,852
but the sweetness of mango jam suits curries the best.

398
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:31,346
- This is delicious!
- Right?

399
00:24:31,346 --> 00:24:33,346
This is the best.

400
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:37,849
Chocolate is also good, but mango is the best.

401
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:41,756
Because it's naturally sweet.

402
00:24:41,756 --> 00:24:44,950
We are bound to win this.

Delicious.

I shall announce the results.

408
00:25:29,036 --> 00:25:32,527
The most number of votes goes to...

409
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:40,057
Team Banana!

410
00:25:40,057 --> 00:25:42,886
Mio Sensei, Nijiro and Kana are the winners!

411
00:25:42,886 --> 00:25:45,633
- Yes!
- Congratulations.

412
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:51,450
Papa is an idiot, a curry idiot!

413
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:56,690
Nijiro, you cannot easily give up something you like.

414
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:59,090
One, two!

415
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:06,080
It's so big! You are good.

416
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,700
One, two!

417
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:11,276
The girl in pink is cute.

418
00:26:11,276 --> 00:26:14,341
Did Hayate Sensei tell you?

419
00:26:14,341 --> 00:26:16,041
No.

420
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,746
Because you are always looking at her.

421
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:24,006
I cannot help it.

422
00:26:24,006 --> 00:26:29,526
Even if I have many friends, I can't help but notice her.

423
00:26:29,526 --> 00:26:32,966
And I always hear her voice.

424
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,809
I'll carry that.

425
00:26:36,809 --> 00:26:38,529
Okay.

426
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,446
Where should I put it?

427
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:48,986
Thank you.

428
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:53,436
Are adults the same, too?

429
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:58,785
Age doesn't change that feeling.

430
00:26:58,785 --> 00:27:00,899
Kyoka-chan, I love you.

431
00:27:00,899 --> 00:27:04,090
What are you saying?

432
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:07,904
Love, love, love you.

433
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:09,785
Look, it's so pretty.

434
00:27:09,785 --> 00:27:12,525
Kana-chan is good.

435
00:27:12,525 --> 00:27:14,776
So many bubbles.

436
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:22,002
I think you are usually praised

437
00:27:22,002 --> 00:27:24,572
as the extremely beautiful female doctor.

438
00:27:24,572 --> 00:27:27,912
You are beautiful, both in your heart and appearance.

439
00:27:27,912 --> 00:27:29,552
Don't say that.

440
00:27:29,552 --> 00:27:33,541
There is too much emphasis on beautiful doctors and politicians,

441
00:27:33,541 --> 00:27:35,942
why is that so?

442
00:27:35,942 --> 00:27:40,484
But Akari-san is different.

443
00:27:40,484 --> 00:27:44,892
<i>Recently, the way of addressing the female spouse is difficult.</i>

444
00:27:44,892 --> 00:27:47,662
<i>Oku-san refers to a person behind you.
(T/N: Oku-san: wife)</i>

445
00:27:47,662 --> 00:27:49,732
<i>So, how shall we call our wives?</i>

446
00:27:49,732 --> 00:27:54,474
<i>Originally, the term "oku-san"</i>

447
00:27:54,474 --> 00:28:00,254
<i>refers to the person who is in charge of the household,</i>

448
00:28:00,254 --> 00:28:04,149
<i>and it shows a form of respect.</i>

449
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:10,762
<i>But the meaning has gradually changed to a person behind you.</i>

450
00:28:10,762 --> 00:28:11,732
<i>I see.</i>

451
00:28:11,732 --> 00:28:14,860
I also dislike calling my spouse "oku-san."

452
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,042
Can you please keep quiet?

453
00:28:17,042 --> 00:28:20,062
Hey, driver. Keep the radio down.

454
00:28:20,062 --> 00:28:23,432
No, I mean you.

455
00:28:23,432 --> 00:28:28,686
Sawada Sensei, what do you recommend calling your female spouse?

456
00:28:28,686 --> 00:28:30,786
M-My recommendation?

457
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:35,122
Anything would be appropriate.

458
00:28:35,122 --> 00:28:36,712
What? Anything?

459
00:28:36,712 --> 00:28:39,842
Sensei, I am counting on you.

460
00:28:39,842 --> 00:28:44,188
That's right. As long as you have respect for the other party,

461
00:28:44,188 --> 00:28:46,899
<i>and she feels that it is fine to call her by that name,</i>

462
00:28:46,899 --> 00:28:50,170
I think "oku-san" or "partner",

463
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:55,171
any name would be good if you give due respect.

464
00:28:55,171 --> 00:28:59,881
It's a little arrogant for me to just fix a term for someone.

465
00:28:59,881 --> 00:29:02,680
<i>- Sorry if I've not answered your question properly.
- No, no.</i>

466
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,670
<i>No, it's good.</i>

467
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:06,631
I see.

468
00:29:06,631 --> 00:29:08,714
That's what he meant.

469
00:29:08,714 --> 00:29:10,517
Excuse me.

470
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,252
It's fine to call me any names.

471
00:29:15,252 --> 00:29:18,222
But to call me as the extremely beautiful doctor is a little over-

472
00:29:18,222 --> 00:29:20,652
I'm not really happy about it.

473
00:29:20,652 --> 00:29:24,862
Eh? I was just complimenting you.

474
00:29:24,862 --> 00:29:26,292
I'm sorry.

475
00:29:26,292 --> 00:29:30,132
Excuse me, driver. Can you let me off here?

476
00:29:30,132 --> 00:29:33,133
Excuse me.

477
00:29:33,133 --> 00:29:35,973
- Your phone rang just now.
- Did it?

478
00:29:36,742 --> 00:29:38,752
<i>[Hinata Akari]</i>
<i>[One missed call]</i>

479
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:43,212
- Excuse me. I'll take my leave then.
- Thank you very much.

480
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:56,992
<i>Hinata here. The radio program was super interesting.</i>

481
00:30:19,572 --> 00:30:22,882
Are you okay? Your face is red.

482
00:30:22,882 --> 00:30:25,470
This is nothing to me.

483
00:30:25,942 --> 00:30:27,722
My face turns red easily.

484
00:30:27,722 --> 00:30:30,062
You should speak for yourself. You've been in here for long...

485
00:30:30,062 --> 00:30:32,962
I'm fine, because I like sauna.

486
00:30:32,962 --> 00:30:34,662
Okay.

487
00:30:40,012 --> 00:30:42,182
Ah, this feels good.

488
00:30:42,932 --> 00:30:45,032
You are right.

489
00:30:47,732 --> 00:30:50,132
I'm getting out.

490
00:30:52,982 --> 00:30:54,822
Fuwa Sensei.

491
00:30:59,282 --> 00:31:02,910
Let me take a rest.

492
00:31:05,499 --> 00:31:08,832
Papa, are you okay? It's the courage test later.

493
00:31:08,832 --> 00:31:11,602
I'm just a little dizzy from standing.

494
00:31:12,062 --> 00:31:14,355
Papa, I knew it. You must be scared of ghosts.

495
00:31:14,355 --> 00:31:16,952
Nijiro, I'll go.

496
00:31:16,952 --> 00:31:20,422
Nijiro-kun, I'll go with you for the courage test.

497
00:31:20,422 --> 00:31:21,980
Don't you want me to go with you?

498
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:22,943
It will be great.

499
00:31:22,943 --> 00:31:25,417
Then let's go together with Hayate Sensei.

500
00:31:25,417 --> 00:31:29,018
- Nijiro...
- If it were the three of us, I would not be scared.

501
00:31:29,018 --> 00:31:31,222
Seita-san, you can take a rest here.

502
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:33,722
I'll go on your behalf.

503
00:31:33,722 --> 00:31:36,121
Let's go.

504
00:31:36,121 --> 00:31:37,664
Wait...

505
00:31:37,664 --> 00:31:39,904
You are mistaken.

506
00:31:43,575 --> 00:31:49,213
Let's start the courage test in this <i>Haunted Forest</i>.

507
00:31:52,194 --> 00:31:55,465
There's a small shrine along the way.

508
00:31:55,465 --> 00:31:58,205
You need to take a card there

509
00:31:58,205 --> 00:32:02,005
and come back here to complete the mission.

510
00:32:02,005 --> 00:32:05,405
It's dark, so hold on to my hand.

511
00:32:07,261 --> 00:32:08,791
Are there ghosts?

512
00:32:08,791 --> 00:32:09,901
I don't think so.

513
00:32:09,901 --> 00:32:12,165
Can you open it?

514
00:32:12,165 --> 00:32:13,207
I'm scared...

515
00:32:13,207 --> 00:32:15,503
One, two!

516
00:32:20,507 --> 00:32:23,677
What a shock.

517
00:32:24,595 --> 00:32:26,435
Papa would be crying if he was here.

518
00:32:26,435 --> 00:32:29,122
- Seita, really?
- Yes.

519
00:32:29,122 --> 00:32:31,251
I see.

520
00:32:31,251 --> 00:32:34,602
What is this?

521
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:40,326
It's making my face wet.

522
00:32:48,834 --> 00:32:50,703
There it is!

523
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:57,840
<i>[Proof of Courage]</i>

524
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,213
Proof of courage.

525
00:33:00,213 --> 00:33:03,917
Good job. Now we only need to go back.

526
00:33:03,917 --> 00:33:07,712
This time, the both of you...

527
00:33:08,789 --> 00:33:11,049
I'm going first.

528
00:33:12,055 --> 00:33:13,815
Wait up, Nijiro-kun.

529
00:33:13,815 --> 00:33:17,415
Hayate Sensei, now it's your time to show your courage.

530
00:33:19,945 --> 00:33:22,925
They are holding hands.

531
00:33:22,925 --> 00:33:26,705
He's gone. Let's go after him.

532
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:32,345
It's dark, so let's hold hands.

533
00:33:32,345 --> 00:33:33,945
Eh??

534
00:33:35,305 --> 00:33:37,675
You are scared, right?

535
00:33:37,675 --> 00:33:39,955
Hmm... Yes.

536
00:33:39,955 --> 00:33:43,135
Guess I have no choice then. Let's go.

537
00:33:47,675 --> 00:33:51,331
Nijiro, he's thinking of putting us together.

538
00:33:51,331 --> 00:33:54,671
Why is he mistaken about our relationship?

539
00:33:56,515 --> 00:33:59,325
Do you really think he's mistaken?

540
00:33:59,325 --> 00:34:00,945
Eh?

541
00:34:06,908 --> 00:34:08,861
Kyoka-chan.

542
00:34:15,989 --> 00:34:17,327
Why?

543
00:34:18,175 --> 00:34:20,425
Look behind you.

544
00:34:21,628 --> 00:34:23,470
What is that?

545
00:34:24,131 --> 00:34:26,688
The children drew them.

546
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:29,515
They called them the daddy monsters.

547
00:34:29,515 --> 00:34:32,711
Yes, they have mustaches.

548
00:34:32,711 --> 00:34:36,321
They are looking over here. Aren't they cute?

549
00:34:41,395 --> 00:34:43,105
Be careful.

550
00:34:46,053 --> 00:34:48,009
It's scary.

551
00:34:48,009 --> 00:34:50,633
Don't do that!

552
00:35:02,344 --> 00:35:03,685
What was that?

553
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:05,675
Seita-san?

554
00:35:11,695 --> 00:35:13,845
Seita-san, it's really you.

555
00:35:18,765 --> 00:35:25,075
I thought that I would tag along. Where is Nijiro?

556
00:35:25,075 --> 00:35:27,505
He ran back first.

557
00:35:27,505 --> 00:35:29,227
That boy...

558
00:35:29,227 --> 00:35:31,315
I'm sorry.

559
00:35:31,945 --> 00:35:36,185
If you are scared, I'll hold your hand.

560
00:35:38,085 --> 00:35:39,885
I'm fine.

561
00:35:42,525 --> 00:35:44,065
It's not scary at all.

562
00:35:46,365 --> 00:35:48,415
Welcome back.

563
00:35:48,415 --> 00:35:51,915
Excuse me, can I trouble you to bring more firewood?

564
00:35:51,915 --> 00:35:55,045
Of course. Then I'll get going.

565
00:36:00,255 --> 00:36:02,245
Where is Nijiro?

566
00:36:02,245 --> 00:36:06,455
Nijiro-kun is working hard now.

567
00:36:13,595 --> 00:36:15,945
Ni-

568
00:36:15,945 --> 00:36:18,625
Let's hide behind the tree.

569
00:36:18,625 --> 00:36:21,195
And I want to say...

570
00:36:21,195 --> 00:36:23,385
Let me see.

571
00:36:24,634 --> 00:36:29,205
Kana-chan, it's always nice and warm to be with you.

572
00:36:29,205 --> 00:36:31,525
I always find it enjoyable.

573
00:36:32,085 --> 00:36:34,285
Is it? Thank you.

574
00:36:35,515 --> 00:36:37,245
Therefore,

575
00:36:37,995 --> 00:36:41,745
can you...

576
00:36:42,755 --> 00:36:46,685
I want to be with you, and then...

577
00:36:48,425 --> 00:36:49,934
And so?

578
00:36:53,505 --> 00:36:55,345
Go on!

579
00:36:59,835 --> 00:37:02,145
And so,

580
00:37:06,075 --> 00:37:08,175
I like you.

581
00:37:08,175 --> 00:37:12,270
I really like you, Kana-chan.

582
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:14,765
Yes!

583
00:37:34,235 --> 00:37:37,115
Okay, you can be my boyfriend.

584
00:37:37,115 --> 00:37:39,025
Kana-chan!

585
00:37:53,005 --> 00:37:57,775
However, I don't know if we will get married.

586
00:37:57,775 --> 00:38:01,670
I don't fall in love just to get married.

587
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:03,936
What?!

588
00:38:12,026 --> 00:38:14,242
<i>Wah...</i>

589
00:38:15,305 --> 00:38:17,485
Papa!

590
00:38:17,485 --> 00:38:20,992
A mood spoiler will not become popular.

591
00:38:20,992 --> 00:38:22,712
Popular...

592
00:38:24,523 --> 00:38:26,613
You've done well.

593
00:38:27,525 --> 00:38:29,125
Yes.

594
00:38:32,745 --> 00:38:35,435
So, we've reached our bedtime.

595
00:38:35,435 --> 00:38:37,232
Everyone, you've had a long day.

596
00:38:37,232 --> 00:38:39,425
Thank you very much.

597
00:38:39,425 --> 00:38:42,575
Please return to your tents to rest.

598
00:38:42,575 --> 00:38:46,205
- Goodnight.
<i>- Goodnight!</i>

599
00:38:50,955 --> 00:38:53,285
I will sleep in my car.

600
00:38:53,285 --> 00:38:55,543
- But...
- Papa, do you have a pillow?

601
00:38:55,543 --> 00:38:59,385
Pillow? I can just roll my clothes into a pillow.

602
00:38:59,385 --> 00:39:01,415
I see.

603
00:39:06,215 --> 00:39:08,815
Nijiro, I'm relying on you.

604
00:39:11,218 --> 00:39:13,605
Then I'm going to sleep in Kana-chan's tent.

605
00:39:13,605 --> 00:39:15,655
What are you talking about? You can't do that.

606
00:39:15,655 --> 00:39:18,245
Kana-chan's mother said that I can sleep over, right?

607
00:39:18,245 --> 00:39:21,515
Yes, I'm fine with it.

608
00:39:21,515 --> 00:39:23,601
Kana is also looking forward to it.

609
00:39:23,601 --> 00:39:25,285
But...

610
00:39:25,285 --> 00:39:28,115
Niji-kun, let's go.

611
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:29,850
Wait up, Ni-

612
00:39:30,485 --> 00:39:32,765
Goodnight then.

613
00:39:33,255 --> 00:39:36,325
- Sorry to bother you.
- Don't worry about it.

614
00:39:50,105 --> 00:39:53,025
Do you want to get some tea?

615
00:39:54,075 --> 00:39:55,875
Okay.

616
00:40:15,895 --> 00:40:19,505
It's nice to come to such places sometimes.

617
00:40:27,892 --> 00:40:29,429
Well...

618
00:40:29,429 --> 00:40:30,797
Yes?

619
00:40:30,797 --> 00:40:32,447
I am...

620
00:40:33,405 --> 00:40:37,615
totally fine about what happened that day.

621
00:40:37,615 --> 00:40:39,573
But...

622
00:40:39,573 --> 00:40:42,273
You don't have to feel bothered about it.

623
00:40:43,525 --> 00:40:45,655
Just act as normal.

624
00:40:50,435 --> 00:40:52,565
But I want you to feel something about it.

625
00:40:55,115 --> 00:40:56,915
I am really...

626
00:40:58,565 --> 00:41:01,075
deep in thoughts about it.

627
00:41:02,675 --> 00:41:04,425
Seita.

628
00:41:05,225 --> 00:41:07,715
Without considering marriage,

629
00:41:08,245 --> 00:41:10,825
would you be my girlfriend?

630
00:41:14,975 --> 00:41:17,695
But Nijiro-kun...

631
00:41:17,695 --> 00:41:21,805
I will talk to him if necessary.

632
00:41:21,805 --> 00:41:25,265
He's my child, so I will handle him.

633
00:41:25,265 --> 00:41:27,665
Kyoka-san, you don't have to think about that.

634
00:41:27,665 --> 00:41:31,990
You still need to think about your work.

635
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:35,435
However, that's still a bit...

636
00:41:35,435 --> 00:41:38,265
I'm not being irresponsible,

637
00:41:39,685 --> 00:41:45,885
but can we not think about marriage and go out?

638
00:41:49,655 --> 00:41:53,365
Not thinking about marriage...

639
00:41:58,195 --> 00:42:02,705
Can't we just go out because we like each other?

640
00:42:14,585 --> 00:42:16,825
Frankly speaking,

641
00:42:18,425 --> 00:42:22,905
I wish to hold your hands.

642
00:42:25,045 --> 00:42:29,765
And I don't want other people to hold your hand.

643
00:43:08,565 --> 00:43:10,425
Me, too.

00:44:34,481 --> 00:44:38,028
He slept in my tent.

660

She's my girlfriend.

Okay.

668
00:45:05,925 --> 00:45:08,525
- Did you sleep well?
- Yes, I did.

669
00:45:08,525 --> 00:45:10,695
What about you?

670
00:45:12,379 --> 00:45:14,865

Yes, I think so too.

Kyoka-chan, you need to go for class later, right?

674
00:45:28,075 --> 00:45:31,578
Yes, I need to go after I put down my things.

675
00:45:31,578 --> 00:45:33,485
Good luck.

676
00:45:33,485 --> 00:45:36,148
I'll go buy some things and make dinner.
