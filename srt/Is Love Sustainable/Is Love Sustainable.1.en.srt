to overcome the hierarchical mindset of business.

182
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:44,751
A nickname?

183
00:12:44,751 --> 00:12:47,818
In that case...

184
00:12:47,818 --> 00:12:52,171
I'm Seita, spelled with the characters for "spring" and "tarou".

185
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:55,142
It's my actual name, but I'm drawing a blank otherwise.

186
00:12:55,142 --> 00:12:57,345
Nice to meet you all.

187
00:13:00,949 --> 00:13:04,753
My name is Kyoka, as in "apricot flower".

188
00:13:04,753 --> 00:13:06,755
Just as my name says,

189
00:13:06,755 --> 00:13:10,527
I was born on a rainy, spring day.
<i>(T/N: Apricots are in season when it rains)</i>

190
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:13,162
Nice to meet you all.

191
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:22,610
The deciding factor of any business is the number of sponsors.

192
00:13:23,405 --> 00:13:26,669
Your magnetism and charisma

193
00:13:26,669 --> 00:13:29,078
will be tested here.

194
00:13:29,078 --> 00:13:30,811
And now, some homework.

195
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:34,663
I'd like you all to reach out to a stranger by our next seminar.

196
00:13:34,663 --> 00:13:39,351
Any businessperson needs the charisma of a flirt.

197
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:41,644
A flirt?

198
00:13:42,268 --> 00:13:44,355
And charisma...

199
00:13:44,355 --> 00:13:48,890
Before we go, please open your introduction sheets.

200
00:13:49,463 --> 00:13:53,768
I'd like to ask why you have attended our seminar today.

201
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:56,496
Let's see...

202
00:13:56,496 --> 00:13:58,438
How about you, Seita-san?

203
00:13:58,438 --> 00:14:00,802
M-Me?

204
00:14:00,802 --> 00:14:03,516
Well, I...

205
00:14:03,516 --> 00:14:08,719
I currently work at a real estate agency.

206
00:14:08,719 --> 00:14:12,338
Two years prior, I was moved to our newer branch.

207
00:14:13,585 --> 00:14:15,822
And... Well...

208
00:14:15,822 --> 00:14:18,327
Do you dislike your current job?

209
00:14:18,327 --> 00:14:21,125
No, nothing like that.

210
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:25,910
Rather than focus on myself...

211
00:14:26,891 --> 00:14:30,072
I wish to focus on others...

212
00:14:30,072 --> 00:14:33,410
or rather, find a method of work that's kind to my family.

213
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:36,979
That is why I attended this seminar today.

214
00:14:36,979 --> 00:14:38,184
Others, huh?

215
00:14:38,184 --> 00:14:40,680
Your wife's lucky to have you.

216
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:44,420
I... have no wife.

217
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:47,224
Nor do I have any plans to get married.

218
00:14:47,224 --> 00:14:48,687
Thank you.

219
00:14:50,837 --> 00:14:53,629
Who shall we hear from next?

220
00:14:53,629 --> 00:14:55,162
How about you, Danny-san?

221
00:14:55,162 --> 00:14:59,665
In my case, I believe Japanese business...

222
00:15:06,507 --> 00:15:08,405
Excuse me!

223
00:15:09,755 --> 00:15:12,112
I'm sorry for earlier.

224
00:15:12,112 --> 00:15:13,833
Oh, not at all.

225
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:17,425
To tell you the truth, I'm a yoga instructor.

226
00:15:17,425 --> 00:15:20,422
Ah, so that's why...

227
00:15:20,422 --> 00:15:23,892
Yes, your posture bothered me.

228
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,144
My apologies.

229
00:15:33,736 --> 00:15:38,643
Well then... See you, Kyoka-san.

230
00:15:42,976 --> 00:15:45,110
<i>Magnetism and charisma...</i>

231
00:15:46,694 --> 00:15:48,779
Seita-san!

232
00:15:58,425 --> 00:16:03,254
Do you have time for a drink?

233
00:16:08,949 --> 00:16:17,736
<i>[Is Love Sustainable?]</i>
<i>[Episode 1]</i>

234
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,213
Now that we're settled...

235
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:21,815
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

236
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:24,971
- Seita-san.
- Kyoka-san.

237
00:16:25,846 --> 00:16:29,758
Adding the character for "rain" to my name reads "Kyoka-u".

238
00:16:29,758 --> 00:16:32,721
It means "springtime rain".

239
00:16:32,721 --> 00:16:35,429
"Kyoka-u"? That's the first time I heard this.

240
00:16:35,429 --> 00:16:39,734
That's natural. My dad's just a word geek.

241
00:16:39,734 --> 00:16:41,803
He makes dictionaries for a living.

242
00:16:41,803 --> 00:16:45,380
Wow, that's amazing.

243
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:48,176
Anything aside from work is beyond him, though.

244
00:16:48,176 --> 00:16:51,578
He can't even notice the smell of burning curry.

245
00:16:51,578 --> 00:16:53,922
Curry?

246
00:16:53,922 --> 00:16:56,350
My father and I live together.

247
00:16:56,350 --> 00:17:00,386
Our latest argument was about tonight's curry.

248
00:17:01,212 --> 00:17:03,859
Is he a single father?

249
00:17:03,859 --> 00:17:08,830
No, I moved back because my mother passed two years prior.

250
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:10,330
Really, all we do is fight.

251
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:11,930
Oh...

252
00:17:13,502 --> 00:17:17,099
Sorry, that must've sounded heavy.

253
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:18,672
No, it's fine.

254
00:17:19,297 --> 00:17:23,977
I think your father must be glad that his kind daughter is home.

255
00:17:23,977 --> 00:17:25,928
I'm only there for financial reasons.

256
00:17:25,928 --> 00:17:30,465
There was no better way to save money for a startup.

257
00:17:30,465 --> 00:17:33,188
Even my current job doesn't know about this.

258
00:17:33,188 --> 00:17:35,924
Is that what brought you to the seminar?

259
00:17:37,292 --> 00:17:40,261
In short, I'm not kind at all.

260
00:17:40,902 --> 00:17:44,182
- Rather, Seita-san...
- You're kind.

261
00:17:44,733 --> 00:17:48,837
After all, you cook for your father.

262
00:17:48,837 --> 00:17:52,506
I know it's difficult to cook for family

263
00:17:52,506 --> 00:17:55,409
- every single day.
- It's just curry.

264
00:17:55,409 --> 00:17:57,312
But curry is amazing!

265
00:17:57,312 --> 00:18:00,547
All its spices essentially make the curry a herbal medicine.

266
00:18:00,547 --> 00:18:04,552
Licorice, turmeric, cloves...

267
00:18:04,552 --> 00:18:07,446
it even contains coriander, which is cilantro seeds!

268
00:18:07,446 --> 00:18:09,191
I never knew...

269
00:18:09,191 --> 00:18:13,260
Right... Sorry, I just really like curry.

270
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:16,063
You made that quite obvious.

271
00:18:16,063 --> 00:18:17,592
I'm sorry.

272
00:18:17,592 --> 00:18:19,710
No, it was interesting.

273
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:27,807
<i>[Parent-Gacha]</i>

274
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:29,910
<i>"Parent-Gacha".</i>

275
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:35,082
<i>To lament about not being born to the right parents.</i>

276
00:18:35,082 --> 00:18:39,756
<i>Coined from the term "gacha", used primarily in video games.</i>

277
00:18:41,602 --> 00:18:46,192
<i>[Example : "My parent-gacha sucks."]</i>

278
00:18:49,431 --> 00:18:52,533
My parent-gacha sucks, huh?

279
00:18:54,217 --> 00:18:55,803
Okay, stop.

280
00:18:55,803 --> 00:18:59,878
I don't care about the seminar. Were there any nice guys around?

281
00:19:01,475 --> 00:19:04,146
No use asking Kyoka-san.

282
00:19:04,146 --> 00:19:05,879
Marriage is beyond her.

283
00:19:05,879 --> 00:19:08,417
Hey, isn't that Kazuma-kun's?

284
00:19:08,417 --> 00:19:11,420
Don't blame me if you two fight, and he leaves again.

285
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,519
Your doodling is atrocious, too.

286
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:16,849
Just break up. It's been four years, and I see no ceremony.

287
00:19:16,849 --> 00:19:18,258
You're wasting your time.

288
00:19:18,258 --> 00:19:21,964
It's more of a waste if I don't get married.

289
00:19:21,964 --> 00:19:26,331
Look. We already spent 10,000 yen on that.
<i>[Marriage Amulet]</i>

290
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,302
10,000?

291
00:19:28,302 --> 00:19:30,604
10,000 to get married? That's nothing.

292
00:19:30,604 --> 00:19:33,140
I'd pay anything for my life's greatest event.

293
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:36,411
Do we really need to try so hard?

294
00:19:36,411 --> 00:19:39,414
There are plenty of single guys out there.

295
00:19:39,414 --> 00:19:41,949
- Let nature handle it!
- Naive.

296
00:19:41,949 --> 00:19:44,753
Don't you realize you're over thirty?

297
00:19:44,753 --> 00:19:47,990
Nowadays, we women have to take the reins. Nature's beyond us.

298
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:51,193
I bet Kyoka-san's oblivious to marriage because she's at home.

299
00:19:51,193 --> 00:19:52,692
The opposite, actually.

300
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:55,330
Looking after my dad

301
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:59,300
makes me wonder why mom married him at all.

302
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,937
I'd love to ask her

303
00:20:01,937 --> 00:20:04,139
if she regrets her decision.

304
00:20:04,972 --> 00:20:07,075
<i>How's your dad been, anyway?</i>

305
00:20:07,075 --> 00:20:11,812
<i>Much better than when he acted like an empty husk.</i>

306
00:20:11,812 --> 00:20:14,516
<i>I don't blame him. Your mom was amazing.</i>

307
00:20:14,516 --> 00:20:18,186
<i>I remember she won a singing contest by dancing AKB.
(T/N: an idol group)</i>

308
00:20:18,186 --> 00:20:22,390
<i>She used to be an interpreter around the globe, right?</i>

309
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:25,381
<i>Yeah. But she settled down after marriage.</i>

310
00:20:25,381 --> 00:20:28,163
<i>She was living my ideal life.</i>

311
00:20:28,163 --> 00:20:30,265
I wonder if that's the case.

312
00:20:30,265 --> 00:20:33,168
She might have had other things she wanted to do.

313
00:20:33,168 --> 00:20:37,005
Maybe her dream was to become a mother.

314
00:20:39,608 --> 00:20:42,844
My mom was always the person

315
00:20:42,844 --> 00:20:46,315
who prayed for her family at shrines.

316
00:20:46,315 --> 00:20:52,895
- Same goes for her Tanabata wishing slip.
- I could never.
<i>(T/N: July 7th; write a wish, hang it on bamboo)</i>

317
00:20:52,895 --> 00:20:57,089
Same for me. I'll never live up to my mom.

318
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:01,163
I mean, how could I prioritize someone else?

319
00:21:01,163 --> 00:21:05,734
My priority now is a personal studio.

320
00:21:05,734 --> 00:21:09,169
One day I'll be doing yoga in the tropics,

321
00:21:09,169 --> 00:21:11,605
and want to fulfill my human destiny.

322
00:21:11,605 --> 00:21:14,774
Anything's better than your previous job. That left you dead.

323
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:16,108
It sure did.

324
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:19,982
Does that mean you'll never get married?

325
00:21:19,982 --> 00:21:24,152
I just don't want to force it.

326
00:21:24,152 --> 00:21:30,021
I'd rather fall in love with an ordinary, kind person.

327
00:21:30,021 --> 00:21:33,328
Most "ordinary, kind people" are looking to get married.

328
00:21:33,328 --> 00:21:36,764
Is there any person similar to you?

329
00:21:38,398 --> 00:21:40,379
There is.

330
00:21:40,933 --> 00:21:42,791
A bond of trust...

331
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:44,051
<i>At least, I think so.</i>

332
00:21:44,051 --> 00:21:47,609
is the very lifeline of all businesses.

333
00:21:47,609 --> 00:21:50,646
Investors are tough to crack.

334
00:21:50,646 --> 00:21:53,279
You must focus on your merits and demerits.

335
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:59,118
A logical presentation will help garner your investor's trust.

336
00:21:59,118 --> 00:22:02,788
How does this merit you? The investor?

337
00:22:02,788 --> 00:22:06,915
Find the perfect middle ground for a successful negotiation.

338
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:23,290
- Hey, it's fun!
- Wait!

339
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:26,640
It's fun.

340
00:22:42,763 --> 00:22:44,432
Oh, good evening.

341
00:22:44,432 --> 00:22:49,064
I was recalling the fun I use to have, frolicking in the rain as children.

342
00:22:49,064 --> 00:22:51,007
I see.

343
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:15,379
I never realized how soft springtime showers are.

344
00:23:18,833 --> 00:23:21,703
So this is what a "Kyoka-u" feels like.

345
00:23:26,597 --> 00:23:28,744
You've reminded me

346
00:23:28,744 --> 00:23:32,247
that rain isn't so bad after all.

347
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:05,486
Thank you.

348
00:24:08,749 --> 00:24:11,083
Are you hungry?

349
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:14,920
Yes, very.

350
00:24:20,928 --> 00:24:22,970
Shall we grab a bite somewhere?

351
00:24:23,978 --> 00:24:25,799
Yes.

352
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:27,601
Then I've got just the place.

353
00:24:35,375 --> 00:24:39,046
Anyone can make curry, but they'll all taste different.

354
00:24:39,046 --> 00:24:42,216
Family recipes and whatnot, you know?

355
00:24:42,216 --> 00:24:45,085
This store uses an original spice blend,

356
00:24:45,085 --> 00:24:48,354
including one called mace.

357
00:24:53,597 --> 00:24:56,430
Oh no, was it too spicy?

358
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:59,444
Um, I have a proposal.

359
00:24:59,444 --> 00:25:00,853
Yes?

360
00:25:02,048 --> 00:25:07,040
I think we're quite an unusual pair, no?

361
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,209
How so?

362
00:25:09,209 --> 00:25:14,213
For one, I dream to open my own yoga studio.

363
00:25:14,213 --> 00:25:18,797
Seeing as I have a goal, I have no desire to get married currently.

364
00:25:18,797 --> 00:25:20,521
I... see?

365
00:25:20,521 --> 00:25:27,425
One of my biggest merits is that I'd never pressure a man into marriage.

366
00:25:27,425 --> 00:25:28,193
Right.

367
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:30,776
As for my demerits,

368
00:25:30,776 --> 00:25:36,081
I'm sloven, messy, and can't take care of myself,

369
00:25:36,081 --> 00:25:39,405
let alone a husband.

370
00:25:39,405 --> 00:25:41,508
If anything, I'd like a wife.

371
00:25:41,508 --> 00:25:43,270
A wife...

372
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:44,978
Someone who loves to redecorate,

373
00:25:44,978 --> 00:25:48,681
who's good at dividing plastics for recycling,

374
00:25:48,681 --> 00:25:51,819
and organizing.

375
00:25:51,819 --> 00:25:54,475
- That I understand.
- Right?

376
00:25:54,475 --> 00:25:58,871
In other words, my demerits are your merits.

377
00:25:58,871 --> 00:25:59,830
Pardon?

378
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:04,282
I mean, you have no desire to get married either, correct?

379
00:26:04,282 --> 00:26:09,002
In other words, I see no reason why we shouldn't go out.

380
00:26:09,002 --> 00:26:10,460
Huh?

381
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:14,274
Would you please go out with me

382
00:26:14,274 --> 00:26:17,268
without marriage in mind?

383
00:26:17,268 --> 00:26:18,943
Excuse me?

384
00:26:20,047 --> 00:26:22,267
Erm...

385
00:26:23,128 --> 00:26:26,532
W-Well... but... I'm...

386
00:26:26,532 --> 00:26:28,420
Uh...

387
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,691
Is that a no?

388
00:26:30,691 --> 00:26:31,857
U-Um...

389
00:26:31,857 --> 00:26:34,437
I get it.

390
00:26:34,437 --> 00:26:36,464
No worries, it's no big deal.

391
00:26:36,464 --> 00:26:38,801
Sorry, I made it sound all businesslike.

392
00:26:38,801 --> 00:26:42,660
- That's not-
- I really overthought this.

393
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:44,538
Sorry.

394
00:26:44,538 --> 00:26:46,740
I'm a single father.

395
00:26:48,624 --> 00:26:50,065
Huh?

396
00:26:50,611 --> 00:26:54,226
I'm once divorced with a son.

397
00:26:54,226 --> 00:26:56,895
He's in second grade.

398
00:26:56,895 --> 00:27:01,499
So marriage is a bit...

399
00:27:03,469 --> 00:27:06,271
I... see.

400
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:13,112
I can't focus on my own dreams

401
00:27:13,112 --> 00:27:17,048
or goals like you anymore.

402
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:22,442
Right now, my son takes priority.

403
00:27:24,223 --> 00:27:29,583
However, working an office job doesn't make parenting easy.

404
00:27:29,583 --> 00:27:34,311
I attended the seminar in hopes of finding a better way

405
00:27:34,311 --> 00:27:38,816
to balance my work and home life.

406
00:27:38,816 --> 00:27:41,324
To focus on others, was it?

407
00:27:41,324 --> 00:27:43,108
Yes...

408
00:27:43,108 --> 00:27:45,026
Or rather, my son.

409
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:51,970
Therefore, you're wasted on someone like me.

410
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:53,319
You'd be better off-

411
00:27:53,319 --> 00:27:59,306
Do you pray for your family's health and happiness at shrines?

412
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:02,088
Yes?

413
00:28:02,088 --> 00:28:04,586
And use your Tanabata slip for them?

414
00:28:04,586 --> 00:28:07,755
I-I guess so.

415
00:28:08,683 --> 00:28:10,885
How lovely.

416
00:28:13,004 --> 00:28:17,384
I'm sure your son adores you.

417
00:28:20,934 --> 00:28:26,721
I respect people like you since I simply can't do the same.

418
00:28:29,529 --> 00:28:31,723
Thank you.

419
00:28:33,558 --> 00:28:36,961
Hearing that cheers me up.

420
00:28:44,803 --> 00:28:47,374
- Shall we-
- Forget everything I-

421
00:28:48,061 --> 00:28:49,859
You first.

422
00:28:51,287 --> 00:28:55,500
Shall we start as friends?

423
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,757
- Friends?
- Yes. Friends.

424
00:28:58,757 --> 00:29:01,052
Friends...

425
00:29:01,052 --> 00:29:03,875
For one, let's exchange Line IDs.

426
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:06,246
As friends?

427
00:29:06,246 --> 00:29:08,748
As friends.

428
00:29:09,983 --> 00:29:11,752
Here's my ID.

429
00:29:11,752 --> 00:29:13,761
Thank you.

430
00:29:15,232 --> 00:29:16,890
And added.

431
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:19,104
Text me if you need me.

432
00:29:19,104 --> 00:29:20,612
If I need you?

433
00:29:20,612 --> 00:29:22,441
Or if you just want to.

434
00:29:22,441 --> 00:29:26,210
All right, I will.

435
00:29:30,787 --> 00:29:34,016
<i>[Thank you, Dad]</i>

436
00:29:48,689 --> 00:29:52,163

437
00:29:52,703 --> 00:29:54,689
Dad!

438
00:29:55,963 --> 00:29:58,465
Your phone's ringing.

439
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,794
Oh, I dozed off.

440
00:30:02,794 --> 00:30:04,519
Thanks.

441
00:30:05,272 --> 00:30:08,109
<i>[Kyoka Sawada: Thank you for inviting me out today. The curry was delicious.]</i>

442
00:30:12,946 --> 00:30:20,072
<i>[Likewise, thank you for joining!]</i>

443
00:30:21,466 --> 00:30:23,368
Work again?

444
00:30:23,368 --> 00:30:25,494
Is it from the department head?

445
00:30:25,494 --> 00:30:26,772
Huh? No.

446
00:30:26,772 --> 00:30:29,307
From an important friend.

447
00:30:32,527 --> 00:30:35,160
Wait... something stinks.

448
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,997
Did you shampoo properly?

449
00:30:36,997 --> 00:30:38,806
I-I did.

450
00:30:38,806 --> 00:30:40,245
No, I'll wash them.

451
00:30:40,245 --> 00:30:43,744
No! You get bubbles in my face!

452
00:30:43,744 --> 00:30:47,840
- No! No!
- I got you, Mister!

453
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:51,416
- I'm home.
- Welcome back.

454
00:30:51,416 --> 00:30:53,554
What are you doing?

455
00:30:53,554 --> 00:30:58,369
Tried my hand at cooking... no, "prepping" curry.

456
00:30:58,369 --> 00:31:02,083
Either way, what's with your sudden gusto?

457
00:31:02,083 --> 00:31:04,676
I'll do my share of chores,

458
00:31:04,676 --> 00:31:07,346
so feel free to get married. I'll manage.

459
00:31:07,346 --> 00:31:08,834
Huh?

460
00:31:08,834 --> 00:31:13,885
Weren't you home late because of a boyfriend?

461
00:31:13,885 --> 00:31:16,241
Of course not.

462
00:31:16,241 --> 00:31:19,458
- Just leave me be.
- How could I?

463
00:31:19,458 --> 00:31:22,082
So? How about getting married?

464
00:31:22,082 --> 00:31:24,960
How about it?

465
00:31:26,053 --> 00:31:29,101
Dad, what even is marriage?

466
00:31:29,101 --> 00:31:32,771
- Huh?
- What does the dictionary say?

467
00:31:32,771 --> 00:31:35,858
T-The dictionary?

468
00:31:35,858 --> 00:31:38,110
Let's see...

469
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:41,064
"When a man and a woman get married"...?

470
00:31:41,064 --> 00:31:45,037
That's like describing "idiot" with "stupid".

471
00:31:45,939 --> 00:31:50,717
Dad, how would you define marriage?

472
00:31:51,893 --> 00:31:53,747
I still don't know.

473
00:31:53,747 --> 00:31:56,814
- Still?
- Anyhow, you should get married.

474
00:31:56,814 --> 00:31:59,219
Why are you all about marriage today?

475
00:31:59,219 --> 00:32:04,459
Because if lousy parent-gacha is the reason you don't, how can I die easily?

476
00:32:04,459 --> 00:32:06,516
What are you saying?

477
00:32:06,516 --> 00:32:09,986
Mom's finally living it up in heaven.

478
00:32:09,986 --> 00:32:12,132
Mom's pitiful if you die now.

479
00:32:12,132 --> 00:32:14,455
I've practically died once already.

480
00:32:14,455 --> 00:32:17,271
Stop talking about dying.

481
00:32:17,271 --> 00:32:20,238
You're only convincing me not to marry.

482
00:32:20,972 --> 00:32:25,791
All you do is obsess over words, with no life skills to your name.

483
00:32:25,791 --> 00:32:30,625
Where was your motive to cook while mom was alive?

484
00:32:30,625 --> 00:32:34,158
Jeez, was she happy at all?

485
00:32:40,794 --> 00:32:42,496
Sorry.

486
00:32:44,135 --> 00:32:47,171
But seriously, no more talk of dying.

487
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:52,183
She's already been gone for two years.

488
00:32:54,119 --> 00:32:58,056
Wait, you called a shrine for her second death anniversary, right?

489
00:32:59,997 --> 00:33:01,397
Uh oh.

490
00:33:26,119 --> 00:33:27,639
Right this way.

491
00:33:27,639 --> 00:33:30,810
Yes, right this way.

492
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:34,012
Sorry to suddenly push this on you, Auntie Chieko.

493
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,736
No worries. So, are you two getting along?

494
00:33:36,736 --> 00:33:38,852
Similar personalities and all.

495
00:33:38,852 --> 00:33:41,709
Similar? Far from it.

496
00:33:41,709 --> 00:33:43,911
Still, we're getting by.

497
00:33:46,416 --> 00:33:49,719
They were really such a wonderful couple.

498
00:33:49,719 --> 00:33:54,424
I've only known my parents after they were married.

499
00:33:54,424 --> 00:33:59,105
I can't even imagine how my father caught my mother's fancy.

500
00:34:00,105 --> 00:34:06,169
Before they got married, Rintaro-san was only a poor researcher.

501
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:08,938
Everyone was against it.

502
00:34:08,938 --> 00:34:11,785
But Yoko continued working despite the opposition,

503
00:34:11,785 --> 00:34:14,871
and they married with an income gap.

504
00:34:14,871 --> 00:34:17,389
That's quite a passionate affair.

505
00:34:21,026 --> 00:34:23,286
I never knew the story behind your marriage.

506
00:34:23,286 --> 00:34:27,656
Turns out, mom loved you as much as you loved her.

507
00:34:28,702 --> 00:34:32,438
Well, I guess that's a given, considering you got married.

508
00:34:33,406 --> 00:34:37,470
Then of course you'd still be mourning.

509
00:34:38,176 --> 00:34:42,081
Yoko-san's death isn't the only reason why I'm mourning.

510
00:34:43,102 --> 00:34:45,717
When Yoko-san died,

511
00:34:45,717 --> 00:34:50,260
a part of myself that she discovered died with her.

512
00:34:50,977 --> 00:34:54,229
I liked the version of myself

513
00:34:54,229 --> 00:34:57,765
that Yoko brought out of me.

514
00:35:03,036 --> 00:35:05,618
The meaning of marriage, was it?

515
00:35:05,618 --> 00:35:10,024
Truthfully, I still don't know.

516
00:35:10,677 --> 00:35:12,292
Huh?

517
00:35:13,914 --> 00:35:22,087
But I know I enjoyed meaningless conversations with Yoko.

518
00:35:26,964 --> 00:35:29,292
That was enjoyable.

519
00:35:39,606 --> 00:35:41,509

520
00:35:41,509 --> 00:35:43,635

The material things can go.

526
00:36:00,629 --> 00:36:05,700
I just promised Yoko-san we'd meet in another life.

527
00:36:17,477 --> 00:36:20,453

00:38:18,938 --> 00:38:20,467
<i>Sir, is something the matter?</i>

540
00:38:20,467 --> 00:38:22,069
- <i>Are you her manager?</i>
- <i>Yes, Sir.</i>

541
00:38:22,069 --> 00:38:24,971
<i>We are really sorry.</i>

542
00:38:29,543 --> 00:38:32,862
<i>Keep at it, okay? You'll be fine.</i>

543
00:38:34,281 --> 00:38:35,672
<i>Could you finish this today?</i>

544
00:38:35,672 --> 00:38:38,892
- <i>Of course. Leave it to me.</i>
- <i>Thanks.</i>

545
00:38:43,323 --> 00:38:45,552
<i>Keep at it!</i>

546
00:39:00,797 --> 00:39:02,999
<i>What's the matter?</i>

547
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:05,812
<i>You're almost done!</i>

548
00:39:05,812 --> 00:39:08,583
- <i>Let's both keep at it- </i>
- <i>I can't.</i>

549
00:39:10,175 --> 00:39:14,959
<i>Sawada-san, I'd rather not "keep at it" and become another you.</i>

Thirsty, okay. What's this one?

552
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:55,190
Yeah, very good, kid. What's this?

553
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:58,289
- Hello! Higashimura here.
- Sleepy.

554
00:39:58,289 --> 00:39:59,898
You're early today.

555
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:01,545
My afternoon plans were canceled.

556
00:40:01,545 --> 00:40:03,625
Is that so?

557
00:40:03,625 --> 00:40:05,550
Nijiro?

558
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:08,002
Nijiro!

559
00:40:08,002 --> 00:40:10,024
Daddy is here.

561
00:40:20,612 --> 00:40:22,625
Is it from work?

562
00:40:23,488 --> 00:40:27,318
Would you like to extend his stay? I'll be here until closing.

563
00:40:29,621 --> 00:40:32,890
Sorry, could you?

564
00:40:33,925 --> 00:40:36,928
Nijiro, your dad says work calls.

565
00:40:36,928 --> 00:40:39,606
Want to make a giant fort with me instead?

566
00:40:39,606 --> 00:40:40,838
Yes!

567
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:42,520
All right, Boy.

568
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:46,010
Have you ever been to the amazon?

569
00:41:03,928 --> 00:41:05,696
Kyoka-san?

570
00:41:05,696 --> 00:41:08,694
Seita-san! I'm so sorry.

571
00:41:08,694 --> 00:41:12,322
- You must've been busy.
- Actually, my day freed up.

572
00:41:13,438 --> 00:41:14,917
Is everything all right?

573
00:41:14,917 --> 00:41:19,353
Oh, this? I was at a memorial service earlier.

574
00:41:24,115 --> 00:41:28,541
You said I could reach out whenever, so...

575
00:41:28,541 --> 00:41:30,688
Oh, right...

576
00:41:30,688 --> 00:41:34,094
Sorry, the funeral getup feels awkward in most places.

577
00:41:34,094 --> 00:41:37,530
That's true...

578
00:41:39,533 --> 00:41:41,547
Welcome.

579
00:41:45,763 --> 00:41:47,865
I won't be ordering, thank you.

580
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,262
All right, shall we go?

581
00:41:52,262 --> 00:41:54,233
Huh? G-Go where?

582
00:41:54,233 --> 00:41:56,100
Let's go.

583
00:41:59,419 --> 00:42:02,422
So... Where are we headed?

584
00:42:02,422 --> 00:42:07,561
I thought it'd be nice to just hop on the first bus wherever.

585
00:42:07,561 --> 00:42:09,430
I see...

586
00:42:15,166 --> 00:42:18,869
Oh, that cloud looks like a turtle.

587
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:20,639
Huh?

588
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:24,642
Over there. Below the big cloud.

589
00:42:25,548 --> 00:42:27,302
Turtle, right?

590
00:42:32,827 --> 00:42:36,747
You've heard of sea turtles laying eggs on beaches, yes?

591
00:42:37,413 --> 00:42:41,328
If the sand is above 29.5 degrees Celsius, the baby is a female.

592
00:42:41,328 --> 00:42:44,562
Anything below becomes a male.

593
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:45,750
Really?

594
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:49,570
Does that mean global warming will turn all sea turtles female?

595
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:50,656
I suppose.

596
00:42:50,656 --> 00:42:53,188
- That's depressing.
- Is it?

597
00:42:53,188 --> 00:42:56,351
Of course.

598
00:42:56,351 --> 00:42:59,310
I mean, females as far as the eye can see?

599
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:01,912
That'd ruin the balance of nature.

600
00:43:02,798 --> 00:43:04,787
We're not on the same page, are we?

601
00:43:04,787 --> 00:43:08,217
While I don't wish to get married,

602
00:43:08,217 --> 00:43:10,024
I do prefer men.

603
00:43:10,024 --> 00:43:12,328
Oh, I assumed...

604
00:43:12,328 --> 00:43:14,461
You knew, right?

605
00:43:14,461 --> 00:43:17,855
- Sorry.
- Don't apologize.

606
00:43:19,902 --> 00:43:23,239
I've been thinking. No matter how long a marriage lasts,

607
00:43:23,239 --> 00:43:28,575
love is never guaranteed to be eternal, is it?

608
00:43:30,246 --> 00:43:32,882
Married couples need to work both ways.

609
00:43:32,882 --> 00:43:36,822
One side's love may last,

610
00:43:36,822 --> 00:43:41,132
but I guess it's difficult to remain mutual.

611
00:43:42,658 --> 00:43:46,451
Well, I'm divorced, so...

612
00:43:47,181 --> 00:43:49,231
- I'm sorry.
- No worries.

613
00:43:49,231 --> 00:43:55,074
Still... the fun I had while married wasn't a lie.

614
00:43:55,074 --> 00:43:59,873
So I look back on it as good times.

615
00:43:59,873 --> 00:44:02,107
Good times, huh?

616
00:44:07,511 --> 00:44:09,016
Let's bet.

617
00:44:09,016 --> 00:44:13,987
If the next man who boards is wearing a pink shirt, I'll buy you a drink.

618
00:44:13,987 --> 00:44:16,557
A pink shirt?

619
00:44:16,557 --> 00:44:18,559
Sounds unlikely.

620
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:21,061
Unlikely indeed.

621
00:44:23,897 --> 00:44:28,063
Sorry, we ended up in the middle of nowhere.

622
00:44:28,063 --> 00:44:32,908
"The time you enjoy wasting is not wasted time."

623
00:44:32,908 --> 00:44:34,705
Pardon?

624
00:44:34,705 --> 00:44:38,547
It's exactly as I said. Enjoying something isn't a waste.

625
00:44:38,547 --> 00:44:40,487
Profound.

626
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:46,221
I enjoyed our little bus ride.

627
00:44:46,221 --> 00:44:48,567
I'm glad to hear it.

628
00:44:49,892 --> 00:44:51,404
Woah.

629
00:44:58,565 --> 00:45:00,901
What a beautiful view.

630
00:45:00,901 --> 00:45:02,831
Agreed.

631
00:45:09,142 --> 00:45:14,247
We were mourning my mother today. She died three years ago.

632
00:45:14,872 --> 00:45:17,084
Your mother?

633
00:45:17,084 --> 00:45:20,474
I'm sorry I rambled about nonsense on such an important day.

634
00:45:20,474 --> 00:45:23,643
It wasn't nonsense to me.

635
00:45:25,427 --> 00:45:27,588
Far from it.

636
00:45:28,897 --> 00:45:31,830
You turned my day

637
00:45:32,416 --> 00:45:34,850
into a good one.

638
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:41,509
When was the last time I even saw a nice sunset?

639
00:45:42,778 --> 00:45:46,447
The free drink makes it all the better.

640
00:45:48,115 --> 00:45:50,711
I'm in the same boat.

641
00:45:50,711 --> 00:45:54,120
Usually, I'm too busy to watch sunsets.

642
00:45:55,571 --> 00:45:57,958
I must've forced you to join me.

643
00:45:57,958 --> 00:45:59,259
- I'm terribly sorry.
- Really, it's fine.

644
00:45:59,259 --> 00:46:03,486
That's what friends do.

645
00:46:06,902 --> 00:46:12,787
I feel like you draw out the kindness in me.

646
00:46:15,576 --> 00:46:17,989
Nonviolence is key.

647
00:46:17,989 --> 00:46:20,358
Did you turn into Gandhi?

648
00:46:21,648 --> 00:46:27,690
<i>One principal of yoga is "ahimsa," the idea of nonviolence.</i>

649
00:46:28,372 --> 00:46:31,391
<i>Indeed, one must not direct violence</i>

650
00:46:31,391 --> 00:46:34,563
<i>towards people.</i>

651
00:46:34,563 --> 00:46:39,259
<i>However, everyone is quick to forget that we're "people" ourselves.</i>

652
00:46:41,565 --> 00:46:44,807
<i>Ask your body and mind this.</i>

653
00:46:44,807 --> 00:46:49,778
<i>Am I inflicting violence upon myself? Am I straining myself?</i>

654
00:47:08,564 --> 00:47:10,970
I want to learn to be kind.

655
00:47:11,699 --> 00:47:15,568
Not only to others but to myself.

656
00:47:17,134 --> 00:47:18,773
Yes.

657
00:47:31,115 --> 00:47:36,850
Chest out, and let's breathe.

658
00:47:37,555 --> 00:47:40,093
In through your nose...

659
00:47:41,662 --> 00:47:44,364
and out from your mouth.

660
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,399
Once more.

661
00:47:53,242 --> 00:47:55,777
Slowly in...

662
00:48:08,657 --> 00:48:11,441
Good morning.

663
00:48:11,441 --> 00:48:13,428
You heard me for once.

664
00:48:13,428 --> 00:48:16,864
I'll make breakfast now.

665
00:48:16,864 --> 00:48:18,380
Huh?

666
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:22,337
- You made breakfast?
- Yeah.

667
00:48:22,337 --> 00:48:23,608
On that note,

668
00:48:23,608 --> 00:48:28,161
I've decided to begin marriage hunting today.

669
00:48:28,161 --> 00:48:30,340
Cool.

670
00:48:31,842 --> 00:48:33,113
Wait, what?

671
00:48:33,113 --> 00:48:36,622
My marriage counselor recommended me this matchup party.
<i>[Wedding Party - People between their twenties and sixties are welcome. April 11, 10 a.m.]</i>

672
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:38,084
Hold on, pause.

673
00:48:38,084 --> 00:48:40,354
I know the divorce papers were a shock.

674
00:48:40,354 --> 00:48:43,323
They surprised me too. But don't be hasty.

675
00:48:43,323 --> 00:48:45,289
I'm not being hasty.

676
00:48:45,289 --> 00:48:47,794
No need for a party.

677
00:48:47,794 --> 00:48:50,027
Let nature do the matchmaking.

678
00:48:50,027 --> 00:48:52,901
Do you sincerely believe that'll happen to me?

679
00:48:52,901 --> 00:48:54,835
Well, I don't think so, but...

680
00:48:54,835 --> 00:48:58,600
If I remarry, I'll be off your shoulders.

681
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:02,244
Not a bad deal, eh?

682
00:49:02,244 --> 00:49:04,177
Wonderful, even.

683
00:49:04,177 --> 00:49:06,947
If this is what makes you happy, good luck.

684
00:49:06,947 --> 00:49:10,717
What? You're coming along.

685
00:49:10,717 --> 00:49:13,387
Sorry? I'm not following.

686
00:49:13,387 --> 00:49:16,058
I RSVP-ed for the both of us.

687
00:49:16,058 --> 00:49:19,761
Huh? We're going as a family?

- Ready?
- Y-Yeah.

691
00:49:59,366 --> 00:50:01,002
Wait. Look!

Your pants aren't hemmed!

693
00:50:04,170 --> 00:50:06,577
Well, I can barely open my eyes.

694
00:50:06,577 --> 00:50:10,145
I've got it. Sit.

695
00:50:10,145 --> 00:50:11,845
Ready? Up goes your leg.

696
00:50:11,845 --> 00:50:15,083
Ouch!

Staples? Yoko-san would-

698
00:50:18,399 --> 00:50:23,107
No comparing your new encounter with mom, okay?

699
00:50:27,896 --> 00:50:30,302
Right this way.

700
00:50:31,427 --> 00:50:33,408
May I have your name, Sir?

701
00:50:33,408 --> 00:50:36,170
Sawada Rintaro

702
00:50:36,170 --> 00:50:39,241
- and my daughter Kyoka.
- Yes.

00:50:39,241 --> 00:50:42,364
First, keep this tag on you at all times.

704
00:50:42,364 --> 00:50:44,935
Next, fill out this short bio. The men stay right here,

00:50:44,935 --> 00:50:48,005
while women head inside.

706
00:50:48,005 --> 00:50:49,672
Thank you.

707
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:55,530
Welcome!

00:51:17,344 --> 00:51:19,320
Why?

711
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:20,759
Didn't you want to avoid marriage?

712
00:51:20,759 --> 00:51:24,318
Likewise, Seita-san.

713
00:51:24,318 --> 00:51:28,694
My current place of employment branched out into marriage counseling.

714
00:51:28,694 --> 00:51:30,659
What? Then...

715
00:51:30,659 --> 00:51:32,559
O-One moment.

717
00:51:34,362 --> 00:51:36,365
This sucks.

00:51:36,365 --> 00:51:38,763
Right this way.

719
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:41,903
Kyoka-san, what brings you here?

720
00:51:41,903 --> 00:51:44,473
I'm merely accompanying my father.

721
00:51:44,473 --> 00:51:46,575
Then you're the family who RSVP-ed...

722
00:51:46,575 --> 00:51:48,630
Higashimaru-san! Do you have a moment?

723
00:51:48,630 --> 00:51:50,330
Coming!

724
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:08,963
<i>It's time.</i>

725
00:52:08,963 --> 00:52:13,633
<i>Men, please move to your right.</i>

726
00:52:22,344 --> 00:52:24,579
- You're a yoga instructor?
- Yes.

727
00:52:24,579 --> 00:52:27,983
That's wonderful. You must be flexible then!

728
00:52:27,983 --> 00:52:29,450
Can you draw with your toes-

729
00:52:29,450 --> 00:52:31,752
I'm not affiliated with the circus.

730
00:52:31,752 --> 00:52:33,871
Yoga's when you meet in the mornings,

731
00:52:33,871 --> 00:52:37,213
and Kamehameha together, right?
<i>(T/N: a special technique from Dragon Ball)</i>

732
00:52:37,213 --> 00:52:39,990
That's more a martial arts thing.

733
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:42,464
Let's just move on from yoga.

734
00:52:42,464 --> 00:52:44,566
Something other than yoga?

735
00:52:44,566 --> 00:52:47,734
I see your blood type is O. That's good.

736
00:52:47,734 --> 00:52:51,205
You can donate blood to anyone.

737
00:52:51,205 --> 00:52:54,041
<i>It's time.</i>

738
00:52:56,177 --> 00:52:58,749
I feel like I'm eating conveyor belt sushi.

739
00:52:58,749 --> 00:53:01,831
- Hello.
- Hello.

740
00:53:06,221 --> 00:53:09,458
So if we were to get married,

741
00:53:09,458 --> 00:53:12,059
I'd have to live with your daughter?

742
00:53:12,059 --> 00:53:15,520
No, she will move out eventually.

743
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:18,165
Excuse my bluntness, but does she have a father complex?

744
00:53:18,165 --> 00:53:22,434
Not at all. If anything, she's too strict.

745
00:53:23,036 --> 00:53:27,967
<i>It's time. Please once again move to your right.</i>

746
00:53:32,476 --> 00:53:35,014
Nice to meet you.

747
00:53:37,981 --> 00:53:39,021
Tired as well?

748
00:53:39,021 --> 00:53:41,887
Yes, I'm a first-timer-

749
00:53:41,887 --> 00:53:44,606
Likewise.

750
00:53:46,995 --> 00:53:49,218
The name's Sawada.

751
00:53:49,218 --> 00:53:51,585
I'm Hinata.

<i>[Occupation : Librarian]</i>

753
00:53:54,634 --> 00:53:57,776
You're a librarian?

754
00:53:57,776 --> 00:54:01,189
Yes. I work at the National Diet Library.

755
00:54:01,189 --> 00:54:03,523
I visit it often.

756
00:54:03,523 --> 00:54:04,811
- Is that so?
- Yes.

757
00:54:04,811 --> 00:54:09,216
I go there for research at least once a week.

758
00:54:09,216 --> 00:54:10,751
I see.

759
00:54:10,751 --> 00:54:14,188
Why do I have to see my father get romantic?

760
00:54:14,188 --> 00:54:15,699
What was that?

761
00:54:15,699 --> 00:54:16,657
Oh, nothing.

762
00:54:16,657 --> 00:54:18,992
Really, what a coincidence.

763
00:54:18,992 --> 00:54:20,302
I see you work from home?

764
00:54:20,302 --> 00:54:25,459
Yes, although sometimes I'm at the Diet Library for research.

765
00:54:39,246 --> 00:54:41,009
Kyoka!

766
00:54:44,815 --> 00:54:46,555
This is my daughter.

767
00:54:46,555 --> 00:54:49,658
Wow, she truly is a beauty.

768
00:54:49,658 --> 00:54:53,662
Meet Komiyama-san, a respiratory surgeon,

769
00:54:53,662 --> 00:54:56,220
and Ogawa-san, a tax counselor.

770
00:54:57,097 --> 00:55:00,030
Sorry, I'm going home. Good luck, Dad.

771
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:02,236
What are you saying? Then my RSVP meant nothing.

772
00:55:02,236 --> 00:55:05,439
If you want to remarry, match make on your own.

773
00:55:05,439 --> 00:55:07,441
I want you to be happy!

774
00:55:07,441 --> 00:55:09,444
And I'm saying you're being a busybody!

775
00:55:09,444 --> 00:55:13,844
- Kyoka-san-
- If I'm not, then who'll take a curry-burning girl like you?

776
00:55:13,844 --> 00:55:15,746
You even stapled up my pants!

777
00:55:15,746 --> 00:55:19,220
Exactly! Marriage is impossible for a woman like me.

778
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:22,891
Right? You wouldn't marry anyone like me, would you?

779
00:55:22,891 --> 00:55:25,460
If I had to choose...

780
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:28,518
- The staples are a bit much.
- Do not insult my daughter!

781
00:55:28,518 --> 00:55:29,715
Sir, you said so yourself...

782
00:55:29,715 --> 00:55:34,232
Sure, my daughter's a slob who loses her phone, eats breakfast in a bowl,

783
00:55:34,232 --> 00:55:37,971
cuts corners, and is stubborn to boot.

784
00:55:37,971 --> 00:55:40,808
But she's kind.

785
00:55:40,808 --> 00:55:42,877
She's incredibly kind.

786
00:55:42,877 --> 00:55:46,076
She returned home to keep me company-

787
00:55:46,076 --> 00:55:48,706
Dad?

788
00:55:48,706 --> 00:55:51,119
W-What's wrong?

789
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:54,554
- What seems to be hurting?
- My hip!

790
00:55:54,554 --> 00:55:57,103
Please excuse me.

791
00:56:01,057 --> 00:56:02,897
I'm actually an orthopedic surgeon.

792
00:56:02,897 --> 00:56:04,599
Weren't you a librarian- Ouch!

793
00:56:04,599 --> 00:56:07,669
- Here, Sir?
- Yes...

794
00:56:07,669 --> 00:56:10,262
While I believe this is merely a strained back,

795
00:56:10,262 --> 00:56:12,478
you should get scanned to be safe.

796
00:56:12,478 --> 00:56:14,475
Yes, Ma'am...

797
00:56:14,475 --> 00:56:16,677
Is there anywhere he can rest?

798
00:56:16,677 --> 00:56:18,154
There's that sofa.

799
00:56:18,154 --> 00:56:20,148
Great. We'll be moving you.

800
00:56:20,148 --> 00:56:21,482
Hold on tight.

801
00:56:21,482 --> 00:56:23,661
Ready, and...

802
00:56:23,661 --> 00:56:25,811
Slowly now.

803
00:56:25,811 --> 00:56:27,589
Kyoka-san, these are your father's belongings.

804
00:56:27,589 --> 00:56:29,921
Thank you.

805
00:56:29,921 --> 00:56:33,451

806
00:56:36,964 --> 00:56:38,266
