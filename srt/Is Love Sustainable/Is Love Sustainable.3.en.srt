- We're using this many ingredients?
- For hotpot.

3
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:43,876
They're living...

4
00:00:43,876 --> 00:00:46,014
together.

5
00:00:50,651 --> 00:00:55,865
Kyoka, where's the new toothpaste?

6
00:00:57,579 --> 00:01:00,759
The new toothpaste, Kyoka.

7
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:05,624
Hot, hot... No way!

8
00:01:05,624 --> 00:01:09,324
You have to be more organized.

9
00:01:09,324 --> 00:01:10,811
What is it?

10
00:01:10,811 --> 00:01:13,748
I mean, the toothpaste.

11
00:01:13,748 --> 00:01:17,609
Oh, in the left drawer of the sink.

12
00:01:17,609 --> 00:01:19,523
All right, thanks.

13
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:23,281
You don’t need to prepare breakfast if you’re tired.

14
00:01:23,281 --> 00:01:26,910
Something was on my mind, that's all.

15
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:29,687
<i>There's someone whom I like!</i>

16
00:01:29,687 --> 00:01:32,023
Ah, I see.

17
00:01:32,023 --> 00:01:34,561
- Huh?
- Well...

18
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:37,762
how's everything between you and that someone you like?

19
00:01:37,762 --> 00:01:41,498
Nothing much. We just go out for meals.

20
00:01:41,498 --> 00:01:43,036
Meals?

21
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:44,142
What?

22
00:01:44,142 --> 00:01:48,051
I've decided to try marriage hunting.

23
00:01:48,051 --> 00:01:51,411
So that you need not take care of me in the future.

24
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:54,446
It'll be troublesome too if you live alone and don't know where the toothbrush is, right?

25
00:01:54,446 --> 00:01:57,548
In the left drawer. I memorized it.

26
00:01:57,548 --> 00:01:59,424
Say...

27
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:03,657
If you remarry, you'll be living together with your partner, right?

28
00:02:03,657 --> 00:02:05,313
Right..

29
00:02:05,313 --> 00:02:08,699
I'll first bring her home, and after living together for a while-

30
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:10,430
You're right.

31
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:15,000
If you two are not close enough, you won't bring her home, right?

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,086
Besides, since your child is living with you...

33
00:02:17,086 --> 00:02:20,809
What, you don't want me to remarry? If so, I won't look for-

34
00:02:20,809 --> 00:02:22,075
No, no...

35
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:24,253
Go for it all the way, Dad.

36
00:02:24,253 --> 00:02:27,444
I fear you'll have to keep looking for stuff your whole life.

37
00:02:27,444 --> 00:02:30,417
Kyoka, I just want you to be happy-

38
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:33,319
Don't worry about me.

39
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:36,790
<i>When that happens, we can use "Is that so?".</i>

40
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:39,566
"So" means...

41
00:02:39,566 --> 00:02:41,493
"Is that so".
<i>["Sou desu ka" in Japanese]</i>

42
00:02:41,493 --> 00:02:45,299
This "sa-shi-su-se-so"
<i>[(Sa) I'm impressed. (Shi) I didn't know that. (Su) How wonderful. (Se) You have a good taste. (So) Is that so?]</i>

43
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:47,959
forms the basics of a conversation.

44
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:51,484
Showing affirmation is important in a marriage meeting.

45
00:02:51,484 --> 00:02:53,741
If you can show affirmation to what the other party is talking about,

46
00:02:53,741 --> 00:02:55,753
that's the first step to a conversation.

47
00:02:55,753 --> 00:03:00,280
Use affirming words.

48
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,632
I see.

49
00:03:01,632 --> 00:03:04,161
Let's practice saying it out loud.

50
00:03:04,161 --> 00:03:06,092
"Sa", "sasuga desu".
<i>["I'm impressed" in Japanese]</i>

51
00:03:06,092 --> 00:03:07,581
"Sasuga desu".

52
00:03:07,581 --> 00:03:10,101
"Shi", "shiranakatta desu".
<i>["I didn't know that" in Japanese]</i>

53
00:03:10,101 --> 00:03:12,192
"Shiranakatta desu".

54
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:15,041
"Su", "suteki desu".
<i>["How wonderful" in Japanese]</i>

55
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:16,253
"Suteki desu".

56
00:03:16,253 --> 00:03:18,677
I apologize for the trouble my daughter caused that day.

57
00:03:18,677 --> 00:03:22,123
No worries. Looks like your back is much better now.

58
00:03:22,123 --> 00:03:25,005
Miraculously, I found a good doctor.

59
00:03:25,005 --> 00:03:27,054
Glad to hear that.

60
00:03:27,054 --> 00:03:30,535
I've also processed Kyoka-san's membership withdrawal.

61
00:03:30,535 --> 00:03:32,703
I'm impressed.

62
00:03:32,703 --> 00:03:36,660
It seems lately, Kyoka has found someone she likes.

63
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:40,460
I didn't know that.

64
00:03:41,153 --> 00:03:43,277
- Excuse me, then.
- See you.

65
00:03:50,197 --> 00:03:54,217
- This is addressed to you, Kyoka Sensei.
- Thank you.

66
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:09,025
Kyoka Sensei, do you have a moment?

67
00:04:09,025 --> 00:04:10,508
Yes?

68
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:23,620
Mikako Sensei has been acting strangely this morning.

69
00:04:24,367 --> 00:04:28,187
Like, present in body, but not in spirit?

70
00:04:28,187 --> 00:04:30,738
You feel me too?

71
00:04:34,419 --> 00:04:37,344
Kind of. I also couldn't seem to focus

72
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:39,731
- today-
- Love robber...

73
00:04:39,731 --> 00:04:42,103
- Lovey-dovey?
- No.

74
00:04:42,103 --> 00:04:44,282
Love robber.

75
00:04:44,282 --> 00:04:46,052
Oh! Yes, yes.

76
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:47,855
Love, correct? Love.

77
00:04:47,855 --> 00:04:50,571
Before you know it, you're thinking about that person all the time, and you can't-

78
00:04:50,571 --> 00:04:52,474
Bingo!

79
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:56,258
"Fan club activities."

80
00:04:56,258 --> 00:04:58,348
"Runny curry."

81
00:04:58,348 --> 00:05:00,381
Blue sky.

82
00:05:13,656 --> 00:05:16,216
"Authentic."

83
00:05:16,216 --> 00:05:18,585
What's its meaning again?

84
00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:20,487
"Authentic."

85
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:24,625
Genuine. "Settle in a genuine town?"

86
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:27,035
What do they mean by that?

87
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:31,592
Oh? Uncle?

88
00:05:31,592 --> 00:05:33,568
It's me, Hayate.

89
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:39,539
- How have you been?
- Oh, hello!

90
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:43,143
I'm home.

91
00:05:43,143 --> 00:05:44,476
Huh?

92
00:05:45,546 --> 00:05:49,782
Dad. What's with all this?

93
00:05:50,605 --> 00:05:52,272
Welcome back.

94
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:54,646
Hayate!

95
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:58,215
Hayate-kun will be living with us from today onwards.

96
00:06:00,761 --> 00:06:02,725
What?

97
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:06,199
No way, no way.

98
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,619
Seriously?

<i>[Is Love Sustainable?]
[Episode 3]</i>

100
00:06:13,787 --> 00:06:16,674
What's the difference between "to settle in" and "to live in"?

101
00:06:16,674 --> 00:06:21,782
"To settle in" means "to keep on living in". It has a continuity element, unlike "to live in".

102
00:06:21,782 --> 00:06:27,490
It's commonly used in slogans in real estate ads.

103
00:06:28,267 --> 00:06:29,923
Wow. The gyoza is delicious.

104
00:06:29,923 --> 00:06:33,292
Glad to hear that. I added in perilla leaves.

105
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:37,947
Uncle, then what's the difference between "cohabiting" and "living together"?

106
00:06:37,947 --> 00:06:41,810
"Cohabiting" is when two lovers live together with each other.

107
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:45,651
And if they do so beyond three years, it can be considered a de facto marriage-

108
00:06:45,651 --> 00:06:49,419
Can I settle into this home, then? For more than three years.

109
00:06:49,419 --> 00:06:51,211
That way, Kyoka-chan and I would be considered a married couple-

110
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:52,880
No way.

111
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,287
In the first place, why our home?

112
00:06:55,287 --> 00:06:59,160
Why not? Hayate-kun's home has a water leakage problem.

113
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,353
He's stayed over countless times already, so we can trust him.

114
00:07:02,353 --> 00:07:04,291
That was when we were kids, right?

115
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:08,950
Wasn't Hayate-kun the one you've been going out for meals with?

116
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:12,733
If that's the case-

117
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:15,069
What? What are you talking about?

118
00:07:15,069 --> 00:07:17,709
- We're totally not-
- Then it's fine.

119
00:07:19,072 --> 00:07:22,972
Sorry. I guess I'm bothering you, right?

120
00:07:22,972 --> 00:07:26,509
Bumping into you brought back old memories, and it made me happy.

121
00:07:26,509 --> 00:07:29,279
You're not a bother at all. I'm happy to have you.

122
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:32,649
Really? Uncle, you're a freaking saint!

123
00:07:32,649 --> 00:07:33,987
Freaking saint.

124
00:07:33,987 --> 00:07:36,489
Freaking saint? Freaking saint.

125
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:40,654
Youngsters nowadays use realistically positive words indeed.

126
00:07:40,654 --> 00:07:42,863
You've been completely played upside down.

127
00:07:42,863 --> 00:07:47,634
If Yoko-san had been here, she would have held a welcome party, and we'd all have a singing session.

128
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:50,234
That would have been fun.

129
00:07:51,872 --> 00:07:55,652
Just living together with her makes me feel as if I've been born.

130
00:07:55,652 --> 00:07:58,789
Looks like he's seriously missing the point here.

131
00:08:04,251 --> 00:08:05,751
What?

132
00:08:10,492 --> 00:08:12,826
I've finished my bath.

133
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:16,457
You helped organize the shelves and fridge?

134
00:08:16,457 --> 00:08:17,564
Sorry, you didn't like that?

135
00:08:17,564 --> 00:08:20,526
The opposite, in fact. Thanks.

136
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:23,167
You're surprisingly well-organized and neat.

137
00:08:23,167 --> 00:08:26,047
You even kept the kitchen spotless.

138
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:29,628
Cohabiting isn't that bad after all, right?

139
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:31,662
Correction. Living together.

140
00:08:31,662 --> 00:08:34,481
More specifically, you're freeloading.

141
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:37,650
What? Living together, at the very least.

142
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:40,487

00:09:18,025 --> 00:09:20,286
I dozed off?

146
00:09:26,834 --> 00:09:30,228
"Se"... "se"? "You have good taste".

147
00:09:30,228 --> 00:09:32,603
"You have good taste", "you have good taste".

- Here you go.
- Thanks.

00:09:34,805 --> 00:09:36,707
- Good morning!
- Morning.

00:09:36,707 --> 00:09:38,576
- Sorry, I overslept.
- No worries.

151
00:09:38,576 --> 00:09:40,130
Tea or coffee for you?

152
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:43,167
- Oh, I'll just have plain water.
- Okay.

153
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:45,485
- I'll do it myself.
- Let me do it.

154
00:09:45,485 --> 00:09:47,599
Thanks a bunch.

155
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,560
- Not bad.
- Huh?

156
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,514
Nothing.

Oh, I didn't notice.

160
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:07,275
Also, don't behave as if Hayate has to make you tea.

161
00:10:07,275 --> 00:10:08,582
No, I'm fine with it, actually.

162
00:10:08,582 --> 00:10:12,099
Don't spoil him. Leave him be, and he'll really forget how to do everything.

What, you're treating me like a kid now?

164
00:10:13,976 --> 00:10:16,350
Would have been great if you're cute like a kid too.

165
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:19,419
- There are kids who don't look cute too.
- Say what?

166
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:21,402
See? It's hard to say you're cute.

167
00:10:21,402 --> 00:10:23,302
Whatever.

168
00:10:23,924 --> 00:10:26,095

A time robber.

I overslept and was late.

175

In yoga, "thou shalt not rob"

177
00:10:54,621 --> 00:10:57,528
is an important doctrine.

178
00:10:57,528 --> 00:10:59,993
By robbing time away,

179
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:02,565
you'll lose friendship and trust

180
00:11:02,565 --> 00:11:06,101
at the same time.

181
00:11:07,726 --> 00:11:10,104
It's not limited to tangible things.

182
00:11:10,104 --> 00:11:13,716
Intangible things like time, privilege,

183
00:11:13,716 --> 00:11:17,102
and kindness, will be robbed away.

184
00:11:17,102 --> 00:11:19,046
Everyone,

185
00:11:19,046 --> 00:11:21,826
please guard yourselves against robbers, all right?

186
00:11:21,826 --> 00:11:26,359
Huh? My patient registration ticket...

187
00:11:26,359 --> 00:11:29,841
Uncle, here's your registration ticket.

188
00:11:29,841 --> 00:11:31,792
Thanks a million!

189
00:11:31,792 --> 00:11:33,393
I have it.

190
00:11:33,393 --> 00:11:34,903
He's a lodger at my place.

191
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:37,574
I'm a lodger.

192
00:11:37,574 --> 00:11:38,631
Here.

193
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:40,635
Oh, thank you.

194
00:11:42,394 --> 00:11:45,130
- Is it painful?
- No.

195
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:52,072
How's your marriage hunting getting along?

196
00:11:52,072 --> 00:11:55,275
Well, I'll be going for a marriage meeting next.

197
00:11:55,849 --> 00:11:57,060
Is that so?

198
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:00,272
It's my first time, so I'm not sure how it'll go.

199
00:12:01,344 --> 00:12:03,624
I'll prescribe you painkillers for now.

200
00:12:03,624 --> 00:12:05,583
We'll leave it to time to do the rest.
<i>["Sa-shi-su-se-so" basics]</i>

201
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:07,592
Leave it to time, huh?

202
00:12:07,592 --> 00:12:10,497
I'm impressed. You're really skillful, Hinata-san.

203
00:12:10,497 --> 00:12:11,865
You flatter me too much.

204
00:12:11,865 --> 00:12:17,397
I-I-I can't believe you're so good at taking X-rays.

205
00:12:17,397 --> 00:12:21,177
Indeed, it's captured quite nicely.

206
00:12:21,177 --> 00:12:23,610
Bones are really beautiful, aren't they?

207
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:26,588
Y-Yes, they are.

208
00:12:26,588 --> 00:12:27,902
You think so, too?

209
00:12:27,902 --> 00:12:29,450
Y-Yes, I do.

210
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:33,386
I like the structure of bones.

211
00:12:33,386 --> 00:12:35,656
They give you a mysterious kind of feeling.

212
00:12:35,656 --> 00:12:39,006
Every part is efficient, with not one bit of wastage.

213
00:12:39,006 --> 00:12:43,510
Their curves are beautiful, as if they are part of a design.

214
00:12:45,808 --> 00:12:47,267
Oh, I'm sorry.

215
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:48,769
That's wonderful.

216
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:51,011
I didn't know that.

217
00:12:51,011 --> 00:12:54,424
I didn't know that bones can be so...

218
00:12:55,542 --> 00:12:59,679
Y-You have good taste, to have an appreciation for bones.

219
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:00,965
Is that so?

220
00:13:00,965 --> 00:13:04,488
So your marriage meeting will surely turn out well.

221
00:13:06,521 --> 00:13:08,854
Thank you.

222
00:13:09,621 --> 00:13:12,258
Well then, you can be discharged.

223
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:16,455
Oh, my shoulder has been kind of stiff lately.

224
00:13:16,455 --> 00:13:17,595
Which one?

225
00:13:17,595 --> 00:13:20,597
- This one?
- Yes, the right one.

226
00:13:21,602 --> 00:13:24,904
- Then let's do an X-ray for that.
- Thank you.

227
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:43,422
So, a role model

228
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:44,925
in a startup.

229
00:13:44,925 --> 00:13:49,286
It's important to listen to advice from a senior entrepreneur that you admire.

230
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:53,694
That way, your vision should be able to materialize.

231
00:13:55,635 --> 00:13:57,768
Speaking of role models,

232
00:13:57,768 --> 00:13:59,937
the yoga industry is rather small.

233
00:13:59,937 --> 00:14:02,340
Before I can tell my boss about it, she would have found out

234
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:04,832
who I had met up with.

235
00:14:07,581 --> 00:14:09,319
By the way...

236
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:18,007
is your apartment near the Kanpachi area?

237
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:22,135
Y-Yes.

238
00:14:22,753 --> 00:14:24,865
Oh, I mean...

239
00:14:24,865 --> 00:14:30,472
You have... a... a... a...

240
00:14:30,472 --> 00:14:33,440
a maid. Did you hire one?

241
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,342
No, I didn't.

242
00:14:35,342 --> 00:14:37,744
It'll be nice if I have one.

243
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:40,100
Y-You're right.

244
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,147
Say...

245
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:46,338
If you're free today, shall we have-

246
00:14:51,122 --> 00:14:52,720
Please go ahead.

247
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,258
Okay.

248
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:58,122
Hello?

249
00:14:58,122 --> 00:15:00,534
Why are you ignoring my LINE messages?

250
00:15:00,534 --> 00:15:02,347
Let's go out for drinks.

251
00:15:02,347 --> 00:15:04,772
And who's that cute childhood friend of yours?

252
00:15:04,772 --> 00:15:07,850
Someone's inviting me out to eat.

253
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:09,690
What?! A date with your childhood friend?

254
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:11,412
No! Not him!

255
00:15:11,412 --> 00:15:14,091
W-Well, next time is fine with me too.

256
00:15:14,091 --> 00:15:16,596
No, it's all right.

257
00:15:16,596 --> 00:15:19,465
That was an old friend of mine.

258
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:24,511
I guess we'll do it next time, after all.

259
00:15:24,511 --> 00:15:26,011
See you.

260
00:15:26,637 --> 00:15:28,137
Huh?

261
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:37,402
What?

262
00:15:38,218 --> 00:15:42,068
Kyoka, could it be that you've been secretly making donations?

263
00:15:42,068 --> 00:15:44,594
- Why're you asking?
- Don't you find it strange?

264
00:15:44,594 --> 00:15:47,880
Your childhood friend, who grew up to be handsome, highly-educated,

265
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,949
and good at housework, suddenly came to live with you.

266
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,463
It's even more rare than striking the lottery.

267
00:15:52,463 --> 00:15:55,088
Your luck is so good, you may become unlucky.

268
00:15:55,088 --> 00:15:57,065
You're too naïve, Riho-san.

269
00:15:57,065 --> 00:15:59,671
Cohabiting is like fake crab meat.

270
00:15:59,671 --> 00:16:01,908
I don't get what you're driving at.

271
00:16:01,908 --> 00:16:03,697
You want to eat crab,

272
00:16:03,697 --> 00:16:06,265
but it's troublesome to dig out the meat, and it's expensive.

273
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:08,251
So you'll just eat this for now. Don't you think so?

274
00:16:08,251 --> 00:16:11,571
No, I don't. Crab is just crab.

275
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:16,174
Cohabiting is like a pseudo-marriage of sorts?

276
00:16:16,174 --> 00:16:18,612
It may be better to cohabit indefinitely,

277
00:16:18,612 --> 00:16:20,879
since a marriage comes with lots of commitments.

278
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:24,084
To him, a marriage is a burden in his life,

279
00:16:24,084 --> 00:16:25,528
what with money and kids.

280
00:16:25,528 --> 00:16:29,023
It's easier to not have to deal with such bothersome stuff.

281
00:16:29,805 --> 00:16:32,483
Where's Kazuma-kun today?

282
00:16:32,483 --> 00:16:35,559
He's at a camp since Saturday, and will go directly to work from there.

283
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:39,928
A man who appreciates nature, doesn't appreciate humans.

284
00:16:39,928 --> 00:16:44,292
Living together also means robbing away the other party's time too.

285
00:16:44,292 --> 00:16:46,545
- Rob away?
- Kyoka-san, so...

286
00:16:46,545 --> 00:16:49,625
you shouldn't live together with a guy just because you like him.

287
00:16:51,645 --> 00:16:57,940
The guy I like, is living with someone else.

288
00:16:58,975 --> 00:17:00,621
What?!

289
00:17:00,621 --> 00:17:02,432
There's someone you like?

290
00:17:03,924 --> 00:17:06,195
I'm home-

291
00:17:09,496 --> 00:17:11,965
A single father, huh?

292
00:17:11,965 --> 00:17:14,734
That's another troublesome one.

293
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:20,497
So the reason why he didn't want to marry, was because of that woman?

294
00:17:27,748 --> 00:17:30,393
Nijiro, can you get me an Allen key?

295
00:17:30,393 --> 00:17:33,539
- Yup. I'll go get it.
- Thanks.

296
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:41,862
You're busy lately?

297
00:17:41,862 --> 00:17:44,461
My clientele has increased.

298
00:17:46,366 --> 00:17:48,735
If you straighten your posture,

299
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:50,737
and just take a deep breath,

300
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:54,765
you'll feel much better. You know, the yoga breathing?

301
00:17:57,782 --> 00:18:00,513
You're so easy to read.

302
00:18:01,106 --> 00:18:03,894
The yoga instructor is now your girlfriend?

303
00:18:03,894 --> 00:18:05,406
What?

304
00:18:05,406 --> 00:18:07,587
No, she's not my girlfriend.

305
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:10,457
You should get a girlfriend.

306
00:18:10,457 --> 00:18:13,550
As long as it doesn't affect Nijiro, why not?

307
00:18:15,725 --> 00:18:18,017
Whoa... I see you've kept things tidy here.

308
00:18:18,017 --> 00:18:20,069
That's quite normal.

309
00:18:20,969 --> 00:18:26,038
After all, you used to think that the garbage disappears on its own.

310
00:18:28,192 --> 00:18:30,645
That's...

311
00:18:30,645 --> 00:18:34,219
Just do the housework that you're good at doing.

312
00:18:34,219 --> 00:18:36,703
Compared to the time when there was nothing

313
00:18:36,703 --> 00:18:39,915
you were good at, this is a huge improvement.

314
00:18:41,339 --> 00:18:43,105
Sorry.

315
00:18:43,724 --> 00:18:45,690
I was just teasing you there.

316
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:48,954
But what you said is true.

317
00:18:51,646 --> 00:18:57,460
Kindness should be expressed through actions, not words.

318
00:18:58,032 --> 00:19:00,023
Good luck!

319
00:19:00,897 --> 00:19:03,622
- I could only find a screwdriver.
- Seriously?

320
00:19:03,622 --> 00:19:06,638
Niji, I’m leaving.

321
00:19:06,638 --> 00:19:09,340
I'll leave the chair to you.

322
00:19:14,148 --> 00:19:16,970
- I'm home.
- Welcome back.

323
00:19:17,757 --> 00:19:21,024
Aha! The handsome childhood friend.

324
00:19:21,024 --> 00:19:24,597
- You're still awake?
- You're really drunk.

325
00:19:24,597 --> 00:19:26,824
What's this?

326
00:19:26,824 --> 00:19:30,369
The living room and kitchen are clean.

327
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:34,073
Hayate...

328
00:19:34,073 --> 00:19:36,785
are you a god?

329
00:19:36,785 --> 00:19:38,611
Were we parent and child in our past lives?

330
00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:41,081
At least say we were husband and wife.

331
00:19:41,081 --> 00:19:44,464
Hayate, thank you.

332
00:20:27,734 --> 00:20:30,590
Hello?

333
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:33,528
Sorry to call you this late. Are you free to talk now?

334
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:37,302
Yes.

335
00:20:38,844 --> 00:20:40,828
Yes. No worries.

336
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,960
You see...

337
00:20:44,178 --> 00:20:47,390
I forgot to tell you this earlier.

338
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:51,433
Oh, you mean about her?

339
00:20:51,433 --> 00:20:55,888
<i>Actually, there's this lady who runs a personal gym.</i>

340
00:20:55,888 --> 00:20:58,474
Oh, your girlfriend's a businesswoman?

341
00:20:58,474 --> 00:21:00,374
Huh?

342
00:21:00,374 --> 00:21:03,629
She's a former customer of our matchmaking agency.

343
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:07,275
So I thought she may be a good role model as a female entrepreneur.

344
00:21:09,075 --> 00:21:12,566
I see. That's what you mean.

345
00:21:12,566 --> 00:21:15,042
<i>If you like, I can introduce you to her.</i>

346
00:21:15,042 --> 00:21:17,477
Sure, thank you so much.

347
00:21:17,477 --> 00:21:19,077
Please do so.

348
00:21:20,929 --> 00:21:23,051
That's great.

349
00:21:23,051 --> 00:21:27,151
Was that why you called me?

350
00:21:27,151 --> 00:21:29,021
Well... yes.

351
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:31,443
Thought I should let you know before I forget.

352
00:21:31,443 --> 00:21:33,047
<i>Kyoka-chan.</i>

353
00:21:33,047 --> 00:21:35,416
<i>I've brought you water.</i>

354
00:21:36,449 --> 00:21:38,893
Thanks, Dad.

355
00:21:38,893 --> 00:21:40,710
Just leave it outside.

356
00:21:41,788 --> 00:21:43,877
Huh? Still drunk? Are you all right?

357
00:21:43,877 --> 00:21:46,104
I'm fine already.

358
00:21:46,711 --> 00:21:49,943
So sorry about it. My dad is drunk.

359
00:21:49,943 --> 00:21:52,509
And he's feeling high now.

360
00:21:54,195 --> 00:21:55,508
Feeling high?

361
00:21:55,508 --> 00:21:59,990
Yeah, you know, he's trying to sound young.

362
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:02,722
Sure, bye.

363
00:22:06,601 --> 00:22:08,427
Ah, jeez...

364
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:32,652
I have a headache.

365
00:22:32,652 --> 00:22:34,415
A hangover?

366
00:22:37,084 --> 00:22:39,326
Hayate...

367
00:22:39,326 --> 00:22:42,386
Sorry about yesterday.

368
00:22:42,386 --> 00:22:44,046
About what?

369
00:22:44,831 --> 00:22:47,705
I'll make breakfast for today.

370
00:22:47,705 --> 00:22:49,738
You can take a break.

371
00:22:51,349 --> 00:22:54,518
Something's on your mind again?

372
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:58,200
Let's have bread, after all.

373
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,341
Mm... it's savory.

374
00:23:00,341 --> 00:23:01,722
It's actually quite savory.

375
00:23:01,722 --> 00:23:03,028
What?

376
00:23:03,028 --> 00:23:06,775
Hayate-kun, eat some pickled plums to remove the poison.

377
00:23:06,775 --> 00:23:08,255
- Pickled plums?
- Yeah.

378
00:23:08,255 --> 00:23:09,757
Okay.

379
00:23:17,867 --> 00:23:19,900
So sour!

380
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,147
Nice reaction there.

381
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:34,759
Hayate, can we have a word?

382
00:23:34,759 --> 00:23:37,460
Yeah, sure.

383
00:23:41,471 --> 00:23:45,517
If we're going to live together, there's one condition.

384
00:23:45,517 --> 00:23:47,061
What is it?

385
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:53,624
Don't be so considerate towards me and my dad.

386
00:23:53,624 --> 00:23:55,790
I'm totally not.

387
00:23:56,702 --> 00:24:00,757
You’re cooking for us, and cleaning up the house,

388
00:24:00,757 --> 00:24:02,483
is really saintly of you.

389
00:24:02,483 --> 00:24:05,382
But we can't live together with a god.

390
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:11,241
Hayate, you hate pickled plums, don't you?

391
00:24:11,936 --> 00:24:14,272
You still remember, huh?

392
00:24:15,874 --> 00:24:18,953
You don't need to smile around us all the time.

393
00:24:20,456 --> 00:24:22,607
Even if you have your dislikes,

394
00:24:22,607 --> 00:24:25,009
even if you feel irritated,

395
00:24:25,009 --> 00:24:26,718
even if you're sloppy,

396
00:24:26,718 --> 00:24:28,500
or even if we fight,

397
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,979
it won't make us hate you.

398
00:24:33,897 --> 00:24:36,193
You were a good kid,

399
00:24:36,193 --> 00:24:39,200
and an even nicer guy now. We know that.

400
00:24:53,262 --> 00:24:55,394
You are in Japan.

401
00:24:55,394 --> 00:24:57,563
- Understand?
- Yes.

402
00:24:57,563 --> 00:25:00,530
I've upgraded from being a freeloader to a lodger.

403
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:03,130
Still too naïve.

404
00:25:03,137 --> 00:25:05,956
Bowls and chopsticks? We have them at home too.

405
00:25:05,956 --> 00:25:09,172
You told me not to be too considerate, didn't you?

406
00:25:09,172 --> 00:25:11,422
Since we're on a date, shall we have matching bowls?

407
00:25:11,422 --> 00:25:13,931
It's not a date. I'm just accompanying you out shopping.

408
00:25:13,931 --> 00:25:15,383
Where can I get an Allen key?

409
00:25:15,383 --> 00:25:18,660
The person in charge will attend to you shortly. Please wait for a moment.

410
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,351
- Why?
- Dad.

411
00:25:20,351 --> 00:25:24,257
What do you call a tunnel that has one entrance but two exits?

412
00:25:24,257 --> 00:25:26,566
Two exits?

413
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:27,549
Pants.

414
00:25:27,549 --> 00:25:30,151
Bingo. You're smart, Dad.

415
00:25:30,151 --> 00:25:31,761
Of course, I'm smart.

416
00:25:31,761 --> 00:25:34,033
Look at this. So cute.

417
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:38,340
Listen. The pillows. Let's get the pillows first.

418
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,448
Sure.

419
00:25:39,448 --> 00:25:42,508
- Shall we get matching pillows?
- May I know what you are looking for?

420
00:25:42,508 --> 00:25:44,262
Wait!

421
00:25:44,262 --> 00:25:46,712
Let's get bowls, after all.

422
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:48,147
Okay, choose, choose.

423
00:25:48,147 --> 00:25:49,794
There's blue, and red...

424
00:25:49,794 --> 00:25:52,703
- Hey, you!
- What?

425
00:25:52,703 --> 00:25:54,103
Hurry up and pick one.

426
00:25:54,103 --> 00:25:56,440
Sorry, it's over here.

427
00:25:58,924 --> 00:26:01,603
Huh? Hayate Sensei!

428
00:26:01,603 --> 00:26:04,139
It's you, Nijiro!

429
00:26:04,139 --> 00:26:05,641
Hello.

430
00:26:08,969 --> 00:26:10,613
Kyoka-chan.

431
00:26:11,316 --> 00:26:13,240
Oh, Hayate?

432
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:16,442
And Seita-san, too? You're both here?

433
00:26:24,751 --> 00:26:26,276
Sorry to keep you waiting.

434
00:26:26,276 --> 00:26:28,454
Thank you.

435
00:26:30,943 --> 00:26:32,346
- Well...
- Well...

436
00:26:32,346 --> 00:26:34,299
- After you.
- After you.

437
00:26:39,546 --> 00:26:41,865
Are you going out with Fuwa-san?

438
00:26:41,865 --> 00:26:46,735
What? No. No, I'm not.

439
00:26:46,735 --> 00:26:49,131
Wait. But...

440
00:26:49,131 --> 00:26:52,448
The phone? You heard his voice, right?

441
00:26:52,448 --> 00:26:54,396
Yes.

442
00:26:54,396 --> 00:26:57,191
He's staying over at my place for the time being.

443
00:26:57,191 --> 00:27:01,599
His apartment has a water leakage problem, and is flooded.

444
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:04,293
My dad was eager to invite him over.

445
00:27:04,293 --> 00:27:07,481
Oh, I see!

446
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:11,162
So that's what happened.

447
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:13,342
Yes, that's what happened. That's right.

448
00:27:13,342 --> 00:27:16,468
"Robber" means "thief".

449
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:21,357
Was it because of a robber that you moved out, Sensei?

450
00:27:23,988 --> 00:27:27,895
A love robber, would be more correct.

451
00:27:29,985 --> 00:27:32,782
Actually,

452
00:27:32,782 --> 00:27:34,697
- I saw you and-
- Dad!

453
00:27:34,697 --> 00:27:35,569
What?

454
00:27:35,569 --> 00:27:38,733
Let's help Hayate Sensei with moving house.

455
00:27:38,733 --> 00:27:41,465
- What?
- Thanks, Nijiro. But it's fine.

456
00:27:41,465 --> 00:27:45,769
- This sister here will be helping me.
- Yup. Thanks.

457
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:50,168
I'll help out.

458
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:50,952
Excuse me?

459
00:27:50,952 --> 00:27:53,441
I'll help you guys. If it's all right with you.

460
00:27:53,441 --> 00:27:56,057
Yay! I'm going too!

461
00:27:56,057 --> 00:27:59,968
Is that so? Really...

462
00:28:12,739 --> 00:28:14,707
Leave the heavy ones to me.

463
00:28:14,707 --> 00:28:18,110
Don't underestimate the muscles of a yoga instructor.

464
00:28:22,737 --> 00:28:25,729
Will Nijiro-kun be all right with my dad babysitting him?

465
00:28:25,729 --> 00:28:28,752
I'm sure Uncle will also have fun.

466
00:28:28,752 --> 00:28:33,661
Green light, red... light!

467
00:28:38,283 --> 00:28:41,753
Green light, red light!

468
00:28:43,624 --> 00:28:47,760
Nijiro-kun! The phone! Get me the phone!

469
00:28:48,428 --> 00:28:50,347
Nijiro-kun!

470
00:28:51,298 --> 00:28:53,137
Move...

471
00:28:55,938 --> 00:28:57,202
Move!

472
00:28:57,202 --> 00:29:01,715
The Chaturanga pose is great for training the biceps.
<i>[Water leakage repairs under way. Thank you for understanding.]</i> l

473
00:29:01,715 --> 00:29:05,246
- But it's rather hard to do, right?
- Yes, it is.

474
00:29:05,246 --> 00:29:08,220
Whoa! Amazing!

475
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:10,056
- They're hard!
- Hard, right?

476
00:29:10,056 --> 00:29:13,996
The clinic called to inform me that you've sprained your back.

477
00:29:14,755 --> 00:29:19,840
But I'm actually at a marriage meeting right now, so...

478
00:29:20,861 --> 00:29:24,463
Oh, I'm sorry to call at an inappropriate time.

479
00:29:24,463 --> 00:29:27,701
My back is totally fine now.

480
00:29:27,701 --> 00:29:29,871
Huh? It doesn't hurt?

481
00:29:29,871 --> 00:29:31,770
- What?
- Glad to hear that.

482
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,141
If it worsens, please contact me.

483
00:29:34,141 --> 00:29:37,452
Thank you. Bye.

484
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:44,759
Okay, I'll drive the car back. Kyoka-chan will join me.

485
00:29:44,759 --> 00:29:48,125
I'll call a cab for you, Higashimura-san. You've been a great help.

486
00:29:48,125 --> 00:29:50,756
It's all right. I can drive.

487
00:29:51,992 --> 00:29:56,749
In that case, I'll take the train back. I'll see you two at my place.

488
00:29:56,749 --> 00:29:58,695
See you later.

489
00:30:07,821 --> 00:30:10,800
Are you really fine with helping me move house?

490
00:30:11,662 --> 00:30:15,742
I previously worked part-time at a moving company, so I'm used to it.

491
00:30:15,742 --> 00:30:18,589
So, it's okay to let you drive, right?

492
00:30:18,589 --> 00:30:20,178
Yup.

493
00:30:21,746 --> 00:30:23,991
Go for it! Go for it!

494
00:30:23,991 --> 00:30:27,419
- Just keep moving straight.
- Okay.

495
00:30:27,419 --> 00:30:29,620
- Here.
- Huh?

496
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:34,190
Go for it! Go for it!

497
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:35,770
- In here.
- Sure.

498
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:38,860
Go for it! Go for it!

499
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:41,073
Let's leave it here for now.

500
00:30:41,073 --> 00:30:43,542
W-W-Wait a minute. Here is...

501
00:30:43,542 --> 00:30:45,846
- I'm kidding.
- What?

502
00:30:45,846 --> 00:30:48,615
Back up, please.

503
00:30:49,282 --> 00:30:51,580
- Put it down here.
- Okay.

504
00:30:52,951 --> 00:30:55,569
- Thanks for your help.
- No problem.

505
00:30:56,532 --> 00:30:58,831
Sneakers?

506
00:30:58,831 --> 00:31:01,617
Watch out for those sneaker boxes!

507
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:06,524
Sorry.

508
00:31:10,502 --> 00:31:13,071
Hey! Stop it, please!

509
00:31:13,071 --> 00:31:14,751
Sorry.

510
00:31:14,751 --> 00:31:16,549
Gosh…

511
00:31:18,378 --> 00:31:20,534
Wow, it's an Air Jordan 1 Chicago!

512
00:31:20,534 --> 00:31:21,847
- You know it?
- Yeah.

513
00:31:21,847 --> 00:31:23,282
It's a 1994 replica.

514
00:31:23,282 --> 00:31:26,044
Awesome! How did you get these?

515
00:31:26,044 --> 00:31:29,590
My friend in L.A. happened to find it in San Diego.

516
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:32,393
- How lucky!
- Exactly.

517
00:31:32,393 --> 00:31:35,114
What are the two of you doing?

518
00:31:35,114 --> 00:31:36,461
- My bad.
- Sorry.

519
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:38,356
She's angry with you.

520
00:31:38,356 --> 00:31:42,620
<i>[Hinata Akari]</i>

521
00:31:47,566 --> 00:31:49,676
Yes, hello?

522
00:31:49,676 --> 00:31:52,496
How is your back?

523
00:31:52,496 --> 00:31:56,549
Yes, well, it's fine.

524
00:31:56,549 --> 00:31:58,408
Glad to hear that.

525
00:32:00,686 --> 00:32:03,132
In that case...

526
00:32:03,132 --> 00:32:05,161
Yes?

527
00:32:05,161 --> 00:32:07,021
Well...

528
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,990
In that case,

529
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:12,062
can we meet

530
00:32:13,125 --> 00:32:15,438
later?

531
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:29,515
Thanks for the hard work.

532
00:32:29,515 --> 00:32:32,004
- Let's have lunch.
- Wow, it's hikkoshi soba!
<i>(noodles eaten after moving house)</i>

533
00:32:32,004 --> 00:32:33,203
Let's all eat.

534
00:32:33,203 --> 00:32:36,219
I... don't like soba.

535
00:32:36,219 --> 00:32:37,861
I'm so sorry!

536
00:32:37,861 --> 00:32:39,583
Then shall I make you some rice balls?

537
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:42,621
It's fine. Let's go to the convenience store, then.

538
00:32:42,621 --> 00:32:45,346
- I want to eat rice balls.
- Nijiro!

539
00:32:45,346 --> 00:32:49,329
In that case, shall we make rice balls together?

540
00:32:49,329 --> 00:32:51,998
Okay! Thank you!

541
00:32:52,619 --> 00:32:55,989
All right, then first...

542
00:32:57,859 --> 00:32:59,905
Dad?

543
00:32:59,905 --> 00:33:02,373
I'm going out.

544
00:33:03,226 --> 00:33:06,072
Is your back all right?

545
00:33:07,647 --> 00:33:10,950
Sorry, I'll be off.

546
00:33:15,348 --> 00:33:16,977
Looks like he's going for a marriage meeting.

547
00:33:16,977 --> 00:33:19,153
So firstly, wet your hands

548
00:33:19,153 --> 00:33:22,735
with some water, and rub them together.

549
00:33:22,735 --> 00:33:25,023
Then add in a little salt.

550
00:33:28,362 --> 00:33:31,557
After that, make a hollow in the middle.

551
00:33:31,557 --> 00:33:34,170
That's right. Very well done.

552
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:37,166
Then, add in your favorite ingredients.

553
00:33:37,166 --> 00:33:39,397
The tuna and mayo are ready.

554
00:33:39,397 --> 00:33:40,754
Great, thanks.

555
00:33:40,754 --> 00:33:43,605
I don't like pickled plums, so please omit them, okay?

556
00:33:43,605 --> 00:33:44,612
Got it.

557
00:33:44,612 --> 00:33:46,361
Dad, cut the seaweed nicely, all right?

558
00:33:46,361 --> 00:33:48,986
Yes, Sir.

559
00:33:50,462 --> 00:33:53,120
Put the rice on top.

560
00:33:54,166 --> 00:33:55,735
Looks good, looks good.

561
00:33:55,735 --> 00:33:59,305
And then, we take a piece of seaweed.

562
00:34:00,794 --> 00:34:03,407
We'll need two pieces.

563
00:34:14,675 --> 00:34:17,978
- And they're done.
- Done!

564
00:34:19,413 --> 00:34:21,673
<i>Thank you for the food.</i>

565
00:34:21,673 --> 00:34:23,014
Are you full?

566
00:34:23,014 --> 00:34:24,243
Yes!

567
00:34:24,243 --> 00:34:27,093
Can I bring the leftovers back for my mom?

568
00:34:27,093 --> 00:34:29,448
It's my day at mom's place tomorrow.

569
00:34:29,448 --> 00:34:32,377
Your day at mom's place?

570
00:34:32,377 --> 00:34:36,041
Yup! My mom's place is the room on the top floor.

571
00:34:36,041 --> 00:34:39,976
It's gorgeous, and the scenery from there is nicer than ours.

572
00:34:39,976 --> 00:34:42,182
Gorgeous?

573
00:34:42,182 --> 00:34:43,923
It's in the same apartment?

574
00:34:43,923 --> 00:34:45,495
Yup.

575
00:34:50,369 --> 00:34:52,113
Well... erm...

576
00:34:52,113 --> 00:34:55,161
Nijiro, want to go with me to the park and play soccer?

577
00:34:55,161 --> 00:34:57,119
- Really?
- Yay!

578
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,785
Okay, let's go.

579
00:35:23,174 --> 00:35:25,376
Hinata-san.

580
00:35:34,701 --> 00:35:39,746
He suggested that we move on to a serious relationship.

581
00:35:39,746 --> 00:35:42,332
He's doing away with the casual dating?

582
00:35:42,332 --> 00:35:47,984
He's younger than me, cheerful, and kind.

583
00:35:47,984 --> 00:35:50,928
He's thinking of getting married within this year.

584
00:35:50,928 --> 00:35:53,230
I'm impressed.

585
00:35:53,941 --> 00:35:56,766
And our conversation led to plans in starting a family.

586
00:35:56,766 --> 00:35:59,553
I have two cats,

587
00:35:59,553 --> 00:36:02,829
a twelve-year-old female, and a six-year-old male.

588
00:36:02,829 --> 00:36:05,216
I didn't know that.

589
00:36:05,216 --> 00:36:10,141
And then, he said he's allergic to cats.

590
00:36:10,141 --> 00:36:12,802
That's wonderful.

591
00:36:12,802 --> 00:36:16,175
- Pardon?
- Sorry, I got it wrong!

592
00:36:18,903 --> 00:36:25,730
He said... if I don't give my cats up, we can't live together.

593
00:36:26,268 --> 00:36:28,938
Then we can't get married.

594
00:36:28,938 --> 00:36:30,920
Is that so?

595
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:33,113
That's right.

596
00:36:33,113 --> 00:36:36,036
Other than the cat allergy, he has no problem with everything else.

597
00:36:36,036 --> 00:36:39,332
- Is that so?
- That's right.

598
00:36:40,334 --> 00:36:42,534
I have a friend who loves cats.

599
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:45,226
So I believe she can take them in.

600
00:36:45,226 --> 00:36:48,121
- Is that so?
- That's right.

601
00:36:48,121 --> 00:36:52,025
Even if I marry him, I can still meet them.

602
00:36:54,214 --> 00:36:56,615
Is that...

603
00:36:56,615 --> 00:36:58,769
the case?

604
00:37:02,009 --> 00:37:06,449
The cats are your family, right?

605
00:37:06,449 --> 00:37:07,974
Perhaps...

606
00:37:07,974 --> 00:37:12,391
you can still marry him, but not live together with him.

607
00:37:12,391 --> 00:37:15,761
Marriage comes in various forms these days.

608
00:37:17,576 --> 00:37:20,433
You're surprisingly open-minded.

609
00:37:20,433 --> 00:37:23,750
That's because words can change, too.

610
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:26,735
During the Heian period, the word "to live"

611
00:37:26,735 --> 00:37:29,224
also applied to a marriage where the couple lived apart,

612
00:37:29,224 --> 00:37:32,554
and the man occasionally visited the woman.

613
00:37:34,388 --> 00:37:36,343
In The Tales of Ise,

614
00:37:36,343 --> 00:37:42,057
the phrase "The man ceases to live there" means he doesn't visit anymore-

615
00:37:42,057 --> 00:37:44,331
Oh, I'm sorry.

616
00:37:44,331 --> 00:37:46,335
It's okay.

617
00:37:49,362 --> 00:37:55,788
What's important, is whether that person lives in your heart. Don't you think so?

618
00:37:58,358 --> 00:38:00,557
In my heart...

619
00:38:03,717 --> 00:38:05,519
If possible,

620
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:11,053
I hope you can marry a person who can also live with your family.

621
00:38:20,868 --> 00:38:23,386
You are right.

622
00:38:32,952 --> 00:38:35,004
I'm sorry.

623
00:38:37,818 --> 00:38:41,550
I'm... so pathetic.

624
00:38:45,259 --> 00:38:47,199
Maybe...

625
00:38:47,868 --> 00:38:50,759
a part of me had been too impatient.

626
00:38:54,674 --> 00:38:58,526
I can't bear to give up my cats, after all.

627
00:39:16,924 --> 00:39:19,727
It's getting cold, so please use it.

628
00:39:19,727 --> 00:39:22,273
Thank you... very much.

629
00:39:27,794 --> 00:39:32,564
I guess I was hoping for someone to stop me.

630
00:39:32,564 --> 00:39:34,192
I see.

631
00:39:39,165 --> 00:39:41,605
I'm so glad...

632
00:39:43,757 --> 00:39:47,791
that your back seems fine, Sawada-san.

633
00:39:50,437 --> 00:39:52,736
Y-Yes, indeed.

634
00:39:54,014 --> 00:39:56,289
Indeed.

635
00:40:07,516 --> 00:40:10,035
For two days a week,

636
00:40:10,035 --> 00:40:13,143
Nijiro will stay over at her place.

637
00:40:14,099 --> 00:40:16,466
That gorgeous place?

638
00:40:16,466 --> 00:40:18,912
You don't find that normal, right?

639
00:40:18,912 --> 00:40:22,772
For a couple to live in the same apartment even after breaking up.

640
00:40:27,561 --> 00:40:31,960
She's much more competent than me, be it in her career, or housework.

641
00:40:34,429 --> 00:40:37,208
She got fed up and left,

642
00:40:37,714 --> 00:40:41,074
saying she doesn't need a husband who's only kind in words.

643
00:40:43,443 --> 00:40:48,714
So four years ago, she said, "It's your turn to raise him this time."

644
00:40:48,714 --> 00:40:51,134
So you became a single father?

645
00:40:54,255 --> 00:40:55,994
But...

646
00:40:56,558 --> 00:40:58,728
for Nijiro's sake,

647
00:40:58,728 --> 00:41:02,442
I felt it's better to live in the same apartment as her.

648
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:08,004
So that's what happened, huh?

649
00:41:09,524 --> 00:41:14,320
I don't know how Nijiro truly feels about this.

650
00:41:15,128 --> 00:41:18,031
About living together with me...

651
00:41:19,164 --> 00:41:22,441
and about shuttling between two rooms in the same apartment.

652
00:41:22,441 --> 00:41:25,481
Some people may find it weird.

653
00:41:32,357 --> 00:41:36,263
I know nothing about marriage,

654
00:41:36,263 --> 00:41:39,503
nor child-rearing at all.

655
00:41:39,503 --> 00:41:42,967
I didn't know Nijiro hates soba.

656
00:41:42,967 --> 00:41:44,166
I apologize for his rudeness.

657
00:41:44,166 --> 00:41:45,649
No.

658
00:41:45,649 --> 00:41:50,082
I thought it's great that he could tell me what he didn't like.

659
00:41:50,082 --> 00:41:52,438
He could honestly tell me what he likes and dislikes,

660
00:41:52,438 --> 00:41:55,701
says "thank you" and "I'm full",

661
00:41:55,701 --> 00:41:57,901
and is full of smiles.

662
00:41:58,684 --> 00:42:01,557
I thought he's a really happy child.

663
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,657
It'll be great if he is.

664
00:42:19,993 --> 00:42:22,162
Here you go.

665
00:42:35,085 --> 00:42:40,577
To be honest, it was tiring for me every day.

666
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:45,640
Nijiro took up most of my time and energy.

667
00:42:46,302 --> 00:42:49,636
That's because Nijiro-kun's a lively boy.

668
00:42:49,636 --> 00:42:51,240
Yes.

669
00:42:52,703 --> 00:42:56,276
It's just that... sometimes...

670
00:42:56,276 --> 00:43:01,850
there were moments when I suddenly feel light-headed.

671
00:43:03,415 --> 00:43:05,845
It's like I'm being robbed,

672
00:43:05,845 --> 00:43:10,555
yet getting something in return.

673
00:43:12,346 --> 00:43:13,946
Yes.

674
00:43:51,570 --> 00:43:55,562
I've decided that it's fine as long as Nijiro is happy.

675
00:43:56,981 --> 00:43:58,981
But in the end,

676
00:43:58,981 --> 00:44:01,776
it's really about me.

677
00:44:03,196 --> 00:44:05,829
I can't give up on myself too.

678
00:44:13,191 --> 00:44:14,838
So...

679
00:44:15,414 --> 00:44:17,253
Kyoka-san...

680
00:44:21,926 --> 00:44:26,235
You're a good father, Seita-san.

681
00:44:27,854 --> 00:44:31,509
My dad also said the same thing.

682
00:44:32,171 --> 00:44:36,043
As long as I'm happy, it's fine.

683
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:43,860
Seeing you with Nijiro-kun today, I thought

684
00:44:45,210 --> 00:44:47,514
that you're a really...

685
00:44:49,855 --> 00:44:52,562
really good father.

686
00:44:58,118 --> 00:45:01,867
Whenever you need help, please let me know anytime.

687
00:45:01,867 --> 00:45:04,871
You know, like, picking Nijiro-kun up.

688
00:45:06,374 --> 00:45:08,124
Thank you.

689
00:45:08,124 --> 00:45:11,111
We have Hayate to help, too.

690
00:45:11,999 --> 00:45:15,468
I'll feel safe if it's the two of you.

691
00:45:22,761 --> 00:45:25,897
See you.

692
00:45:27,707 --> 00:45:29,598
Bye bye.

693
00:45:30,951 --> 00:45:32,763
You're good at making rice balls.

694
00:45:32,763 --> 00:45:35,031
- Was it fun?
- Yup.

695
00:45:38,003 --> 00:45:40,527
What, your maternal instincts have awakened?

696
00:45:40,527 --> 00:45:42,302
Huh? What are you talking about?

697
00:45:42,302 --> 00:45:43,907
Well, you were giving that kind of look.

698
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:45,911
We're simply seeing them off, aren't we?

699
00:45:45,911 --> 00:45:48,035
- Like a mom.
- Forgot something?

700
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:51,740
Nope.

701
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:55,832
Nijiro, what is something that's robbed from you, but makes you happy?

702
00:45:55,832 --> 00:45:57,354
- A riddle?
- Yeah.

703
00:45:57,354 --> 00:46:00,794
Something that's robbed from you, but makes you happy?

704
00:46:00,794 --> 00:46:02,794
- I have no idea.
- Your heart!

705
00:46:02,794 --> 00:46:05,102
What do you mean by that?

706
00:46:05,866 --> 00:46:08,750
Oh, it's that, right?

707
00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:10,351
Love robber.

708
00:46:10,351 --> 00:46:12,390
Love… what's that?

709
00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:14,030
A robber of love.

710
00:46:14,032 --> 00:46:17,597
A robber of love? Where did you learn that from?
