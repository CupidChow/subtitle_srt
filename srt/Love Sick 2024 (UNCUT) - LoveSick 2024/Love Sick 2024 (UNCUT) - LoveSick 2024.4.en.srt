1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:02,000
I came to see you today

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,560
Because I have something to ask.

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:05,880
Does Phun have someone else?

4
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,560
What do you really want?

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,360
I want to have you, Noh!

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:12,760
When you tried to kiss me,

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,080
I didn't pull away.

8
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:17,360
Because I like you too.

9
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,400
But I think this's enough

10
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,680
Whatever we took here,

11
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,400
let's just leave it here...

12
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,640
I like you!!!!!!!!!!!!!

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,240
I like you too!!!!!!!!!!

14
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:37,320
I'm really leaving now.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,720
Hello, Friday College kids!

16
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,200
[Teacher] In just a few days...

17
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,640
[Teacher] It's gonna be time for the traditional football event.

18
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,960
[Teacher] I want this event to be creative.

19
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,800
No forcing anyone.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,760
No one should be punishing anyone either.

21
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:14,840
[Teacher] Remember...

22
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,120
School activities...

23
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,120
[Teacher] ...aren’t life or death situations.

24
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,280
[Teacher] We do activities to gain experience...

25
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,600
- Why did you poke me?
- I didn’t poke you.

26
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,360
Then who? Is that you?

27
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,800
Not me!!

28
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:34,400
[Teacher] I want all of you to have good memories of this year's football event.

29
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:40,640
[Teacher] It's okay to lose, it's okay to make mistakes because it's all part of the experience.

30
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,400
[Teacher]  As long as we all enjoy the activity together, that's all that matters.

31
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:59,800
[EP4 Earn]

32
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,400
Well, you said you'd teach me...

33
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,440
I saw the football event is coming up soon.

34
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,280
We gotta hurry.

35
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,240
Huh?

36
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,480
You want me to teach you to play this...

37
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,440
before the event?

38
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,560
Are you crazy?

39
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,880
And didn't you see? Film already announced the main lineup.

40
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,640
Stop being dramatic.

41
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,440
There are plenty of other things to do.

42
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,320
Like welfare! They're short on people.

43
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,760
Yeah, sure!

44
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,520
-I’ll do it!
-No, you can't.

45
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,240
You can't let him be out in the sun.

46
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,600
It's freaking hot.

47
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,040
It's hot every day!

48
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,440
Not for him!

49
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,560
Come on, Mick.

50
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,720
Let's go check the equipment.

51
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,000
In the A/C nice and cool.

52
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,440
No need to suffer with Ohm.

53
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
[Ohm's mouth] Fuck!

54
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,760
Let’s go!

55
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,240
Dude...

56
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,240
What’s up?

57
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,000
Is there any month in Thailand that isn’t hot?

58
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,920
I don’t think so.

59
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,680
El Niño.

60
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,000
Huh?

61
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,320
Whoa!

62
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,720
Amazing.

63
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:53,880
They´re all unique!

64
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:23,040
[Noh's mouth] What the hell's with you?

65
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,200
[Ohm's mouth] Fuck you!

66
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,720
What's up?

67
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,720
What the hell have you been doing lately?

68
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,960
You’re always with the club now.

69
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,880
You don’t hang out with your "new friend" anymore?

70
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,480
Who?

71
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,920
You mean Phun?

72
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,560
I've never really hung out with him that much.

73
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,000
But aren’t you worried about him?

74
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,320
What about our club funds?

75
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,080
Hey, we’ll get them.

76
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,320
He’s not like that.

77
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,600
Better be sure.

78
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,200
I’m sure!

79
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,120
Guys!

80
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,120
We're here!

81
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,120
Here!

82
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,480
Right here!

83
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,480
What the hell is wrong with you guys?

84
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,560
They're here!

85
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,800
They’re waiting out front.

86
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,040
Calm down! Calm down! What’s here?

87
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,360
The drums are here!

88
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,040
Holy shit!!!

89
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,680
Aren't those pants too long!!!

90
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,520
Back in my day, they were super short.

91
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,760
Wanna see some pics from my time? Super cool!

92
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,040
I’m telling you.

93
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:11,600
Hello, boss!

94
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,280
Hey!

95
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,520
Noh!

96
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,120
Long time no see!

97
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,560
-Your hair didn’t grow at all?
-Oh, what?

98
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,200
Yeah, yeah! You wanna fight?

99
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,720
How’s the football event?

100
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,680
Good?

101
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,920
It’s fine, boss.

102
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,200
Football losses are fine,

103
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,000
but the club can’t lose face!

104
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,799
Oh man, we're gonna turn heads!

105
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,400
Chill out!

106
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,159
Who’d you learn to brag like that from?

107
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,880
-From you.
-From me?

108
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:43,840
Yeah!

109
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,280
Alright, quit wasting time. Pay up and take the goods.

110
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,800
Bro...

111
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,680
-When was that?
-Well,

112
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,080
a month ago, I guess.

113
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:16,880
What?

114
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,040
What are you three doing here?

115
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,600
-Why not go to rehearsal?
-Uh...

116
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,680
Trying to skip cheerleading practice?

117
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,560
-Wanna start something?
-Hey!

118
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,360
Chill out, man!

119
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,800
What’ve you guys been up to?

120
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,480
You're having exams, right?

121
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,480
Next time if you’ve got something going on, just tell us. We won’t get mad.

122
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,080
Alright, go get ready for your exams.

123
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,120
Aren’t you spoiling them too much?

124
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,240
What if the formation fails on the actual day?

125
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,520
The formation fails?

126
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,080
The school’s reputation will just take a hit.

127
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,320
But the school doesn’t have feelings, does it?

128
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,440
It is they who have feelings.

129
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,760
If this year’s activity...

130
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,560
isn’t fun for you, then why'd you do it.

131
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,560
Am I right?

132
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,600
Remember what the teacher said?

133
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,000
This year’s football event... forget about the school!

134
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,280
Let’s make memories instead.

135
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,880
The kind where, even in 10 years...

136
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,760
you’ll still think this event was the most fun ever.

137
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,240
Can you do that?

138
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,240
Hell yeah!

139
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,560
Huh?

140
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,880
So you got your budget cut?

141
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,160
-And the council’s helping you out?
-Yeah, that’s right.

142
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,360
Man, I’m confused!

143
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,560
But you're pretty well-connected, huh? The council’s even helping you out.

144
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:06,080
But with the council helping, it’s gonna take some time.

145
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,440
Got it!

146
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,360
Here’s the deal:

147
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,960
take the stuff and you can pay me later.

148
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,160
Really, bro! Thank you.

149
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,920
But no later than this week.

150
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,680
-Oh, seriously?
-What the hell, man?

151
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,400
You gotta understand me too.

152
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,000
I’ll get scolded by my dad!

153
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:36,280
He goes off on me every time I bring stuff for you guys.

154
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:40,000
He's always making a fuss. He should learn to be compassionate.

155
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,960
-Alright?
-Got it.

156
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,760
Okay, let's go.

157
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,880
Get the stuff.

158
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,680
Oh!

159
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,320
And this is...

160
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,480
the food that we will provide at the stand, what do you think?

161
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,680
Damn! Looks delicious!

162
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,000
If we’d had food this good back in our day...

163
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,240
Hey!

164
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:15,880
So...

165
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,360
I’ll send you the restaurant info on Line, okay?

166
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,520
-I have to go practice first.
-Okay?

167
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,240
Just help me out.

168
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,040
Will a week be enough?

169
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,520
Phun!

170
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,760
[Stressed voice] Did you get the money yet?

171
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,720
Is it too serious?

172
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,480
Damn Phun!

173
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,160
Can I ask about the money?

174
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,320
Too rude?

175
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,280
Sweetie Phun!

176
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,360
Did you get the money, beb?

177
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,880
Too sweet? So funny.

178
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,000
Noh!

179
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,360
Still not going home?

180
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,360
Nah, I just came...

181
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,160
to check on you guys at the stand.

182
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,200
It’s not that bad.

183
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,800
Then come help me out.

184
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,560
I’ll make you vice president.

185
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,280
I don't want it.

186
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,680
Nah, I’m good.

187
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,280
And then...

188
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,400
How's your work lately? Busy?

189
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,720
Crazy busy!

190
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,520
The new drums just arrived and I have no money to pay for them.

191
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,680
So frustrating!

192
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,760
Why though?

193
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,560
Well,

194
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,320
We messed up the budget.

195
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,760
So we have to wait for the council's money.

196
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,080
As you are the cheering president,

197
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,960
have you ever messed up like this?

198
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,400
Never, right?

199
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,360
How much are the drums?

200
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,560
More than 50,000 baht, and it is due this week.

201
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,480
[Funds received notification]

202
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,440
Hey!

203
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,280
Is that your money?

204
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,160
Yeah.

205
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,120
If you ever need anything, just let me know.

206
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,040
I’m always here to help.

207
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,680
Hey, don’t worry. I’ll transfer it back.

208
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,160
-Give me you account number.
-Hey, no need.

209
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,320
No need!

210
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,320
Well,

211
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,080
You can pay me back when you have the money.

212
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,000
-I really appreciate it.
-Alright.

213
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,200
If you need help, just hit me up.

214
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,360
I can do it all.

215
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,720
You sure you mean that?

216
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,240
Try to tell me first

217
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,240
It's not that hard.

218
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,040
I want you to...

219
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,200
to...

220
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,000
to...

221
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:06,599
-I want you to...
-Whoa!

222
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,440
You say it once.

223
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,040
I want you to...

224
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,440
Please get the water from the marching band for us on event day.

225
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,520
But doesn’t the stand already have water?

226
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,520
Well, yes.

227
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,000
But that day’s gonna be hectic.

228
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,360
And then...

229
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,200
You...

230
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,240
come help me out with...

231
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,280
Give me some food and water.

232
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,160
I don’t wanna bother the welfare guys.

233
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:45,880
How?

234
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:48,760
You mean...

235
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,320
You want me to get food and drinks for you?

236
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,160
That's it?

237
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,240
Yep.

238
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,280
Hey, no problem!

239
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,320
That’s easy, chill.

240
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,560
But you gotta wait until the marching band’s done, alright?

241
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,080
Okay.

242
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:06,920
I’ll wait.

243
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,600
Yep.

244
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,400
Let’s go, head home.

245
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,400
Man, you nailed it! Can I jut try?

246
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,680
So, did Earn really pay upfront?

247
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,800
-Yeah.
-But it was a lot.

248
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,200
I heard Ern also chipped in quite a bit for the stand.

249
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,720
Hey!

250
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,840
It's fine. Just pay him back when you’ve got the money.

251
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,440
But this stuff...

252
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,160
I think we should get Earn’s name engraved.

253
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,880
[Meet me at the same place.]

254
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,280
Always Friday

255
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,920
That's so cool.

256
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,160
It'll make you think of school.

257
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,960
It's his idea.

258
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,320
So, I'll take this one.

259
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,400
No way! Give it to the juniors first.

260
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:44,960
You can take it later.

261
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,040
Damn...

262
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,080
Fucking rare!

263
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,360
Our year didn't have this.

264
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,240
We just had to be on the stand and it was so freaking hot.

265
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,360
What the heck!

266
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,800
And we got yelled at up there.

267
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,920
Hey, Earn!

268
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,760
Are you ready to have someone yet?

269
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:09,880
Why?

270
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,080
Every cheer  president does, you know.

271
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,880
Soon you'll have them lining up like a conveyor belt.

272
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:17,800
Nope!

273
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,240
I don't like anyone else.

274
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,120
Or...

275
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,120
do you already have someone you like?

276
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,480
Hey, tell me.

277
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,960
Who is it? Which school?

278
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,280
Spill it!

279
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:58,480
[Noh types and deletes] When will we receive club funds?

280
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:07,640
[Noh types and deletes] What did the council say?

281
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,360
[Noh types] Phun!

282
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,160
[The message was sent].

283
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,320
Jeez, did I already send it?

284
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,400
[Phun!]

285
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,280
[What's up?]

286
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,280
[Noh] Where're you?

287
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,400
[Phun] Council.

288
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,560
People with partners are like this.

289
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,160
Always glued to their phones.

290
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,600
[Phun's message] Where are you Noh?
Want me to see you?

291
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,000
[Noh's message] In half a second, see you.

292
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:44,920
Hey, Noh!

293
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,760
Why're you here?

294
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,120
Why didn’t you say you were at the door?

295
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,240
Earn!

296
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,960
That’s the stand necklace, right?

297
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,240
-Yeah!
-It’s awesome!

298
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,920
Can I have it if it is left.

299
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,560
-You want it?
-Sure!

300
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,720
I’ll give it to you.

301
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:26,800
Wait.

302
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,520
Why didn’t you give it to me first?

303
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,160
Didn’t you say to wait for the juniors?

304
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,360
Well,

305
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:38,680
The president of the music club is definitely getting one anyway, right?

306
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,400
I, the president of the student council.

307
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,280
Maybe I'll return it?

308
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,920
Oh it's okay.

309
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,560
Nah, I’m just giving this to the juniors first.

310
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,640
People see what you're wearing.

311
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,760
You’ll look good in it anyway.

312
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,480
I’ll be back.

313
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,480
Alright, I’ll be back too.

314
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,080
Phun!

315
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:24,960
I’ll give you next time.

316
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,760
Phun!

317
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,400
Damn Phun!

318
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,960
I wanna talk about the club’s budget.

319
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,160
I’m following up on it.

320
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,760
Sorry for the delay.

321
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,760
Hey, if you’re working on it, no worries.

322
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,000
Aren’t you in a rush to use it?

323
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,160
At first, yeah. But not anymore.

324
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,120
The other day...

325
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,760
the store delivered the drums.

326
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,840
They wanted me to pay right away.

327
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,600
-You can take it from me first.
-Nah, no need.

328
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,280
I ran into Earn, and he transferred me the money.

329
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,880
If I get yours, I’ll just pay him back faster.

330
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,440
You talked about this with Earn?

331
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,200
I saw him yesterday, so I asked for his advice.

332
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,400
Asked for advice?

333
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,040
What’s the deal?

334
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,040
You didn’t tell me...

335
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,560
because you don’t trust me, right?

336
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,000
Learn to say no.

337
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,240
Learn to talk back.

338
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:44,600
Learn to say no.

339
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:45,960
Learn to talk back.

340
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,280
Learn to say no.

341
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,320
Learn to talk back.

342
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:49,640
Learn to say no...

343
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,640
-Hey, kid...
-Oh, what’s your problem, huh?

344
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,880
Why do you keep asking for money?

345
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,360
I’m not afraid, but it’s annoying.

346
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,120
Stop trying to mooch off me.

347
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,760
I’m fed up. Not giving you anymore!

348
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,240
What the hell was that?

349
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,760
Has Piccolo's stuff all arrived yet?

350
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,440
-Can you check for me?
-Yes, there are 4 over there.

351
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,800
Hey Noh! You gonna polish all of these yourself?

352
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,640
Yes, no more money to take to the store.

353
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,320
Ask Earn.

354
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,160
Try asking him again.

355
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,080
[Noh's mouth] Fuck you!

356
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,880
The store just delivered them and they want me to pay right away.

357
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,640
-You can take it from me first.
-Nah, no need.

358
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,480
P'Noh!

359
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:51,760
Noh!

360
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,560
Need any help from me?

361
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,960
Go work over there.

362
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,720
No, I wanna do this.

363
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,520
-Per!
-Yes!

364
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,640
Is your friend in front of the room?

365
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,640
Uh, yeah.

366
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,160
Why don't you bring him in?  It's hot outside.

367
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,240
If it's hot, why he'd stay there.

368
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:20,160
Bring your friend inside. Let them cool off in the A/C.

369
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,640
Come in

370
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,440
Hello everyone...

371
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,480
Hey there!

372
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,320
-Anything I can help with?
-Nope, no need.

373
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,520
Oh, nice.

374
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,560
Help polish the instruments. There's tons of them.

375
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,720
-Why are you making the kid do it?
-He asked to help, right?

376
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,160
-Got it. Over there, right?
-Yep.

377
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,880
Ouch...

378
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,280
Sorry about that.

379
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,040
-Wipe it first.
-Nah, it’s fine.

380
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,240
I’ll wipe it for him.

381
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,600
Guys, there’s someone here too.

382
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,680
He's practically part of the furniture.

383
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,320
Why are you so clumsy?

384
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:05,840
No, I'm not.

385
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:09,840
I can wash it myself.

386
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:15,840
I’ll wash it for you.

387
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,080
I told you not to come to the club.

388
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,680
Why are you so stubborn?

389
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,320
I’m not stubborn.

390
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,840
You said I’m grown now.

391
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,080
You told me to think for myself and not believe others so easily.

392
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:22,320
I said stand up to people, not stand up to me.

393
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,000
You’re waiting for me to get back, right?

394
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,440
Then stay still, don’t cause trouble.

395
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,800
I’ll take you out for a treat later.

396
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:48,840
Why are you smiling?

397
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,240
Nothing, nothing.

398
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:16,960
Ohm!

399
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:17,960
Hold it.

400
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,840
Please stop raining already, I wanna go home.

401
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,760
Seriously, man.

402
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,960
Hello?

403
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:33,960
Yes!

404
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,640
You’re in front of the school, right?

405
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,120
Yes, sir.

406
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,840
Give me a sec, I’m heading out now.

407
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,960
Alright, bye.

408
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,040
Hey, Mick.

409
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,720
No need to ask God.

410
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,280
The ghost is already here!

411
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,040
God or ghost,

412
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,440
both work for me!

413
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,840
Let’s go home.

414
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,120
Mam, get up!

415
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,440
Hey, Noh! See ya.

416
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,640
-Take care, P'Ohm!
-See  you later!

417
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:04,720
Let's go!

418
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,400
-Per!
-Hmm.

419
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,120
I'll hit the ATM real quick.

420
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:22,480
Are you mad at Film...

421
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,280
because of  Win?

422
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,320
Not mad,

423
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:35,880
just...

424
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:38,040
I don’t like people messing with him.

425
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,080
You talked to Earn about this?

426
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,320
Yeah, saw him yesterday, so I asked him for advice.

427
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,040
And you didn’t tell me...

428
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,520
...because you don’t trust me?

429
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,240
[Noh's message] You home?

430
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,160
[Ohm's message] Yeah!

431
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,280
[Noh's message] I need to ask you something.

432
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,440
-Sup?
-Nothing much.

433
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,440
Just needed to talk about a friend.

434
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,600
Which friend?

435
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,160
You don’t know him.

436
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,240
There’s no friend of yours I don’t know.

437
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:30,880
There is.

438
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,240
Alright, spill it.

439
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:34,920
It's like this...

440
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,040
So there’s this guy, A.

441
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:42,400
And he’s asking for help from B.

442
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,880
And B’s trying to help.

443
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,680
But then C steps in.

444
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,680
So A asks C for help instead.

445
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,000
Do you think A is a jerk?

446
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:53,880
Totally.

447
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,320
Why, though?

448
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,800
You think about it.

449
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,960
If you do group work

450
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,080
...and suddenly someone replaces you

451
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,760
because he works faster than you.

452
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,960
How would you feel?

453
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,080
Exactly.

454
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,200
Alright, I’m off for a shower.

455
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,520
Gotta think about it.

456
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,360
We should do this at home sometime.

457
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,320
What’s the concept of this dish?

458
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,040
If you can eat it, eat it.

459
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:26,600
If not, throw it away.

460
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,480
Whoa!

461
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,920
Crazy? Here's our boss.

462
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,240
Oops!

463
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,840
I got too into it.

464
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,440
Aggressive, huh? The ingredient is crocodile!

465
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,040
Nong Noh!

466
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:43,160
-Where are you going, Noh?
-Where are you going?

467
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,240
Nong Noh!

468
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:45,960
Noh!

469
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,840
I'll be back.

470
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,280
-Oh!
-Oh!

471
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,440
Where are you going, Noh?

472
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,280
-What's wrong with him?
-Noh!

473
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,120
Hey!

474
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:04,960
Where're you going?

475
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,440
How’d you get here?

476
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,440
Not home yet?

477
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,080
You hungry?

478
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,440
Well...

479
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,520
But I’m starving!

480
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,560
So, go get the helmet.

481
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:40,720
Quickly!

482
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,400
Hurry up!

483
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,160
Let's go, let's go!

484
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,480
Put on your helmet!

485
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,440
Hold on tight!

486
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,320
Hold tight!

487
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,000
Sir!

488
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,640
Two pork porridges please.

489
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,760
With eggs?

490
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:04,840
No, sir.

491
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:11,800
Never been here?

492
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,400
Just passed by.

493
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:17,480
[Restaurant owner] Mei, go serve porridge.

494
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,680
-Thank you, Jie!
-Thank you.

495
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,520
You'll see why I brought you here.

496
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:33,760
Why?

497
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:34,960
Here, try it.

498
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:48,840
How is it?

499
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,080
It’s good!

500
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,200
I told you!

501
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:19,840
Want some more?

502
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,320
I’m full!

503
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,600
Man...

504
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,360
I’m stuffed!

505
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,920
And you said you weren’t hungry.

506
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,600
Did I mishear you?

507
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:40,440
-How can you be the music club president with bad ears?
-Hey!

508
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,520
We're giving free Chao kuai today!

509
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,120
Thank you.

510
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:03,720
Ouch!

511
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,440
What’re you looking at?

512
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:08,920
Looking at the lady.

513
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,400
She could...

514
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,440
trip on the stairs.

515
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,400
You were actually going to see me right?

516
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:30,640
Why would I?

517
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,440
Sorry for being grumpy earlier.

518
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:37,440
And what were you?

519
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,200
I don't know.

520
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,080
Maybe I’m mad you let someone else help.

521
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,080
I mean, Earn.

522
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,680
Hey!

523
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,600
I was just telling him...

524
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,200
Suddenly he transferred money. I was surprised too!

525
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,960
And why didn't you tell me when the drums arrived?

526
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,520
I didn’t wanna nag you.

527
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,640
I figured you were already on top of it, right?

528
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,400
When the money came, you’d let me know, right?

529
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:16,440
-Instead, you sweet-talked Earn?
-That's nuts!

530
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:27,720
Sir!

531
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,240
The bill, please.

532
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,120
I’ll pay...

533
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,200
so you know that I can transfer money quickly too.

534
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:40,640
I'm sorry too.

535
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,280
If I made you feel bad.

536
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,200
Did you tell anyone you'd be back this late?

537
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,080
I told Pang already.

538
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,360
When she found out I was with you,

539
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:05,160
she said I didn't have to come back.

540
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:06,480
Really?

541
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:08,840
Sorry, sir!

542
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:10,400
I’ll take you home myself.

543
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:12,560
Give me five stars, okay?

544
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:14,880
Come here.

545
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,200
Noh...

546
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:34,880
Stay still.

547
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:22,720
I forgot to return it to Earn!

548
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:27,240
I’ll return it to him.

549
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:40,600
Phun!

550
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:43,640
You...

551
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,040
Still remember what happened at the beach?

552
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:00,440
Of course I do.

553
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:07,000
But it's not that simple.

554
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:59,640
Film to Art, where are you? Come here.

555
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:03,200
Art to Film, copy that.

556
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:22,240
Damn, it’s 2 AM.

557
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:26,760
Noh, my hat's loose.

558
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:28,560
Here, I’ll fix it.

559
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,920
All set! Try it on.

560
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,360
Thanks, P'Noh! You got this,

561
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:35,760
You got this too!

562
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:37,240
Come on!

563
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:38,720
P'Noh, where's the hat?

564
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:40,280
Over there, yeah right there.

565
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:42,880
P'Noh, when can the parents come in?

566
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,760
-The field opens at 8 AM.
-Alright, sir.

567
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:48,840
P'Noh, the bathroom’s locked!

568
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:53,000
If it's locked, use another one!

569
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:55,000
Or pee on the wall! I'll show you.

570
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:56,280
Hey, no need!

571
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:58,200
I gotta pee, though.

572
00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:59,280
I wanna go too.

573
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:01,000
Damn it!

574

Learn to think for yourself,

575
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:04,440
don't ask him everything!

576
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:06,720
Got it?!

577
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:11,440
It's me, not him.

578
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,960
Sorry, I got pissed off.

579
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:17,960
Just let it go, man.

580
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:20,600
The kids are excited. Back in our day, it was even crazier.

581
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:21,800
What do you mean?

582
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:25,120
You stayed up all night and fell asleep during the march!

583
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:27,240
And you were the only one playing off-key, idiot!

584
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:29,200
Not true!

585
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:30,760
What is not true?

586
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,680
-No way! You’re lying, man.
- Yes way!

587
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:34,200
Don't argue with me. I remember!

588
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:39,120
Here's the water, bro.

589
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:42,000
-Thanks a lot, I was just feeling sleepy.
[Earn]-  Let's clean it and pack it up.

590
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:46,800
-Noh!
-Oh, hey Ern!

591
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:49,640
Did you wake up?

592
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:51,520
Seems sleepwalking?

593
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:54,240
Did you sleep here?

594
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:57,400
Sleep? I've been getting called all night!

595
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:00,360
See? I told you to join my club.

596
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:02,320
I'll let you sleep like nobody's bothering you.

597
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:03,360
Nah, man.

598
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:05,520
But this year’s staff uniforms look amazing.

599
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:08,160
Actually, I signed up for it at first,

600
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,400
but the club wouldn't let me...

601
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:11,640
I missed out on wearing it.

602
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:13,120
Want to wear it?

603
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:14,440
I'll find you one.

604
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:16,600
It's okay.

605
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:19,400
-The club has extras.
- Noh, seriously, I’m good.

606

Everyone’s looking for you.

609

Can I bring you now?

610
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,960
Oh, alright.

611
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,240
-Catch you later.
-You got this!

612
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:33,440
If you're sleepy, just turn off your walkie-talkie.

613
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:35,040
-I'll get scolded!
-It's up to you.

614
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:35,920
See you later!

615
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:54,440
Phun!

616
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:56,200
Help me hook up the computer.

617
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:58,240

You're sleepy?

620
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:11,440
You haven't slept yet.

621
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:13,240
It's okay.

622
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:14,360
I’m totally fine.

623
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:16,360
You?

624
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,040
You should rest.

625
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,680
Go sleep. I’ll wake you in the morning.

626
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:23,640
Nah,

627
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:27,040
You’re not sleepy, then I’m not either. I’ll stay up with you, okay?

628
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:28,280
Okay.

629
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,800
Alright then, I’ll see you.

630
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:39,240
Huh? Everyone’s been here since last night?

631
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:43,080
-Yeah.
-Ohm, nobody told me.

632
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:46,240
We would tell you, but P'Ohm...

633
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:48,240
You didn’t need to march,

634
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:49,840
so why rush here?

635
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:51,320
Here...

636
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:55,920
your job is to walk around the band with this.

637
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:00,600
No need to be dramatic!

638
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:06,720
Your job is important. Look at everyone, they look like a zombie band.

639
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,080
We need someone well-rested to keep things in check.

640
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:15,920
And that’s why I picked you.

641
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:17,240
Don’t let me down.

642
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:23,920
I’ll take care of everyone.

643
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,560
And I’ll take care of you too, Ohm!

644
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:28,600
You're so small, but you talk big, huh?

645
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:32,640
Hey, what are you doing, Ohm?

646
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:35,240
Stop it.

647
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:36,640
What are you doing to the kid?

648
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:38,160
That's enough.

649
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:43,000
Are you okay?

650
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:44,720
Hey, guys! Wake up!

-100 baht for each wrong note?
-Nice!
