If one day...

00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:03,800
I ever mess up,

00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,000
promise you won't hate me?

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:09,400
Are you free this evening?

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,240
I can’t take this anymore.

6
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:14,200
Why don’t you come by my school?

7
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,079
There’s a music event.

8
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,200
Are you sleepy, Noh?

9
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,000
No, I’m not.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:23,800
So...

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,960

You hitting on Noh!?

Here comes Phun!

You're gonna get it from Phun now!

35
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,120
For sure!

36
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,280
You didn’t think at all, huh?

37
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,680
His girlfriend’s sitting right here.

38
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,560
Oh, sorry guys!

Student council band...

00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,600
If they don't pass the audition,

42
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,400
they'll cut our budget again next year.

43
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,960
It's okay if we don't make it, but if you're being a dick,

44
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,000
The budget we talked about is...

45
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,200
I ain’t scared.

46
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,520
Phun already transferred all the money to us, right?

47
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,320
For real?

48
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,080
Damn, Phun!

49
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,680
You hitting on Noh, bro?

You're so beautiful huh?

00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,600
[Noh's mouth] Fuck you!

52
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:53,840
Noh!

53
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:57,880
Hey, Grace!

54
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,280
I got some news, man.

55
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,480
Aim unmatched my friend just like that.

56
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,279
But I think this confirms it even more.

57
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,079
Honestly, from what I saw today, Phun and Aim...

58
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,960
don't seem like a couple at all.

59
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,200
Seemed more like close friends to me.

60
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,280
Really?

61
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,960
But, you know...

62
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,440
When they’re together,

63
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,200
maybe they get all lovey-dovey.

64
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,159
We wouldn't know.

65
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,800
True that.

66
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,280
Let me know if you need help.

67
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,320
Gotta go,

68
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,720
Mr. Chad’s picking me up now.

69
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,640
Later, bye!

00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,600
[EP7 “11:00 p.m.”]
Bro, do you think our school has ghosts?

71
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,400
Of course.

72
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,160
Every place has them, man.

73
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,440
There’s one standing right behind you now.

74
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,520
Not playing with you anymore.

75
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,960
If you’re this scared...

76
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,080
Why are you hanging out so late?

77
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,200
Thought I could help out.

78
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,400
Oh, help me remember to take you guys home, maybe?

79
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,640
-Still not heading home?
-Yeah.

80
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,040
And you?

81
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,120
I thought you’d already left.

82
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,040
I just turned off the lights in the council room.

83
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:42,159
Nice, we can walk back together then.

84
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,080
Yeah.

85
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,280
Ohm!

86
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,880
Do me a favor.

87
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,520
What’s up?

88
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,960
Aren’t we the ones who should be asking you guys for help?

89
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,560
Yeah...

90
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,200
But you can help me with this.

91
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,360
I think I like your kid, man.

92
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,920
Ngor, huh?

93
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,920
Think it through, bro.

94
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,680
Mick?

95
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,120
If you like him, just go for it.

96
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,720
I will.

97
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,680
But your kid's so hard to approach.

98
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,320
I don’t know how to act.

99
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:30,960
He’s tough ’cause...

100
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,280
maybe he doesn’t like you?

101
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,039
Alright, I’m out.

102
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,080
Goodnight.

103
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,440
Come on, let’s go, kids. Time to head home.

104
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,440
Yes, sir.

105

106
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,400
Hurry up!

107
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:57,840
Coming!

108
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,760
-Hey
-Shit!

109
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,400
Still here?

110
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,280
Yeah.

111
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,800
What about the others? They already left?

112
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,200
Yeah.

113
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,160
Alright, I keep you company.

114
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,000
Or do you want something else?

115
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,800
Stop it.

116
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,440
Won’t quit playing around, huh?

117
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,560
You’re pretty good fixing things.

118
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,360
How much does it cost to hire you for repairs in my home?

119
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,000
Smartass?

120
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,400
Hey, I’m sorry!

121
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,480
Did I distract you?

122
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,680
Yeah, man.

123
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,920
I’m about to sew your mouth shut!

124
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,760
Whoa, no, no! Don’t!

125
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,160
Can you skip this one?

126
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,040
Let's play something else.

127
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,600
-You'll get pushed by a ghost!
-What else?

128
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,440
You should keep it first.

129
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,640
Better this?

130
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,200
Don't!

131
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,760
The needle is there.

132
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,720
Stop it!

133
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,160
Noh!

134
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,600
Shall we go?

135
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,640
Yeah!

136
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,560
I'll wait outside.

137
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,760
I’ll go.

138
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,760
Didn’t you already leave?

139
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,040
Why are you here?

140
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,360
To pick up Noh.

141
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,960
You're that caring of a friend, huh?

142
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,200
You don’t have to. I was gonna take him home anyway.

143
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,760
I’m closer anyway.

144
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,840
Wherever it is, I can take him home.

145
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,000
Did you hear the song I sang?

146
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,600
I wasn’t joking.

147
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,400
And you?

148
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,880
I don't count you as a competitor if you're not clear with yourself.

149
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:46,200
[Ohm] You home yet?

150
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,080
[Noh] Almost.

151
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:56,000
[Ohm] Damn, it's late. Who are you with?

152
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,920
[Noh] Earn. But he disappeared now.

153
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,320
[Ohm] So you're alone?

154
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,960
[Ohm] Look to your right.

155
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,720
Shit!!!

156
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,840
Sanctus Michael, Archangele, defende nos in proelio.

157
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,400
Noh!

158
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,560
Whoa, sorry!

159
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,440
Yeah...

160
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,680
Are you...

161
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,080
scared?

162
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,480
Dude, you were gone for so long.

163
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,840
I thought you’d left.

164
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,360
Well...

165
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,360
I got caught up talking to him.

166
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,200
Right?

167
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:06,920
Yeah!

168
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,600
So...

169
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,160
You take him home.

170
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,680
How are you getting home?

171
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:16,880
I already called a ride.

172
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,240
So...

173
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,280
you go home with Phun.

174
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:25,880
I’m passing him to you first.

175
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,960
Bye, see you later!

176
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,760
How'd our band do?

177
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,400
Tired?

178
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:05,840
Wanna grab food?

179
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,000
That porridge place?

180
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,640
You in?

181
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,080
You mad at me?

182
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,200
Sorry for bringing Aim along.

183
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,200
I really felt bad for her.

184
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,400
You can curse me if you want.

185
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,560
But I really came back to pick you up.

186
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,200
Don't be like this.

187
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,520
Listen to me, I’m not mad.

188
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,400
I don't care who you bring.

189
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,040
And I don’t care either.

190
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,240
You wanna bring her, that’s your call.

191
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,240
Right... why would you care?

192
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,680
I’m not as good as Earn.

193
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,120
Well,

194
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,640
you're right.

195
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,600
Earn’s cute.

196
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,640
And he’s also warm and caring.

197
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:41,200
Anyone who gets him as a boyfriend's damn lucky.

198
00:16:59,080 --> 00:16:59,880
Noh!

199
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,800
Open your eyes when you walk.

200
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,760
Were you up late last night?

201
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,200
What's wrong with him?

202
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:32,800
Hello, Noh!

203
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,800
Are you okay?

204
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,280
Nong Mick!

205
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,560
Where you heading?

206
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,200
I’ll drop you off.

207
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,200
Hey there!

208
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,080
Let’s head to class.

209
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,040
-Hey Ohm, help me out.
-Nah.

210
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,080
Just give me his Line ID, I’ll handle the rest.

211
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,360
You'd better send him a message on IG.

212
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,000
I already did but he didn't answer.

213
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,280
It’s pretty clear he’s not interested, dude.

214
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,400
Hell no!

215
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,800
I’m serious today, man.

216
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,480
I swear, if I get him...

217
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,760
If I become his boyfriend...

218
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,160
I'll take good care of him.

219
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,280
You know I do.

220
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,120
I always took care of my exes.

221
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,040
Then why are they all your exes?

222
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,600
‘Cause they dumped me.

223
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,080
Please!

224
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,240
What do you want me to do?

225
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,720
Or what do you want?

226
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,480
You're asking me to give you our kid?

227
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,520
No, It’s called a trade.

228
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,920
You help me get him, and I’ll give you...

229
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,200
Funding for your club.

230
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,400
So, what do I get?

231
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,280
Well...

232
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,000
I’ve got two authentic vintage Nirvana shirts.

233
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,400
Two shirts.

234
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,200
plus a Kurt Cobain one!

235
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,400
But I’m just recommending here.

236
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,160
Yeah, thank you, dude!

237
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,560
Thanks, man!

238
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,040
So, what's between Fi and you?

239
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,000
Are you close to him?

240
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:52,200
You asked me as if you were my wife.

241
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,400
Damn, that's gross.

242
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,600
Phun!

243
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,640
What’s with that?

244
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,360
Not that close anymore?

245
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,000
I’ll punch you, man!

246
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,240
Ouch, that hurts.

247
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,960
Didn’t even get any work done.

248
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:09,960
Phun!

249
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,920
Don't you wash your hands?

250
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,080
Still waiting for what?

251
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,200
Go for it, dude!

252
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,600
I can’t take this anymore.

253
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,280
What’s up with you?

254
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,000
Follow me

255
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,280
-Me again?
-Be quick!

256
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,600
I’ll be right back.

257
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,080
Eh, Noh!

258
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,600
What are you doing here?

259
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,520
Delivering documents.

260
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,160
Why didn't you ask our kids to do it?

261
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Because I wanted to.

262
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,160
-You’re coming with me.
-Huh?

263
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,000
Come on!

264
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,240
I bring you the documents.

265
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:16,960
Just leave them.

266
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,640
-What’s going on with you two?
-Nothing.

267
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,840
Why did you skip class yesterday?

268
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,080
Lazy.

269
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,400
Tired of people.

270
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,760
What were you guys talking about?

271
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,720
Oh, yeah.

272
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,200
You went to watch the Friday music competition, right?

273
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,000
How was it?

274
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,240
I wanted to go.

275
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,800
Really? You went?

276
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,360
How’d you get in? I really wanted to go.

277
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,720
She got in because she's Phun's girlfriend.

278
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,920
Who’s your boyfriend to get you in?

279
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,240
True that.

280
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,400
Normally, they don’t let outsiders in.

281
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:39,720
But Phun asked Noh to let me in, so I can.

282
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,440
Whoa, Noh didn’t even invite me.

283
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,960
Phun must be crazy in love, wanting support like that.

284
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:53,360
So do you guys think Ohm wants my support too?

285
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,480
Nope.

286
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,920
Did you stay till the end? Was it late?

287
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,320
No.

288
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,600
He didn’t want me getting home late.

289
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,280
Right after he finished playing...

290
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,600
He told his friends he’d take me home first.

291
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,200
Excuse me?

292
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,000
Are we at a bragging contest now?

293
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,720
She’s got something to brag about!

294
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:30,760
Where’d you run off to?

295
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,760
Did you see me sitting over here?

296
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,840
Keep your eyes open.

297
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,480
Hey Noh!

298
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,200
How's the curry from that new place?

299
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,200
Salty as hell!

300
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:12,160
The rice is hard, and the fried chicken’s trash.

301
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,040
The veggies are dry.

302
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,240
Should feed it to the dogs.

303
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,480
Want some?

304
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,240
No, thanks.

305
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,160
What's up with that asshole?

306
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:26,800
What's wrong, dude?

307
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:28,760
It's about Phun?

308
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,520
What did you guys fight about?

309
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:33,520
I didn't fight.

310
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,920
Didn't do any shit.

311
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,320
What were you up to last night?

312
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,160
Fucking nothing, man.

313
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,680
I was dead tired.

314
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,480
He even tried to talk to me.

315
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,600
Think carefully.

316
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,960
You can curse me if you want.

317
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,080
But I really came back to pick you up.

318
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,720
Listen to me,

319
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,200
I’m not mad. I don't care who you bring.

320
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,480
And I don’t care either.

321
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,000
You wanna bring her, that’s your call.

322
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,600
You’ve figured it out now?

323
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,960
If you get it now,

324
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,120
go make up with him.

325
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,880
Stop being grumpy with everyone.

326
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,360
You're scaring everyone.

327
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,280
I'm leaving.

328
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:21,880
See you!

329
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:42,840
Tum!

330
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,720
Who are you here to see?

331
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,560
-I came to see Phun.
-Phun, right?

332
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,200
-Can you call him for me?
-Sure thing.

333
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,160
Phun!

334
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:53,840
Phun!

335
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,240
Hey, Phun!

336
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,120
Dude, he’s being salty.

337
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,200
-Hold on a sec.
-Okay.

338
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,960
Phun! Noh came to see you.

339
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:07,640
Let's go!

340
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:15,840
Noh, what’s up?

341
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,720
What’s with you?

342
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,280
I remembered what happened last night.

343
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,400
I was just tired. I’m sorry.

344
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,800
I didn’t mean it.

345
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,360
Anything else?

346
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,400
I gotta go.

347
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,560
Yeah, just go.

348
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,160
Go ahead, and don’t come back!

349
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,480
Hey!

350
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,600
What now?

351
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,200
In case you get sleepy later.

352
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:11,800
Thanked me yet?

353
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,560
Thanks.

354
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,840
What’s up with him?

355
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,200
Relax your body, keep your neck straight, back straight.

356
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,240
Now, try blowing.

357
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,240
Alright, alright, enough.

358
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,560
Am I better today?

359
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,680
Better than last time.

360
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,880
But not quite good yet.

361
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,880
How do I get as good as you?

362
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,360
Get reborn as me!

363
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,440
You’ve only practiced twice,

364
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,560
and you think you’ll be as good as me? You nuts?

365
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:20,320
I’m gonna practice hard and be just as good as you.

366
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,760
As good as me?

367
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,200
you gotta be better than me!

368
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,200
If you're gonna set a goal,

369
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,280
set it higher.

370
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:32,960
Yes, sir.

371
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,000
I’m gonna train hard

372
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,680
to be better and cooler than you.

373
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:37,520
Yeah!

374
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,760
That's good!

375
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,240
Before being cool though,

376
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,600
work on being less clumsy first.

377
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,360
Got it.

378
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,360
Where are you off to now?

379
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,040
Got class at Pensuk building.

380
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,480
Alright, I’ll take you there.

381
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,280
Oh.

382
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,880
Here to practice?

383
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:44,000
Mick, this is my friend, Fee.

384
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,240
Hello, sir.

385
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:52,080
So, where are you headed next?

386
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,240
Pensuk building.

387
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,360
Thought so.

388
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,160
My kid's going there too, so just go with him.

389
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,920
Ohm, let’s go together.

390
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,840
Take care of him.

391
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,080
I’m out.

392
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:31,920
Keng!

393
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,720
What the hell are you guys doing? I’m trying to study.

394
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:40,960
Hey, Noh!

395
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,280
Is your bae still mad?

396
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,200
Look at your face

397
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,040
What about my face?

398
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,280
Looks like a sad puppy waiting for food.

399
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,120
So, what's up with you and Phun?

400
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,760
What do you mean?

401
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,480
Even a blind dog could tell  something's up with you two.

402
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,920
What? We’re just friends.

403
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,960
-Friends?
-Yeah.

404
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,720
So if I got mad, would you sweet-talk me like that?

405
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:09,920
But nah,

406
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,960
I won't get mad.

407
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,440
Friends don't pull that stuff.

408
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,200
A lot of people.

409
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,200
Alright!

410
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,000
If you don’t wanna say it, don’t.

411
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,720
Stop it!

412
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,560
Didn’t you just say friends don’t get mad?

413
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,360
Asshole!

414
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,560
Phun’s enough to give me a splitting headache!

415
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,160
Fine, whatever.

416
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,560
Tell me when you actually wanna talk.

417
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:38,960
Hmm.

418
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,360
Ouch!

419
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,720
That hurt!

420
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,280
Done!

421
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,360
Hooray!

422
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,600
Noh! So, who are you rooting for?

423
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,400
Earn's band, right?

424
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,719
Why?

425
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:11,600
When Earn was singing,

426
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:13,040
he was totally looking at you like...

427
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,120
That time...

428
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:19,760
Earn walked out and said...

429
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,120
Listen carefully to this song.

430
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:26,960
You go help Art!

431
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,120
Fine, I will.

432
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:42,040
Wait, wait, wait!

433
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,920
-Hey, Ngor, stick this on the door.
-Yes, sir.

434
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,080
Eh, let me see first.

435
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,880
Eh, I’m gonna hit the bathroom. I'll be back.

436
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,560
Hey, Fee!

437
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,160
Oh, what's up?

438
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,920
Did you Phun?

439
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,200
You didn’t see him, and you think I would?

440
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,160
Lately, you are closer to him than I am.

441
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:27,880
Whatever,

442
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:28,920
I’ll ask him for you.

443
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,120
Why are you guys mad about?

444
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,680
Hello, Phun?

445
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:40,680
Where are you?

446
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,600
At the gym?

447
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:45,920
Alright, I'll go first.

448
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:51,200
Yeah, I’ll send someone to pick you up.

449
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,360
Make sure your hair’s awesome.

450
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,480
Noh!

451
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,520
Did my band pass the audition?

452
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:06,840
Go check the club board.

453
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:12,800
Alright.

454
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:15,880
I’ll...

455
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:22,720
What are you doing here?

456
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,120
Ready to go home?

457
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:33,480
What are you doing here?

458
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:35,720
Stop being mad.

459
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,120
Just let it go.

460
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:44,720
Come down.

461
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:53,800
I was just sleepy back then.

462
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,560
I’m sorry.

463
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:05,560
If you forgive me, I'll buy you snacks.

464
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,960
Fine, be mad! I'm out!

465
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,640
Just came to tell you your band made it!

466
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,800
Congrats!

467
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,320
Not gonna try harder?

468
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,760
You messing with me?

469
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,280
Nah...

470
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,680
I was mad at first but I'm cool now.

471
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,200
Let's make up.

472
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,280
Can you be as cute as just now?

473
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,800
Cute? You’re dreaming.

474
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,320
So...

475
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,080
were you really mad?

476
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,240
If it’s about that thing,  I wasn’t mad.

477
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,520
I deserved it for talking to you when you were sleepy.

478
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,880
But seriously, I didn’t mean it.

479
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,720
You bringing Aim was your right.

480
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:30,720
But about Earn, I was mad.

481
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,720
You know Earn likes you, right?

482
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,840
And that’s my fault?

483
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,680
No, it’s not.

484
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,440
I’m just frustrated.

485
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,840
There’s nothing I can do.

486
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,080
I wasn’t with you last night.

487
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,000
I'm sorry.

488
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,680
But...

489
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,600
you did come back to pick me up.

490
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,840
I didn’t just do it as a favor.

491
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:09,880
I meant to.

492
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,680
So, what 's up with Earn?

493
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,560
Phun!

494
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,120
Listen to me.

495
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:23,320
I’m not so easy that I’ll go with anyone who likes me.

496
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:29,960
Right now...

497
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:31,880
I only like Phun!

498
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:33,880
And no one else.

499
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,320
Remember that.

500
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,560
I like you too.

501
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,760
-Where are you off to?
-I think I’ll just head home.

502
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:44,040
-Aren't you going to Siam with me?
-All good. Don’t you have a meeting after?

503
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,560
That's right.

504
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,480
I think he's waiting for you.

505
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,080
Ignore him.

506
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:58,920
Per!

507
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,560
You go on ahead.

508
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,960
I’m heading out. Talk nicely, okay?

509
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,440
-Bye!
-See ya!

510
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,600
Why are you following me?

511
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,120
I'm going home.

512
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:21,880
I'm not.

513
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:22,920
You go on your own then.

514
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:24,800
Not going home?

515
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:26,480
Where are you going?

516
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:30,920
I have plans.

517
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:32,920
With who?

518
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,280
If you didn't know one thing,

519
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:41,880
would you die, huh?

520
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,400
You wanna know?

521
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,280
Just come along.

522
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,240
-Noh!!
-Ouch!

523
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:28,960
It hurts.

524
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:31,120
Now I won't help you pick To-san's gift!

525
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,520
No way! You promised me already.

526
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,400
So, what are you gonna buy? Decided yet?

527
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,200
What do you think, Noh?

528
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,160
What does your dad like?

529
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:47,200
Anything but mystery box, I guess.

530
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:51,920
How’d you know? I was just thinking that!

531
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,600
I'm smart!

532
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:54,680
Clever!

533
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,760
How’d you know?

534
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,360
So, how’d you know?

535
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,400
You’ve got mind-reading powers

536
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,200
This one's really delicious.

537
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,080
Noh!

538
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:25,600
Is it cute?

539
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:27,720
Yeah, it's cute.

540
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:30,520
The skirt.

541
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:31,760
The skirt’s cute.

542
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:33,680
Isn’t it too short?

543
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,200
Yeah, it’s short.

544
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:38,520
Aren't you worried?

545
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:40,800
Wear it if you like.

546
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,600
Just be careful wearing it.

547
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,600
Maybe wear some shorts underneath.

548
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:48,800
So...

549
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:50,280
You are worried, huh?

550
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:53,360
Yeah.

551
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:57,280
Ma’am, I’ll take this one!

552
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,440
How many do you have? I’ll buy them all.

553
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:00,200
Huh?

554
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:02,600
Where’d you get all that money?

555
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:04,960
I’m broke over here.

556
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,720
Still haven't found To-san's gift...

557
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,760
I'm not surprised at all.

558
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:17,040
Noh!

559
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:23,280
Noh!

560
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:27,960
Remember when we first met?

561
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:33,640
At the Open House event?

562
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,040
-Nope.
-It wasn’t?

563
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:42,520
It was on that day...

564
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:44,160
when the storm hit.

565
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:01,920
Are you alright?

566
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:11,000
Can you stand?

567
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,040
Sorry.

568
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:18,920
1...2...3… up!

569
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,120
You looked so cool back then.

570
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:42,080
And when I saw you at the school open house,

571
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:43,600
it felt like fate.

572
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:44,920
Wow!

573
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:48,240
Who else will be as nice and cool like you?

574
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:51,480
Anyone who saw would have helped.

575
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:54,760
Imagine you have a boyfriend.

576
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,200
And he doesn’t do this kind of stuff...

577
00:45:58,520 --> 00:45:59,320
Dump him.

578
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:02,760
So it can't be you, then?

579
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:11,560
I’ve met a good guy.

580
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:14,160
but he's not budging.

581
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:26,680
Yu!

582
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:31,560
Just kidding.

583
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:34,280
Whoa!

584
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,200
Just shooting my shot, ya know?

585
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:11,920
Ice cream.

586
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:13,160
Thanks.

587
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:15,280
Careful, it’ll melt.

588
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:17,320
True that.

589
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:19,480
Favorite flavor?

590
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:20,880
Exactly.

591
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:22,120
You know me, huh?

592
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:23,760
Of course!

593
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:25,320
We’ve been talking for two months.

594
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:33,920
Aren’t you inviting your friend to join?

595
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:41,360
Don’t worry about him.

596
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:52,440
Need me to hold that so you can eat your ice cream?

597
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:13,680
Want it?

598
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:15,640
Can I have it?

599
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:18,800
Tasty, want some?

600
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:20,880
Don't want?

601
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:28,880
Are you okay?

602
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:30,680
Is your friend okay?

603
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:33,080
No idea.

604
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,040
How can you not know? That’s my croissant!

605
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:06,840
Sorry, I tripped; the floor’s not even.

606
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:10,680
Per, maybe I should just go home.

607
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:13,040
Can I have my stuff back?

608
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:25,040
Why’d you do that?

609
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:26,560
Do you even have a right to be mad, Per?

610
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:28,400
You’re the one who lied.

611
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:31,000
Didn’t we promise?

612
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:32,400
That we wouldn’t leave each other?

613
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:36,320
Why’s it like this?

614
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:40,480
Just go home.

615
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:43,680
What about you?

616
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:46,280
Just leave me alone.

617
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:10,400
Noh-Po, yum yum, yum yum, good boy!

618
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:12,320
Good boy, yum, yum!

619
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:14,040
Yum, yum, good boy!

620
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:17,960
Thanks for helping me pick, Noh.

621
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:21,320
Do you want anything? I’ll buy it for you.

622
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:23,960
You rich or something?

623
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,360
-Rich enough.
[Noh's mimicking] - Rich enough

624
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:30,840
Aww, you’ve got it all over your mouth!

625
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:33,200
Where's it?

626
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:35,320
Let me wipe it off.

627
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:39,400
Softly, Noh!

628
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:45,520
Hey, Phun!

629
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:50,520
Yep.

630
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:51,920
Meeting Aim?

631
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:54,680
Nah, picking up my sister.

632
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:00,280
You mean Pang?

633
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:03,280
Yeah!

634
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:04,760
Look...

635
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:06,280
That's her calling

636
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:10,280
See you!

637
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:12,120
Yep.

638
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:23,240
Noh!

639
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:25,040
Noh!

640
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:27,280
Don’t you think Phun’s acting strange lately?

641
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:30,440
How so?

642
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,280
I noticed Aim looks stressed out lately.

643
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:35,880
Maybe it’s because of Phun. Wonder if he did something.

644
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:44,480
Maybe she's stressed about other stuff.

645
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:47,360
Some things are more complicated than they seem.

646
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:49,240
Really?

647
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:50,680
Yeah.

648
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:06,680
Damn it!

649
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:07,520
Don’t you guys think?

650
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:08,680
The school food today…

651
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:09,920
Not even a dog would eat it.

652
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:11,480
Yeah, I totally agree.

653
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,600
That’s why I’ve gotta eat sukiyaki at Noh’s place!

654
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:14,680
Eh!

655
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:17,160
Who invited you idiots?!

656
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:25,080
I told you all to put your shoes away.

657
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:27,080
Now look, Noh found out.

658
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:29,120
What the hell? I told you to hide them.

659
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:30,800
You didn't put yours away, asshole!

660
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,040
Who said mom and dad aren't here?

661
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:34,200
P'Im, dude!

662
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:35,920
My darling!!!

663
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:40,200
Isn't your darling Nong Nan?

664
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:42,080
Asshole!

665
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Move move...

666
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:47,160
let me sit too.

667
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,800
[Per] Are you still at Siam?

668
00:52:58,480 --> 00:52:59,560
[Noh] I'm home.

669
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:01,600
[Noh] What's up?

670
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:04,640
[Per] Nothing much.

671
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:06,920
[Noh] Wanna come?

672
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,280
[Noh] Having a party.

673
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:16,600
[Per] Can I bring Knot?

674
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:19,080
[Noh] Sure!

675
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:22,880
What are we gonna do about exams?

676
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:26,080
I don’t think we'll get a 65.

677
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:27,360
But I think we'll.

678
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:31,360
We'll clean the toilets!

679
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:32,680
Grab the Duck cleaner, guys!

680
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:33,800
Man, I knew it!

681
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:36,280
Summer school’s rough enough.

682
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:37,360
Now we have to sweep up too?

683
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:39,080
And also clean the bathrooms?

684
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:42,240
So annoying!

685
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:43,240
I’m the one who’s annoyed.

686
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:44,840
I passed for sure.

687
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:46,160
But if you all fail...

688
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:47,360
I’m roped into this too!

689
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:49,880
Should we get serious then?

690
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,080
At least for Keng's sake. I feel bad for him.

691
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:56,760
Come on!

692
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:00,160
This hotpot is our oath! We'll try our best for Keng!!!

693
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:04,720
For Keng!!!

694
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:08,000
Eh, Phong!!!

695
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:10,480
Hey, for Keng!!!

696
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:13,360
Who were you talking to?

697
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:14,520
Yeah, that's right.

698
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:16,680
-Your kid!
-Huh?

699
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:18,560
Who's it?

700
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:19,840
-Nong Ngor.
-Huh?

701
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:21,800
Huh, what kind of talking?

702
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:29,280
I'm teaching him Taekwondo, so he won't get bullied again.

703
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:30,080
Ohhhhh!

704
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,480
-But he’s kinda cute, right?
-WHAT?!

705
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:37,120
-You're serious?!
- Serious about what?

706
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:38,360
He's our junior.

707
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:42,480
But I've never seen you  this interested in any junior before.

708
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:45,440
Noh!

709
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:47,440
Don’t you have someone too?

710
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:49,480
Someone you're super interested in.

711
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:54,200
What!?

712
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:59,480
Yeah. I'll put this in the fridge.

713
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:01,080
Eh, where're you going?

714
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:03,760
Boo! Tell us first.

715
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:05,360
Noh, that's my water.

716
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:07,760
That's mine!

717
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:20,760
Home yet?

718
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:23,480
[Yuri] Yep, I am.

719
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:49,080
How’d you get here?

720
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:51,720
Taxi

721
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:54,680
Why are you here?

722
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:02,600
I wasn’t kicking you out!

723
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:03,600
Just asking.

724
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:09,440
Pang saw you and Yuri at Siam.

725
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,320
Oh? And then what?

726
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:15,600
She thought we were fighting,

727
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:17,520
so she told me to come and make up with you.

728
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:19,200
I didn't know you were having a party.

729
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:21,120
You didn't invite me.

730
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:23,160
I just found out myself.

731
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:24,880
They just suddenly came.

732
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:28,720
Let me try it!

733
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:29,760
Eh—

734
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:31,680
Nope, I haven’t even tasted it.

735
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:33,240
Let's eat first

736
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:38,680
You spilled it all!

737
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:40,360
It's delicious.

738
00:56:58,320 --> 00:56:59,680
Familiar?

739
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:07,560
It was nothing, really.

740
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:10,240
Yuri just had food on her face.

741
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:13,480
-So I wiped it off.
-I understand.

742
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:17,080
Eh!

743
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:18,280
Be serious.

744
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:29,680
Just like when I was scared you’d be mad about Aim.

745
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:34,280
Did Pang really make you come here?

746
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:38,360
Yeah.

747
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:39,840
Why’d I lie to you?

748
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:42,480
There’s no need to hide anything from you.

749
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:44,680
How about you, Noh?

750
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:54,880
Nope.

751
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:01,080
Okay!

752
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:03,680
Let’s go take this to our friends.

753
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:05,680
Sure.

754
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:10,280
Let’s go! Just pour it.

755
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:13,400
All done.

756
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:16,680
Wait wait!

757
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:18,880
That's mine!

758
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:22,880
Feels like an honor to eat hotpot at your house.

759
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:25,280
Stop being dramatic, please!

760
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:27,760
Hey, now that—

761
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:30,920
We have a new member of the hotpot gang,

762
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:32,360
Let’s play a welcome game!

763
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:34,320
-No way!
-Oh, sure!

764
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:35,680
How to play?

765
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,040
I'll spin this bottle.

766
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:39,560
And whoever it points to...

767
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:40,960
has to answer truthfully.

768
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,600
If anyone lies,

769
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:46,880
they gotta put a toe in their mouth for IG story.

770
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,440
-Got it!
-Dea!

771
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:50,560
Let's do this.

772
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:55,080
Since I suggested it, I’ll go first.

773
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:13,280
Hey, Per, what’s the deal between you and Win?

774
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:21,880
Just friends.

775
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:23,880
What kind of friend puts up with you like that?

776
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:26,520
Win can’t stand him, man.

777
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:28,320
But when he gets mad...

778
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:30,240
Per goes and makes up with him.

779
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:34,000
That’s friendship, huh?

780
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:38,040
Per!

781
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:40,240
Does that mean you’re not telling the whole truth?

782
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:41,280
Alright then—

783
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:42,680
I’ll go easy on you.

784
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:46,360
I'll let you take a picture with your foot then.

785
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:47,840
IG? For real?

786
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:50,320
Yes, it's gonna be viral I can tell.

787
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:10,520
Are you serious?

788
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:12,720
-Your turn, P'Ohm.
-Never mind.

789
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:15,360
For me, it's totally chill.

790
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:20,040
Just bring it!

791
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:23,160
I saw you hugging Nong Mick this afternoon?

792
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:28,080
-Really?
- I don't think so.

793
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:30,560
My question is why did you hug him?

794
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:32,320
Well...

795
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:35,000
He tripped,

796
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:39,440
and I just helped him not to fall.

797
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:40,480
-Is it true?!
-Really?

798
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:42,640
Big brother, huh?

799
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:45,360
It's 100% true, so I pass.

800
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:51,120
But how do we know if it's true?

801
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:52,120
You don't.

802
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:53,520
All I know is that

803
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:56,080
next round is mine.

804
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:57,920
-What!?
-So...

805
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:01,440
I can tell you that...

806
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:04,600
someone is going to die!!!

807
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:09,200
Man, I gotta poop!

808
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:11,920
-Eh, sit down!
-Are you running away?

809
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:34,880
Trying to get me, huh?

810
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:36,720
That's not happening.

811
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:40,280
Shit.

812
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:48,440
Eh, Ohm!

813
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:53,000
How did he go without a phone with him?

814
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:56,800
Can teens these days really go without their phone?

815
01:01:58,080 --> 01:01:59,120
What the heck?

816
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:04,280
Ohm!

817
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:06,720
Ohm!

818
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:08,480
Give me the phone.

819
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:10,880
Come out and get it yourself, chicken!

820
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:17,440
Don't chicken out!

821
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:47,280
Noh!

822
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:48,720
Come down already.

823
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:50,880
Oh, shit!

824
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:52,280
Noh!

825
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:03,360
Fuck!

826
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:04,600
It’s 11 p.m. already?

827
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:16,080
Are you guys done with the game?

828
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:17,960
We’re all finished, sir.

829
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:21,280
Alright.

830
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:25,880
Tell me what happened!

831
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:30,080
Whoever told him, I'm gonna kill you!

832
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:34,320
So,

833
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:37,760
is it true that Earn sang to you during the audition?

834
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:40,640
-Oh, really?
-Seriously?

835
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:43,360
About this of course.

836
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:45,240
100% real.

837
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:50,120
Our friend’s getting a cheer captain boyfriend!

838
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:51,920
You jerk!

839
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:56,320
Actually, there’s someone coming in hotter..

840
01:03:56,680 --> 01:03:58,480
Who is it? Is it Yuri?

841
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:03,720
Oh, wait!

842
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:06,120
I have somthing for you.

843
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:08,920
-There you go.
-Thank you, Knot!

844
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:13,840
Hey—

845
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:14,880
how do you know my password?

846
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:16,880
Is it hard to guess?

847
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:21,160
5...5..5..5

848
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:25,080
You again?

849
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:29,280
Your password is so dumb. You must be dumb to not figure it out.

850
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:31,400
Bullshit!

851
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:37,680
-Oh, where’d Phun go?
-He's left already.

852
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:42,240
After we finished filming, we showed him some clips.

853
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:44,080
He only watched for a bit and then left.

854
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:46,440
Your videos were awkward?

855
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:54,840
Why’d you do this?

856
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:56,480
Don’t you care?

857
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:58,160
You did care about me?

858
01:04:58,240 --> 01:04:59,640
Can you stop this?

859
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:02,480
When I said I loved you, did you even think about it?

860
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,560
-Are you dating Nong Mick?
-Huh?

861
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:27,080
When's your birthday?

862
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:29,160
Did someone ask you to find out?

863
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:31,640
I never thought P'Ohm would do this to me.

864
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:34,320
What about you and Pun? Not gonna tell me what's up?

865
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:39,680
How long have you known?

866
