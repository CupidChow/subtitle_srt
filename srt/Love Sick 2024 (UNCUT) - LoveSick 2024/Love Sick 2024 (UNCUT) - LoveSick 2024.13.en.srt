Mew's already told me...

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:04,130
... that you have a partner.

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:06,330
Will you tell me straight up...

4
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:08,210
..or let me find out myself?

5
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:12,380
Why can't I make my own decisions?

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,580
The Phumipat house is huge...

7
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,670
But there’s nothing in it

8
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:19,670
and it doesn't have me in it either.

9
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:21,580
Phun!

10
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:23,630
You okay, dude?

11
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:26,040
I don't know.

12
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:28,170
I know he means well...

13
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:32,000
and I want to make him happy.

14
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:33,750
But I...

15
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:48,130
So, Pang, tell me...

16
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:49,290
What’s the answer to this one?

17
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:52,540
Is it “A”?

18
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:56,500
I think I already taught you this.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,750
I really don't know. Can you give me a hint?

20
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:01,790
Let's try another one then.

21
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:05,710
How about this question? Go ahead.

22
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:07,170
Well?

23
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:08,960
Dad!

24
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,380
Where are you going in your school uniform?

25
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:15,630
This is a government uniform, sweetie.

26
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:16,830
Not a school uniform.

27
00:01:18,289 --> 00:01:20,210
I’m starting my new position today.

28
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:21,960
Come give me a hug first.

29
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:28,789
I'm going to be very busy after this.

30
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:31,630
-Don't be mean to mommy, okay?
- Okay.

31
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:34,830
Be a good girl, alright?

32
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,750
Phun!

33
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:39,500
Yes?

34
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:44,670
I'm leaving your sister and Mom with you, okay?

35
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:47,420
Yes, sir.

36
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,420
You're in high school now; behave yourself.

37
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:53,750
Soon you'll be wearing a uniform like me.

38
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,039
Yes.

[EP 13 Pham]

40
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,000
You okay?

41
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,170
Yes, I am.

42
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:00,830
Skipping class?

43
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:04,670
I’ve got an exam today.

44
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,710
Why?

45
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,080
Worried about me?

46
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:19,579
Worried?

47
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,580
Worried you'll throw up on Fi's head.

48
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,420
Wipe it for me, will ya?

49
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,460
Fine, I will.

50
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:50,630
-Gently!
-I'm being gentle.

51
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,630
What, I'm wiping you.

52
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:01,460
If you're wiping that hard...

53
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,540
you'd better not use the towel.

54
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:06,750
Then what do you want me to use?

55
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:50,960
Well, how about this...

56
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:54,460
Noh, what're you doing?

57
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,170
Playing with water.

58
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:02,250
I'll hit you, okay?

59
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:05,000
Stop it!

60
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:15,500
[Sorry, the number you have dialed is not reachable at the moment.]

61
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:22,420
Hello, P' Dream?

62
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:24,830
Have you been able to reach Win yet?

63
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,460
Nope. You can't get contact him either, huh?

64
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,750
Yeah, I can't reach Win at all.

65
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:35,080
Where the heck did he go? I'll try again later.

66
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:36,250
Talk to you later.

67
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,040
Okay, bye.

68
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,830
Chill out.

69
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,750
He's not going anywhere.

70
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:51,290
You'll find him.

71
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,500
But where are you gonna find him?

72
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,040
Alright!

73
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:04,210
I'll help you.

74
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,630
Don't stress.

75
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:10,000
-Okay?
-Thanks, man.

76
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:36,040
This exam is the last one for the semester.

77
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:40,040
I hope you all will prepare...

78
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:44,290
because if you fail, there are no make-ups.

79
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:49,710
Remember, no talking during the test.

80
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,000
Flip your paper and start.

81
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,380
Put your pencils down.

82
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:59,080
Anyone still holding their pencil will get a zero on the exam.

83
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,210
This exam is freaking hard!

84
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:26,540
In a bit...

85
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:27,880
I'm gonna go Physics Olympic.

86
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:29,170
Go take the test?

87
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,210
Go clean the toilet!

88
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:31,830
What the hell is that joke?

89
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,130
Eh, Noh!

90
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:37,460
Got any money?

91
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:40,540
I heard you spent it all on those kids in the club, huh?

92
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:41,880
I got some.

93
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:43,710
"Got some" means...

94
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,210
He meant he got the VP of the student council to pay him.

95
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,630
I'll beat your ass.

96
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:49,750
Again with this?

97
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,710
Don't you feel sorry for me?

98
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,290
What's up with you?

99
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,460
If it’s about your sister, I’m sorry.

100
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:25,170
I really couldn't do it last night, man.

101
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:28,330
So, yes or no?

102
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:33,790
It’s not a no...

103
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:35,920
But—

104
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:37,790
What if I just don’t want to?

105
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:39,750
What's it to you, anyway?

106
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,580
Well, 'cause I'm Phun's...

107
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,330
You're going to tell something about Phun?

108
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,790
Hey, everyone!

109
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,460
Noh's going to tell us.

110
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,460
-Who wants to hear?
-[Everyone] Me!

111
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,920
Feeling any better?

112
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,750
Yeah, better.

113
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:12,670
How'd you manage to come in this morning?

114
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:18,210
Got my own personal nurse looking after me.

115
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:21,000
The bald one.

116
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,670
Fi!

117
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:37,330
I’ve got something to say.

118
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,040
What is it?

119
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:43,580
Me and Noh...

120
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,250
We’re dating now.

121
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:50,670
Oh, big surprise. Totally didn’t know.

122
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:54,170
I could tell from way over there!

123
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:56,960
You're exaggerating.

124
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,380
No, I'm not.

125
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:03,920
Especially Noh—he's a mess, so easy to notice.

126
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,750
Congrats, though.

127
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,210
I'll follow you soon.

128
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,330
You should move on already.

129
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:14,920
I want to...

130
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,250
but when I look at that jerk Ohm....

131
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,290
It sucks, man.

132
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,170
How could I lose to him?

133
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,500
So you were lying to me?

134
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:56,000
I wasn't lying.

135
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:59,000
My eyes hurt. You were the one freaking out!

136
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,170
I thought he was mad at me this morning too.

137
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,670
Turns out it was just his eyes!

138
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:06,290
Such a poker face, man.

139
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:07,670
Eyes hurt?

140
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,540
But you want to tell us? It's okay if you don't, man.

141
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:13,080
Yeah, if you want to know, just ask me.

142
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,000
Okay, I'll ask.

143
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,460
Phun and you are currently dating, right?

144
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:29,630
Yeah.

145
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,670
Like, as a couple?

146
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:35,750
Well, yes.

147
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,290
So, who made the first move?

148
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,830
Phun, I guess.

149
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,330
That’s it! Why didn’t you just tell us earlier?

150
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:49,880
I was scared you’d all tease me!

151
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,330
We only teased you because we didn’t know.

152
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,290
If we’d known, we wouldn’t have teased you.

153
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:55,080
See?

154
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,710
Told you so.

155
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:01,500
So, Phun’s broken up with his ex, huh?

156
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:06,710
They broke up.

157
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,040
So...

158
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,710
at the same time as you?

159
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:14,830
What about Yuri?

160
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,790
Look, it's almost afternoon...

161
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,040
Gotta go get our stuff from the teacher's office.

162
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:30,000
Come on, Noh. Let's go.

163
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,040
[Everyone] See you later!

164
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,170
Thanks a lot, man.

165
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,420
No problem, man.

166
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:56,460
Hey, Noh!

167
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,080
Here to sign up for the pharmacy camp?

168
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:00,540
What camp?

169
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:02,040
The pharmacy camp.

170
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,330
Sure!

171
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,380
I’ll join.

172
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:10,960
Sign me up.

173
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,830
Planning to study pharmacy?

174
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,420
Dude, think about it—pharmacy camp.

175
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:21,580
...full of cute girls, like, those girls with glasses, you know?

176
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,170
-Girls with glasses.
-Nerdy angels.

177
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:27,380
Alright, sign up Napat [Noh] and Thadchakorn [Ohm] too.

178
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:30,670
-Wait! When did I say I was going?

179
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:34,130
Aren’t you coming? I’m going.

180
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:39,630
You just wanna flirt with nerdy girls, huh?

181
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:42,290
Nah, I’m going because Fi’s going.

182
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:45,380
Let's come together.

183
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,170
Yeah.

184
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:51,540
So...

185
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:11,330
Eh Noh, let’s go to Siam this evening.

186
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:15,130
I'm gonna buy a whole new outfit.

187
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,460
Jeez, you braggart!

188
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:22,170
Ralph Lauren!

189
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,540
Nothing.

190
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,710
Study hard.

191
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:41,830
Let's go, we'll go study hard.

192
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,040
Come, let's study hard.

193
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:17,290
Eh, Mick!

194
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:19,880
Don’t put stickers on the school instruments!

195
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,710
This isn’t a school instrument.

196
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,710
Not a school instrument? Whose is it then?

197
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:24,790
It’s yours?

198
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:30,250
Don't tell me that.

199
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,130
It’s yours?

200
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,250
Who bought it? Did you buy it yourself?

201
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:44,920
Ohm bought it for me.

202
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,330
Something's weird here.

203
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,500
-I’m going to find him.
-Where to?

204
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Don’t know.

205
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,830
Eh, I'll go with you.

206
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,420
Noh!

207
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:13,790
[Everyone] I'll go find him too. I don't want to practice anymore.

208
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,750
Eh, come here to practice first.

209
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,790
Oh my...

210
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,750
Every day, a new problem.

211
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:24,750
Never-ending situations.

212
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:26,790
One day, a thousand issues.

213
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:28,920
I’m so done.

214
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:39,460
Get a grip, dude!

215
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,750
Like this, you'll drop dead before you find Win.

216
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,460
I don’t even know if I’ll find him.

217
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,380
He’s never disappeared like this before.

218
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:48,040
Calm down, man.

219
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,630
Calm down, my ass!

220
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:51,920
The reason he's like this...

221
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:54,710
It’s because I kept calm, right?

222
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:00,210
If I’d done something that day...

223
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,040
He wouldn’t have disappeared like this.

224
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:08,040
I don’t know if it’s too late.

225
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:11,040
But I’ve got to do something now.

226
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,500
I can’t just sit around anymore.

227
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:24,580
Okay.

228
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:31,250
I guess I can't just sit around either.

229
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,380
I'll go with you.

230
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,710
Game's almost over, not drinking more?

231
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,750
-I can't any more.
-You just ate only pork, huh?

232
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:02,790
Excuse me,

233
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,170
bring me the bill.

234
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:06,830
Pay already? I'm not drunk yet!

235
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,080
Why the rush?

236
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:11,170
-I've got work tomorrow
-2,515 baht, sir.

237
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:13,960
Whoa.

238
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,290
You’re still young.

239
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:18,290
Not going to school?

240
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,290
I'm not studying.

241
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:24,710
This kid looks super familiar.

242
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:28,750
Like the son of some General or something.

243
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:30,290
General Yupayong?

244
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:35,040
Yeah, Gen.Yupayong Phichanborirat!

245
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,000
His son looks just like this.

246
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:39,630
Jerk! You're already drunk.

247
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,670
No way the general’s son would be working here.

248
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,920
He'd be living in a nice place, going to an expensive school...

249
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:50,210
...not working at a BBQ restaurant like this.

250
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,420
-You idiot!
-That's right.

251
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:56,130
Anyway, I already transferred 2,600 baht.

252
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,540
The rest is your tip.

253
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:00,170
You look like my boss's son.

254
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:01,460
I like it.

255
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,330
Hey, Jib, finish it all.

256
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:10,880
Per!

257
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:12,540
When you talk to him,

258
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:13,500
talk nicely.

259
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:14,920
Calm down, understand?

260
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:17,000
How can I calm down?

261
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,460
He ran away like this...

262
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,500
If he didn't come to you,

263
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,630
what would happen?

264
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:23,170
But he came to me.

265
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:25,710
Meaning...

266
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,750
...he doesn't want to go far from you, right?

267
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,330
I understand that you...

268
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:35,630
...are worried about him.

269
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,670
I get it, but...

270
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:40,880
...can you stop thinking only about yourself?

271
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:42,630
Look at him.

272
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:45,080
If home isn't a safe zone for him,

273
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,630
and you're not a safe zone for him either...

274
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:50,170
...then who's going to take care of him?

275
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:53,920
You calm down!

276
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,500
Show him some empathy.

277
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:58,080
Talk nicely, okay?

278
00:21:58,750 --> 00:21:59,710
Okay.

279
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:02,250
Alirght?

280
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,920
Fight for him.

281
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:18,710
Since you are with Knot,

282
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,500
do you eat BBQ every day?

283
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:22,750
That's crazy!

284
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:28,130
You've been with him since the start.

285
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,460
Yeah, I've been here since day one.

286
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,920
I was thinking of seeing you but...

287
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,670
I'm sorry

288
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:50,420
That day...

289
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:52,670
I didn’t know what to do.

290
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:56,710
I was afraid your dad would think worse of us.

291
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:59,540
But I realized...

292
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:04,170
I should care about your feelings more.

293
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,210
Come home with me.

294
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:18,080
I won’t push you to go home again.

295
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:21,420
If you don’t want to go back,

296
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,420
I’ll stay with you.

297
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,790
Knot...

298
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:34,380
he doesn't know you like I do.

299
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:40,130
And then...

300
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,880
he doesn't love you...

301
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,750
like I do.

302
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:09,880
[Phum] Stuffed as hell.
[Pao] Yes, deserved. Looks like you ate a whole cow.

303
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:12,380
[Noh] Looks like 3 cows.

304
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:48,170
Are you full yet?

305
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:49,920
Want more?

306
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:54,580
Nope, you should eat too.

307
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:57,420
I'm still stuffed right here.

308
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:00,170
You should've told me you were coming,

309
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:01,830
and you didn’t even eat.

310
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,040
I didn't know you'd stay this late.

311
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:07,630
...you still haven't gone home?

312
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:12,500
And did you tell anyone?

313
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:17,750
You think I'd run away from home?

314
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:20,380
How would I know?

315
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,250
Did you run away?

316
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,130
I told Mom already.

317
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,250
You sure?

318
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:34,540
This is good.

319
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,130
Just try it.

320
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,750
Give me more.

321
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:38,960
Thie one too.

322
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:41,040
Another pork, please.

323
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,670
That's right...

324
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:48,170
You said you were stuffed right there.

325
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:51,580
But there's still some left here.

326
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:55,380
Shit, I'm gonna puke.

327
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,130
I really told my mom.

328
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:46,290
Sounds weird.

329
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,330
I miss my boyfriend.

330
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,380
Can't I come to visit him?

331
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:56,210
We saw each other today.

332
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:01,170
Today, I missed you for 25 hours...

333
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:05,130
because I missed you too much.

334
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:10,790
Well, I also missed the Japanese girls...

335
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,420
Because I miss you sugoi [a lot].

336
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:18,830
The joke was so cringy.

337
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:22,130
Come on up.

338
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,380
-Where?
-Come on.

339
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:53,880
Is everything alright?

340
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,670
You can tell me.

341
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:01,170
Do you love me?

342
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,330
Why do you ask?

343
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:08,330
I can’t ask, huh?

344
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:11,000
Of course I do.

345
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:14,040
Like, a crazy amount.

346
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,540
Thank you.

347
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:37,250
I know what to do now.

348
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,040
What’s that?

349
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:44,080
I’m going to love you even more.

350
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,630
I’m never letting you go.

351
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:54,830
And if you don't love me, you'll just release me?

352
00:28:58,290 --> 00:28:59,420
Huh?

353
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:13,670
I should go shower.

354
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,420
Later!

355
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:20,380
You annoying jerk.

356
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:03,960
Hello?

357
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:07,830
Hi, Noh, is Phun staying over at your place?

358
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,670
Yes, ma'am.

359
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:16,880
He’s in the shower right now.

360
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,790
Should I get him?

361
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:22,960
No, it’s fine. I'm just checking.

362
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,920
Phun said he was going to see you,

363
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:28,710
But I was worried...

364
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:32,420
Is there anything, ma'am?

365
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:39,130
-It's the same problem with his father.
-Okay.

366
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:42,540
Phun won't talk about it.

367
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,710
I don't know what to do.

368
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:51,250
Can you help? I want him to tell his father.

369
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:54,000
Because whoever Phun chooses to be his girlfriend...

370
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,580
must be a good person, right?

371
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:59,460
I'll try talking to him.

372
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:32,750
What are you doing?

373
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:38,460
Don't you like it?

374
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,210
Grabbing what?

375
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:59,080
Grabbing your heart to see if you still have me.

376
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,630
Can't grab it?

377
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:05,670
Phun! I'm not playing.

378
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,540
Just a little bit.

379
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,250
Pick up the phone, it may be urgent.

380
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:03,460
No longer urgent.

381
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:20,670
Fi!!!

382
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,000
Pick it up first.

383
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:28,420
Hello?

384
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:30,380
Hey, Phun!

385
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,330
I forgot the council room key.

386
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:33,540
Huh?

387
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:36,000
What's that gotta do with me?

388
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:38,630
Just bring it to me. It's urgent, man!

389
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,380
If you can wait, wait. If not, screw it.

390
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:53,670
What is wrong with me?

391
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:56,630
Were you too harsh with Fi just now?

392
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:01,670
It wasn't hard. He called to annoy me.

393
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:08,790
So what?

394
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,710
Can't I go, please?

395
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:21,080
Ouch!

396
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:27,290
Guess I have to go now.

397
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:31,630
Be responsible, Mr. Student Council VP.

398
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,380
I'm going.

399
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:38,580
Yeah, I'm gonna shower.

400
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:41,670
Want to shower together?

401
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:43,000
No way.

402
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,790
Come on, we’re a couple now.

403
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:47,250
Wait.

404
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,960
See? I really gotta go.

405
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,750
-Come on, let’s shower together.
-Hold on!

406
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:59,380
No. I'll take a shower alone.

407
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,080
Go, go... let's shower together.

408
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:03,250
Go, go, go...

409
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:11,290
-Come down yet?
-Not yet.

410
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:15,080
They're coming.

411
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:17,500
Nong Noh!

412
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:19,290
You got up early! Eat breakfast first?

413
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,710
No, it's okay. I have to go.

414
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:27,580
-See you later!
-See you!

415
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:31,880
I put my effort into this!

416
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:34,790
-I’ll eat just a little bit then.
-Really?

417
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:38,420
I just made it bite-sized so you can eat quickly.

418
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:40,210
Please give it to Noh too.

419
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:42,290
Sure, I'll feed him myself.

420
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,500
Saying stuff like that makes the Y girls melt, Phun!

421
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,080
Thank you.

422
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:51,630
I won't disappoint the fangirls.

423
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:58,460
Kids these days know their stuff.

424
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:04,540
What's going on, madam?

425
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,750
I'm in a bad mood,

426
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,500
but I do enjoy it.

427
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:14,210
Yes, madam!

428
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:32,170
The last piece here...

429
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:04,920
Hungry?

430
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:07,960
Yeah.

431
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:26,960
When you're with your boyfriend, ever think I'm waiting?

432
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,790
When you're yelling, ever think I want to be with my boyfriend?

433
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,330
"With your boyfriend," my ass!

434
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:35,580
I've been calling since this morning.

435
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:39,630
Or...

436
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:43,040
do you keep your clothes at Noh's place now?

437
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:48,630
Don't just pick on me because you've been dumped.

438
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:52,460
Today...

439
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,040
I have to get a girlfriend.

440
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:56,080
The girls coming for the economics quiz bowl...

441
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:58,040
are all hot and smart.

442
00:38:58,460 --> 00:38:59,790
They deserve to be with me.

443
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:01,750
True

444
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:03,960
Tons of cute girls.

445
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:07,130
You're not single anymore.

446
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:08,580
How can you look at other people?

447
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:14,880
You held a sandwich earlier, Phun!

448
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:25,210
[Pham]

449
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:32,960
So you're not actually competing?

450
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,630
I didn't sign up in time.

451
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:37,000
So I'll have more chance to win, right?

452
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,250
I don't have to compete against you.

453
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,290
So which room is competing? Take me there.

454
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,420
Sure!

455
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:47,460
-Is it hard?
-Very hard.

456
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,420
I studied all night.

457
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:51,630
What did you do?

458
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:56,330
Hey, Noh!

459
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:58,040
Let's play soccer.

460
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:00,170
Go!

461
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,580
Go! Let's play soccer.

462
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:05,580
-Alright!
-Friday has to win this year.

463
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:12,960
Why aren't you at school today?

464
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:15,380
You're not there either.

465
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,210
I can't go.

466
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:22,330
If I go,

467
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,630
Dad will definitely drag me back.

468
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:34,790
You gonna keep running away like this?

469
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:38,710
I don't know.

470
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:41,540
But if I get caught...

471
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:44,580
I won't see you again.

472
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,830
So can I stay a little longer?

473
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:12,420
Listen!

474
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:15,420
Even if someone hides you...

475
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,710
I’ll find you no matter what.

476
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,330
Got it?

477
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:36,830
Mawin!

478
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:38,880
Dad!

479
00:42:55,790 --> 00:42:58,580
Turn to the next page and look at the first table.

480
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:06,460
What’s your deal?

481
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:08,880
Hot.

482
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,580
What’s making you hot? Look at Farm.

483
00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:15,330
I'm cold.

484
00:43:20,830 --> 00:43:22,670
Did you and Phun have a fight or something?

485
00:43:23,830 --> 00:43:24,630
I can tell!

486
00:43:28,290 --> 00:43:29,080
Butt out!

487
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:34,880
Bastard!

488
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:44,040
So, what did he do to you?

489
00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:46,000
I'll punch him.

490
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:47,830
Don't punch my boyfriend!

491
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,380
Now that you're out and proud, huh?

492
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:50,710
And you're not?

493
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:52,290
I'm always proud.

494
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:58,630
Naphat! Thatchakorn!

495
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:00,500
[Noh&Ohm] Yes!!!

496
00:44:03,670 --> 00:44:05,170
You’re always meddling.

497
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:07,000
Then stop giving me reasons to meddle!

498
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:09,710
- You, you, you...
- It’s you...

499
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:14,380
Hey, Fi!

500
00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:15,630
Where’ve you been?

501
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:18,290
Alone? Where's your secretary?

502
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:21,790
Phun?

503
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,080
Over there!

504
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:27,830
No.

505
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:29,580
He's right there.

506
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:35,830
Right here!

507
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:39,960
Bastard!

508
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:47,630
Oh, there he is.

509
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:57,880
Damn, the girl at that table's so pretty.

510
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,670
-Where it is?
-Triam Udom girl?

511
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,500
Let me see...

512
00:45:08,130 --> 00:45:09,710
It's nothing, man.

513
00:45:10,130 --> 00:45:12,040
Phun's just helping her study.

514
00:45:12,170 --> 00:45:13,540
It's nothing.

515
00:45:13,790 --> 00:45:15,210
Seriously, I’m fine.

516
00:45:18,790 --> 00:45:21,460
No one at Auntie Choei’s shop. I’ll head over first.

517
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:34,000
This is serious!

518
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,710
[Everyone] Ready to go all in with rock-paper-scissors!

519
00:45:58,630 --> 00:45:59,460
What are you doing?

520
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:02,750
Eating rice.

521
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:07,040
So delicious, huh?

522
00:46:07,630 --> 00:46:09,630
I didn't eat rice. I ate noodles.

523
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:15,080
Is this your side chick?

524
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:19,000
Hey, buddy! He cheated on you.

525
00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:19,960
What?

526
00:46:20,130 --> 00:46:22,210
If you cheat on my friend, I won't forgive you!

527
00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:24,500
That's right!

528
00:46:25,170 --> 00:46:26,000
Cheating on who?

529
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,790
I only love my boyfriend.

530
00:46:30,210 --> 00:46:32,080
Chill, chill! I know you're embarrassed.

531
00:46:32,630 --> 00:46:33,460
That's enough.

532
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:38,710
Walk away!

533
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:41,130
Can’t I stay a little longer? I miss you.

534
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:44,080
You’re blushing!

535
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:46,920
Are you okay?

536
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:48,960
Move!

537
00:46:50,130 --> 00:46:51,630
Bye-bye

538
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:05,830
See you later!

539
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:11,580
Got a little extra, huh?

540
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:28,880
Phun!

541
00:47:43,130 --> 00:47:44,460
Give me my son back,

542
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:46,000
and I won’t press charges.

543
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:49,540
Promise me first that if Win comes back...

544
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:51,380
you won't hurt him.

545
00:47:52,290 --> 00:47:54,250
Don't mess with my family.

546
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:58,670
I know you don't approve, but Win and I really love each other.

547
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:01,790
How can you love each other?

548
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:03,960
You're both men.

549
00:48:04,790 --> 00:48:06,920
Did I let you two be together too much?

550
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:08,670
Is that why you turned out like this?

551
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:09,670
Win!

552
00:48:10,170 --> 00:48:11,380
Go home.

553
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:13,540
Release

554
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:16,790
-No...
-This's my family, don't mess!

555
00:48:17,330 --> 00:48:19,830
Why can't I step in? Do you think you've done it well?

556
00:48:22,290 --> 00:48:25,790
Per's not at fault. I'm the one who liked him first.

557
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:27,460
And I'm the one who asked him out.

558
00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:31,080
If you put him in jail...

559
00:48:31,630 --> 00:48:33,750
I’ll wait outside the cell for him.

560
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:36,630
Because Per is my boyfriend.

561
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:39,750
Do you realize...

562
00:48:40,630 --> 00:48:41,790
what you just said?

563
00:48:42,130 --> 00:48:42,960
I know.

564
00:48:44,830 --> 00:48:46,210
And I want you to know too...

565
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:48,420
that I like men.

566
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:54,790
Even if you hit me a hundred more times..

567
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:57,540
I'll still like Per.

568
00:48:57,960 --> 00:48:59,080
Win!

569
00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:01,290
Is this because I raised you badly?

570
00:49:01,790 --> 00:49:03,580
So you became like this?

571
00:49:04,130 --> 00:49:06,670
-Huh?
-So should we start?

572
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:08,830
I'm going home,

573
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:13,170
and I'll let you raise me as you want.

574
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:14,580
So you'll know...

575
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,500
that I can be a man for you.

576
00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:18,460
But I can't like girls for you.

577
00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:21,170
Are you being sarcastic?

578
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:23,040
I'm serious.

579
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:25,750
When I go back this time...

580
00:49:26,170 --> 00:49:27,290
I'll make you see...

581
00:49:28,290 --> 00:49:30,750
that I am who I am.

582
00:49:36,790 --> 00:49:38,420
You've fought for me a lot.

583
00:49:38,630 --> 00:49:41,460
This time, I'll fight for myself.

584
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:47,250
The one who has to change is not us,

585
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:49,290
but dad.

586
00:49:51,330 --> 00:49:52,790
Do whatever you want.

587
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:54,710
Go ahead.

588
00:49:58,580 --> 00:49:59,920
Because you...

589
00:50:01,330 --> 00:50:02,960
you turned my son into this!

590
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:30,250
Yes?

591
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:45,170
That's great.

592
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:59,210
Bastard!

593
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,790
What the hell are you guys doing?

594
00:51:18,210 --> 00:51:19,580
Go home!

595
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:32,920
In a good mood, huh?

596
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:34,580
What?

597
00:51:35,250 --> 00:51:36,750
Just because your boyfriend said he loves you,

598
00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:38,420
now you’re on cloud nine?

599
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,080
It's normal.

600
00:51:40,830 --> 00:51:43,210
I guess... don't be jealous of Phun.

601
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,250
If he could devour you,

602
00:51:45,790 --> 00:51:46,750
he would have already.

603
00:51:52,210 --> 00:51:53,670
Look at those who've never fallen in love.

604
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:00,750
I've never...

605
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:03,460
but my boyfriend is so handsome.

606
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:29,710
Cheating on who? I only love my boyfriend.

607
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:50,130
I'm gone, beb!

608
00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:53,380
How about me?

609
00:53:10,630 --> 00:53:12,040
Phun!

610
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:15,960
Phun!

It's still summer break...

615
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:28,710
and I have to wake up at 5 a.m. for this camp?

616

When people are dating...

617

if they don't talk, it won't work out, right?

618
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:49,250
I don't know how I'm supposed to feel.
