[English subtitles available]
I think I'm ready about Aim.

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:04,980
Don't let go of my hand, okay?

3
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:06,820
I won't.

4
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:09,660
Actually, I like someone else now.

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,060
Is it Noh?

6
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:13,460
If that's him, I understand.

7
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,220
Yeah, Noh’s pretty cute.

8
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,380
I already broke up with Aim.

9
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,300
Give me some time, okay?

10
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,500
Breaking up takes time to heal, right?

11
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:24,660
Wait for me, okay?

12
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,780
[Noh] 1...2...cheese!

13
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:45,020
Eh, Noh!

14
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,100
I heard your club's coming to our school's Open House?

15
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:51,420
Where’d you hear that from?

16
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:54,660
Just tell me already.

17
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,620
I don’t know. I haven’t heard anything.

18
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,540
-Good. Don’t come, okay?
-Oh!

19
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:00,580
Why not?

20
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,300
Just don’t come, okay?

21
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:03,660
Understand?

22
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,060
Promise me.

23
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,780
-Fine.
-Okay.

24
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,940
I’m gonna go order some drinks.

25
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:15,220
Okay.

26
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:21,660
[Yuri] Excuse me, can I get an iced lemon tea?

27
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:24,700
[Jeed] Hey, Yuri!

28
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,340
What a coincidence.

29
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,740
Just the two of you?

30
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,539
Yeah, just two of us.

31
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,860
And that's how we planned it.

32
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,900
Were you the one who played at our school concert?

33
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,340
It was last year.

34
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,620
Oh, yeah!

35
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,940
I’m Jeed, by the way.

36
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:01,980
I’m in the music club too.

37
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,460
You were super cool back then!

38
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,060
[Jeed]

39
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,980
Wanna exchange Line IDs?

40
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,180
So we can chat about music.

41
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,100
Sure, one sec.

42
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,140
Let’s go, Noh!

43
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,380
Okay...

44
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:44,540
Noh, can I ask you a favor?

45
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:47,220
Stay away from Jeed, okay?

46
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:52,420
-Answer me okay.
-Alright, okay.

47
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,420
Yeah!

48
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,100
Let’s grab some cake more.

49
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,020
The same as this one...

50
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,380
but not this place.

51
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,620
[Ep10 "Phun-Noh"]

52
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,460
How’d you get in here!?

53
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,340
Teleported, duh.

54
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,300
Eh!

55
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,540
Whatcha lookin' at?

56
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:42,780
Did you eat yet?

57
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:44,900
Yeah, I did.

58
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,620
My mom made crispy pork.

59
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,580
Don't you want to eat it?

60
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,700
This one is good. It's been my first time to try it.

61
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,300
Did you ate at my place?

62
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,820
Yeah, your mom invited me.

63
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,220
And she said to come over often.

64
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,780
You're hitting on my dad's girlfriend now?

65
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,060
No way!

66
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,980
I'm flirting her child.

67
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,860
So first I have to make good with her.

68
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:29,780
You eat a lot.

69
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:30,940
So your mouth will be busy.

70
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:33,860
What about you, Noh?

71
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:35,659
Oh right, give that back.

72
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,500
Not going home yet?

73
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,220
My relatives come to sleep at home.

74
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,580
Pang's been with them all day.

75
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,260
Can I stay here?

76
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:29,900
Why?

77
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,220
Lonely?

78
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,340
Sulking with Pang, right?

79
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,180
That's half true.

80
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,740
What about the other half?

81
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,780
I wanna be with you, Noh!

82
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,420
Are you feeling okay?

83
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:58,740
You're acting weird today.

84
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,820
So where were you today, Noh?

85
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,780
I had lunch with Yuri,

86
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,380
saw a movie,

87
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:14,900
walked around, had snacks.

88
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,100
Why?

89
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,660
Can I be jealous?

90
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,539
You said you'd wait...

91
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,659
Are you still waiting?

92
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,460
Even if you're not waiting...

93
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,540
I don't care anymore.

94
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,820
I'm gonna make a move on you.

95
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,660
I'm not asking for your permission.

96
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:26,220
Just lettting you know.

97
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,420
Go take a shower.

98
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:37,740
-I will.
-Turn off the light for me.

99
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,820
Take this!

100
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:46,820
Don't cross the line.

101
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,820
Just sleep here.

102
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,380
If you were my boyfriend...

103
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,580
I'd kiss you on the cheek.

104
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,300
I'll save it for later.

105
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:45,740
Goodnight.

106
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,820
Here, this bag's for you.

107
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,300
I want the burnt one.

108
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,540
It's not good.

109
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:35,140
I don't like good stuff.

110
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,340
I like useless stuff.

111
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,020
But I’m still useful.

112
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,340
Minus 80 scores!

113
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,500
-Darn it!
-Minus 90.

114
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,500
-So, how much is left?
-Minus 100.

115
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,980
What are you gonna do?

116
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,340
Are you coming with Mick?

117
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,020
Yeah, and you're coming with Phun?

118
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,300
Oh, my bag.

119
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:48,620
Oh!

120
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,980
Shit, what a mess.

121
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,780
Total mess.

122
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:11,300
Crap, I got a 62.

123
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:19,020
Our class average is 61.75.

124
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,420
So, do we have to go clean the toilet now?

125
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:24,220
You calm down.

126
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:25,900
It's just the midterm.

127
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,300
I'll figure out what needs to improve for the final.

128
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,780
Nah, don’t bother.

129
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:34,500
It's not going to get better anyway.

130
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:38,500
Hey!

131
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:39,940
Why don't we try first?

132
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,140
Yeah.

133
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:43,660
If we don't try, Keng'll have to clean the toilet too.

134
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,540
It's not just him.

135
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,380
We'll all have to clean.

136
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,100
What's with that attitude, man?

137
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,420
Don’t you find yourself funny sometimes?

138
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,900
Everyone has to do this for you.

139
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,580
Stop it, Palm!

140
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,820
I don't care about cleaning toilets.

141
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,900
But you guys are going to be seniors next year.

142
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,660
I want you guys to get good grades.

143
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:14,060
Sorry if I’ve been too pushy.

144
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,260
-What did you just say, dude?
-Look, you've done

145
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,780
This will be refreshing.

146
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,220
And you?

147
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,580
You looked more tired than me.

148
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,220
It's okay.

149
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,780
You take first, I'll take it later.

150
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:17,220
Knot!

151
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,660
Sorry, are you okay?

152
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,300
Does it hurt, Per?

153
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,060
No.

154
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,380
Don't do that again.

155
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,900
You could have let me take the hit.

156
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:48,740
It wouldn't have hurt that much.

157
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,220
It was just my arm...

158
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:52,820
and it hurts this much.

159
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,260
What if it hit your neck...

160
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,380
Wouldn't it break your neck?

161
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,500
I said I was sorry!

162
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:07,380
I didn't do it on purpose.

163
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,500
Were you scared, Win?

164
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:13,220
A little.

165
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:15,819
So...

166
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:20,460
Wanna grab some food this evening?

167
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:22,060
We can go to your favorite place.

168
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,260
It's on me.

169
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:31,500
Sure you can go?

170
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:32,940
I can.

171
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,460
Ouch!

172
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,780
It still hurts.

173
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,940
I guess you'll have to feed me now.

174
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:49,940
Alrighty!

175
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,100
What's that smell?

176
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,900
Is that what love smells like?

177
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,180
Just send me the QR.

178
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,300
I'll pay for it.

179
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:12,660
Awesome.

180
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:15,420
Let's go!

181
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,900
Hey, where's Per?

182
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,300
His arm hurts, so he went home already.

183
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,060
Is it serious?

184
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,660
It's a minor injury,

185
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,220
but he overreacts to get Win's attention.

186
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:51,740
By the way,

187
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,420
our club doesn’t have much going on now, right?

188
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:55,020
I want to leave now.

189
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:11,580
Whatcha doing, Mick?

190
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,460
Waiting for P'Ohm.

191
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:22,980
It's not even dark yet.

192
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,300
Do you need a ride home?

193
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,180
No, sir.

194
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,620
I'm taking P'Ohm home.

195
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,100
Everyone!

196
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,020
I'm flirting with Ohm, okay?

197
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,140
I'm serious, I'm after P'Ohm!

198
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,300
-Wish me luck!
-Let's go home.

199
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,740
-Bye everyone!
-Go home!

200
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,700
Fuck's sake, Ohm!

201
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:17,580
[An unregistered number]

202
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:20,100
How'd you get my number?

203
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,340
[Jeed] From the concert last year.

204
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,100
[Noh] Oh, right. So, what's up?

205
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,900
[Jeed] My club needs a book.

206
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,980
[Jeed] And I heard Friday has another one...

207
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,300
[Jeed] Can I get that one too?

208
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,380
[Noh] Sure.

209
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:41,180
Here, are these two books?

210
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:46,340
Yes! Thank you, Noh.

211
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,860
Actually, you could ask Yuri to pick them up.

212
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,020
So you wouldn't have to come yourself.

213
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:55,380
It's okay, I didn't want to bother anyone.

214
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:01,740
I heard Friday has a lot of instruments.

215
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,500
I'd love to see them.

216
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,100
Doesn't your school have any?

217
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,100
Oh, my school...

218
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:11,380
barely has any instruments, and they're all old.

219
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,100
Nothing like Friday.

220
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,100
Maybe sometime...

221
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,700
you could ask for permission to visit our school.

222
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:25,140
But I'd love for you to play at my school again

223
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,820
to inspire the younger kids.

224
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,460
-Yeah, sure!
-Really?

225
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,100
-If there's a chance.
-If you have a chance, you have to go, okay?

226
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,540
-Of course, I'll go.
-You already said it.

227
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,340
Aren't you going home, Noh?

228
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,220
Then, do you have anything else?

229
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:51,740
Nope, but could you help...

230
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:53,940
get me...

231
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,060
The car is here, let's go.

232
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,020
We gotta go then.

233
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:31,820
Khom!

234
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,100
-Are you doing maths?
-Yes, I am.

235
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:35,820
-Can I copy them?
-Yes, sure.

236
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:38,740
I'm not sure if it's right, you have to see it.

237
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,500
You got a pen?

238
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:52,300
Palm and Keng still not cool?

239
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,620
Hell no.

240
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:57,020
Palm still hasn't apologized to Keng.

241
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:09,460
Eh!

242
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:11,900
Eat some?

243
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,420
Eh! Wanna eat some?

244
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:23,820
Eh!

245
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:25,820
Wanna eat?

246
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:42,300
-It's tough.
-I think so.

247
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:49,340
Again? You’re always busy, huh?

248
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:03,620
Convent school wants our band to perform at their open house.

249
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:04,420
What do you guys think?

250
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,820
Whoa, like last year?

251
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:06,900
Maybe.

252
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:09,020
Dude, we have exams coming up! Still wanna go?

253
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:10,380
Yes, yes, yes!

254
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:13,180
This year I have to get a girlfriend.

255
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,500
I have to get it before you do.

256
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:18,420
What exactly will you do there?

257
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:20,580
[Everyone] We will perform the concert there.

258
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:27,140
[Friday Band Show @Open House Convent School].

259
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:28,980
Noh's here!

260
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,220
You're always late.

261
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,020
Shall we go?

262
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:32,740
Let's go!

263
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:35,740
Where're you guys going?

264
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,260
To the Convent School.

265
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,140
What for?

266
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:42,220
-To play music?
-Correct!

267
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,500
Did you ask for permission?

268
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:49,780
Yes, the other day they sent me the documents.

269
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,260
You guessed it!

270
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:58,060
-I'll go too.
-Huh?

271
00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:59,620
Why're you going?

272
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:02,540
Someone from student council has to go, right?

273
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:05,860
To supervise and in case some students refuse to return to school.

274
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:09,140
I'll have to go back to school anyway.

275
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,060
Yeah.

276
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,060
Oh, yeah.

277
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,380
I need to keep things in check.

278
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:20,300
-In case there's a fight.
-Huh? A fight?

279
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:21,740
A fight with girls?

280
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,460
Just let him go.

281
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,300
He wants to go with you.

282
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:28,100
Just say it, man. It's fine.

283
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,900
-Alright, let's go then.
-Let's go guys, it's late now.

284
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,620
Go go go...

285
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,500
Eh, where can I sit?

286
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:53,260
Hurry up.

287
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:52,460
Noh!

288
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:59,300
Let's go eat.

289
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:24,780
Could you help my friend check the instrument?

290
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:30,500
All right.

291
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,500
And you...

292
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:38,940
...get me some food, yeah?

293
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,100
Sure.

294
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:06,740
Hey, Phun!

295
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:25,980
Noh!

296
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:28,020
When did you get here? You didn't tell me!

297
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:29,100
A while ago.

298
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:30,580
- A while ago?
- Yeah!

299
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,580
Are you hungry? Have you eaten?

300
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:35,420
Hungry, huh? I've got something for you.

301
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:38,340
-I made it myself.
-Want some Takoyaki?

302
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:42,500
Delicious! Salmon filling, cheese filling...

303
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,620
a little bit of Yuri's love.

304
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:48,540
Want some? It's really good. I promise!

305
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:51,140
Yuri tried her best to do this to you!

306
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:52,740
Wow, I didn't expect that.

307
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:54,940
How're you?

308
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,460
I'm so so.

309
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:01,780
Did you come with Noh?

310
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,900
Are you guys dating yet?

311
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,660
Not yet, right?

312
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,820
Well, I don't want to rush things.

313
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,340
It wouldn't look good.

314
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:24,100
We broke up months ago!

315
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:26,980
Some things...if you wait too long...

316
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,500
...they won't wait around.

317
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:42,620
It'll be official soon.

318
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:54,540
So, how are things with Lee?

319
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:57,940
Nothing much.

320
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,260
Like I said...

321
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:02,900
...wait too long, and they won't wait.

322
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:09,580
What about your mom?

323
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:16,260
I'll be patient for one more year,

324
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:19,260
and then I may go study abroad.

325
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:31,780
If you have anything, feel free to talk to me, okay?

326
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,100
Thank you, Phun!

327
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,180
Take it!

328
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:02,300
Phun's ex?

329
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:06,300
Is that why he followed us here?

330
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,180
Yeah, maybe.

331
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:22,700
Hello, I'm Plai. I'm alumni of Holy Convent, class of '57.

332
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:27,260
Hello there.

333
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:29,940
I'm Theeros, also Holy Convent, class of '57.

334
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:31,580
Same here.

335
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,740
Wow, such a big crowd today!

336
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:39,740
Now is undoubtedly the highlight of our Open House.

337
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,900
I wonder if we'll have a concert like our year?

338
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:47,020
And it's going to be a lot of fun.

339
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:51,340
Because Friday College's band came here, just like our year.

340
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,660
Okay, now please welcome...

341
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,740
...Friday Brand 2024!

00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:05,260

I'm Knot, the lead singer.

Hi, I'm Art, guitarist.

345
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:13,660
-Hi, I'm Paokung also a guitarist.
-Hi, I'm Filmie, drummer.

346
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:16,620
Hello everyone. My name is Ben, I'm the bass player.

347
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:20,380
-Hi, I'm Phu, keyboard player.
-Hello, I'm Ngor, Maracas player.

348
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,500
I'm Mick playing Tambourine

349
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:25,780
I hope you enjoy our band!

350
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,300
Is everyone tired yet?

351
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:05,860
[Everyone] Not yet!

352
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:12,100
If not, let me hear you scream for our club president!

353
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:14,380
Me?

354
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,340
Hello.

355
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:31,340
Have you all ever been in love?

356
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:41,420
Did your love come true?

357
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:45,180
If your love has not yet come true...

358
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:46,940
Don't give up.

359
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:50,420
Because I believe love is real,

360
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:54,780
but it can happen soon or late.

Have you ever thought?

367
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:24,820
If my club budget hadn't been cut that day,

368
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:28,260
what would have happened to us?

369
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,100
I don't want to think about it.

370
00:34:37,219 --> 00:34:39,580
Now is the best time for us.

371
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:40,900
♪ I wonder if love is waiting for us to meet.♪

372
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:43,100

375
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:56,260
If you're looking him like this,

376
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,660
want to sing it together?

377
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:02,060

Knot!

382
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,420
What the hell was that?! Let me curse you fist.

383
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,020
Oh, well...

384
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,940
I thought it would be nice to have Phun sing with you.

385
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:36,940
Eh, Knot!

386
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,540
Next time you do something like that...

387
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:39,500
...tell me first, okay?!

388
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,500
I couldn't change the key in time!

389
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:43,700
Hey, sorry.

390
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:46,180
It's okay.

391
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:47,780
Seriously though...

392
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:50,100
Are you trying to show ownership?

393
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:57,220
It means you guys...

394
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:05,260
This guy, I thought he was being all quiet...

395
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:07,260
...turns out he's just opening snacks for his kid.

396
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:11,900
You put it there unopened,

397
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:13,060
...how´s he supposed to eat it?

398
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:15,300
Give it to me. I can open it.

399
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:23,620
Everyone!

400
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:28,580
Thank you so much, this was fun!

401
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:30,500
It's our pleasure.

402
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:32,700
Thanks for inviting us too.

403
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:34,940
Pao, seriously...

404
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:36,820
how many girls' IGs did you get today?

405
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:39,140
[Everyone] Share us?

406
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:41,980
We have souvenirs for everyone –

407
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:43,820
keychains that we made ourselves.

408
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,740
[Noh] Eh, I'll get that one.

409
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:05,220
I give you this one.

410
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:12,420
Here, I already picked this one for you.

411
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:26,140
I'll take this one then.

412
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:44,380
[Yuri] I can't go there. They wouldn't let me in.

413
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:45,500
Hey!

414
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:48,460
Can Yuri come in?

415
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:51,140
No way, Noh.

416
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:54,460
No outsiders allowed in the music room.

417
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,220
So let's go back?

418
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:02,460
It's getting late now.

419
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,340
Yeah, okay.

420
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:05,740
I'm sleepy.

421
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:08,780
Noh, aren't you staying for snacks?

422
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:16,260
He won't be free.

423
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:19,900
In a moment, he won't be free anymore.

424
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:26,140
What's going on here?

425
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:28,620
This isn't for kids.

426
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:30,740
Oh.

427
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,420
You meddle in my business all the time.

428
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:39,700
Ngor!

429
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:42,220
Pack up, let's go back to school.

430
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:44,100
Let's go.

431
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:50,180
What was that?

432
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,460
Let's go back and I'll tell you later.

433
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:54,540
-Let's go!
-What's with you?

434
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:55,940
Let's go!

435
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,180
Go first.

436
00:38:58,540 --> 00:38:59,340
Go, go, go.

437
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,820
Hey, Noh!

438
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:34,020
I'll take you there.

439
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:37,820
Noh, come here.

440
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:40,740
I'll take care of my friend.

441
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:42,340
But he's my guest.

442
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:45,180
-I can take care of him.
-The event's over.

443
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:46,380
Stop overdoing it!

444
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:47,660
Yuri!

445
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:49,860
Come here, Noh!

446
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:07,220
Come with me.

447
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:09,540
I'll take care of him.

448
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:27,900
Because of you...

449
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:37,500
I want to take him back.

450
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,540
It's okay, Yuri.

451
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:40,100
No, it's not.

452
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:44,260
Oh, you girls aren't going home yet?

453
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:46,740
Just about to.

454
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:48,300
Waiting for someone?

455
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:50,660
Thinking about someone special?

456
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:54,300
You can tell?

457
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:56,740
We were the same back then.

458
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:58,140
-When we were young, right?
-Yeah!

459
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:00,220
You went after a Friday boy?

460
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,620
Did it work? What did you do?

461
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:05,380
How can I say...

462
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,820
I just did nothing, he came to me.

463
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,260
But it's okay if they don't.

464
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:12,620
There are plenty of cute guys out there.

465
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:15,340
True. Remember, Friday isn't everything.

466
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:16,740
Don't chase them too much.

467
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,420
Yeah, now hurry home.

468
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:21,620
Take care of yourself.

469
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:23,340
Live your own life, okay?

470
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:25,700
We gotta go.

471
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:28,220
See you around!

472
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:50,460
Holy shit!

473
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,020
Who put meat on this grill?!

474
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:53,820
It was Ohm! I saw you.

475
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:55,780
This is morning glory, not meat, you idiot!

476
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:57,860
[Everyone] You are such a liar!

477
00:41:57,860 --> 00:42:00,020
It's just one piece of meat; Guanyin won't mind.

478
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:01,980
Knot!

479
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:03,900
Change the grill, please?

480
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:07,540
[Per] What's your problem?
- The meat stinks!

481
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,140
I don't like meat.

482
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:10,740
Whoa.

483
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:12,940
The owner serving us himself?

484
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:16,140
This isn't my restaurant, it's my uncle's.

485
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:18,660
Any live music tonight?

486
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:21,500
No, the singer's sick today.

487
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:23,140
Move aside, Ngaor. I'll grab it.

488
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:43,420
-You eating anything?
-Yes, I'm.

489
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:45,460
I'm just keep eating.

490
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:47,620
Here's some pork belly, for collagen.

491
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:51,540
For collagen, you need this!

492
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:56,260
[Everyone] Calm down, Pao. You're going to get yourself killed.

493
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:57,500
It's delicious.

494
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:59,140
Bring me the ready ones.

495
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:00,980
My sock is cooked - are you going to eat it?

496
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:04,060
-Chill out, man!
-You can't take this.

497
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:10,940
Eh, I'll be back.

498
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:24,860
Hello Noh?

499
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:27,140
Where are you guys? It's so loud.

500
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:29,020
At the BBQ place.

501
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:31,140
-Did you get home?
-Yes, I'm home.

502
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:32,980
I'm about to eat.

503
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:34,580
wash the dishes, do homework...

504
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:36,700
clean the cat litter, and then...

505
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:38,180
I'm gonna take a shower.

506
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:40,420
Busy night, huh?

507
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:43,460
Alright, talk to you later.

508
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:44,860
Oh wait...

509
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,500
Today I only talked to you very little.

510
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:49,700
You even came all the way to school!

511
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:51,740
Well, you were busy selling Takoyaki.

512
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:55,460
I didn't want to sell them! I wanted to see you.

513
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:57,940
But Jeed stole the show.

514
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:00,540
Noh!

515
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:03,900
Phun!

516
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:06,780
Oh, Yuri.

517
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:08,780
Hi. Eaten yet?

518
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:10,140
No, not yet.

519
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:12,180
'll grab something when I finish my stuff here.

520
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:15,140
Where are you guys going next?

521
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:16,980
Take care of Noh, okay?

522
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:19,980
Always do.

523
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:35,500
Mick!

524
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:37,140
Are you okay? You've been in there forever.

525
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:40,140
One sec, I have a stomachache.

526
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:42,740
Hurry up!

527
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:53,980
-What's the matter?
-I have diarrhea.

528
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:57,300
See? Wouldn't let me grill for you.

529
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:02,940
And you couldn't grill it properly.

530
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:10,300
I wanted to grill for you, Ohm.

531
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:12,340
Glad I didn't get diarrhea too.

532
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:14,180
You're the one who needs to be careful.

533
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:15,740
I'm sorry.

534
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:19,900
But if you get sick...tell me.

535
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:21,340
I'll get you medicine.

536
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:23,980
You're gonna take care of me?

537
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:32,100
Let's just say, until you grow up...

538
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:33,900
let me take care of you.

539
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:34,700
Huh?

540
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:40,460
Does this mean... you’re my boyfriend now?

541
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:52,980
Is that right?

542
00:45:56,540 --> 00:45:57,340
It is exactly as you heard it.

543
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:01,900
If you ask again and I'll change my mind.

544
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:25,980
P'Ohm!

545
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:46,220
Eh, Knot!

546
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:47,540
Drag him to bed.

547
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:49,780
Oh, no problem.

548
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:52,180
You can eat again next time, but...

549
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:54,540
You don't have to bring Ohm.

550
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:00,860
[Everyone] See you later, guys!

551
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:06,540
See you!

552
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:09,020
Oh, you are not going back?

553
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:10,380
We're going back now.

554
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:11,940
Take care, guys!

555
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:19,180
Still hurts?

556
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:23,020
Not really.

557
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:24,260
Almost healed.

558
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:25,620
-Really?
-Ouch!

559
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:28,180
I thought you said it was healed?

560
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:38,660
Just kidding.

561
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:42,620
I don't want you to worry about me.

562
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:49,900
Per!

563
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:54,300
Now it actually hurts.

564
00:47:57,620 --> 00:47:58,420
Mavin!

565
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:25,340
So what's the deal with you and my little brother?

566
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:34,220
We're together.

567
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:40,300
I think...

568
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:42,260
I'll take care of Win.

569
00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:51,060
I knew it would be like this.

570
00:48:57,420 --> 00:48:58,860
But don't let anyone know.

571
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:00,700
Especially Dad.

572
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:02,740
You'll be dead.

573
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:06,900
Okay.

574
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:10,980
I'll take good care of Win.

575
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:39,420
Let me tidy up my things.

576
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:55,620
Did your parents forget they have a son?

577
00:49:58,060 --> 00:49:59,940
Is your house accepting new sons?

578
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:22,660
Phun!

579
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:27,420
Did you see Aim today?

580
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:43,340
Yeah, I did.

581
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:50,460
She seems to be doing well.

582
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:57,060
She looks fine.

583
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:14,260
Why? Jealous, huh?

584
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:19,380
Jealous? No way.

585
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:27,100
You’re jealous, aren’t you?

586
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:29,860
What?

587
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:38,860
Eh, I'll tidy up first.

588
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:41,660
It has nothing, really.

589
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:44,220
We’re just friends...

590
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:48,940
But you...admit you're jealous.

591
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:51,460
That sounds crazy.

592
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:58,540
Crazy? I get jealous of you sometimes.

593
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:04,500
Mr. Popular today, huh?

594
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:06,100
Everyone wants a piece of you.

595
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:24,060
Eh, I'll tidy up.

596
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:35,820
Noh!

597
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:43,460
Since... you like me,

598
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:45,740
like I like you...

599
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:49,340
So...

600
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:52,940
...wanna try going out?

601
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:13,500
When did I say I liked you? You’re making that up!

602
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:22,020
What!

603
00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:30,460
Don't be so quiet for too long.

604
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:34,380
I'm also shy too, huh?

605
00:53:38,860 --> 00:53:40,660
So... what's going to be between us?

606
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:44,580
Fine, okay!

607
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:51,540
"Okay” what? I'm serious!

608
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:54,260
Well,

609
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:56,460
what did you just ask?

610
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:15,420
So, we’re together?

611
00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:17,580
Yeah.

612
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:24,060
Like, as boyfriends?

613
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:26,780
Yeah!

614
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:28,300
So I’m your boyfriend?

615
00:54:28,580 --> 00:54:29,300
Yeah!

616
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:31,340
-And you’re my boyfriend?
-Phun!

617
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:33,020
So annoying already.

618
00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:37,420
Thank you

619
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:40,380
In the student council room...

620
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:42,020
What did you say?

621
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:43,500
Be my boyfriend, Noh.

622
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:55,380
I like you!

623
00:54:56,780 --> 00:54:58,100
I like you too!

624
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:13,180
Hey!

625
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:15,620
Are you okay, Phun?

626
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:18,380
Are you crying?

627
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:20,460
Yeah, look!

628
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:23,020
Crying?

629
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:49,900
Thanks for this morning.

630
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:50,900
It's okay.

631
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:54,060
Later, come early so you don't get punished.

632
00:56:54,060 --> 00:56:55,380
What's going on with you and Phun?

633
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:57,260
You guys have been close lately.

634
00:56:57,260 --> 00:56:58,780
What are you to each other?

635
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:00,260
Noh and I, we're...

636
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:01,700
Friends!

637
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:04,900
I'm sorry.

638
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:06,460
I'm not embarrassed...

639
00:57:07,220 --> 00:57:08,860
I'm just not used to it. Got it?

640
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:11,060
It's fine, actually.

641
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:13,220
It's kind of nice to be like this.

642
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:16,940
