1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,600
[English subtitles available].
Hey, Noh!

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,800
We're missing two zeros from our budget.

3
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,280
What should I do?

4
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,560
There's another way.
How about you be my boyfriend?

5
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,000
But you already have a girlfriend?

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,200
I do have a girlfriend,

7
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:12,280
but my family might not like her. They’ve already picked someone for me.

8
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,880
If there’s only one way to survive..

9
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,280
I'll ask Pang for help.

10
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,600
And about the club, I'll handle it.

11
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,640
Don't bail on me, that's all.

12
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,440
I'm sorry

13
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,840
I didn’t know you were allergic.

14
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:29,880
Cold!

15
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,560
Turn off the air.

16
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,880
Do you have fever?

17
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:27,840
Hey!

18
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,600
What are you so shocked about?

19
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:32,920
I'm shocked by you!

20
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,960
You pulled my [blanket].

21
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:35,960
Really?

22
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,479
Yeah!

23
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,640
I couldn't even remember.

24
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,640
Anyway, are you okay yet?

25
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,280
Do you think our friends have ever accidentally turned on the front camera and freaked out?

26
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,600
Probably freaked out by their prettiness

27
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,720
I'm fed up.

28
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,520
Here they come.

29
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,200
Photographer Lee...

30
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,960
Take some photos for me too!

31
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,560
What are you reviewing?

32
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,079
Some tamarind candy?

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,520
Hey, the restaurant posted the photo already.

34
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,960
It's fabulous!

35
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,440
Look...the place has 200 followers.

36
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,240
But the pic of Phun and Aim—

37
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,800
-has over 2,000 likes
-That's crazy!

38
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,640
Honestly, girl, I don’t even ship them,

39
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,000
But honestly, Aim's couple is an ideal match.

40
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,840
What does 'ideal match' mean?

41
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,320
Aww, the little Japanese girl doesn’t get it!

42
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,720
By the way, what’s “ideal” anyway?

43
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,040
It means they're a perfect pair.

44
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,800
When someone’s both good-looking and rich, what else can you call them?

45
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,320
Yes, they are ideal, worthy and perfect.

46
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,680
Must it be good-looking to be ideal?

47
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,040
Is she educating us?

48
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,400
Hey, listen up—

49
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,600
In our idiom, there is the word ‘perfect match’.

50
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,520
If the world were indifferent,

51
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,080
would that word even exist?

52
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,200
Now look at Aim's face...

53
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,800
she’s drop-dead gorgeous.

54
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,280
You really want her to date Lee?

55
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,079
What does that mean?

56
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,040
Ugh, Yuri!!!

57
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,800
Anyway, do you think—

58
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,520
-Me and Ohm are an ideal match?
-Yes, ideal.

59
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,360
An ideal match for… doctor's advice.

60
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,320
Yuri, did you wear Mary Janes to school today?

61
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,840
So cute.

62
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,200
Where did you get them? I want them!

63
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,800
Yesterday!

64
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,320
At Siam, right?

65
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,440
-Did you go back for it?
-Yeah.

66
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
They’re pretty, look really good on you!

67
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,200
Then, buy some!

68
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,600
Of course. I'll ask my mom.

69
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,280
Still burning up.

70
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,120
I’ll get some meds for you.

71
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,520
Hello?

72
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,760
Oh, today?

73
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,960
[Aim] Yeah, of course.

74
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,200
[Aim] It’s the day we planned!

75
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,000
You said you'd take me shopping.

76
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,600
Can be tomorrow?

77
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,160
[Aim] Why?

78
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,880
Are you flaking on me?

79
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,520
No, I'm not.

80
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,160
Then, I'll see you in Siam this evening, okay?

81
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,480
[Aim] Alright!

82
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,720
Talk to you later.

83
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:16,960
Phun!

84
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,440
You’re going to Siam?

85
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,240
In this state!?

86
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,640
I’ll sleep for a bit and be fine.

87
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,760
Even your voice right now is unbearable, man.

88
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,160
[EP2: Aim]

89
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,040
Can we take photos with you?

90
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,080
Is there a size 38?

91
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,200
I’ll check for you.

92
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,520
One, two, three!

93
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,440
Let me see the picture.

94
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,560
Hello there.

95
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,400
Could we interview you for some content?

96
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,400
Wow, you guys are a couple, aren’t you?

97
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,560
Noh!

98
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,600
Oh, Earn! What are you doing here?

99
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,400
I’m picking up some stuff for the soccer event.

100
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,159
Hey, can I see it?

101
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,720
Wait!

102
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,720
If you want to see...

103
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:41,840
How about grabbing lunch with me?

104
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:43,600
Oh.

105
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,200
Hey!

106
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,400
Maybe next time.

107
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:51,960
-See you!
-See you!

108
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,480
Hey!

109
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,120
Are you alright?

110
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,280
I'll take him home first, okay?

111
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,240
Take it easy!

112
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,640
Take this first.

113
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,000
Get up slowly!

114
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,560
Get in first.

115
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,800
Thonglor, please.

116
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,600
Can we not go home?

117
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,400
You sure you’re okay?

118
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,480
Can you take us to Ekkamai instead?

119
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,280
-Mama!
-Yes!

120
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,280
I think I'm more handsome than him.

121
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,800
You're really confident, huh?

122
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:05,960
You’re upset over something so small? Come on, just admit the truth!

123
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,600
-How I look different from him?
-There is a big difference in all ways.

124
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,000
-Mama!
-Don't be mad!

125
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,560
-I was just teasing!
-So little difference.

126
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,480
Let it go, let it go...

127
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,600
Gosh! So much love here!

128
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,400
Go find yourselves a husband then!

129
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,960
Ouch!

130
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,600
How harsh!

131
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,640
Oh wait!

132
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,760
-Good evening!
-Who’s this boy?

133
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,720
It’s my friend.

134
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,000
He’s not feeling well.

135
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,840
-I’m taking him to the room.
-Let me help you.

136
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,480
Im & Am...

137
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,680
please bring also the medicine, towel

138
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,080
and also the T-shirt.

139
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,400
Alright, madam.

140
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,520
-That way!
-No, it's this way.

141
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,320
Go quickly.

142
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,800
Ouch, be careful.

143
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,480
This way

144
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:00,920
Oh...

145
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,080
All are gone now.

146
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,400
Sit.

147
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:13,880
You're not really going home?

148
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,040
Go to the hospital?

149
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,360
I’ll be fine.

150
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:28,000
-Im & Am, are you coming up?
-Yes, we're.

151
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,600
Here we come.

152
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,600
Here you go!

153
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,600
Noh, here’s the fever medicine.

154
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,040
And then...

155
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,440
don't forget to wipe him. He's covered in sweat.

156
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,880
Don't let him shower yet.

157
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,360
When you're done—

158
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,960
Change him into this.

159
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,200
Did you get it?

160
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:51,840
-Yeah.
-If you want something more, just let me know.

161
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:52,920
Alright?

162
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,400
-Make yourself at home.
-Yes, ma'am.

163
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,720
Why you're sitting there?

164
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,680
Nong Noh!

165
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,640
Your friend is super handsome!

166
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,240
Why did you say that in front of him?

167
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,760
-Is that not okay?
-No, it’s not.

168
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,400
Nong Noh!

169
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,440
-Your friend is super handsome!
-What're you doing?

170
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,680
What the hell are you doing? Get down.

171
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,440
How terrible!

172
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,200
-I didn’t mean to.
-[Noh's mom] - Im & Am, are you coming down?

173
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:39,840
Yes.

174
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,400
Come on

175
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,560
Coming, madam.

176
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,800
Let's go wipe you off.

177
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,680
I’ll wipe myself.

178
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,000
Who the hell can clean themselves?

179
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,800
Hurry up and take off your shirt.

180
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,560
Quickly!

181
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,920
Why not take it off from the top?

182
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:18,840
Don’t be mad at Aim, okay?

183
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,200
She didn't mean to.

184
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,800
Why would I be mad?

185
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
You're causing your own trouble.

186
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,720
Smart kids are always stubborn.

187
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,760
You hungry?

188
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,720
Not hungry? Then just sleep.

189
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,200
And call home too.

190
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,680
And wear this shirt.

191
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,560
I laid it out for you.

192
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,800
Noh!

193
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,480
Are we close now?

194
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,000
I don’t know.

195
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,600
President of the Music Club here, requesting a budget review for this semester.

196
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,200
Noh!

197
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,200
Phun!

198
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,320
Feed me!

199
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,960
You eat it yourself...

200
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,760
Do you take medicine?

201
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,560
Noh!

202
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,240
Are we close now?

203
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,840
Nong Aim, can we take a photo with you?

204
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,400
Strike a nice pose, okay?

205
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,480
1...2...3

206
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,080
Change your pose.

207
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,920
1...2...3

208
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,560
So cute! Thanks so much.

209
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,440
Hey, Phun!

210
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,560
Phun!

211
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,480
Cold?

212
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,080
You can hug me.

213
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,880
If it helps you feel better like before,

214
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,440
then go ahead.

215
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:17,800
Are we close now?

216
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,160
The air’s hot, and your hug’s too tight...

217
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,160
You’ll pay for this later!

218
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,120
Would you like breakfast, young master Pun?

219
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:15,800
What?

220
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,800
Oh, yeah.

221
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,080
I’ll dig up something for you, dude!

222
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,240
♫I am traveling with a racing heart,♫

223
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:49,240
♫Not knowing, not knowing, not knowing where this will lead.♫

224
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,760
Nong Noh!

225
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,960
-Did you wake up already?
-Yes, I did.

226
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:13,080
But normally, if the clock hasn’t passed noon,
you would never wake up, right?

227
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,280
Did you not sleep well?

228
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,000
Wait!

229
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,480
Didn't sleep well?

230
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,560
You two sleeping together?

231
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:28,000
You two must be hugging for sure.

232
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,560
The AC was too hot.

233
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,440
The AC was too hot, really?

234
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,400
Is it really hot because of the AC?

235
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,640
Sharing one blanket—

236
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,800
It must be sweating.

237
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,400
Cute, brother.

238
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,880
P'Im, do we have anything to eat?

239
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:55,720
Why does this feel like a scene where they make breakfast together in a series?

240
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,880
There’s nothing, Nong Noh!

241
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,360
Mom and Dad aren’t here either.

242
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,200
Everyone went out.

243
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:07,080
Nobody's home.

244
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,480
But you can go check the kitchen.

245
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,440
Maybe there’s something you can cook up.

246
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,640
Just the two of you, eating together.

247
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,600
Go on, check.

248
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,000
I'll go to do the laundry.

249
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,240
Give it your best effort.

250
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,400
Just create a meal...

251
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,200
for the one you love.

252
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,640
You can go ahead now!

253
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,240
I went to do laundry first.

254
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,720
The sun is so good.

255
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:38,160
♫I am traveling with a racing heart,♫

256
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,200
Will it be enough?

257
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,400
What should sick people eat?

258
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:14,120
Sick people have to eat porridge, Nong Noh!

259
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,240
I have just returned from the market.

260
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,640
And...

261
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,680
Tada! I brought porridge too!

262
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,480
But wait, there's more.

263
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,800
I also got...

264
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,400
Eggs—

265
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:30,080
freshly laid! And pork too!

266
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,320
Now we’ve got all the ingredients. Ready to cook!

267
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,280
But how do I cook it, P’Am?

268
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,400
You’ve come to the right person, Nong Noh!

269
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,120
Because I...

270
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,360
am a graduate of cooking schools—

271
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,720
from all over the world.

272
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,920
Also,

273
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:55,840
I’ve worked at 15 Michelin-starred restaurants,

274
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,600
Six-star hotels, eight-month stays,

275
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,000
meteor showers—I've been through it all.

276
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,120
So making porridge like this...

277
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:13,840
-Okay, ready?
-Yes, I'm.

278
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,760
Tada!

279
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,520
Porridge for “close friend”.

280
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:01,840
It’s done!

281
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,200
Close friend?

282
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:04,840
Yes!

283
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,760
Normally,

284
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,160
you've never done anything like this for anyone.

285
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,680
Making porridge for someone means you're getting really close, right?

286
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,520
-That's right.
-Yeah.

287
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,200
The food tastes terrible.

288
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,120
Change a new chef.

289
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,960
This is a five-star hotel,

290
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:32,920
not a cheap place!

291
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,200
Understood.

292
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,800
I'll handle it quickly.

293
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,800
Oh, tomorrow at 8: 00.

294
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,520
There is a shooting of Jackie's show.

295
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,280
He'll send the script.

296
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,800
You're already filming and haven't sent the script yet?

297
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,280
I’ll chase it down right away!

298
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,920
Why are your lips so pale?

299
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,200
Like a sick person

300
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,320
Grab my lipstick for me, will you?

301
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,200
Got it.

302
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,480
Make sure to check the mirror before leaving the room.

303
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,080
It’s a good thing we’re still in the hotel.

304
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,520
If this were outside, you'd be screwed.

305
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:22,640
Put it on.

306
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,480
I never thought you’d grow up to be so pretty.

307
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,800
When you were born, I was so worried.

308
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,000
Remember?

309
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,440
When she was born, she wasn't that pretty!

310
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,320
Other moms would take their kids to tutoring.

311
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,760
But you had to take her to the clinic!

312
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,760
Fortunately, she's a big girl now. She can go by herself.

313
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,600
Oh, right—

314
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:57,000
We’ve got a show filming at the hotel today, so get the room ready.

315
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,360
And put away the baby pictures, okay?

316
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,600
Then go shoe shopping with P’Pla.

317
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,840
Get a nice pair.

318
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,760
So you won’t embarrass yourself.

319
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,200
Yes.

320
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:11,159
[Social media] Hi, can we do a quick interview for some content?

321
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:14,639
[Social media] Wow, you two are together like this, what’s the story here?

322
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,960
Are you still dating Mr. Danop’s son?

323
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:24,639
Stick with this guy, okay? I think he's a good one.

324
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,920
[Q: Who made the first move?]

325
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,400
[Lee: Can you come out?]

326
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
My friend’s here. I’ll excuse myself for now.

327
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,560
Hey, Lee!

328
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,280
Here!

329
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,000
My mom sent some Kanom Jeen for you.

330
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,360
Thank you!

331
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,440
It has coconut milk in it, though. Are you okay with that?

332
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,400
You'll complain about weight later.

333
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,440
It’s fine, I can eat it.

334
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,040
Alright, I’ll head off.

335
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,720
Say hi to Mrs. Ann for me.

336
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:34,480
Where are you off to? Got a date or something?

337
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,000
You talk as if I have a lot of people. I only have one.

338
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,440
-Hello!
-Hello!

339
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,680
Your mom sent food again? She's so kind.

340
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:48,160
With pleasure. She's happy to do it.

341
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,440
Your girlfriend?

342
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,480
Kids these days are lucky, huh?

343
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,600
Be whoever you want to be, just be a good person.

344
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,600
Alright, I’ll be going now.

345
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,640
See you!

346
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,960
Not like that! I don’t approve.

347
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,760
I won’t accept a tomboy, lesbian, or whatever.

348
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,240
Didn’t you just say they can be whoever they want as long as they’re a good person?

349
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,120
That's not my child.

350
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,120
Did you know—

351
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,320
Lee’s mom is stressed about this too. She always talks to me.

352
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,880
Don’t behave like that...

353
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,400
unless you want everyone to talk about you.

354
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,240
Wow, this looks delicious!

355
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:24,320
I wish your friend could see the care you are putting into this.

356
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,440
Phun is so lucky, huh?

357
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,080
Oh, come on.

358
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:40,200
It’s true! I’ve never seen you do anything like this for anyone before.

359
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,840
Alright, take it to serve...

360
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,600
-before it gets cold, quickly.
-Okay!

361
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,000
Smile, smile.

362
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:51,920
Oh, be careful.

363
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,920
-Oh wait!
-Yeah.

364
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:58,040
Let me take this back first.

365
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,040
Go.

366
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,400
When did you wake up?

367
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Just now.

368
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,240
Do you have this game?

369
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,040
Really cool.

370
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,600
Feeling better?

371
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,200
Yeah, my headache’s gone.

372
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,800
Hungry? I made some porridge for you.

373
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,160
You want some?

374
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,800
You made it yourself?

375
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,480
It’s just instant porridge.

376
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:45,800
Thank you

377
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:50,720
It’s nothing, gotta treat guests well, right?

378
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:02,880
Delicious

379
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:07,480
Of course, coming from Master Chef Ekkamai!

380
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,960
Hey, If it's good, why the hell do you add sauce?

381
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:12,800
Well,

382
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,560
I like to eat salty

383
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,640
Ha, you like salty?

384
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,080
Enjoy your kidney disease.

385
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,360
Have you eaten yet?

386
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:27,960
You’re not eating?

387
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:36,680
It’s all cold now.

388
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:42,800
Jump now!

389
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,040
Wait!

390
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,600
-Hey, let me play that!
- Wait, just a second.

391
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,320
Come here.

392
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,160
-No...
-Let me show you how it's done.

393
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,320
No need to play by myself

394
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,280
Let me play.

395
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,240
No.

396
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,560
Damn Phun!

397
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:00,000
-Let me do it.
-Hey, I'm playing.

398
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,560
Yeah, I'll play for you.

399
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Damn Phun!

400
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,880
Give it to me!

401
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,880
Nong Noh, did you forget the dried beef?

402
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,840
I bought sticky rice for you too.

403
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,120
What are you guys doing?

404
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,200
I’ll go get the medicine.

405
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:05,840
oh!

406
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:36,960
Hey, Phun!

407
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:45,480
Helmet!

408
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:25,240
Thanks, man.

409
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:30,800
Hey, Noh!

410
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,480
Oh, thanks man.

411
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:44,880
Were you up late last night?

412
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,680
Yeah!

413
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:52,080
Ohm asked me to play a game.

414
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:53,960
I see.

415
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:56,240
If your team’s ever short, hit me up!

416
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:05,200
Earn!

417
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:08,880
I’ll see you later.

418
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,520
Look at this guy just floating around. Hey!

419
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:31,800
Damn Noh!

420
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:34,080
Where were you last night?

421
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:35,600
We lost because of you, asshole!

422
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:36,760
Do you know

423
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:39,000
The guy who filled in for you played terribly.

424
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:42,760
I tried to play it cool for the girls

425
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:43,560
but we lost!

426
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,800
I dropped three ranks.

427
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:47,520
This asshole too!

428
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,960
You didn't help anything.

429
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,720
Hey, Noh, look at me. I’m right here.

430
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,200
Take responsibility for everything, okay?

431
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,520
-Auntie, one crispy pork basil, please.
[Auntie] -Don't have.

432
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,040
What do you have?

433
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,480
[Auntie] Cheese, Fried chicken,

434
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,080
[Auntie] -French fries, water.
[Ohm] - Grenadine, please.

435
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:29,200
Hey, Ohm!

436
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:30,800
Why didn’t you reply to my chat?

437
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:31,800
Why should I answer?

438
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,240
Because you’re supposed to watch my newbie.

439
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:36,400
No.

440
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,400
What are you eating? Let me try some.

441
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:53,000
That’s good!

442
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,000
Hold on! Almost full already.

443
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:57,680
Jeez!

444
00:46:58,280 --> 00:46:59,600
Don’t steal his food, dude.

445
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:02,560
Just leave it, come here.

446
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:04,040
-See you!
-You come here.

447
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:05,360
Where do we go?

448
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:30,360
Hi!

449
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:37,400
Um,

450
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:39,000
Hi!

451
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:07,240
Damn Film keeps on insisting.

452
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:10,120
It’s just one kid. Just do it.

453
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:12,120
No, the more I'm forced, the more I refuse!

454
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,240
I don't know him; we're not even close.

455
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:15,600
Why should I take care of him?

456
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:26,240
Wow, this looks delicious!

457
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:29,040
I wish your friend could see this.

458
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,680
He would know how much you care.

459
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:48,960
Noh!

460
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:52,400
Are we close now?

461
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:22,280
Ohm!

462
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:23,640
What?

463
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,120
How many years have you and I been close?

464
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:27,640
10 years?

465
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:30,760
We’re close.

466
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,080
But how close can we really be?

467
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:36,440
This close, maybe?

468
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:38,400
All right.

469
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:41,200
-This close...
-Oh, Shit!

470
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:43,080
Get away, jerk! It's hot.

471
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,000
And what if?

472
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:05,400
Shit.

473
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:07,200
Who the fuck?

474
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:09,600
Damn Phun!

475
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:42,600
Is that mop water?

476
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:46,360
Filtered water!

477
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:51,000
Why’d you pour it on me?

478
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:53,400
Is this payback for the car wash?

479
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:58,440
I didn’t even see you.

480
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
What were you doing there anyway?

481
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:08,280
Not going to class?

482
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:12,640
You're not either?

483
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:18,800
Well,

484
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:20,640
I’m waiting for you to dry off.

485
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:22,400
You still have a fever?

486
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:34,880
And today—

487
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:38,400
Why are you ignoring me?

488
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:57,800
When you're dry, could you lock the door for me?

489
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:51,240
You okay, man?

490
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:56,400
I don't know.

491
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:01,040
Ever feel like you don’t know what you are?

492
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:06,560
The longer it goes on, the more people get hurt.

493
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,040
How do I figure it out?

494
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:15,240
How do I know it faster?

495
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:20,240
I don't know what you are.

496
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:22,800
But you should ask yourself.

497
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:25,240
In the end—

498
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:27,920
What do you want most in life?

499
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:40,640
What the fuck are you hitting?

500
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,080
I'm rehearsing.

501
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:50,360
-Look at that jerk, is he crazy?
-Hey, Ohm!

502
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Dried yet?

503
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:54,880
I think

504
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:57,840
it's okay now.

505
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:00,840
Damn hot.

506
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:06,640
Ohm!

507
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:09,000
It’s just one kid, why can’t you help me?

508
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:12,080
Now you're paying the price, soaking wet, you idiot!

509
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,360
Bullshit! It's just one kid, you guys take care of him.

510
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:17,440
Whoa!

511
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:20,680
I'm busy. We have soccer practice.

512
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,200
I’ve got stuff to do too.

513
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:24,800
-What are you doing?
-I'm going back to see the Demon Slayer.

514
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:25,640
Ugh!

515
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:29,200
-Busy?
-That’s nonsense, Ohm.

516
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:45,680
Hey, Art!

517
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:46,960
Go find our friend.

518
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:48,760
I’ll go ahead.

519
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:50,200
Hey, Ngor!

520
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:53,200
I really don't have any money this week.

521
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:55,040
I haven't eaten yet today.

522
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:58,520
You say you haven’t eaten, but I saw you holding Starbucks.

523
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,000
Hold on!

524
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:04,000
[Ngor] I only hold my friend's.

525
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:08,520
Forget it. Let's take off his watch.

526
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:10,880
Good afternoon, sir!

527
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:18,400
[In teacher's voice] Hey there!

528
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:20,200
What are you doing here?

529
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:24,560
Oh, we're here for marching band practice,

530
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:26,280
not to do anything else.

531
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:29,800
Just checking out this corner of the building.

532
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:33,280
I heard students come here to shake people down for money.

533
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:35,480
Keep grabbing him.

534
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:38,680
No way, sir! Are there still jerks...

535
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:52,520
Hard to believe that at our school we'd have such assholes...

536
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:00,240
I mean, hassles.

537
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:03,960
They're so poor that they have to extort money from others.

538
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:09,840
Not really, they might have money but also problems at home.

539
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:14,240
Like maybe they have dogs at home, and their parents love the dogs more than them?

540
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:17,800
Or they hit on a girl, and she didn't answer them.

541
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:21,920
Or worse—ordered basil chicken and got string beans instead!

542
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:25,960
I'm guessing they're the kind with size 49 dicks,

543
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:29,360
But 7-Eleven only sells size 52.

544
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,800
Man... that’s rough.

545
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:36,560
Lemme go check it out.

546
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:46,160
You won't be saved next time, Ngor!

547
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,000
Hey, Ngor!

548
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:54,960
-Thank you!
-How many times has this happened?

549
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:57,600
First time, bro.

550
00:56:58,800 --> 00:56:59,600
Really?

551
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:03,600
I don't believe you.

552
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:06,920
3 times

553
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:09,040
You think I'm stupid?

554
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:13,040
Answer me again.

555
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:20,440
How did you let them do it?

556
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:23,880
Come on, they’re older and there were three of them!

557
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:25,200
How can he beat them?

558
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:28,000
You too, do not wear Patek watch next time.

559
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:29,160
You’ve gotta learn to say no

560
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:32,680
I guess I have to teach you how to say no.

561
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:35,600
Repeat after me: 'No way!'

562
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:37,560
No way...

563
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:39,080
Jeez!

564
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Come on, say it louder.

565
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:44,360
-No way!
-C'mon!

566
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:47,800
-Louder!
-Again, give it your all this time, okay?

567
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:49,520
With all your might, face turning red.

568
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,960
NO WAY!!!

569
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:09,040
So good, Ngor!

570
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,200
He can do it. That's it.

571
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:17,000
Ohm!

572
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:20,040
You seem to like teaching kids, huh?

573
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:22,400
Are you really not going to teach a newbie for me?

574
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:24,160
You idiot, you've been asking me all day.

575
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:25,680
Hey!

576
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:28,040
Answer, answer what I want to hear.

577
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,960
Alright, I’ll teach, okay?

578
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:33,680
It's just this.

579
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:35,840
-I'll pay you for grenadine
-All right.

580
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:40,760
Next time bring me a Patek to wear, okay?

581
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:42,120
No way!

582
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:58,080
Noh, is this cute?

583
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:01,840
Noh!

584
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:03,360
Noh!

585
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:07,960
-Isn't it cute?
-It’s really cute.

586
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:10,000
What’s wrong?

587
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:15,680
Just tired from studying.

588
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:20,120
-Are you?
-Oh why?

589
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:24,600
Then I will click for another one

590
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:26,320
so that we can have them as a pair.

591
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:28,360
When you are tired, you will think of me.

592
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:30,440
Will that just make me more tired?

593
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:42,760
-Is this cute? Look!
-It’s so cute.

594
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Use them as a pair.

595
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:47,600
Then I will buy this one for you.

596
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,600
It looks the same, right?

597
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:51,360
They don’t look the same at all.

598
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:55,760
Noh, with things like this, it's all about how you feel. They’re both elephants, right?

599
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:58,760
Let's go pay.

600
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:11,240
Aim!

601
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:12,760
Phun!

602
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:15,320
Oh, no wonder.

603
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:17,080
After school, you rushed out.

604
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:17,800
C'mon.

605
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:20,160
I don’t have someone to pick me up from school like you.

606
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:24,680
Did you buy them to use together?

607
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:26,280
It's so sweet!

608
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:27,840
You should do the same.

609
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:29,240
Look here...

610
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:30,920
Noh, show them.

611
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:38,480
Let’s go, it’s too full of love around here.

612
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:53,200
What's wrong?

613
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:03,640
Hi.

614
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:31,640
What’s wrong with you? Just say it.

615
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:35,040
Why didn't you just say?

616
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:04,800
You’re really going to face me.

617
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:24,240
[Operator] -Sorry, the line you are calling is unavailable.
-Phun didn't answer the call

618
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:26,880
I came to see you today...

619
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:28,520
because I have something to ask,

620
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:31,440
But can you promise me that if I ask...

621
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:33,200
you'll answer honestly.

622
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:35,720
Phun's dating someone else, right?

623
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:38,880
So, what is it exactly?

624
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:40,240
You’re not making anything clear.

625
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:43,680
I want to have you.

626
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:50,640
