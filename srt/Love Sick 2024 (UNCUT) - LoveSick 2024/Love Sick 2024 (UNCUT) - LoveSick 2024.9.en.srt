1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,840
[Noh] Dude, I’m sorry for coming over.

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:03,800
[Noh] But we really need to talk about this.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,160
[Phun] I hate that you have to see me like this.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,400
[Noh] You don't have to say anything.

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,640
[Noh] If you let it go,

6
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,040
[Noh] then I’ll let it go too.

7
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,840
I’m staying right here with you.

8
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,800
Save it for this afternoon!

9
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:16,840
[Just smile a bit.]

10
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,240
The reason why you push me like this...

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,480
Is it because I told you I liked you?

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,880
Can we forget about it?

13
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:25,880
Go back to how we were.

14
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,360
I like you, P' Ohm.

15
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,240
And I'll even make you my boyfriend.

16
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,000
You get ready for that.

17
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:33,880
And...

18
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,400
Aren’t you gonna ask about that day?

19
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,920
Let me know if you need any help.

20
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,920
I never stopped loving you.

21
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,000
Even when I was with Phun.

22
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,120
I only thought about you.

23
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:08,000
-Can you check if I look pretty?
-Is my bangs flawless?

24
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,560
-So cute.
-Yeah, it's flawless.

25
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,760
-Your bangs are messy.
-Could you fix them for me?

26
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,360
Wait, me too!

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,400
Do you like her?

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,440
Go flirt with her.

29
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,360
Look, I'll find out for you.

30
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,960
If she's single, go ahead.

31
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,720
Nah, it's fine.

32
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,000
Eh, Phun!

33
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,080
Mom, I don't want to go.

34
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,280
Why do I have to go?

35
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,880
I already made plans with my friends.

36
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,000
I just want friends who are really my friends.

37
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,480
Not friends who are just content.

38
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,280
Okay, then.

39
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:42,520
[EP9 Phun-Aim]

40
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,080
Even though I was with Phun,

41
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,400
I was always thinking of you.

42
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,480
Aim, be careful!

43
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,800
Don't go with anyone else, Lee!

44
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,280
I really don't have anyone left.

45
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,560
Wait, wait...

46
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,240
Where are you rushing off to?

47
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,840
Wait for the clear soup first.

48
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,040
But I have to go now.

49
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,840
Are you in such a hurry?

50
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,640
I have to go now.

51
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,800
Wait, wait...

52
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,280
Did you forget something?

53
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,400
Look, he forgot to kiss my cheek again.

54
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,520
[Everyone] Hey, Noh!

55
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,320
Why are you early?

56
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,800
I got up early.

57
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,920
[Everyone] Hey, Keng!

58
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,960
-Did you just sleep?
-What's up, dude!

59
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,159
What's this?

60
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,280
-That's mine!
-Nope, it's mine.

61
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,480
There are a lot there.

62
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,840
Here's mine, dude.

63
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,400
Gosh!

64
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,800
So detailed.

65
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,280
Did you take a long time to do this?

66
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,000
I've been summarizing continuously.

67
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,960
Just trying to make it easier to read.

68
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,440
You know what?

69
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,040
Let’s just eat it, shall we?

70
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,280
Hey, don't do that!

71
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,320
Stop it!

72
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,600
I think GPA score

73
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,480
of our class would be higher this semester

74
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,000
It might be get over class 1

75
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,760
Agree

76
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,240
Hey, Noh!

77
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,280
I got my order

78
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,880
Okay

79
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,480
I will sit there

80
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,560
Okay, I will reserve the table

81
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,800
Hey, dude

82
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,160
Here is my seat

83
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,920
Can I sit here?

84
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:31,880
Wait please

85
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,240

Wait please

88
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,800
Wait please

89
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,600
You may leave now

90
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,200
Here's your chiken

91
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,360
Thank you. Thank you.

92
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,600
Hey!

93
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,800
Do you realize that's your smile of the day

94
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,160
Do you think Noh is the healer?

95
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,560
Whenever you look at him

96
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,040
You always smile

97
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,800
You feel comfortable when you see him, don't you?

98
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,440
Oh hey Noh! drink some water

99
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,760
Alright, I don't think he's a healer now

100
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,040
He's something like a safe spot?

101
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,600
Fi

102
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,880
I have something to do.

103
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,000
What are you doing?

104
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,280
You missed!

105
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,680
What the...

106
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,320
Bro, is this correct?

107
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,800
It's not! Try again

108
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,840
Khom is quite good

109
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,640
What about this one?

110
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,400
Is this the wedding, man?

111
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,480
It's really hard to understand you guys.

112
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,760
Go

113
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,800
Jakkaphan!

114
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,200
You guys are so picky!

115
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,400
Is this the old amplifier?

116
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,600
Why don't you bring the new one?

117
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,520
Oh.

118
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,200
Hey, what's wrong?

119
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,160
Look at this

120
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,160
The is the old amplifier which is broken.

121
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,920
Hey, I'll get you a new one.

122
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,080
Noh, shall I help him?

123
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,400
No, stay here.

124
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,560
Oh!

125
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,400
Hey!

126
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,760
Noh!

127
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,080

128
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,400
Let me help

129
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,040
Is it okay to do that?

130
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,240
It is

131
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,280
I will be back

132
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,040
Why can't I think about this solution

133
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,200
Yeah.

134
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,800
Anything to help more?

135
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:07,960
Um..

00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,680
No, it's all done

137
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,800
Don't you have class?

138
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,360
I'm free for afternoon classes

139
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,400
Oh, yeah.

140
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,480
Hello?

141
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,480
Did you leave there?

142
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,320
Bring me the keys.

143
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,720
I did leave there

144
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,600
Then just go back

145
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,600
What the...

146
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,440
What should you do?

147
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,080
Uh...

148
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,200
Can you help me carrying this first?

149
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,000
Okay

150
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,600
I'll come to you later

151
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,680
Hey, wait a minute

152
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,840
Do you want me to wait?

153
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,640
You don't need to

154
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,760
You can go now

155
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,680
Okay

156
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,080
Noh

157
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,440
What are you carrying?

158
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,440
My hands is carrying not hairy

159
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,600
Oh, yeah.

160
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,480
Nothing special. It's for you guys

161
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,040
No, it's okay. I can do this

162
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,440
See you tomorrow.

163
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,160
I'll see you in the evening.

164
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,200
Okay

165
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,160
I gotta go now

166
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,000
Mick

167
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,359
What are you doing?

168
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,440
I'm making name tags

169
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,920
Only the artists name is fine not for all

170
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,520
In case someone would keep it as the memento

171
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,280
If they see their names

172
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,480
They would be happy

173
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,600
Did Fi still text you?

174
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,200
I don't do anything this time

175
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,680
Just blocked him

176
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,600
It's okay.

177
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,800
I don't want any trouble.

178
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,960
But if I want to know about Ohm

179
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,240
I'll text to ask Fi

180
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,240
Are you fooling my friend?

181
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,360
I'm wacthing you

182
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,400
Keep writing.

183
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,440
Hey, have I given back the needle to you?

184
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,280
Yes

185
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,240
Well, thank you.

186
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,040
Thank you for what?

187
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,280
For you, I can do it more

188
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,440
But...

189
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,560
There's no hope, isn't it?

190
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,200
What hope?

191
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,240
You really don't know

192
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,160
I'm sorry

193
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:58,880
If that makes you uncomfortable

194
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,600
What are you talking about? No, I'm not

195
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,160
Noh

196
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,960
I...

197
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,440
I've never ever been in crush before

198
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,400
You are the first one

199
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,880
Look at your face

200
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,960
I'm about to laugh just seeing you

201
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:34,440
Are you making fun of me?

202
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,480
No, I'm not

203
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,040
But you are a cool guy

204
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,400
Just stay with you

205
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,800
I'm healed

206
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,960
I really want to have you as my own.

207
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:22,840
You can

208
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,280
But...

209
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,680
It's not for that purpose

210
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,680
I don't have the same feeling as you

211
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,680
Do you understand me?

212
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,440
I think...

213
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,000
Friend status is good

214
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,000
Yeah

215
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,440
Okay

216
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Thank you so much for telling me honestly

217
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,520
But if

218
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,400
If you need some help

219
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,480
You can let me know anytime

220
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,280
I'm still how I am

221
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,440
Hello, Phun

222
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,040
Now Noh and Earn are flirting on side stage

223
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,320
Please come to interrupt them now

224
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,560
So...

225
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,440
See you tomorrow.

226
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,280
Hey!

227
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,160
What are you guys flirting?

228
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,800
What are you talking abot

229
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,600
Why are you here?

230
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,440
Setting up is all done

231
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,360
I'm here to take club president home together

232
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,640
What if the club president go home at 2 A.M.?

233
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,400
Then I'll go back first. I'm afraid I'm not looking good

234
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,200
What the... you're serious about being handsome?

235
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,400
Mr. President, sir.

236
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,400
Please don't just flirt at the side stage

237
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,400
Just inform you that the amplifier is broken

238
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,640
So..

239
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,000
You will wait for me, won't you?

240
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:17,880
Yes, I will

241
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,720
Then you stay here. I'll be back.

242
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,080
Thank you for taking me home

243
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,600
I'm rooting for you tomorrow!

244
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,440
Any special score?

245
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,400
I'm not corruption

246
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,040
See you

247
00:22:58,840 --> 00:22:59,640
Phun

248
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,480
Get home safely

249
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,760
Roger that, sir.

250
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,200
Noh

251
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,600
Tomorrow

252
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,480
I have something to say

253
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:33,800
wait for me

254
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:12,800
Today

255
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,600
We have a test for chapter 5 and 8

256
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,400
Start from 10.00 to 12.00 P.M.

257
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,320
Miss!

258
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,840
You haven't informed us about test!

259
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,360
Why do I have to?

260
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:26,040
If you pay attention to the class

261
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:26,840
You can do it

262
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,520
But I've to attend the evening live contest

263
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,800
Naphat

264
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,720
Phatchakorn

265
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,360
You are student so the duty is just to study

266
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,480
You're not the event organizer

267
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,080
Alright

268
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,880
If you want to go

269
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,560
Let's finish the exam quickly

270
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,760
After that, you can do whtever you want

271
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,400
Got it?

272
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,280
I don't know anything about the class

273
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,920
She just gives me the exam again

274
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,120
Let's start tutoring!

275
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,760
I have done predicting the questions in exam

276
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,280
Let's start! I'm ready

277
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,080
Go to page 3

278
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,760
What are you looking at?

279
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,800
I saw Win walk in over there

280
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,800
Win?

281
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,600
Why?

282
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,600
Only smokers are there in the nook of building

283
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:46,960
That means...

284
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,240
Win...

285
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,600
Not really

286
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,760
Hey!

287
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,040
What the hell are you guys doing?

288
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:33,760
Go out!

289
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,240
And you, come here

290
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:43,520
What's wrong with you Per? You told me to stay away from you

291
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,120
Stay away from me and be a good boy

292
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,000
How can I be good while we're apart?

293
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,240
What are you talking about? All I do is for you! What about you?

294
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,320
I did when I was with you, Per.

295
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,000
Ask youself, did you really do this for me?

296
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,200
Stop thinking for me

297
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,720
What's good or bad for me

298
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:04,400
Because this is my life

299
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,360
Don't be stubborn

300
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,280
If you want me to stay away from you, you need to do the same

301
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,920
Now I want to try something new

302
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,120
Perhaps, I found something better than you

303
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,000
Win!

304
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,480
Whose handwriting is this?

305
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,200
Why is it so cute?

306
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:57,880
Fi!

307
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,320
I'm about to give your stuff back

308
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:03,880
Here it is

309
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,760
I think I can't help you flirt with him anymore

310
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,160
Why?

311
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:16,760
He is in crush. You should give up

312
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:21,520
Do you know who? Do I know him?

313
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,400
Do you know him...

314
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,760
Let it go! you don't have to care

315
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,760
How is that guy better than me?

316
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,640
I don't know is that guy a good boy

317
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,840
But I think he is more handsome than you

318
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:43,920
I'm leaving

319
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,120
F**k you!

320
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,440
Pete, help me this guitar key note

321
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,120
It's wrong side!

322
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,400
You get on my nerve!

323
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,600
Hey, how are you guys? Are you ready today?

324
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,640
Oh, Ton

325
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,120
Hi

326
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:14,000
You are here today?

327
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,560
Of course, our club is nominated every year

328
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:17,580
What prize will we get?

329
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,560
I might not be able to do

330
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,800
I was just heartbroken

331
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,800
I'm so sick of it

332
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:29,200
Why? Just move on

333
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,520
You should be open-minded to someone else

334
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,400
No, I like him

335
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,160
Even he doesn't like me, I still do like him

336
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,840
Alright, let's go with what you're okay

337
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,400
I'm looking forward to seeing

338
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,520
Okay

339
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,880
Where are we now?

340
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:11,960
Wow

341
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,980
Hello everyone! Which brand will you cheer for today?

342
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:16,010
I'm Naphat Nawatjindakarn, a president of music club

343
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:18,030
I would like to have the official speech

344
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:20,060
for live contest 2024 the final

345
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:36,600
Please cheer and support the band you love today

346
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:37,720
Please enjoy the stage

347
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,120
If you dare enough, just say it out what band you cheer for

348
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,480
I'm fair enough. I'm not like you

349
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,360
What

350
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,600
Hello everyone

351
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,360
Thanks to all in the club for coming today

352
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,960
We are always Friday

353
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,480
For this song..

354
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,760
It may not be a joyful song

355
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,040
Because the beat is a little bit slow

356
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:38,760
I practice it in advance

357
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,600
I know I would be heartbroken

358
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,440
Yeah

359
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,840
But I'm still looking at you from far away

360
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:28,160
Someone, but just stand near here.

361
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,400
Noh

362
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:41,960
You're still here

363
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:50,880
Are you awake?

364
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,680
So I will accompany you

365
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:57,640
Or something else

366
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,480
Noh

367
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,400
Why is Earn looking at you?

368
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,400
That's enough.

369
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,000
Good job!

370
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:49,960
Wow

371
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,640
The opening show started with sad vibe

372
00:33:55,920 --> 00:34:06,280
For the next show, it's the brand you are waiting fr

373
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,320
Mafia band!

374
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,960
Mafia!

375
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:33,760
One more time x 5

376
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,160
If he sing badly, just throw the bottle up

377
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:02,960
Let's go bro

378
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:16,000
First of all, thanks to the band

379
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,600
giving me chance to do something like this

380
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,080
Do you have your own safe zone?

381
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:22,920
our safe zone?

382
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,200
Yes

383
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,840
Someone who makes you happy just looking at him

384
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:32,240
Or having meal together

385
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,880
food is getting more delicious

386
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,240
What if

387
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,800
You found that one

388
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,640
Don't miss to let him know

389
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,200
It's so special to have him

390
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,280
Oh

391
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,040
Who is that?

392
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,280
And today I will tell him

393
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:43,040
How long to travel

394
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,640
How troublesome it is, don't be afraid

395
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,880
If you were the sea, I would be the sky taking care of you

396
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,560
I will be beside you until the last day

397
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,200
Thank you

398
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,880
If you were the sea, could it be possible for me being the sky?

399
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,960
So we could be together at the edge of sky

400
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,280
If you were the sea

401
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,920
Is it possible for me to be the sky beside you?

402
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,280
Can I?

403
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:15,800
Yeah

404
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,760
Thank you guys so much today

405
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,560
Good job for you guys

406
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,160
Go pack up.

407
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,480
This is the last time

408
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,520
We will be able to sleep finally!

409
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,880
Oh, hey, Phun

410
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,200
Congratulations to you

411
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,040
for popular vote prize

412
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,240
Thank you

413
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,600
I voted for you

414
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,120
Because you are handsome

415
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:45,920
What are you thinking?

416
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,120
I'm kidding

417
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,360
Your band plays well.

418
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,440
The last song

419
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,880
I was about to tear

420
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,080
Because you stepped on my foot

421
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,200
What the hell is this?

422
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:54,880
Phun

423
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,400
Don't you leave now?

424
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,280
I'm waiting to go back with Noh

425
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,800
Alright guys, go pack up so we could sleep

426
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,080
Go

427
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,400
Let's go to sleep

428
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:14,680
What are you looking at?

429
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,200
What should you do?

430
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,040
Nothing, he is just stupid

431
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,280
Is that because you did that to him first?

432
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:32,280
How? All I did is good for him

433
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,840
And you think you're doing it right?

434
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:38,840
Listen to me

435
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,200
If it's not good being together

436
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:44,680
But it's not good either

437
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,640
being apart

438
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,240
Let's just being together then

439
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,800
Regardless, no one takes care of him as good as you

440
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:15,880
Hey!

441
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,720
And will you go home now?

442
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,720
Why?

443
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,600
I'm going to have some drink

444
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,200
It's not far from here

445
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,800
Are you allow to get in?

446
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,480
Yes, just come with us

447
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,800
Yeah, will you join?

448
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,560
Win

449
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,400
Don't go

450
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:54,800
What?

451
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,560
Don't go

452
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,080
What the f**k

453
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,200
He wasted our time

454
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,120
What do you want, Per?

455
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,400
You told me to stay away

456
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,440
I did

457
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,080
you're still not satisfied?

458
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:29,560
From now on,

459
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,240
You don't have to go anywhere

460
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,680
If you are apart from me and turn to bad boy

461
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,200
It's better having me take care of you

462
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,080
We don't have to play any damn games

463
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:48,880
You like me

464
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:50,400
and I like you

465
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:52,840
It's done

466
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:58,600
From now on,

467
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:00,440
I'll take care of you

468
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,480
You did really good for the song today

469
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,200
It's not sarcastic right?

470
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:44,800
I said it honestly

471
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:46,680
l like it

472
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:52,880
Do you really like it?

473
00:42:58,600 --> 00:42:59,400
Thank you for takng me home

474
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:05,600
Umm

475
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:14,280
Noh

476
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,800
I think I'm ready for Aim

477
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,400
You will be on my side, right?

478
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:46,440
Don't let go of my hand

479
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,280
I won't let you

480
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:37,680
Only two of you?

481
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:39,640
Um

482
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:41,600
Are you sure for this?

483
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:44,040
Yeah

484
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:48,600
Today, Ann auntie..

485
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,000
I mean Aim's mom, she isn't here

486
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:53,120
But he is grounded

487
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:54,920
If you want to talk

488
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:55,840
You need to go inside

489
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,120
I can trust you, right?

490
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:10,680
I always respect Aim

491
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:13,760
I still do for today

492
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,840
Then I'll wait outside so you can talk

493
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:32,440
Please wait for me here

494
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:05,440
I sent you messages. Did you see that?

495
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:10,400
I don't know what should I reply

496
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:19,000
How is it?

497
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:20,760
Have you two clear up talking?

498
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:24,600
I think it doesn't need to

499
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,360
Anyway, Lee doesn't have the same feeling as me

500
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:36,280
But I want to talk with you, Phun

501
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:45,840
Phun

502
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:50,680
I don't like men

503
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:01,960
I'm not like everyone else since I was young

504
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:09,760
I'm not adorable

505
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:15,960
I'm not good at studying

506
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:23,040
Also, I'm BI

507
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:33,280
No one accepts what I am

508
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,200
So I have to start changing myself

509
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:46,200
Start taking care of myself

510
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:52,440
Study hard

511
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:57,600
And try to date with you

512
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:05,560
In case, one day

513
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:08,840
I can really like you

514
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:17,840
In the end, I can't do that

515
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:24,960
I don't want to lie to you anymore

516
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,280
I just want to be myself

517
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:39,280
Even no one likes what I am

518
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:42,880
But it is myself

519
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,200
I don't want to fool Phun anymore

520
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:10,800
Phun

521
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:15,840
You are a very good man

522
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:23,560
You're the only one man

523
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:28,040
I feel comfortable to

524
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:39,200
I don't know that

525
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:44,400
you still want me being your friend or not

526
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:52,040
But I still want to be your friend

527
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:00,400
I'm really sorry

528
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:05,960
You don't have to apologize

529
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:08,800
It should be me doing that

530
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,800
Actually, I'm in crush with someone else

531
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:29,080
He's the one I have been peeking around but I don't dare to admit

532
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:37,760
Actually

533
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:39,360
I think we're in the sme situation

534
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:49,840
We're afraid of ourselves

535
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:52,680
We try not to be oueselves

536
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:57,640
In the end, we couldn't escape from oueselves

537
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:08,760
Your situation

538
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:10,880
I truly understand

539
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:20,560
For my situation,

540
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:23,360
It's fine if you're not okay

541
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:33,040
It's Noh?

542
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:37,440
Right?

543
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:43,880
It's understandable if it's him

544
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:46,800
He's cute

545
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:51,760
But I didn't expect

546
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:55,280
That you will..

547
00:52:58,360 --> 00:52:59,160
like men

548
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:07,680
I'm sorry

549
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:10,800
I feel I fooled you to find out myself

550
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:16,080
Actually, I was very happy being with you

551
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:23,800
From now on, I hope you take good care of yourself

552
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:27,840
If you need help, you can text me anytime

553
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:38,880
I'm still worried about you like I am

554
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:43,760
In summary, we broke up, right?

555
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:01,080
It's better to do that

556
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:13,000
May I hug you?

557
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:16,000
For the last time

558
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:55,400
I'm sorry

559
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:23,400
Is your friend really trustworthy?

560
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:28,600
He is

561
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:41,600
You like Aim?

562
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:48,800
What is this question for?

563
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:57,800
Well..

564
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:03,880
Even I like her, nothing changes

565
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:08,440
Why?

566
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:36,680
Phun

567
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:39,360
Are you okay? What did you talk to her?

568
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:00,160
I will take care of Aim

569
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:02,200
You two can go back now

570
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:19,800
Do you want to eat something?

571
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:26,400
Shall we go home?

572
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:33,080
Do you want to sleep at my house?

573
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:52,000
I broke up with Aim

574
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:01,240
Can I have time?

575
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:13,600
Why would you ask?

576
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:16,600
Breaking up with someone

577
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:18,400
needs time to heal

578
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:24,560
Wait for me

579
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:50,560
Let's go home

580
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:16,600
Ho Ho Ho

581
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:19,000
Hey!

582
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:29,840
This couple is too much sweet

583
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:39,640
Mix!

584
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:52,360
If I had a time machine,

585
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:53,800
I wouldn't let Mix be with you

586
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:56,920
Mix, I ask you seriouly. How is this guy good?

587
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:59,200
He is cute

588
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:00,800
You said he's cute

589
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:03,320
Are you going to turn over the position

590
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:08,640
Hey, where's Ngo?

591
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:12,920
He's just

592
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:13,960
taking photos with us

593
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:41,280
What's up?

594
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:44,040
Where's my money pocket? It's Christmas

595
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:48,520
Where the hell is that giving money pocket for Christmas

596
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:51,440
Will you give us 200 baht? Santa Ngo

597
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:54,640
Give me your wallet

598
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:55,800
Come on, Santa Ngo

599
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:56,960
Hurry

600
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,320
Come on, Santa. I told you to bring it, asshole

601
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:51,240
Fight with him

602
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:00,960
Hey!

603
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:02,760
What's going on?

604
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:14,040
Um,

605
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:38,600
Hey, what are you afraid of?

606
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:41,000
This is the student council room, not the discipline room

607
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:48,160
You did good job

608
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:50,560
Thank you bro

609
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:53,920
Don't be afraid

610
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:56,000
You did it just to protect yourself

611
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,520
You didn't do anything wrong

612
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:59,920
Well, nobody blames you

613
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:02,600
Thank god there's CCTV there

614
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:05,120
If you punch someone, do it in CCTV area

615
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:06,520
I think

616
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:08,200
We can make a short film

617
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:11,560
Pong taught you well

618
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:29,120
If everything is cleared

619
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:30,080
I may leave now

620
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:32,200
Thank you for your concern

621
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:33,600
Yes

622
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:35,000
Good luck, Bye bye

623
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:39,080
Hey!

624
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:42,880
You're not going to the fair?

625
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:46,520
I will, how about you?

626
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:48,920
No, I'm afraid of that

627
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:50,640
What are you doing?

628
01:03:56,360 --> 01:03:57,200
Where to go?

629
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:34,200
Hopefully

630
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:18,840
Let me help

631
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:21,800
You don't need to

632
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:24,880
How do it clean doing yourself

633
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:27,360
Try to have someone helping you

634
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:03,600
Hey

635
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,200
It's so crowded here

636
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:38,080
Hey Phun

637
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:40,680
The council room is more comfortable so

638
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:41,479
Why are you here?

639
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:43,200
Why did you ask that

640
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:45,640
Even he must be tired coming to this room

641
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:47,800
But his heart is comforted here

642
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:52,359
How is it comfortable?

643
01:08:53,319 --> 01:08:54,279
It's so tired cleaning up the dust here

644
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:57,520
Then, let me give you a massage

645
01:09:06,279 --> 01:09:07,200
What are you looking at?

646
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,160
I'm handsome?

647
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:11,479
Too confident! If I take a shower,

648
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:13,000
I'm more handsome than you for sure

649
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:17,800
Hey!

650
01:09:18,279 --> 01:09:19,080
As handsome as this one?

651
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:21,960
Shit

652
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:23,040
No, don't make fun of me

653
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:29,560
Just a second

654
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:30,760

656
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:36,040

657
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:37,479
Can you visit Siam with me?

658
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:39,399
Okay

659
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:41,000

660
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:46,040

Yeah, a second ago

662
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:51,479
Why did you ask?

663
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:54,000
Nothing

664
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:09,400

And you came with Phun?

672
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:26,000
You said you'd wait for me, are you still waiting?

673
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:28,120
Let's have meal

674
