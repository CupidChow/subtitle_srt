1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,830
[English subtitles available]
Noh!

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:02,300
Phun!

3
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:03,500
Hey, Yuri!

4
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,500
Where are you guys going next?

5
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,100
Take care of Noh, okay?

6
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:09,000
Always do.

7
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,030
Since you like me,

8
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,300
and I like you.

9
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:16,400
Shall we try dating?

10
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,900
Yeah!

11
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,600
Shit!

12
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,200
What?

13
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,000
Are you alright? Why are you startled?

14
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,900
I'm not startled. It's hot.

15
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,700
I'll turn up the AC.

16
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,400
Let me go already!

17
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,700
Let me turn up the AC!

18
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,530
-It's easier to let me go.
-I told you I'd turn it up.

19
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,900
I'll go take a shower.

20
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,030
- Let's shower together.
- No need!

21
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,500
Go shower together!

22
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,930
Who the hell showers together?

23
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,100
People who are dating.

24
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,100
But, but the bathroom is small.

25
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,200
But you just did it with Ohm.

26
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,500
How do you know that?

27
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,700
I just know it.

28
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,030
But Ohm is just a friend.

29
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,600
What about me?

30
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,530
Well, you're not just a friend.

31
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,630
I'll go take a shower now.

32
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,900
Nong Phun!

33
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,700
Isn't it too hot to be driving at this hour?

34
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,500
Hello, ma'am!

35
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,600
Phi Noh!

36
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,300
Nong Pang, hold Phi Noh gently, okay?

37
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,900
Are you jealous?

38
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,900
Well, you told me to take good care of him, right?

39
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,800
Nong Phun!

40
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,400
Nong Noh!

41
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:11,100
Hello, you came here so early today.

42
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:14,100
Have you eaten yet? Are you hungry?

43
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,700
Aunt Noi?

44
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,600
We have food for the kids, right?

45
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,500
All set, ma’am.

46
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,300
You're so sweet!

47
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,500
Let's go get something to eat.

48
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:26,000
-Aunt Noi has prepared it already.
-Yes, ma'am.

49
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:27,000
Okay, Nong Noh?

50
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,300
Nong Noh!

51
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,500
I'm the one who imported this.

52
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,100
Jus try it.

53
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,000
Okay, ma'am.

54
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,330
The meat is like jelly!

55
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,200
Nong Noh!

56
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,300
When Phun visits your house,

57
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,200
I feel considerate of you.

58
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,930
Is it a bother?

59
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,600
Not at all.

60
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,100
Really?

61
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:21,700
My mom actually loves having people over.

62
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,300
Oh, that’s nice!

63
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,200
It's not a bother, Mom.

64
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,730
Phun and Noh are super close.

65
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,000
How do you know?

66
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,000
I'm their number one fan!

67
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,700
Nong Phun, where are you off to?

68
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,630
Look how handsome you look today.

69
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,100
Going to the movies with Noh, Mom. I’ll be back this evening.

70
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:55,600
Alright, I’ll let your dad know.

71
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,100
What the hell are you wearing?

72
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,800
Look at me!

73
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,600
It's dark in the cinema, no one will see.

74
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,500
It’s dark?

75
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,400
And you took forever to get dressed.

76
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,300
I took a bit of time.

77
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,200
It’s our first date.

78
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,000
See you, ma'am

79
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,299
-See you later, ma'am.
-Take care of him, please!

80
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,500
These grapes are great, ma'am.

81
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:41,530
He's cute, isn't he?

82
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,100
Here, this one.

83
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,430
Do you want some, Noh?

84
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,600
Not really, just don’t know what else to eat.

85
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,700
I’m starving today.

86
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,000
Hello, can I interview you for some content?

87
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,200
Maybe later, I'm here with my b...

88
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,200
Oh, we can interview you both.

89
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,500
It won't take more than 5 minutes.

90
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,600
We come from the Hug Club channel.

91
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,100
Sorry, still can’t.

92
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,600
-I'm sorry.
-Alright, no problem!

93
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,500
Didn’t you say we’re just watching a movie?

94
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,500
Look at what I’m wearing!

95
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:33,230
It’s our date, we should come somewhere nice, right?

96
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,800
Stop exaggerating!

97
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,800
No, I'm not.

98
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:40,330
Let’s go.

99
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,700
-Quick!
-Can we not hold hands outside?

100
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:54,870
Fine.

101
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,100
Don’t tear it, okay?

102
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,370
We can keep it as a memory of our first movie date.

103
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,400
If we don’t tear it, who’ll keep it?

104
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:30,730
You can keep it.

105
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,300
I'll go to see it often.

106
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,500
Thanks for coming with me.

107
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,930
So, what do you wanna eat?

108
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,400
I’ll go along with you.

109
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,700
Are you sure?

110
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,770
Want some red sausages?

111
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,200
Why not? They’re good.

112
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,400
Can you feed me one!

113
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,400
Shit! My hand, my hand!

114
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,400
Noh, you gonna eat again?

115
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,100
[Noh] Yeah, I wanna eat.

116
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,400
[Phun] I'm full already.

117
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,230
What are you doing here?

118
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,600
Playing soccer, I guess.

119
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,930
Cut the crap, seriously

120
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,370
I have tutoring.

121
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,670
Eh, let me see.

122
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:52,900
Damn!

123
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,100
Are you such a jerk, studying with ninth graders or what?

124
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,970
Hello, Phi Noh!

125
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,770
Wow, Mick, you’re so hardworking.

126
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:46,800
You stayed up late last night and still showed up today.

127
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,270
-Ohm called to wake me up.
-Stop, Mick!

128
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,400
Dude, are you playing the babysitter role?

129
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,330
Or is it more like…

130
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:56,900
Shut up! Don't bring me up only.

131
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,500
What about you and Phun?

132
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,400
You guys have been way too close.

133
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:01,800
What’s up with you two?

134
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,370
Noh and I...

135
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:04,070
Friends!!

136
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,100
We’re friends.

137
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,630
What’s so weird about it?

138
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,530
He stayed at my place last night, and we came together.

139
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,900
And you and Mick?

140
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,400
What’s up with you two?

141
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,870
He’s like my little brother.

142
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,400
Well,

143
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,500
I was just hungry,

144
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,130
so I came out to grab something to eat.

145
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:29,700
That’s all.

146
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,800
Was the movie fun?

147
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,600
I thought it was awesome!

148
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,600
There'll be another episode for sure.

149
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:07,200
But that one looks good, the one with the red and yellow poster.

150
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,430
Phun!

151
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:12,900
Phun!

152
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,570
What’s up with you?

153
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,400
Phi Noh!

154
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,400
What's up?

155
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,100
In the middle of the mall, huh?

156
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,600
Why? We can do whatever we want.

157
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:32,270
Per!

158
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:37,100
Why do we have to be shy? We are a couple.

159
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:39,630
You're such a badass.

160
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:41,670
Don't be shy!

161
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:43,600
Per, just stop it.

162
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,600
Win, you’re pretty lucky.

163
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,600
A guy like him is rare.

164
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,670
Even I’m jealous.

165
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:55,300
Why would you?

166
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,500
I used to be a real asshole.

167
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,200
But I think...

168
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,200
having a boyfriend like Phun...

169
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,830
would be better, right?

170
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,000
Right, Phi Noh?

171
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,700
How would I know?

172
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,400
I don’t think this is gonna work.

173
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,030
But it’s their problem, right?

174
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:27,500
No, dude, they’re both my friends.

175
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,300
I don’t want things to end up like that.

176
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,000
But I think if...

177
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,300
Pla doesn't apologize to Keng,

178
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,870
how's Keng ever gonna get over it?

179
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:37,730
[Everyone] Yeah, right.

180
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,700
Are you guys actually stressed,

181
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,800
or did you just come here to play games?

182
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,000
Dumbass, you even have to ask?

183
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,400
Look, I lost now.

184
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,000
It's mine.

185
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:01,830
Why the hell did you set an alarm for Sunday at noon?

186
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:04,030
I set it to remind Ngor to take his meds.

187
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,500
I'll be right back.

188
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:14,230
What the hell is this?

189
00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:15,329
I’m so confused.

190
00:17:15,329 --> 00:17:17,030
Yeah, me too. I think they're something.

191
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:20,300
-What's up with them?
-Why he has to set the alarm to take the meds?

192
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,170
Oh, I think it's normal.

193
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:23,930
-You do that?
-Yeah!

194
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:28,230
How many times have I reminded you not to be late?

195
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,100
Squat jump!

196
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:32,500
Get started!

197
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:37,630
Naphat!

198
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:39,930
Yeah?

199
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:41,430
Come here!

200
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:45,130
What time is it now?

201
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:49,330
30 minutes late.

202
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:51,030
That’s 30 times.

203
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:52,830
But it’s hot out here.

204
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:53,730
Complaining?

205
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:56,130
Fine, make it 35.

206
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:57,130
Do it!

207
00:17:58,230 --> 00:17:59,030
Do it?

208
00:17:59,130 --> 00:17:59,930
Yes!

209
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:01,430
Can you show me how it’s done?

210
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:02,830
Hands behind your back,

211
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:05,830
then switch your legs.

212
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:08,130
Count 1, count 2, count 3...

213
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:09,430
Along with your friends.

214
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:12,530
Alright, let’s start.

215
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:23,000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5...8, 9.

216
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:28,730
Sir,

217
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:31,530
could you sign right here? Over here.

218
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:38,630
Oh, there’s another page.

219
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:40,530
-Another page?
-Yes, sir.

220
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:42,530
Why are there so many?

221
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,130
There's more...

222
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:47,130
Here too...

223
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:49,530
-Yes, sir. Here too...
-Right here?

224
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:50,430
Yes, sir! Here too.

225
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:56,230
Hey, where'd everyone go?

226
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:58,230
There's another one here, sir.

227
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:05,830
Got punished?

228
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:07,530
Of course!

229
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:09,930
Keng!

230
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:12,670
Can I take your homework to the boys in Class 4?

231
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,930
They kind of want it.

232
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:15,570
Sure, whoever wants some can have it.

233
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:17,470
Better than giving it to someone who doesn’t care.

234
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:51,670
Good morning, everyone.

235
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:56,230
[Everyone] Good morning.

236
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:00,930
Open your books to the chapter we left off on last time.

237
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:03,430
So, what's up with you and Phun?

238
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,030
How about you and Mick?

239
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:07,730
Want to answer together?

240
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:10,500
1...

241
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,070
2...

242
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:13,830
3...

243
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:15,630
Naphat, Passakorn!

244
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:18,500
If you're not going to study, come to the front of the class.

245
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,100
[Ohm] I'll study, ma'am.

246
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:35,530
Naphat, Passakorn!

247
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:37,270
Get out now.

248
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:40,830
I tried to warn you guys,

249
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,630
but it was too late.

250
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:44,830
See? Don't mess with Pacharee's power.

251
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:56,730
Aren’t those Keng’s summary sheets?

252
00:20:57,330 --> 00:21:00,430
Yeah, his sheets are super popular now.

253
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:03,430
I bet he’ll be tutoring on the sport court soon.

254
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:12,630
Noh!

255
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:14,730
That kid's doing that again.

256
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:17,130
When will he stop volunteering for everything?

257
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:18,730
I don’t know.

258
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:25,330
See? I told you they’re dating.

259
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:26,930
-Really?
-Yeah!

260
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:28,230
Who agrees with me?

261
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:31,330
-Maybe they’re not.
-I'm sure they are.

262
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:40,170
That's right, Noh?

263
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,830
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

264
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,170
Why are you standing up?

265
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:52,930
Ngor!

266
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:55,030
Let me help you.

267
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,300
Who’s making you do this again?

268
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,300
How many times have I told you to start saying no.

269
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,300
No one, I wanted to do it myself.

270
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,300
I just want to help others.

271
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,700
Because I can't do much else.

272
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:18,430
So this is something I can do.

273
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:22,330
A smart guy like you probably wouldn't understand.

274
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:26,330
I probably don't understand.

275
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:32,530
But I want to, okay?

276
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:37,030
Do you want to date me?

277
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:39,030
Huh?

278
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:03,130
Miss!

279
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:15,230
Phun!

280
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:18,770
Thanks for this morning.

281
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:20,430
No problem.

282
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:22,130
Did you go the class on time?

283
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:24,530
Well,

284
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:25,830
nearly on time.

285
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:27,700
That's good.

286
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:29,570
Next time, come early,

287
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:31,170
so you don’t get punished.

288
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:33,030
It’s been so hot lately too.

289
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:41,330
Then call me to wake me up!

290
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:47,300
I'll call you tomorrow.

291
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:54,530
Ouch!

292
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:57,530
What happened?

293
00:23:58,030 --> 00:23:58,830
Shit.

294
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:00,730
It’s probably ants.

295
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:03,530
-Don’t scratch it, you’ll make it worse.
-But it itches!

296
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:06,230
You’ve gotta rub it gently, like this.

297
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:15,830
Feeling better?

298
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:29,770
Oh hey!

299
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:37,530
You eaten yet?

300
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:39,330
I’m eating now.

301
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:41,230
And I’ve already eaten before.

302
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:44,530
I’m off to find somewhere to nap.

303
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:48,630
Yeah, go ahead...

304
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:50,530
Go ahead...

305
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:16,530
Go to the nurse's office.

306
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:19,270
So others won't see you with me.

307
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:23,300
Phun!

308
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:58,930
[Someone] Sorry, I can't find the instrument.

309
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:01,930
What's the hell wrong with all of you?

310
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,030
Well,

311
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:07,270
I couldn't find the item.

312
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:26,770
You? What's the hell wrong?

313
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:31,870
Everyone's looking for their practice equipment, and you..

314
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:52,730
Sorry, man.

315
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:02,130
Alright, go. Keep looking, all of you.

316
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:06,530
Let's go.

317
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:22,530
What’s up with you today?

318
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:24,870
You're acting weird.

319
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:28,030
Here, let me help you.

320
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:29,330
No, it's okay.

321
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:30,530
[Ohm] It's heavy

322
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:33,130
-It's not heavy.
-I said it's heavy, so it's heavy.

323
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:34,630
Let's go!

324
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:40,330
Look at him.

325
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:43,170
Hard to stay mad at him, right?

326
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:46,600
At least he takes care of people.

327
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:49,670
Did he tell you what’s going on between them?

328
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:57,870
One good thing about him...

329
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:00,630
even though he's stubborn,

330
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:03,070
at least he expresses himself.

331
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:07,370
Better than the silent type

332
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:09,530
and did nothing.

333
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:13,470
Anyone who dates that type—

334
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:15,330
Total bad luck, man.

335
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:24,600
So, who are you gonna date...

336
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:27,470
none of us are bothered.

337
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:30,500
If you keep hiding,

338
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:34,530
you’ll regret it later.

339
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:38,830
Ouch!

340
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:41,000
I'll help them find their stuff, okay?

341
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:44,030
Okay.

342
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:52,130
Noh!

343
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:56,870
Noh!

344
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:11,330
When’d you get here?

345
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:14,200
Been here a while.

346
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:16,230
I called, but you didn’t hear.

347
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:21,030
What about the leave form?

348
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:23,530
What leave form?

349
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:27,430
Film tell me to get it from you.

350
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:30,070
He's taking the kids to a competition for a week.

351
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:34,530
I haven't done it yet.

352
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:38,470
If I finish it, I'll give it to you.

353
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:52,530
Then just bring it to the student council room.

354
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:05,400
What’s next for you?

355
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:08,030
Nothing.

356
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:10,030
Then stay.

357
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:11,630
It’s cool in here.

358
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:13,930
The council room’s cool too.

359
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:21,670
I have snacks.

360
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:24,530
And Noh's here too.

361
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:30,930
Don't do that.

362
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:33,400
People might get it wrong.

363
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:36,530
Wrong about what?

364
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:39,330
Well,

365
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:41,930
that we're a couple.

366
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:45,630
But aren’t we?

367
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:50,070
Seems like someone here doesn’t want to be.

368
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:52,300
Maybe he's shy.

369
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:54,930
Shy about what?

370
00:31:58,130 --> 00:31:59,470
My boyfriend is this handsome!

371
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:06,630
I'm sorry.

372
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:10,230
I’m not shy.

373
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:14,170
Just not used to it. You got it?

374
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:20,430
Got it!

375
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:24,030
-But still don't understand.
-Oh!

376
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:27,730
I'm not used to it too.

377
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:29,930
But I love you.

378
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:33,930
I could tell the whole world I love you.

379
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:36,930
Then, why?

380
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:38,730
So,

381
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:41,030
you've been dating me...

382
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:43,370
were you forced?

383
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:46,670
If you're not okay, then...

384
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:47,730
It's not that!

385
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:53,770
I’m really fine.

386
00:32:57,530 --> 00:32:58,330
I'm just...

387
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:01,530
scared of being teased by my friends.

388
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:07,030
But I’ll try.

389
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:30,130
Actually, it's fine.

390
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:36,730
I’m happy just being like this.

391
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:43,830

What kind of person you like?

410
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:37,870
If there ever is someone,

411
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:40,230
you have to tell me first, okay?

412
00:35:55,130 --> 00:35:56,430
Tomorrow I'll tell Yuri...

413
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:01,800
about us.

414
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:31,230
Noh!

415
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:33,030
Have you been waiting long?

416
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:35,030
I rushed right out!

417
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:37,130
Actually, I wanted to leave since morning.

418
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:38,670
Calm down!

419
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:39,830
How can I calm down?

420
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:42,430
It’s the first time you’ve ever asked me out.

421
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:44,430
So, what do you need me to do?

422
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:45,830
I can do anything!

423
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:48,870
Shopping, carrying stuff, taking pics...

424
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:51,030
even waiting in line for Momo. I’m up for it all!

425
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:52,030
Tell me, already.

426
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:53,930
Nope, it's not like that.

427
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:57,170
Then why ask me out?

428
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:15,730
I just wanted to...

429
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:18,930
You wanted to see me?

430
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:23,830
So, let's walk in the mall until it's closed

431
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:25,330
Let's go.

432
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:37,370
Noh, does this look good?

433
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:39,330
Noh!

434
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:42,430
Looks good?

435
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:45,230
Yeah, it does.

436
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:00,800
Here, it's super cute.

437
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:03,170
Red’s adorable.

438
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:05,370
Or should I go orange?

439
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:17,330
Let's stick it.

440
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:29,800
Noh, isn’t that Phun?

441
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:33,830
Yeah.

442
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:35,700
Let’s say hi.

443
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:40,330
Phun!

444
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:46,130
Yuri, Noh!

445
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:50,230
Who’re you waiting for?

446
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:52,330
Oh, yeah.

447
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:54,570
I'm just working on homework.

448
00:38:57,630 --> 00:38:59,830
But I gotta go now.

449
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:02,100
See you later.

450
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:39,470
[Phun] Text me when you're finished.

451
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,700
Do you think he's waiting for his new girlfriend?

452
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:49,870
Then why?

453
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:52,670
I guess...

454
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:54,070
He broke up with Aim

455
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:55,670
because he had someone new.

456
00:39:58,130 --> 00:40:00,630
Now I'm dying to know who is better than my friend.

457
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:10,430
It's okay.

458
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:11,600
Calm down!

459
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:28,170
Noh, you know what?

460
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:30,830
You’re super cute today.

461
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:35,870
Can’t I be handsome?

462
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:38,570
You’re handsome every day.

463
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:42,930
But today you’re cute and so kind.

464
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:48,170
Let’s do this.

465
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:49,670
After we eat, let’s take some photos.

466
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:52,300
I wanna remember today.

467
00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:53,930
Deal!

468
00:40:55,730 --> 00:40:57,330
Can I order food, please?

469
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:14,830
Look at your face—so funny!

470
00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:16,370
Yu!

471
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:18,030
-But this one’s handsome.
-Yu!

472
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:20,830
I'm going to cut it and put it in my phone case.

473
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:23,730
Don't lose it, or I'll drag you back here

474
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:24,830
Yu!

475
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:29,130
What’s up?

476
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:36,330
I’m sorry.

477
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:41,570
Sorry?

478
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:47,130
What for?

479
00:41:56,530 --> 00:41:58,300
Do you already have someone else?

480
00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:10,400
Is she Jeed?

481
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:21,300
And who’s that?

482
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,000
Can we still be friends?

483
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,500
Can’t you really tell me who?

484
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:54,530
Thanks for telling me.

485
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,930
I hope you’re happy with that person.

486
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:05,630
Thank you...

487
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,330
for making me happy all this time.

488
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:14,230
I love you, Noh!

489
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:31,170
Will we see each other again?

490
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:39,400
Of course.

491
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:44,900
I'm still your best friend, Noh!

492
00:44:29,430 --> 00:44:32,430
[Noh] Thank you for waiting.

493
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:35,700
[Noh] But let me stay alone tonight.

494
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:52,100
Per, I got six answers right today!

495
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:55,100
-Nice!
-Any rewards?

496
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:57,970
What kind of reward?

497
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,400
-I was kidding.
-Not that!

498
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:06,000
Like, going out, treating me to snacks, something like that.

499
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,000
That's childish.

500
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:16,500
Wanna go somewhere?

501
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:18,530
You wanna go out?

502
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:20,900
Honestly...

503
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,400
anywhere’s fine.

504
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:24,600
As long as it’s with you.

505
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:26,400
So...

506
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,370
How about the street corner?

507
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,800
Actually, that is as far as I can go.

508
00:45:37,730 --> 00:45:39,000
That's sad.

509
00:45:43,530 --> 00:45:44,600
Should we run away?

510
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:49,970
For real?

511
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:00,700
But give me 10 more years.

512
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,830
That's ridiculous.

513
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:09,500
Mosquito bite?

514
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:14,130
Is your dad almost here?

515
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:17,030
Don't know.

516
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:20,100
Go inside, lots of mosquitos now.

517
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,330
Hey, wait a minute.

518
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:27,700
You’re sweating.

519
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:30,200
-Right here!
-Eh!

520
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:32,770
-No, I'm just looking.
--Don't touch, or I'll get pimples.

521
00:46:32,870 --> 00:46:34,430
No way, my hands are clean.

522
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,270
What the hell are you doing?!

523
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:38,300
Dad!

524
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,300
-Good afternoon, sir!
-I told you to study,

525
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,370
-What are you doing?
-Nothing, I just had to...

526
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:46,900
Don’t lie. I know all about you.

527
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:51,800
Someone told me they saw you holding hands today.

528
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:55,970
What’s your excuse now?

529
00:47:00,270 --> 00:47:01,600
And you—

530
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:03,630
I should've known it would be like this.

531
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:11,070
Spending all day with him.

532
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:14,300
Acting like a jerk like this, you need to be taught.

533
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,130
Dad, don't!

534
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,030
There's a camera there!

535
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:36,200
Mr. Yung, I am very sorry.

536
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:39,400
Win and I are really dating,

537
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:43,200
but we’ve never done anything wrong.

538
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:46,000
- Don’t blame Win.
- Don't you dare to lecture me!

539
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:48,900
He's my son. I can do whatever I want.

540
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:53,600
I order you...

541
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:55,800
to break up with him right now!

542
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:58,100
-Don't let me see you together again!
-Dad!

543
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:00,800
Go home.

544
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:03,600
Win.

545
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:07,300
Dad, calm down!

546
00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:53,230
Noh, is it cute?

547
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:55,830
-I bought this one for you.
-Can I hug you?

548
00:48:56,830 --> 00:48:58,330
As a friend.

549
00:49:11,430 --> 00:49:13,770
You really can't tell me who that is?

550
00:49:24,830 --> 00:49:29,830
[Rod-Keng] I can’t find the question 3. Anyone got it?
[Keng] Skip it. You don't need to do it.

551
00:49:40,170 --> 00:49:43,170
[Rod-Keng] Hey, I saw Noh chick earlier at Siam.

552
00:49:49,270 --> 00:49:50,900
[Noh] Who?

553
00:49:54,700 --> 00:50:02,470
[Rod-Keng] Yuri, from the convent school. I was going to talk to her, but she didn't look at me and ran to the cab.

554
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,930
[Khom] She’s scared of you.

555
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:38,900
Noh!

556
00:50:41,530 --> 00:50:42,330
Come in, Mom.

557
00:50:43,730 --> 00:50:44,870
The door's not locked.

558
00:50:55,930 --> 00:50:57,170
Phun brought this for you.

559
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:08,230
Where's he now?

560
00:51:08,330 --> 00:51:10,930
He left, just stopped by for a bit.

561
00:51:28,130 --> 00:51:30,270
Don’t forget to brush your teeth, okay?

562
00:51:36,530 --> 00:51:38,770
And don’t stay up late! Got it?

563
00:52:07,130 --> 00:52:08,200
Get some rest, son.

564
00:52:08,530 --> 00:52:10,330
Mom's right here.

565
00:52:15,230 --> 00:52:16,270
Goodnight!

566
00:52:57,930 --> 00:53:04,170
[Magic snacks—eat them and have sweet dreams :)
Noh, you’ve done your best. Smile tomorrow, okay? :)]

567
00:53:54,070 --> 00:53:56,670
Whoa, isn’t this a Friday kid?

568
00:53:57,270 --> 00:53:58,470
Rich, huh?

569
00:53:59,170 --> 00:54:00,870
Nice pin you’ve got, huh?

570
00:54:01,170 --> 00:54:02,570
Can I have it?

571
00:54:20,070 --> 00:54:20,870
Phun!

572
00:54:21,870 --> 00:54:23,770
Which of these two pairs are cool?

573
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,300
I thought you had chosen that one.

574
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:29,270
Yeah, but now this pair’s tempting too.

575
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:32,230
What do you think?

576
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:33,670
Which pair is easier to wear?

577
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:39,700
Nah.

578
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:41,400
You picked the other one already,

579
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:43,300
Don’t change your mind now.

580
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:46,900
You changed your necklace though.

581
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,700
You bought it and returned it to the store.

582
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:51,400
I didn’t say a word.

583
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:56,300
Take this pair

584
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:57,800
I choose for you

585
00:54:58,400 --> 00:54:59,200
Done!

586
00:55:15,930 --> 00:55:17,170
What’s the teacher carrying?

587
00:55:18,130 --> 00:55:18,930
Go help him!

588
00:55:21,530 --> 00:55:22,570
Let's go, Phun!

589
00:55:49,170 --> 00:55:49,970
Phi Noh!

590
00:55:50,470 --> 00:55:51,600
Where's your pin?

591
00:55:52,370 --> 00:55:53,830
Did someone steal it?

592
00:55:58,770 --> 00:55:59,970
You got another one?

593
00:56:03,830 --> 00:56:04,630
Take mine!

594
00:56:08,170 --> 00:56:09,070
Thank  you!

595
00:56:09,870 --> 00:56:10,970
Guys, let's go!

596
00:56:11,270 --> 00:56:13,670
Let's take a stroll.

597
00:56:23,570 --> 00:56:25,470
But I read it, it's so confusing, so bad.

598
00:56:26,170 --> 00:56:27,170
What do you expect from Class 5?

599
00:56:27,170 --> 00:56:28,370
The bottom-ranked in science program.

600
00:56:28,470 --> 00:56:30,070
They even dare to summarize it for us.

601
00:56:30,070 --> 00:56:30,870
And look,

602
00:56:31,070 --> 00:56:34,770
There are cartoon, cloud, star pictures...

603
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,300
Damn, I thought it was an elementary school.

604
00:56:36,570 --> 00:56:37,530
So funny!

605
00:56:37,770 --> 00:56:39,670
Eh, you can’t understand my friend’s notes...

606
00:56:39,670 --> 00:56:41,400
Is it the notes, or are you just dumb?

607
00:56:41,570 --> 00:56:42,530
Hey what?

608
00:56:42,670 --> 00:56:44,170
My friend stayed up all night...

609
00:56:44,270 --> 00:56:45,330
making those for us.

610
00:56:45,470 --> 00:56:47,270
And you guys haven't done shit, just complaining.

611
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:49,670
If you're so smart, why are you even reading my friend's notes?

612
00:56:50,770 --> 00:56:51,970
I might be dumb,

613
00:56:52,370 --> 00:56:53,470
but my friend is smart.

614
00:56:53,770 --> 00:56:54,770
He could do it,

615
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:56,470
or not do it.

616
00:56:56,970 --> 00:56:58,170
But he did.

617
00:56:58,830 --> 00:57:00,570
You should be kissing his feet in thanks!

618
00:57:00,630 --> 00:57:01,470
You think you’re cool?

619
00:57:01,470 --> 00:57:02,770
Yeah, pretty cool.

620
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:05,970
My friend's a black belt in Taekwondo, you know.

621
00:57:07,070 --> 00:57:09,370
-I'll get back at you later.
-Don't forget it.

622
00:57:19,230 --> 00:57:20,270
Thanks, man.

623
00:57:25,030 --> 00:57:28,130
Yeah, sorry I was rude earlier.

624
00:57:29,130 --> 00:57:29,930
It's okay.

625
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:31,930
But what you said was correct

626
00:57:33,130 --> 00:57:35,130
Everyone's doing it for me.

627
00:57:35,730 --> 00:57:36,630
Sorry, man.

628
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:40,300
You're wrong.

629
00:57:40,830 --> 00:57:43,230
We only read them ‘cause we want good grades.

630
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:44,870
-Right?
-Yeah!

631
00:57:45,930 --> 00:57:48,630
You guys, wanna go eat meatballs? My treat.

632
00:57:49,330 --> 00:57:50,530
A treat for what?

633
00:57:51,130 --> 00:57:52,830
Because Keng and Palm made up?

634
00:57:53,030 --> 00:57:54,430
Yeah, and...

635
00:57:55,230 --> 00:57:56,230
I'm now in a relationship.

636
00:57:56,330 --> 00:58:00,230
-Huh, who's that?
-Let's go!

637
00:58:13,230 --> 00:58:15,130
Did you eat the snacks I gave you last night?

638
00:58:16,330 --> 00:58:17,530
Yeah, I did.

639
00:58:18,630 --> 00:58:19,430
Thank you.

640
00:58:22,330 --> 00:58:23,130
Noh!

641
00:58:23,430 --> 00:58:25,130
Don’t forget to submit your leave form today.

642
00:58:25,230 --> 00:58:27,100
Or the teacher won’t sign it, and you can’t compete.

643
00:58:27,530 --> 00:58:29,100
That's right.

644
00:58:33,130 --> 00:58:36,130
[Noh] Could you do it please?

645
00:58:40,930 --> 00:58:43,030
Good thing we’re free this afternoon.

646
00:58:43,530 --> 00:58:45,330
Even if we weren’t, we’d have to skip class.

647
00:58:45,430 --> 00:58:47,230
All the seniors are off taking exams.

648
00:58:47,630 --> 00:58:49,130
True, true.

649
00:58:51,830 --> 00:58:54,030
Is Win not coming today?

650
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:08,430
Is he sick?

651
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:19,400
I have no idea.

652
00:59:21,170 --> 00:59:23,070
You have no idea what's going on with Win?

653
00:59:26,070 --> 00:59:28,370
From now on, I might not know much about him anymore.

654
00:59:35,070 --> 00:59:35,870
Do you think...

655
00:59:36,870 --> 00:59:37,670
people...

656
00:59:39,370 --> 00:59:40,870
have the right to love anyone?

657
00:59:44,870 --> 00:59:45,670
Or are there...

658
00:59:48,270 --> 00:59:50,070
some people we’re just not allowed to love?

659
00:59:55,370 --> 00:59:57,470
So, can you stop your own feelings?

660
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:01,700
I can't.

661
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:05,100
That means you can love.

662
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:09,800
But what do you do after you love?

663
01:00:13,470 --> 01:00:15,000
Just do what you can.

664
01:00:32,070 --> 01:00:33,330
Knot!

665
01:00:35,270 --> 01:00:36,700
Why do you seem to know so much?

666
01:00:37,970 --> 01:00:40,170
Are you secretly crushing on someone?

667
01:01:46,730 --> 01:01:47,930
Very good, my dear.

668
01:01:47,930 --> 01:01:49,030
Passed on the first try!

669
01:01:49,330 --> 01:01:51,430
-Much better than Noh!
-Hold on!

670
01:01:51,830 --> 01:01:52,600
Thanks two of you,

671
01:01:53,130 --> 01:01:54,430
otherwise our club wouldn't be able to compete.

672
01:01:54,930 --> 01:01:56,630
-Because, Noh has forgotten.
-Oh, wait!

673
01:01:56,830 --> 01:01:59,470
I think we should treat them to show our thanks.

674
01:01:59,830 --> 01:02:01,130
[Everyone] Yeah, good idea!

675
01:02:01,330 --> 01:02:04,130
How about a hot pot at Knot house? It's the best option.

676
01:02:04,530 --> 01:02:06,730
Hey hey hey, don't! I beg you.

677
01:02:06,970 --> 01:02:08,800
I already prepared karaoke!

678
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:11,230
With all due respect, do it in your bathroom!

679
01:02:12,930 --> 01:02:13,930
You guys are enough.

680
01:02:14,330 --> 01:02:16,830
Don't be lazy. It's time to practice.

681
01:02:24,730 --> 01:02:26,200
Noh, can you sweep the floor?

682
01:04:08,470 --> 01:04:09,930
Finally done.

683
01:04:10,370 --> 01:04:12,670
Why are you here?  Something up?

684
01:04:14,570 --> 01:04:15,570
Nope.

685
01:04:16,670 --> 01:04:18,370
Just stopped by.

686
01:04:20,570 --> 01:04:22,130
Anything you want to tell me?

687
01:04:37,870 --> 01:04:39,330
I told Yuri already.

688
01:04:48,370 --> 01:04:49,530
But she cried.

689
01:04:55,170 --> 01:04:56,730
I don't want to see her cry.

690
01:05:04,670 --> 01:05:06,130
So what are you gonna do?

691
01:05:12,370 --> 01:05:13,670
Do what?

692
01:05:20,070 --> 01:05:20,870
Phun!

693
01:05:26,570 --> 01:05:27,370
Well,

694
01:05:28,770 --> 01:05:30,030
I don't know.

695
01:05:33,870 --> 01:05:35,370
I see you looking sad.

696
01:05:39,770 --> 01:05:41,770
You didn't change your mind, right?

697
01:05:47,070 --> 01:05:49,170
Eh, change what?

698
01:06:00,070 --> 01:06:01,500
I love you.

699
01:06:17,470 --> 01:06:18,370
What?

700
01:06:21,870 --> 01:06:23,370
Nothing.

701
01:06:27,670 --> 01:06:29,000
Noh!

702
01:06:36,870 --> 01:06:37,670
Thank you

703
01:06:44,770 --> 01:06:46,570
I couldn't sleep last night.

704
01:06:49,170 --> 01:06:49,970
Why?

705
01:06:51,970 --> 01:06:53,930
I was afraid you'd change your mind.

706
01:06:56,870 --> 01:06:58,270
If you chose Yuri...

707
01:06:59,770 --> 01:07:01,370
I wouldn't know what to do next.

708
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:48,000
How could I change my mind?

709
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:52,330
I feel sorry...

710
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:54,600
for making Yuri sad.

711
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:00,670
But I’m not going anywhere.

712
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:04,400
I'm still here with you.

713
01:08:08,700 --> 01:08:09,800
Can you trust me?

714
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:15,600
Yeah.

715
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,500
We'll trust each other.

716
01:10:05,270 --> 01:10:06,130
Noh!

717
01:10:08,700 --> 01:10:09,500
Noh!

718
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:23,130
You're still going to see him?

719
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:25,000
Don't you feel sorry for Aim?

720
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:26,400
Sorry for what?

721
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:28,300
Breaking up with her boyfriend?

722
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:29,900
Maybe it's because of...

723
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:32,800
that person over there.

724
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:35,430
Why can you tell everyone,

725
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:37,400
but not me?

726
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:39,800
Will you tell me nicely?

727
01:10:41,100 --> 01:10:42,230
Or will I find out by myself?

728
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:50,000
