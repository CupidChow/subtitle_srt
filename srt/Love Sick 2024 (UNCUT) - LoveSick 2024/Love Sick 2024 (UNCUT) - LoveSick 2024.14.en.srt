[English subtitles available].
Phun!

2
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:02,750
Pham!

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:05,630
It’s nothing, man.

4
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,630
Phun's just helping her study, that's all.

5
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:08,630
It's nothing.

6
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,130
Seriously, I’m fine.

00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,630
[EP14 Phun-Earn]

8
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,250
Handsome as you are,

9
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,040
don’t stay single too long!

10
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,540
Let me introduce someone...

11
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:56,420
The other day, I met a girl,

12
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,880
and she's super cute.

13
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,380
Anyway, please look after Phun.

14
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,500
Take care of him.

15
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,630
Let Phun find good love...

16
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,380
to be worthy of him being a good boy.

17
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,250
I think I don't have to teach you anymore.

18
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:48,790
You're even better than me now.

19
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,250
Mick, what the hell are you doing?

20
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:57,130
I want you to keep teaching me.

21
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,420
Do you like it when I yell at you or what?

22
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:02,130
No, I want you to be nice.

23
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:07,880
How about this...

24
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,170
Pack your stuff.

25
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:10,380
I'll take you for snacks.

26
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:11,880
Okay.

27
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:31,250
[Noh] What’s up?
Can you come over?

28
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:44,750
[Ohm] What’s wrong?

29
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,250
Let's go P'Ohm.

30
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,130
Just pack your stuff and go home today.

31
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,380
I have something urgent to do.

32
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:03,540
I'll buy you snacks some other time.

33
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,170
Hey!

34
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,290
Yo, why’d you call me?

35
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,290
Who did this to you?

36
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:58,500
I don’t even know what I’m supposed to feel.

37
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:04,630
Then break up?

38
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,250
If you don't want to break up...

39
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,250
Just talk to him.

40
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,500
When people are together...

41
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:23,670
If they don't talk...

42
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,170
It won't work out, right?

43
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:31,000
But if he really cheated on you...

44
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,040
He'll have to deal with me.

45
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:22,790
[Phun] I'm done now. Should I go find you?
Are you at the club?
Where did you go?
I'll wait at the school gate, okay?

46
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,380
He still hasn't replied to your Line?

47
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:34,540
Did you call him?

48
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:37,000
He's not answering.

49
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,630
And at the club?

50
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:42,250
He's not there.

51
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,250
Or did he already go home?

52
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:50,670
Been watching all day, didn’t see anything.

53
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:55,920
Seriously, what's going on with you two?

54
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,630
I don't know.

55
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:10,790
I think it's been normal.

56
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,420
Normal for you, but is it normal for him?

57
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,880
Or is it about Pham?

58
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,630
Why does she get involved?

59
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,630
You’re with her all the time, that’s why.

60
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,750
Well,

61
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,630
as she came alone,

62
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,000
I had to welcome her, right?

63
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:36,250
Aren't you worried that Noh will overthink it?

64
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:38,000
You said there's nothing,

65
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,500
But if your boyfriend overthinks it...

66
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,130
are you cool with that?

67
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:57,000
What should I do if he overthinks it?

68
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,500
Apologize him!

69
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,170
If apologizing doesn't work,

70
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,630
then kneel down and beg.

71
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,000
Shit, Oi!

72
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,750
You don't have to come.

73
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,250
I don't want to see you, asshole!

74
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,880
Phun, I'm going home first, alright?

75
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,290
See ya.

76
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,630
I'm in school!

77
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,380
Want to eat something?

78
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,130
I'll get fat.

79
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,630
Damn, look at you!

80
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,170
Skinny as hell.

81
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,540
If you can't handle it...

82
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,250
Call me, okay?

83
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,130
Didn't you go to the club today?

84
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:12,000
I looked for you, but you weren’t there.

85
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,040
And...

86
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,500
why you're going home so late?

87
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,040
Did you know? Our school won!

88
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,000
So your friend lost?

89
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,000
Yeah.

90
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,130
I'm surprised.

91
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:59,380
Actually, she's really good.

92
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,250
I'm going home.

93
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,290
Noh!

94
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,380
Huh?

95
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:14,750
What's wrong with you?

96
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,420
Why are you mad at me?

97
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,630
You're good at school.

98
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:20,540
But why are you so stupid?

99
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,630
Don't think I don't know about Pham.

100
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:27,630
Know about what?

101
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,250
Pham and I are friends.

102
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:32,130
Friends?

103
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:35,540
Friends can hug each other like that?

104
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,500
I told you, Pham's just a friend.

105
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,420
I really love you.

106
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,040
Oh, Phun!  You haven't left yet?

107
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,920
Not yet. How about you?

108
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:24,750
I just finished eating.

109
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:27,790
Are you feeling better?

110
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:30,420
I'm okay now.

111
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,040
Mike, this is Phun!

112
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,750
Thank you for taking care of Pham for me.

113
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,420
No problem.

114
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,500
Better luck next year!

115
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:47,750
Just one more score. I'll definitely be back next year.

116
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:50,630
We'll get going then. Bye Phun!

117
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,000
Good-bye Noh too!

118
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,290
Eh, good luck!

119
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,750
See?

120
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,380
She has a girlfriend.

121
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,290
Why are you still jealous of me?

122
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:17,750
She was upset that she lost at the time.

123
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,500
So I comforted her.

124
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,130
That's all.

125
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,420
Then why did you hug her?

126
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,380
Noh!

127
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:33,380
There's really nothing going on.

128
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:36,290
When she hugged me...

129
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:39,750
It didn't feel the same as when I hug you.

130
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:44,000
Can you trust me?

131
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:07,880
Are you alright?

132
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:09,000
You seem stressed these days.

133
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,040
I...

134
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,500
I was thinking...

135
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:42,630
Maybe we shouldn't be together.

136
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,130
Why?

137
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:01,920
Phun!

138
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,920
Think about it.

139
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:09,130
If I weren't your boyfriend...

140
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,880
you would have already told your family.

141
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,000
But if you...

142
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,130
had a girlfriend...

143
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:26,000
who was good at school...

144
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,750
you would have told your family by now, right?

145
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,880
But it's me.

146
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:45,170
Then let's go together.

147
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,670
Go where?

148
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,630
Go to make you feel better.

149
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,500
How about this?

150
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:24,880
Do you like?

151
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,420
This one's good too.

152
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,250
[Phun] Come on!

153
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:35,750
[Noh]  I can't see behind.
[Phun] Come on in!

154
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:37,920
Why'd you bring me here, dude?

155
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,790
You can come home too?

156
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:53,750
Good evening!

157
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:02,040
You're back late.

158
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:04,750
Go take a shower and sleep.

159
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,250
Dad!

160
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,130
I have a partner.

161
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,000
You're finally saying it?

162
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,130
Go on.

163
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:26,670
I want everyone to accept my choices.

164
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:28,750
Both about the student council...

165
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,500
and my partner.

166
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,380
You chose for yourself...

167
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:38,540
Did you think it well?

168
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:41,750
I've thought about it carefully.

169
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:43,920
This person's stubborn...

170
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:46,750
Hard-headed, silly, and quick to anger...

171
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,380
, but I'm happy when I'm with that person.

172
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:54,750
In this world...

173
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,880
I can obey you in everything.

174
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,040
But I want to ask for just one thing: to choose for myself.

175
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,670
I'll only choose this person.

176
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:11,500
At your age...

177
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:16,500
You don't know what it's like to regret...

178
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:19,670
making the wrong choice.

179
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:23,250
Can you handle it?

180
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,170
I don't know what the future holds.

181
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:29,250
But if I don't choose this person now, I'll definitely regret it.

182
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:37,750
Are you sure?

183
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:40,790
I'm sure.

184
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:46,290
Aren't you going to tell me who is that?

185
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:07,670
I'll tell you when that person's ready.

186
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,880
Suit yourself.

187
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:17,670
You're grown up now. Think for yourself.

188
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:22,130
Don’t come crying later that you don’t want to stay here anymore.

189
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:33,420
I love you the most!

190
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,420
Love Mom too!

191
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,250
Love Pang too!

192
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:42,000
I promise I'll be even better!

193
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,420
That's enough, Phun!

194
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,750
You're already good enough.

195
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,540
Next time, if you have anything...

196
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:50,670
Just tell dad and me...

197
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:52,500
Don't keep it to yourself, okay?

198
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:56,880
You don’t have to be the perfect kid all the time.

199
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,380
Just be happy. That’s enough.

200
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:05,630
Alright then, I’ll be less “perfect.”

201
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,130
There might be nothing left!

202
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:16,880
Noh!

203
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,630
Yes.

204
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,630
Staying here tonight?

205
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,500
Noh is sleeping with me tonight.

206
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:46,380
What I said about choosing a good person...

207
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,750
It doesn't have to be a girl.

208
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:05,380
Go on, it's late.

209
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:07,920
Go take a shower, do your homework, and go to bed.

210
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:11,500
I'll definitely do my homework...

211
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,000
Let's go!

212
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:55,500
Why didn't you tell me first before doing this?

213
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Is it okay?

214
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,500
Do you know how much I love you?

215
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,380
Stop overthinking.

216
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:28,290
And when you're ready, you can tell Dad with me.

217
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:31,500
Oh, I can't...

218
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,880
But you've thought this through, right?

219
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,630
You still don't trust me?

220
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:42,040
Can I get a reward?

221
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,250
What reward?

222
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:04,420
Can I?

223
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:08,750
Damn!

224
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:11,380
Do whatever you want. Don't ask.

225
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:00,380
I totally forgot...

226
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:02,380
I promised Keng to do my physics homework.

227
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:03,790
I'm late now.

228
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:14,170
Noh!

229
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,500
Really.

230
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,630
Your dad told you to do your homework,

231
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
so I thought about it.

232
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:30,670
Don't do homework with others.

233
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,380
Only with me.

234
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:39,290
Give me here.

235
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:08,630
Stop it! Stop!

236
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,130
[3 days to the final. Fighting for 70%!]

237
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:22,540
[Club use suspended during exams.]

238
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,040
A man finds that...

239
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:28,130
It's faster to hear a shark in water than in air by 1.8 seconds.

240
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:32,000
The question is, how many meters away is the shark from him?

241
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,920
Why calculate? Just flee!

242
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:36,500
Right!

243
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:39,130
Do sharks even roar?

244
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:40,130
What does it sound like?

245
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:41,130
Blub Blub!

246
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:42,790
Shut up!

247
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:45,130
Hey, I saw it on TikTok!

248
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,540
The answer to this one is 800.

249
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:51,750
How can you hear it from 800?

250
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,130
Maybe 400?

251
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:56,130
[Everyone] 800! 800! 800!

252
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,500
What are you guys doing?

253
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:42,920
How was it?

254
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:45,000
Can everyone do it?

255
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,630
Everyone, thanks to the teacher!

256
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,130
Thank you, ma'am.

257
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,750
[Today is the Pharmacy Camp!]

258
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,250
Whoa!

259
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:38,790
Look at him.

260
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:40,670
Coming early and still being dramatic.

261
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,170
It's still summer break...

262
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:44,000
And I have to wake up at 5 a.m. for this camp.

263
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:46,130
Who the hell signed me up for this?

264
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:47,290
Don't let me find out huh?

265
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:50,250
Sign here!

266
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,670
Hey, but I think...

267
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:57,880
Since we already signed up...

268
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,000
We have to put in some effort, right?

269
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:01,250
That's true

270
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:03,130
This is the pharmacy camp, man!

271
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:05,500
Come on, guys!

272
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:26,750
Here, eat this.

273
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:28,500
There is still a long way to go.

274
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:30,170
Thank you.

275
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:32,750
Why didn't you tell me...

276
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:34,250
that you were coming too?

277
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:36,880
The teacher told me to come.

278
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,000
I forgot to tell you.

279
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:40,000
But don't worry.

280
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:41,790
I'll be on my own.

281
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,170
You can do whatever you want.

282
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:56,380
What's with him?

283
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:06,540
Looks like the kid is sulking with someone.

284
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,540
Yeah, and I don't think he even realizes it.

285
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:13,040
This is gonna be fun.

286
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:16,500
By the way...

287
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,420
why does each tag have a different color?

288
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:20,250
Different team.

289
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:23,040
But Phun is on the yellow team, and you're on red.

290
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:24,790
So you're not together.

291
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:01,130
Marwin also joins?

Hello everyone!

308
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,750
Today...

309
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,880
We're going to have you...

310
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:49,000
select the leader.

311
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:50,420
And once you select them...

312
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:52,170
have them sit at the front of the line.

313
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:53,000
Okay?

314
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,630
You are the first, so you are the leader.

315
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,290
First one! First one!

316
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:00,540
You can be!

317
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:01,750
As you're already sitting there...

318
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:02,630
Yeah, you're at the front.

319
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:09,500
I'm sorry.

320
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:11,500
I'm sorry.

321
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
I'm sorry I'm late.

322
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:15,290
No problem, please have a seat.

323
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,420
Since you all come from different schools...

324
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:28,630
we're going to have you...

325
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,130
play an icebreaker game.

326
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,420
Alright everyone...

327
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:36,290
Our camp activity...

328
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:37,250
is called...

329
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:38,630
"The Hungry Ghost"!

330
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:41,630
While we're at this camp...

331
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:44,500
we can't walk around alone.

332
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,290
Especially the villagers.

333
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:48,250
Because the hungry ghost will kill you.

334
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:51,380
[Villager]

335
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:55,750
The Hungry Ghost kills the villagers by ripping off their name tags.

336
00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:01,130
But the hungry ghosts can't walk around alone either.

337
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:05,380
Because we have the Shaman to kill the hungry ghosts.

338
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:06,880
Shaman King!

339
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:10,880
And on the way back, we'll tally the scores...

340
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,880
to see which hungry ghost killed the most villagers.

341
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,170
And which Shaman killed the most hungry ghosts.

342
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,630
Enjoy, everyone! Good luck!

343
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:24,540
Okay everyone, don't forget the rules.

344
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:26,290
You can disperse now.

345
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,630
[Everyone] Copy that!

346
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:31,500
Eh, win!

347
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:33,250
How did you get here?

348
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:34,750
Does your dad know?

349
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:37,500
Yeah, he does.

350
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,250
My dad took me.

351
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:40,630
Oh!

352
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,250
Did he do anything to you?

353
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,750
No.

354
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:46,250
He didn't.

355
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,920
And I don't think he will anymore.

356
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:55,750
Why?

357
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,670
My dad'll send me to study in England.

358
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:05,500
So I asked him to see you here for the last time.

359
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,500
He said I could come, but when I go back...

360
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:14,880
he’ll send me to London right away.

361
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:22,000
It's okay.

362
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:24,500
About that...

363
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:26,000
Forget it.

364
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:31,670
We're together now.

365
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:35,130
I want to spend this time with you.

366
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:03,920
Damn, Earn, did you really pee there?

367
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:06,750
The bathroom was full, man!

368
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:09,250
What if someone sees your worm?

369
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:12,170
-Is that true?
-Yeah...

370
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,630
There you go!

371
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:28,920
-P'Ton, can I have a lot of pork?
-Yes, sure.

372
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:49,040
-Noh, do you want pork?
-Thank  you.

373
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:53,380
Look tasty here.

374
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,920
Give me back my pork!

375
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:01,630
What? Are you stingy?

376
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:03,420
This one's pumpkin!

377
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
It is also edible.

378
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:38,630
It tickles! Move!

379
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:49,750
Give me your arm.

380
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:52,130
I'll put on mosquito repellent for you.

381
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:03,000
Bleh, love makes me sick!

382
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:08,130
The couple next to me is just as sickening also!

383
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:11,790
-Which couple?
-It's you!

384
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,790
Can you carry our bags for us?

385
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:17,380
We're going to set up the room.

386
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:19,130
-See you!
-Eh, wait!

387
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:20,630
Damn!

388
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:42,880
Mick, want some snacks?

389
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:50,380
Do you even like me a bit?

390
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,040
Why are you asking?

391
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:57,790
Do you like me even half as much as you like Noh?

392
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:44,130
Jeez!

393
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,130
Whoa, are you guys laying now?

394
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:53,790
I think I'll sleep here.

395
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:55,630
I'll be here then.

396
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:57,670
Phun, yours is here.

397
00:40:58,290 --> 00:40:59,670
Why are we sleeping there?

398
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,380
The feng shui's good—I checked.

399
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,380
Come on, stay away from my friend a bit.

400
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,420
So you can miss each other more.

401
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:37,880
Then where do I sleep?

402
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:40,500
Next to Noh where you're sitting now.

403
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:42,750
Why do I have to sleep with him?

404
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:49,250
Duh, it’s all part of the plan.

405
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:53,380
This is your chance to regain that closeness away from Phun.

406
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:08,130
I know.

407
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:10,790
Know what?

408
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:14,420
I know I can’t compete with Noh.

409
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:18,040
But I won't give up. I'll keep fighting until you really like me.

410
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:24,000
-But...
-No need to say anything.

411
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:29,040
I think you should fight too.

412
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:32,290
Because you once told me...

413
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:35,750
If we like something, we should fight for it.

414
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,670
So why don't you fight?

415
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,380
And you want me to break them up?

416
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:42,380
You can't do that.

417
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:45,500
But if you can...

418
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,290
I'll give up.

419
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:50,790
Are you challenging me?

420
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:18,380
Shit!

421
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:21,750
-What?
-What are you doing?

422
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,130
Got a partner and now you’re protective, huh?

423
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:28,540
Asshole!

424
00:43:35,790 --> 00:43:37,920
Alright, if you’re all ready,

425
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,500
let’s meet at the field, alright?

426
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,000
Hurry up, guys!

427
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:44,880
Yes, sir!

428
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:48,380

Noh!

443
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:49,250
I'm sorry about what happened earlier.

444
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:52,670
I didn't mean it.

445
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:56,000
It's okay.

446
00:46:57,750 --> 00:46:59,380
It was just a game.

447
00:47:03,130 --> 00:47:04,880
Come on, let's pick teams.

448
00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:15,880
Even if you don't think anything...

449
00:47:18,250 --> 00:47:19,250
But I do.

450
00:47:21,290 --> 00:47:23,250
You know how I feel about you.

451
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:27,380
Earn!

452
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:29,250
Listen to me.

453
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:33,000
From the first day until now...

454
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:37,290
I haven't changed.

455
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:46,130
I still think of you as a friend.

456
00:47:57,170 --> 00:47:59,250
What's wrong with being friends?

457
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,380
If it was someone else...

458
00:48:05,630 --> 00:48:07,380
I'd have punched them.

459
00:48:08,290 --> 00:48:10,250
But I saw it was you, so I was chill.

460
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:21,880
No matter how many times you kiss me.

461
00:48:24,750 --> 00:48:26,250
I still think of you the same.

462
00:48:29,790 --> 00:48:30,630
Okay?

463
00:48:40,790 --> 00:48:41,630
Okay.

464
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:45,000
Okay, fine then.

465
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:37,750
Where are you going?

466
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:39,250
To shower?

467
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:13,880
Come on, guys, take a shower. It’s not cold!

468
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:20,380
-Take off your shirt!
-Nope, I won't!

469
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:26,500
-Hurry up and shower, guys! We're freezing here.
-Hurry up!

470
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:34,380
1...2...

471
00:51:35,130 --> 00:51:37,250
Go!!!

472
00:51:49,630 --> 00:51:50,750
Hey!

473
00:51:51,130 --> 00:51:53,250
What are you guys doing? No invite?

474
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:55,630
Eh, I still want more.

475
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:58,750
Noh, you're done. Let's go.

476
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:04,000
You go shower!

477
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,880
Ohm, can I shower too?

478
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,130
Go somewhere else.

479
00:52:28,290 --> 00:52:29,750
No, I'll do it here.

480
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:32,670
No, we’re all men!

481
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:35,380
I'm a man too.

482
00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:36,920
Win, go somewhere else!

483
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:38,130
Nope, showering right here.

484
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:39,540
Here's for elders.

485
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:41,750
You'd better say seniors.

486
00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:52,920
So tired!

487
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:55,500
Aim, your twerking was top-notch!

488
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:57,630
Even my Ohm can’t compete!

489
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,790
Of course I do! Wanna see it again?

490
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,630
Oh, Jeez!

491
00:53:02,250 --> 00:53:04,420
Switching from beauty queen to comedian, huh?

492
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:05,250
Yeah.

493
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:08,290
Oh, Jeed's gang isn't coming tomorrow.

494
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:10,170
Last I heard, they said they’d skip camp.

495
00:53:10,630 --> 00:53:12,250
Too bad!

496
00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:14,000
Do you feel bad?

497
00:53:14,250 --> 00:53:15,630
Then look at this.

498
00:53:16,250 --> 00:53:18,920
No, you should do it like this!

499
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:20,000
Like this?

500
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:24,290
You have to do this. Look at me.

501
00:53:25,630 --> 00:53:26,920
That's so cute.

502
00:53:49,250 --> 00:53:52,540
-Let’s go shower, shall we?
-Yeah!

503
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,670
-Earn!
-Hmm?

504
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,250
if I steal your blanket tonight,

505
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:07,500
don’t get mad, okay?

506
00:54:08,630 --> 00:54:09,750
I get cold easily.

507
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,500
I think I don't want to die yet.

508
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,750
Pete!

509
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:24,000
Let's swap places!

510
00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:26,000
Why?

511
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:30,040
Afraid someone won’t sleep tonight.

512
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:36,170
Who?

513
00:54:37,170 --> 00:54:39,500
Whatever. Switch! Switch!

514
00:54:48,670 --> 00:54:50,000
Are you a Hungry Ghost?

515
00:54:50,670 --> 00:54:51,880
I am not.

516
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:55,630
You're a Hungry Ghost?

517
00:54:55,630 --> 00:54:57,000
No, I'm not either.

518
00:55:05,290 --> 00:55:06,130
I'm turning off the lights!

519
00:55:55,750 --> 00:55:58,750
[Noh] Good night, you drama queen!

520
00:57:24,790 --> 00:57:25,630
So...

521
00:57:26,420 --> 00:57:27,750
Did Earn kiss you?

522
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,630
That wasn't really a kiss.

523
00:57:29,630 --> 00:57:30,790
It was just a game.

524
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:33,500
I want to apologize to you about Noh.

525
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:35,380
Oh, thanks.

526
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:37,290
I'm not mad at you.

527
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:41,130
Noh!

528
