Are we close now, Noh?

Ohm!

Why are you ignoring me?

What should I do, man?

Hello, sir.

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,120
Thank you, sir.

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,920
You’re here to see P'Phun, right?

15
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:37,240
Yeah!

16
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,560
Let's get in!

17
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,080
I’m sure Phun’s waiting for you.

18
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:43,960
Waiting for me?

19
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,960
Didn't you guys argue?

20
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,240
I can tell, you know.

21
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,520
Phun’s been down  since he came back from your home.

22
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:55,560
Hmm.

23
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,840
I don’t know what happened,

24
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,160
But I want you to clear things up...

25
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,040
Just talk things out slowly.

26
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,520
I'm sure P'Phun has feelings for you.

27
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,200
Feelings for me?

28
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,440
Yes, of course.

00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,720
Ever since I’ve been Phun’s little sister,

Yeah.

Back then,

So...are we close now?

Are you mad at me?

Why would I be mad at you?

What’s wrong with you?

00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,159
Suddenly, you seem strange,

not looking at me,

46
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,840

All day, I’ve only been thinking about you.

But I wouldn't dare be near you.

Disappointed in what?

57
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,440
That you tried to be close to me,

58
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,760
and I turned out like this?

00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,960
Just give me some time.

Don't joke like that.

I'm sorry.

Come on, who would dare come between this couple?

They’re perfect for each other.

109
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,080
If Phun actually likes someone else,

110
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,480
he has no brain, but a sponge.

isn’t the one you love?

128
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,760
What would you do?

129

-A new kid, guys!
-New kid and what's up?

If I joined again, would you all get excited?

137
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,720
Nope.

138
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,720
Maybe he's different from you.

139
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,400
We could show him now.

-I'll do.
-Stop.

145
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,160

Seen the new kid? He’s cute.

Hands off, man. Film’s already claimed him.

155
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,920
Go tell them-

156
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,480
it's time to rehearse.

157
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,760
Rehearsing? How?

158
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,760
The drums are crap.

159
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,560
So, did Phun give us the money?

160
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,240
That’s council money…

161
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,760
not Phun’s.

162
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,320
Yeah, but still.

163
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,160
P'Phun got it for us, right?

164
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:14,080
Fortunately you are very close to him. Otherwise, our club would be screwed.

165
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,120
What the fuck!

166
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,080
The student council should help those in trouble.

167
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,560
What’s up with you? Are you mad at Phun?

168
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,280
Did you two fight?

169
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,160
Don’t. We might not get the money.

170
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,920
Money’s not guaranteed.

171
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,000
But you can bet on me kicking your ass.

00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,640
What did I even do?

I’m outside the school.
I need to talk.

187
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,720
Slow down!

188
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,200
No one's stealing it.

189
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,160
Don't you eat?

190
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,360
So, why’d you call me today?

191
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,760
Don’t tell me you just needed a snack buddy.

192
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,000
Could’ve just met at the café.

193
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,000
No need to meet at school.

194
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,360
Actually,

195
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,600
I came to see you today

196
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,280
Because I have something to ask.

197
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,560
But promise me.

198
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,800
If I ask,

199
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,600
You’ll tell me the truth.

200
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,440
Sure!

201
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,840
Does Phun have someone else?

202
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,120
I don’t know… we’re not that close.

203
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,320
Not close?

204
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,600
Or you’re just not telling me?

205
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,440
Why do men always cover for each other?

206
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,800
Do you even know how Phun and Aim started dating?

207
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,360
Phun made the first move, you know.

208
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,440
At first, Aim wasn’t even interested.

209
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,360
but we told her to give it a shot.

210
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,880
because we thought Phun was a good guy,

211
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,960
that he wouldn't hurt her.

212
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,120
But now I'm not so sure...

213
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,360
if we were right.

214
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,400
Why's that?

215
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,520
Phun's been hard to reach lately...

216
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,760
His phone's always off,

217
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,120
or he doesn't pick up.

218
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,560
Whenever Aim tries to call him,

219
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,520
She ends up getting all stressed out.

220
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,040
He’s not been feeling well lately.

221
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,080
Like today, he didn’t even come to school.

222
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,720
Really?

223
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,480
Yeah!

224
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,040
True

225
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,480
So, in the end,

226
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,360
Nothing going on, right?

227
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,480
Nothing.

228
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,240
That’s what I thought.

229
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,960
My friend is pretty and popular.

230
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,160
who else would be a better match for Phun?

231
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:49,960
Right?

232
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,520
A good match?

233
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,880
Based on what?

234
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,560
Jeann says...

235
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:01,800
"pretty with handsome, rich with rich," or something like that?

236
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,160
But I think it's true.

237
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,160
If they weren't a good match,

238
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,160
how could they last?

239
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,600
Don’t you think, Noh?

240
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,360
And you and I are a good match too.

241
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,880
So ideal!

242
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,840
[Yuri's voice] Lately he has been very hard to reach.

243
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,360
[Yuri's voice] His phone's always off,

244
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,680
[Yuri's voice] or he doesn't pick up.

245
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,520
[Film] He's so freaking cute.

246
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,400
[Art]  PDPA, mr. police!

247
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,440
[Pepper] Omg, you guys are such sasaengs.

248
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,960
[Film] I've got even cuter ones.

249
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
[Knot] What's going on?

250
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,000
[Pepper] Film, you little shit!!!

251
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,280
[Phun] Noh!

252
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,280
[Yuri's voice]  Does Phun have someone else?

253
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:40,160
[Noh's messages] You disappeared!
Where did you go?
 Why didn't you come?

254
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,640
[Phun types and deletes] I'm sorry...

255
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:46,160
[Aim's message] Did you skip the class? Are you alright?

256
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,720
P'Phun!

257
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,320
Yes?

258
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,160
This is Day 2.

259
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,560
You’ve got to clear things up today.

260
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,760
So you can go back to school tomorrow, okay?

261
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,560
Did Paeng tell you to come?

262
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,440
No, I came on my own.

263
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,320
Are you sick?

264
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:12,760
No.

265
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,560
Then why did you skip?

266
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,000
Ouch.

267
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:34,920
What’s wrong with you?

268
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:37,840
Damn, Phun!

269
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,480
I told you everything yesterday.

270
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,680
What else, Noh?

271
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,360
Stay away from me.

272
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,480
I don't want you to hate me more.

273
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,440
Hey!

274
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,200
Who hates you?

275
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,000
Clear that up.

276
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:58,760
Who hates you?

277
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:00,960
Do I hate you?

278
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,560
Are you crazy?

279
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,800
Why would I hate you?

280
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:11,720
Yesterday, I was just said that because...

281
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,440
I don’t hate you, okay?

282
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,720
I was just trying to warn you.

283
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,640
Haven’t you gone out at all?

284
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,000
Get out sometime so you can stop overthinking.

285
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,800
Where would I go?

286
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,760
Anywhere you feel like.

287
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,520
I'll go with you.

288
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,880
-Ouch, it's all dusty here.
-Should we wipe here too?

289
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:01,880
Hey!

290
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,360
Nong Phun!

291
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,040
When did you get here?

292
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,680
I was just cleaning up.

293
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:12,560
-Mrs. Noi, I think it's clean now.
-Oh, it's okay.

294
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,040
Where are you guys off to?

295
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,640
I’ll just borrow the car for a bit.

296
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,160
Oh, sure! Keep it for the night if you need.

297
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,680
I’ll bring some snacks for you later.

298
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,760
It's dark

299
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,040
Drive safe, okay? I’m worried.

300
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,160
Yes, ma'am.

301
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,040
Put this on, it’s getting cold.

302
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:11,720
So, where are we going tonight?

303
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:14,800
I don't know.

304
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,160
You sure you can drive?

305
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,360
Okay.

306
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,720
I could drive with my eyes closed.

307
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,960
Keep 'em open, please.

308
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,400
Can we go anywhere? Really?

309
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,720
Um...

310
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,360
Thanks... for not hating me.

311
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,160
Let's go!

312
00:32:53,760 --> 00:33:34,120
[Driving by minors under 18 is illegal. Parents should provide close guidance.]

313
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:50,800
This is where you wanted to come?

314
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,960
Yep, right here.

315
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,160
Go.

316
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,240
Let’s go for a walk.

317
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,960
Hey, this one is beautiful. Your right hand.

318
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:20,679
Is it funny,huh?

319
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,639
-It's long.
-Try it

320
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,000
Try what?

321
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,159
Where are you going?

322
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,760
Oh, shoot!

323
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:50,880
Oh!

324
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,239
Are you thirsty?

325
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,880
Are you Phun from Friday College? We’re big fans!

326
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,600
That’s me.

327
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:05,600
Can we take a picture with you? We’re huge fans!

328
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,520
Sure thing.

329
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,000
I’ll take the pic for you.

330
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,000
Okay, everyone say ‘I gotta pee~~~’

331
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,720
I gotta pee!

332
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,200
That's it.

333
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,400
Thank you. Let's see the picture.

334
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,360
Hey, how do you guys know him?

335
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:26,240
I saw him on TikTok, then followed him on IG.

336
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:30,360
I love both Phun and Aim! They’re such a perfect match!

337
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,840
-Do you want some more to eat?
-Man, I’m stuffed!

338
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,440
Well, then...

339
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,120
Help me out.

340
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,160
It's not yummy.

341
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,680
-Come on, help me finish this!
-Let's go to Zen.

342
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:06,600
Shit!

343
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,640
Sorry about that.

344
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,960
My friend didn’t mean it. I’ll get you a new shirt.

345
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,440
The shirt’s fine, seriously.

346
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,040
But just because you’ve got money,

347
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,640
You think you can do whatever you want?

348
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:42,760
My people of Bang Saen,

349
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,160
we have a special guest today.

350
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,960
And we met very impressively.

351
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,880
Since Friday’s kids are visiting us,

352
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,920
Us folks here in Bang Saen

353
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:56,960
Want to see them put on a show, right?

354
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,520
Come on!

355
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,240
Hey, don't be nervous.

356
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,960
-This is very nervous, bro.
-Or you'll buy me a new shirt.

357
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,360
Alright.

358
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,520
Come on, give us a cheer, Bang Saen!

359
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,360
Hello, hello, hello.

360
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,360
-President of the Music Club here, requesting a budget review.
-Noh!

361
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,800
What should I do?

362
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:56,360
We need to pay for the drums, and now we’re out of money.

363
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,760
How about you be my boyfriend?

364
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,000
Amazing, just amazing!

365
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,680
So great, so great.

366
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:36,360
Give it up for Noh, the president of the music club from Friday College.

367
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,680
-One more song?
-That's fine.

368
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,840
All right, everyone, we still have time left.

369
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,600
Let’s move on to the next song.

370
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,760
Remember?

371
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,800
Two years ago,

372
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,000
we came to the sea together like this.

373
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:02,760
When was that?

374
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,160
On my birthday.

375
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,560
You call that coming together?

376
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,040
Hey!

377
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,200
Right there, right?

378
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,560
That is where I met you.

379
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:25,800
Right?

380
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,240
Man, what a crazy coincidence.

381
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:34,920
That sky picture you drew,

382
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:36,960
I still keep it.

383
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,400
You’re so thoughtful, man.

384
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,240
And do you remember when we first talked?

385
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:56,960
Was it when...

386
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,960
I cut in line at the fried chicken shop?

387
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:00,880
Back in grade 4?

388
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:02,840
Nope!

389
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:07,760
Or was it when I kicked the ball and hit you?

390
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:10,960
Nope!

391
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:11,760
When?

392
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,400
In grade 2, during that tug-of-war competition.

393
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,360
Oh, yeah.

394
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:23,000
When you and I fell and ended up in the nurse's office together, right?

395
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:23,840
Yeah.

396
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,400
Shit.

397
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:30,200
And do you remember when we first added each other on Line?

398
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:39,960
In grade 5.

399
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,360
When we were in that school play together.

400
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,200
Oh, I remember.

401
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,240
The whole script is very long.

402
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,880
I remember begging you for like 2 hours.

403
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,680
It took forever.

404
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,320
Why do you remember all that so well?

405
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,440
Maybe because it’s about you.

406
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:24,040
I think I’ve liked you since day one.

407
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,680
Then why are you dating Aim?

408
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,000
I don't know.

409
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,160
Probably everyone said she was a good match.

410
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:08,520
When I asked to date you,

411
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:11,720
wasn’t it because of Paeng?

412
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:13,720
Oh!

413
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,320
Back then, I just wanted to see

414
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,240
how close I could get to you.

415
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:26,760
How long I could stand being just friends.

416
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,040
So what?

417
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,240
I ended up really liking you.

418
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,040
I'm an asshole...

419
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,320
I only thought about myself,

420
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,480
I didn’t think about anyone else.

421
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:16,320
Phun!

422
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,280
You listen to me.

423
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:19,560
I might seem friendly,

424
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,920
but I'm not close to everyone.

425
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:28,160
When you tried to kiss me,

426
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,120
I didn't pull away.

427
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,880
If you're an asshole, then so am I...

428
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,520
because I like you too.

429
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:22,560
But I think this is enough

430
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:29,160
Whatever we took here,

431
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:31,360
let's just leave it here...

432
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:33,560
Okay?

433
00:44:58,920 --> 00:44:59,720
I like you!!!!!!!!!!!!!

434
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:07,840
I like you too!!!!!!!!!!

435
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:12,520
You're so damn handsome!!!!!!!

436
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:17,720
You're so damn cute!!!!!!!! And kind!!!!!

437
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:21,200
You're the nicest, Mr. Perfect!!!

438
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,160
Your hugs are warm, you smell good!!!!

439
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:26,760
I'm freaking whipped for you!!!!!!

440
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,760
And you’re just so cute.

441
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:31,760
You even cook well.

442
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:34,320
How could I not like you?

443
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:38,760
So why add more sauce?

444
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:42,560
Well,

445
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:46,360
I like it salty.

446
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:49,320
Damn Phun!

447
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,360
-Are you lying to me?
-Really.

448
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,960
-You’re lying!
-Nope, not at all.

449
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:57,960
You're lying.

450
00:45:58,520 --> 00:45:59,960
-Lying about what?
-You're lying.

451
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:02,360
You lie and need to jump in the sea.

452
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,400
- You go first.
-I'm not going.

453
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:05,360
I will get wet.

454
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:48,160
I'm leaving.

455
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,480
Hey, wait.

456
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:39,640
There are spare clothes in the council room.

457
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:41,520
You can grab them.

458
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:43,640
Okay.

459
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:52,920
Well, I...

460
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:55,160
I'm really leaving now.

461
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:28,040
Bye-bye.

462
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:01,720
Is that Noh?

463
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:03,600
Whose car did he come in?

464
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:05,560
Look

465
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:07,880
Hey, Noh!

466
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:08,960
Hey, Noh!

467
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:11,160
Why did you come early today?

468
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:12,320
Let me go, what are you guys?

469
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:13,920
Are you up late or haven't slept yet?

470
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:17,200
-Did you come with Phun?
-Huh?

471
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:19,040
-How’d you know?
-Huh?

472
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:22,840
The gray Benz with the parliament sticker on it.

473
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,240
Isn't that Phun’s family car?

474
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:27,360
Jeez, you’re practically a Poon super-fan, huh?

475
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,000
I’m like paparazzi, man.

476
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:30,440
You're observant.

477
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:33,360
Hey, Noh!

478
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:38,280
Dude, you smell kinda salty, don’t you?

479
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:39,560
Not salty, jerk!

480
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:40,640
Salty.

481
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,360
Hey, Noh, why do you have sand on you?

482
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:47,520
-What?
-Salty? Sand?

483
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:48,920
-Salty
-Stop.

484
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:51,560
Listen to me.

485
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:53,640
Not salty.

486
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:55,200
No sand.

487
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:56,960
Not your business.

488
00:50:58,360 --> 00:50:59,160
Clear.

489
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:01,400
Damn Noh!

490
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:30,200
Hello, Phun!

491
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:32,960
What’s wrong? Where’d you go?

492
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:37,800
I'm sorry, I had some things to think about.

493
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:41,760
But I'm okay now. I'm really sorry.

494
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:43,480
Um, that's okay.

495
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:46,040
-Just let me know next time, okay?
-Alright.

496
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:50,280
I'll pick you up today, and we can go to that new cafe.

497
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:52,200
Okey, let's go!

498
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:19,080
Hey, answer.

499
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:22,560
Can anyone answer?

500
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:27,120
I can answer.

501
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:31,960
The answer is...

502
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:34,160
Rambutan

503
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:40,640
Come on, focus! The timer’s running out!

504
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:43,160
Your questions are harder than the teacher’s, man!

505
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:45,880
Well, you wouldn’t be getting 70% otherwise.

506
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:52,760
Hey, again?

507
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Hey!!!! What the hell! Stop extorting money from younger kids!!!!

508
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:00,240
How much money did your mom give you? Why isn't it enough!!!

509
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,360
Wanna borrow from me? Low-interest loans!!!

510
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:04,600
Asshole!

511
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:07,000
-Watch yourself, huh?
-Stay alert, you shithead!

512
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:08,480
Don't run away, idiot!

513
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:15,280
Thank you!

514
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:21,160
This is how things have been the past few days,

515
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:22,960
but it feels like it's been ages.

516
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:31,800
Noh!

517
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:33,760
Someone’s here for you.

518
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:44,200
It made me realize that feelings

519
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:46,440
are irrational.

520
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:48,720
And so hard to control.

521
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:52,600
But actions,

522
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:55,360
are something we can control.

523
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:08,320
When did you get here?

524
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:12,760
Just now.

525
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:14,560
Went home to shower.

526
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:16,920
Oh, yeah.

527
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:18,760
That's good.

528
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:23,320
Did you change the shirt?

529
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:27,400
Nope.

530
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:28,920
Doesn’t matter.

531
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:51,680
Honestly,

532
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:53,720
in my high school life,

533
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:57,120
there are still many things I need to do.

534
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:03,720
So I think one day,

535
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:06,840
I’ll forget how I feel now.

536
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:16,880
Noh!

537
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:18,040
Hey, Phun!

538
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:19,640
Are you done talking?

539
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:22,680
We’re starting the new round, hurry up.

540
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:24,520
I’ll catch up, go ahead first.

541
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:26,000
Alright, hurry up.

542
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:27,600
Okay, sir.

543
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:44,960
Phun and I can still be friends.

544
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:48,240
Just with a little more distance.

545
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:52,160
Like he always said.

546
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:56,840
You don't have anything else, right?

547
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:09,960
If not, I'm going in.

548
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:22,400
Love.

549
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:24,360
If it’s real,

550
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:28,240
it has to come at the right time, too.

551
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:58,040
Noh!

552
00:56:59,120 --> 00:56:59,960
Are we close now?

553
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,360
Phun, give that to me.

554
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:10,960
What do you really want?

555
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,520
I want to have you, Noh!

556
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:18,160
But even though it ended like this,

557
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:21,520
everything that happened is a good memory.

558
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:24,600
For me.

559
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:30,160
And my new friend, called...

560
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:34,000
Phun!

561
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:01,920
[Noh's voice] But everyone,

562
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:06,240
[Noh's voice]  falling in love takes hardly any time.

563
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:08,240
[Noh's voice] Then when we have to say goodbye,

564
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:10,840
[Noh's voice] why does it hurt so much?

565
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:16,200
-The drum is here!!!
-Holy shit!!!

566
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:18,760
Noh!

567
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:21,680
-How's the club going?
-Crazy busy!

568
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:24,480
The new drum just arrived, and we're broke!

569
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:26,840
Were you talking to Earn about that?

570
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:32,760
Phun!

571
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:35,600
You...

572
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:38,320
still remember what happened at the beach?

573
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:47,440
