1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,200
Yuri

2
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:02,470
What?

3
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:04,870
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:07,910
You're in crush to someone, right?

5
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:11,750
You don't let me know who's that?

6
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:16,890
Will we be able to meet again?

7
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:19,370
Yes, we will.

8
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:22,570
I'm your friend.

9
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,060
Noh's bestfriend.

10
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,060
Noh!

11
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:31,210
Noh

12
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,320
1 hour ago

13
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:52,630
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,340
You're in crush to somone, right?

15
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:00,880
We're still friend, aren't we?

16
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:07,370
Yes, we are.

17
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:16,580
Oh, Yuri.

18
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,100
Where are you going?

19
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:19,770
I'm going to meet Noh.

20
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,070
Do you still want to meet him?

21
00:01:23,539 --> 00:01:24,930
Don't you feel sorry to Aim?

22
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,840
What do you mean?

23
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:30,350
She's broke up with her boyfriend.

24
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:32,320
Don't you think it's because

25
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,140
because of someone you know?

26
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:55,190
The reason I'm here is

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,500
because I have something to ask.

28
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,120
Can you promise to me?

29
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:02,110
If I ask you about this,

30
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:04,990
You will tell me the truth.

31
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,970
Lately, I think Aim is stressed.

32
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,800
I think it's because of Phun.

33
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,370
I'm not sure what he has done.

34
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,320
Something is more complicated than we thought.

35
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:18,590
Really?

36
00:02:18,829 --> 00:02:19,829
Yeah

37
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,520
Noh, do you think that

38
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,460
Phun is waiting for his new girlfriend?

39
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:26,470
What's wrong?

40
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:29,490
I think

41
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,110
the reason Phun broke up with Aim

42
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,880
because Pun got a new girlfriend for sure.

43
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,160
Yuri! Have you found Noh?

44
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,500
Phumphat's house

45
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:53,110
I'm sorry.

46
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,190
Why did you say sorry?

47
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:59,030
Well

48
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,220
It's not only you.

49
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,130
But I'm the one who started.

50
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:09,930
Phun

51
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,950
Did you feel better now?

52
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,100
Then

53
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,370
Don't you follow Yuri?

54
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,620
If I did, I don't know what to say.

55
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:14,820
Aren't you hungry?

56
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:16,450
I am.

57
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,850
But I'm punishing myself.

58
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,680
Why did you do that?

59
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,640
I told Yuri to meet you yesterday.

60
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,830
Hey, it's not because of you.

61
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,020
Phun and I did wrong.

62
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:35,350
I don't blame two of you.

63
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,580
I just want to apologize.

64
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,530
How is Yuri going now?

65
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:50,140
She doesn't talk to me at all.

66
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,320
Let it go.

67
00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:59,270
You haven't done anything wrong.

68
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:00,290
Really?

69
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,480
Yeah

70
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:05,290
Don't worry about it.

71
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,400
Oh, don't be sad dude.

72
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,110
You're hungry now?

73
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,210
Eat mine.

74
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:22,910
Damn it.

75
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,540
You're hungry but you don't buy a meal.

76
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,150
Hey, Ngo! Come here.

77
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:33,460
How are you?

78
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:36,650
Oh

79
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:38,310
Are you two really dating?

80
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,150
Yes, we are.

81
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,020
Are you serious?

82
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:44,660
What's wrong?

83
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:46,810
I'm dating. I just said the truth.

84
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,690
It's better to let others know later.

85
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,970
It may cause the problem.

86
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:17,530
The marching brand flies to China today.

87
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,750
Hey, good luck to you guys.

88
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:19,810
I'm rooting for you.

89
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,080
You should get the award.

90
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:22,110
Just do your best.

91
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:23,130
We will win for sure.

92
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,160
We don't need any luck.

93
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:25,230
Alright

94
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:31,480
You don't forget anything right?

95
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,230
I can't fly there to give it to you.

96
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:34,490
I don't forget it.

97
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,160
I just left it to you.

98
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,240
Huh?

99
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:38,810
What did you leave it to me?

100
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,110
It's my heart.

101
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:46,890
Please keep it well.

102
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,330
Who taught you this?

103
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:54,180
It's so damn soapies.

104
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:56,830
I knew it.

105
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,110
When you stay in China,

106
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:01,670
Take good care of yourself.

107
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:02,690
For your heart,

108
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,160
I will take good care of it.

109
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:12,090
Hey, you should go now guys.

110
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:13,490
It might be late to check-in.

111
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:15,940
Don't be lonely when we're not here.

112
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,960
Just go now!

113
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:18,050
We're doing fine!

114
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:19,180
You can do it!

115
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,760
You can do it!

116
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:34,250
He hasn't joined the class since that day.

117
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,960
How could he come for today?

118
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,630
Let's do your job first.

119
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:43,230
After that, we will find Win together.

120
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:45,990
Let's go.

121
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:49,460
Hello, bro.

122
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,340
See you later.

123
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,370
Get in the car, I will help.

124
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:54,710
See you later!

125
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,630
Hey, take care of yourself.

126
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:57,650
Yes, of course. See you.

127
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:05,730
The room is quiet when they left.

128
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:07,350
You miss them, do you?

129
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,120
No! I don't.

130
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,390
When they left, it's comfortable.

131
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,490
This sofa

132
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:16,670
I reserve

133
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:18,940
I will come to sleep everyday.

134
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,500
Are you not studying anymore?

135
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:30,690
Hello?

136
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:33,870
It's been a moment ago and you called to me?

137
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,600
Alright

138
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,750
Yeah, got it.

139
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:00,670
Noh!

140
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,300
I forgot to tell you.

141
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:03,810
The book I helped you order,

142
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:04,930
you should take it today.

143
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:06,690
Then go with me.

144
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,050
I'm not available anymore.

145
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,690
How could I carry 14 books?

146
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:13,190
Shit.

147
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,470
I think we should put it here.

148
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,630
It's good Feng Shui.

149
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:25,660
Hey, I think it's here.

150
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,550
No, trust me. Put it here.

151
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:29,930
This is right here.

152
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,840
Please pick up the phone for me.

153
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,620
What are you doing?

154
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:48,700
I'm in the council room.

155
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:49,850
What do you want, Noh?

156
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,590
Are you free this evening?

157
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,710
I may ask you carrying books with me.

158
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,970
14 books

159
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:00,970
Of course I'm free.

160
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,730
It's okay if you're busy.

161
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,700
Fee, I'm not coming this evening.

162
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:09,790
What?!

163
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,660
Who will help me carry the cabinet?

164
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,610
Hey, it's okay.

165
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Oh, I'm free for you.

166
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:17,630
Fee!

167
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:19,100
Ask other for help.

168
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:20,990
I'm helping my boyfriend.

169
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:22,090
Come on, Phun!

170
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,120
Come on!

171
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:25,620
Phun, it's okay if you're busy.

172
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,080
I'm free.

173
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:29,520
See you this evening.

174
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:42,300
All right, that's enough today.

175
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:44,910
Also, It's soon for final exam.

176
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,810
Please do read books.

177
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:49,200
You all are wise but lazy.

178
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,430
Students

179
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,540
Do respect to the teacher.

180
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:53,450
Thank you.

181
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,220
Hey guys

182
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:00,890
Are you going to play football?

183
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,520
Get up! Let's go!

184
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:03,550
Hey guys, I gotta go now.

185
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,640
What?

186
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,100
I'm leaving.

187
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,400
Noh

188
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:09,570
Why is your friend in hurry?

189
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:11,220
Dude, you're also his friend.

190
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,540
I gotta go now too.

191
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:15,620
You're hurry to leave too?

192
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:17,570
I have to take something at the club.

193
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,530
Yeah, bye-bye.

194
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:21,970
Bye, dude.

195
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,630
What's wrong with him?

196
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:25,570
Noh!

197
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:27,910
- Have you finished calss?
- Where do we meet?

198
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:28,930
Noh!

199
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:30,410
Noh!

200
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,200
Come here.

201
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:38,140
What are you doing?

202
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,160
Get away from here!

203
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:40,190
Huh?

204
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:42,050
- He's here!
- Come back here.

205
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,080
What's going on?

206
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,800
Hey!

207
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:51,130
You have to help me first.

208
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,560
Go and ask others to help!

209
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:53,590
I'm asking you!

210
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:54,980
No, we don't want to!

211
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,540
Let's go!

212
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,180
Don't chase after me!

213
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,650
You escaped from Fee. Does he upset?

214
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:10,390
No, he just gets on my nerves.

215
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,220
Since he's heartbroken,

216
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:14,110
He can't see anyone in relationship.

217
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,210
Oh, Fee

218
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:17,650
Moreover,

219
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,090
How can I let you go alone?

220
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,550
You're my boyfriend.

221
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,600
I think you may have high fever.

222
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:31,130
- No, I don't.
- What do you mean no?

223
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:33,990
Let's go.

224
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:35,110
We should go now.

225
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:40,060
So, how much does the taxi fee cost?

226
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:42,050
I don't let you know.

227
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,420
Damn it, Phun.

228
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:46,920
I paid you for the taxi fee.

229
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,790
You treat me some meal.

230
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,380
But meal is more expensive.

231
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,780
I promise I will not eat too much.

232
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:54,130
Alright

233
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:57,190
Let's go find something to eat.

234
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Noh!

235
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:09,730
What?

236
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:15,900
Ohm

237
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:24,079
Hey

238
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:25,099
Ohm!

239
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,650
What are you doing?

240
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,670
I saw Ohm getting in there.

241
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:36,710
So what? We come here together.

242
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:43,810
Noh

243
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:46,690
Let's go find something to eat.

244
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,720
Let's take the books first.

245
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:51,730
Let's eat something first.

246
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,170
Take the books first.

247
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,700
Okay okay, let's go.

248
00:17:58,790 --> 00:17:59,790
Take the books first!

249
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:05,120
Noh, it's heavy.

250
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,350
Just carry it!

251
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,630
- Can you help me?
- No, I can't.

252
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,920
Phun! Noh!

253
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:13,950
What are you doing here?

254
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:15,930
Nongnan!

255
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:36,650
I'm going to the toilet.

256
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,610
Let's go to the toilet.

257
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,730
Let's find something to eat.

258
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,230
Which substance has a role,

259
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,750
in digesting intestinal protein?

260
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:28,980
The shrine

261
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,400
Khing!

262
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:34,430
The answer is Procarboxy Peptides.

263
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,010
which is made of a small intestine.

264
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,250
It's an enzyme indactine.

265
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:39,830
It's activated to carboxypeptidase.

266
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:41,300
After that, it can digest protein.

267
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:43,630
What's that?

268
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:44,650
What did he say?

269
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,940
I heard something was dead.

270
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,620
- It's cold until my cheek got red.
- Freaking cute!

271
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:14,310
Damn.

272
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,850
They don't send competition photos.

273
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,850
Why don't you search it?

274
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:20,430
Do you know that application?

275
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,690
Waper.. something

276
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:23,350
It's Weibo, dude!

277
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:26,960
So, you know how to use it?

278
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,590
- I don't know.
- What?

279
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:30,370
Just ask them.

280
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,710
Okay, I'll try asking.

281
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:39,430
How's the competition result?

282
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,100
We lost.

283
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,920
- We lost.
- Damn!

284
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:17,510
So what?

285
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,540
I told you to wait for the results.

286
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:22,560
I thought they would win.

287
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:24,110
They're so confident.

288
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,180
Then, what should we say?

289
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:39,870
Don't think it's regretted.

290
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:46,590
They got chance to be a national representative.

291
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:48,350
We should congratulate them.

292
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:51,220
However, they come back with experience

293
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,010
handed to the next year's juniors.

294
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:54,660
So, our juniors could prepare better.

295
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,680
Is that right?

296
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:56,850
Amen

297
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:05,810
Thank you.

298
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:21,180
- Don't say something bad.
- I know!

299
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:05,430
Shit!

300
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:07,380
Are you fooling me?

301
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,820
Who fooled you? We literally lost.

302
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,040
We lost the first place.

303
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:12,930
But we got second place!

304
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:32,990
Are you fooling me too?

305
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:37,070
Film forced me to do.

306
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:46,820
But I have a gift for you.

307
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:53,360
I don't know what should I pick,

308
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,890
so I just took it all.

309
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:01,330
I have something for you too.

310
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,240
A reward that you won the contest

311
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,470
What is this, Ohm?

312
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:18,650
But

313
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:21,170
If you can't find it by tomorrow

314
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:22,810
You won't get it.

315
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:25,450
Yeah, I'll find it.

316
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:32,690
Hey, what are you talking there?

317
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:35,610
Hey! just a moment, I'm coming.

318
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:47,750
One two three

319
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:52,840
Okay

320
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:55,820
Guys, I keep the trophy here.

321
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:57,540
I won't be dirty by the dust.

322
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,560
Okay!

323
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:00,850
Put it carefully.

324
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:02,400
Alright, good job.

325
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:07,430
I'm reserving a seafood pizza.

326
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:09,210
When did you reserve?

327
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,690
I'm looking at it means it's reserved.

328
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:15,030
But when I'm holding,

329
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:16,950
that means I'm gonna eat it!

330
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:20,170
Ohm, were you lonely when we left?

331
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:22,030
Listen to me. When you're not here,

332
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:23,990
I'm doing fine.

333
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:25,010
Are you sure?

334
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:26,370
Of course!

335
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:27,830
- You're not lonely?
- Yeah

336
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:29,770
Do you want me to say?

337
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:31,430
Who texted me every day?

338
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,090
How's the weather there?

339
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,800
- Is the food spicy?
- Hey!

340
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,000
Is there anyone got sick?

341
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:40,440
I think

342
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:42,180
He asked you or

343
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,880
he's trying to ask about someone?

344
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:48,870
You all are nonsense!

345
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,560
Ohm, your ears are blushing.

346
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:51,750
Not

347
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:53,470
Hey, Noh

348
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:55,100
- Huh?
- Have you fixed the air-con?

349
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:56,770
It was still hot days ago.

350
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:00,680
Of course, I did it.

351
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:05,770
I wil llet you guess who fixed it.

352
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:07,150
Who's that?

353
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:08,810
Who?

354
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:09,970
Who fixed it?

355
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:12,050
Who is that talent to fix it?

356
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:14,170
He is here.

357
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,540
What's wrong!

358
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,520
We didn't say anything.

359
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:25,960
Is anyone here ordered some pizza?

360
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:27,790
The delivery man dropped it at the building.

361
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,300
Phun!

362
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:35,380
- Do you want to eat with me?
- Huh?

363
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:37,070
Are you sure with that?

364
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,100
I mean the pizza!

365
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,310
The pizza!

366
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:41,980
Yeah, having the pizza like this.

367
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:43,670
Oh, you eat it like that?

368
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:47,050
- Yeah
- Okay, that's enough.

369
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:49,430
- You guys bring him too far.
- Don't tease him

370
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:55,660
Oh no, I didn't mean that!

371
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:59,770
While I was going out from the room

372
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:01,810
I'm not sure did they
fix something else

373
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,340
except the air condition.

374
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:05,940
Damn it, Ohm!

375
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:08,150
Seriously,
I think Phun is really cool

376
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:10,830
In the past days, you claimed all
our club tickets.

377
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:13,740
Now, you still help taking care
of our club.

378
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:19,130
Alright

379
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:21,530
I gave you my seafood pizza.

380
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:23,550
Oh, you gave it to him.

381
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,040
Damn!!

382
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:29,700
Damn it.

383
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:34,370
Damn it, I didn't do it.

384
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:36,590
No way, it shouldn't be the trophy.

385
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:37,610
No No No

386
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,880
It must not be a trophy.

387
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:41,300
- Yeah, it's not the trophy.
- Right? you think so?

388
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:43,140
You think it's not the trophy.

389
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:45,750
Phun, don't spoil him.

390
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:46,930
Whatever will be, let it be.

391
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,490
Open it now so we can see
how the condition is.

392
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,520
Just open it.

393
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:02,480
Damn! the trophy is lost!

394
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:06,090
It's worse than it's broken, damn!

395
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:08,980
Shit

396
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,670
Are you looking for a trophy?

397
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:18,940
Yeah

398
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:20,950
It's over there.

399
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:26,970
Oh my

400
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:29,150
Damn it!

401
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,120
I'm afraid it would be broken here.

402
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,000
I'm sorry
I didn't let you guys know.

403
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:36,380
Thank you!

404
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:40,360
Phun! Phun! Phun! Phun!

405
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:41,840
Phun, you're really cool!

406
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:43,970
That girl who are your girlfrind,

407
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,300
it's like she opens random box,

408
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,820
and she got the secret one.

409
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:49,330
Ngo! conme here!

410
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,540
Damn it!

411
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:58,030
I'm not that awesome.

412
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:01,690
I just want the club president smiles.

413
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:08,900
Phun Noh! Phun Noh! Phun Noh!

414
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:14,480
Phun Noh! Phun Noh! Phun Noh!

415
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:17,310
Phun Noh! Phun Noh! Phun Noh!

416
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:25,930
Bank balance is 23.75 baht

417
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:40,230
What are you doing?

418
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:42,890
I'm watching them playing football.

419
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:46,650
Uh, what about Ohm?

420
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:49,780
I don't know.

421
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:51,650
He is getting weird lately.

422
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,400
Oh!

423
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:56,670
Will you leave now?

424
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,210
Yeah, I'm leaving now.

425
00:30:58,230 --> 00:30:59,610
Hey man! I gotta go.

426
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:02,460
What? You stole my friend again.

427
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:07,110
Wait

428
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:08,380
How about Ohm?

429
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:11,970
Why did many people ask about him?

430
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,200
Noh! wait for me!

431
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:20,750
Did Ohm really hide it here?

432
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:14,160
I can't find it.

433
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,530
Can't you give me more hint?

434
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,890
It's here. You found it.

435
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,500
Huh?

436
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:29,370
Ta da!

437
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:30,580
Here it is!

438
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:33,940
For the rest,

439
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:35,870
I will give you more.

440
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:44,530
Mick, this is for you.

441
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,280
Are you serious?

442
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:50,650
I told you

443
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:52,730
Think carefully before you buy something

444
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,650
Make sure you really love it.

445
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,500
You have proved it today.

446
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,770
You really like it.

447
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:01,700
I gave this to you this time.

448
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,540
It's for you wining the competition.

449
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:05,740
Thank you.

450
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:09,870
Oh, Mick!

451
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:14,060
Let me go!

452
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:18,040
I will play HoN forever!

453
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,420
You're exaggerated!

454
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:23,510
So, you know now?

455
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:26,240
If I like something,
I really like it.

456
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,200
- You missed it!
- We're treated ice-cream.

457
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:38,860
Ohm and Noh missed it!

458
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,090
Where is Noh?

459
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:49,290
- Where's Noh?
- He's with Phun.

460
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:07,130
Ohm!

461
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:17,820
Are you hungry?

462
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:20,469
Oh, look at my face!

463
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:25,810
Does it look yummy?

464
00:34:30,969 --> 00:34:32,679
Don't you think it's too expensive?

465
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:36,429
It's on me.

466
00:34:39,139 --> 00:34:40,139
Thank you.

467
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:42,730
But

468
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,139
After we finished here,

469
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,949
let's stop by at my house.

470
00:34:48,969 --> 00:34:49,969
Why do we have to?

471
00:34:51,699 --> 00:34:52,699
Well,

472
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,920
Let's eat something else.

473
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:56,820
Shameless!

474
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:00,210
No

475
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:01,940
I'm just kidding.

476
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:04,830
Paeng misses you.

477
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:06,510
Really?

478
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:10,430
Are you sure?

479
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:13,610
Not only Paeng

480
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:16,570
but also her elder brother missing you

481
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:25,270
Alright

482
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:29,940
May I serve you a drink?

483
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:41,620
Yes, please.

484
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,400
Thank you.

485
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:50,310
I have a stomachache.

486
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,600
I'll go to the toilet for a second.

487
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:55,690
Hurry up and come back.

488
00:35:57,910 --> 00:36:00,550
That boy in blue pants
is very handsome.

489
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:01,900
The one is sitting alone there?

490
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:03,990
Yeah, his freind just got up and left.

491
00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:05,510
I think they are not friend.

492
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:06,860
Really?

493
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,010
You're talking about that blad boy
coming with him?

494
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,750
Yes, they were embracing
while I served them drink.

495
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:13,050
What?

496
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:14,960
What a pity. He shouldn't be homosexual.

497
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:16,350
He's very handsome.

498
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:18,130
Yeah, I think so.

499
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:19,570
I want him.

500
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:21,080
One of them has very beautiful skin.

501
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:25,580
Noh

502
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,760
What?

503
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:28,230
Today before we leave,

504
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:30,040
let's buy some snacks for Paeng.

505
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:31,460
She asked for it many things.

506
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:33,900
Sure.

507
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:50,270
Noh

508
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Noh

509
00:36:54,970 --> 00:36:55,970
Are you okay?

510
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:57,660
Are you okay?

511
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,680
Phun!

512
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:04,850
- Hello, auntie Mew.
- Hello

513
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,720
How are you?

514
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:08,890
What are you doing?

515
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:12,180
Oh, we have just finished eating.

516
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,300
It's good to meet you, Phun.

517
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:16,190
I have something to ask.

518
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:17,490
Does your girlfriend

519
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:19,100
still using the same contact number?

520
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:21,200
I called to her but there's no response.

521
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:29,870
Eh?

522
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:32,020
or

523
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,050
Are you two still dating?

524
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:37,350
- No
- Oh

525
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,920
I'm sorry.

526
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,280
I was curious why you two

527
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,660
haven't posted any couple photos.

528
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,750
I'm sorry.

529
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:44,280
Are you still okay?

530
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,100
Yes, I am.

531
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,610
Have you started new relationship?

532
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,640
You're handsome.

533
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:51,400
Don't take too long time being single.

534
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:54,270
I can help you find the new one.

535
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:56,860
I met someone days ago.

536
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,530
She's so cute.

537
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:07,510
Oh,

538
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,830
I have got that one.

539
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:15,250
Really?

540
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:16,860
Who is that?

541
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:18,590
You're Phun.

542
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,720
That one must be extraordinary one.

543
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:22,850
Is she a convent student
as the previous time?

544
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:24,950
or she's studying international program?

545
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:26,600
or she is a net idol?

546
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:29,030
Come on, just let me know.

547
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,220
That one is ordinary.

548
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:34,570
But for me,

549
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:36,070
I think he's the cutest.

550
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:43,520
If that one is ready,

551
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:45,540
I will introduce to you later.

552
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:49,000
I'm sure you will like that one so much.

553
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:50,550
Alright

554
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:52,460
Oh!

555
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:54,100
I gotta go now.

556
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,270
I'm going to meet your father.

557
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:57,750
I'm leaving now.

558
00:38:58,590 --> 00:38:59,590
Bye.

559
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:17,880
Let me know when you're ready.

560
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:22,540
Okay

561
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:52,090
Oh, Win

562
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,170
How did you come here?

563
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:58,730
Why didn't you reply chatting?

564
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:03,840
What did uncle Yoo do to you?

565
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:06,430
He just didn't let me go to school.

566
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:07,710
So, what should you do?

567
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:11,410
I don't know.
That's why I escaped from him.

568
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:14,770
Isn't he get angry?

569
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,330
Do you want me staying with dad?

570
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:22,620
Where are you going to stay?

571
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,700
Your house

572
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:30,420
If uncle Yoo come to find us

573
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:32,850
Wouldn't it get worse?

574
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:38,020
Then, where do you want me to go?

575
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:45,770
Shall we go to explain to uncle Yoo?

576
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:47,650
Explain to him that we are friend.

577
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:49,680
It was nothing that day.

578
00:40:57,790 --> 00:40:58,920
Friend?

579
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:01,830
Nothing?

580
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:10,990
Well, I'm just trying to get it over with.

581
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:12,630
How do it over?

582
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:16,840
My dad hates me for what I am.

583
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:19,520
No matter how we lie

584
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,590
we can't change.

585
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:27,400
I think

586
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:30,590
Per will be the one who understand me more.

587
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:35,770
It's okay if you don't help.

588
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:39,190
I can find a way to go.

589
00:41:39,370 --> 00:41:40,480
Where are you going?

590
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:41,870
Win

591
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:45,150
Win

592
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:26,330
Noh!

593
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:29,400
Someone told on you.

594
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:32,250
Someone here doesn't read books.

595
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:35,690
Is it Phun?

596
00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:38,630
That's true.

597
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:40,820
When are you going to read?

598
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:43,210
Let me watch the series for 1 episode.

599
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,570
If you read it now,

600
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:46,890
I have some rewards for you!

601
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:48,790
It's fat. I don't want it.

602
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,400
Oh, it's fat.

603
00:42:54,830 --> 00:42:55,990
Shall we do this?

604
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:58,650
If you finished reading book for 1 subject,

605
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,210
I will teach you for the piano.

606
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:02,940
Really?

607
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:04,760
But

608
00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:08,050
Please hurry. I'll be here until 8 P.M.

609
00:43:08,270 --> 00:43:09,850
Of course! I will start now.

610
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,040
I think Paeng likes you so much.

611
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:21,850
Because I'm handsome.

612
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:35,360
Hi, dad.

613
00:43:37,310 --> 00:43:39,400
It's been a long time
you haven't been here, Noh.

614
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:44,720
Why did you get home late?

615
00:43:45,410 --> 00:43:46,620
I had some meal outside.

616
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:49,060
Let's go.

617
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:50,320
Phun

618
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:54,330
Keep your stuff and meet me downstairs.

619
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,670
We need to talk.

620
00:43:58,470 --> 00:43:59,470
Yes, dad.

621
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:47,850
Are you okay?

622
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,040
Wait here. I'll come back.

623
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:09,160
You can play some games on the computer.

624
00:45:15,490 --> 00:45:16,490
I'm waiting for you.

625
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:38,840
I love you.

626
00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:41,230
Wait for me here.

627
00:46:20,770 --> 00:46:21,770
Calm down.

628
00:46:38,530 --> 00:46:39,860
How's your class?

629
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:43,770
Nothing's new.

630
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:49,890
Your mom said you often gets home late.

631
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:52,550
What did you do?

632
00:46:55,370 --> 00:46:56,830
It's student council work.

633
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:00,690
Why do you have to do that?

634
00:47:02,730 --> 00:47:04,230
Didn't I tell you?

635
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:08,370
If you're not the student president,

636
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:09,660
you don't need to do that.

637
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,180
Do you remember Phao?

638
00:47:16,890 --> 00:47:18,010
Now, his family

639
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:20,380
all moved to live abroad.

640
00:47:21,310 --> 00:47:23,190
The case is bigger than we thought.

641
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:27,930
That's why I was trying to tell you
many times.

642
00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:30,610
When you are dating with someone

643
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:32,150
think carefully.

644
00:47:32,490 --> 00:47:34,760
Both of friends and your girlfriend

645
00:47:39,970 --> 00:47:41,190
But you're on this age

646
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,480
you still can't see how the people are.

647
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:46,730
That's why I sent you to study at Friday.

648
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:49,770
to filter the society of friends

649
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:53,490
For a girlfriend,

650
00:47:54,890 --> 00:47:56,750
I can't guess who you're grabbing.

651
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:20,190
Auntie Mew told me about your girlfriend.

652
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:25,580
Why you can let others know this.

653
00:48:26,430 --> 00:48:27,870
Why didn't you tell me?

654
00:48:35,270 --> 00:48:36,970
Don't think that I don't know.

655
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:43,170
About your ex-girlfriend

656
00:48:46,030 --> 00:48:47,330
She is a child of celebrity.

657
00:48:47,890 --> 00:48:49,370
But the reason I don't mind is

658
00:48:49,970 --> 00:48:51,940
Because I know how her family is.

659
00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:00,730
For this person,

660
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:03,870
Where is that person from?

661
00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:08,550
You will tell me

662
00:49:09,190 --> 00:49:10,550
or you will let me investigate?

663
00:49:11,370 --> 00:49:12,620
Dad, don't mess with him, okay?

664
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:13,940
Then tell me who's that?

665
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:19,640
If the person who you're dating is weird

666
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:21,220
then stop dating.

667
00:49:22,430 --> 00:49:24,130
If it makes you're worse,

668
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:25,530
You don't need to date!

669
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:28,720
Why are you quiet?

670
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,740
Who taught you to escape the problem?

671
00:49:30,770 --> 00:49:31,770
It's you, dad.

672
00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:38,310
Because of you,

673
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:39,830
I don't want to say anything.

674
00:49:39,950 --> 00:49:41,780
If I say it and makes you mad,

675
00:49:41,850 --> 00:49:42,850
You still force me.

676
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:45,020
You can't choose the right one.

677
00:49:45,910 --> 00:49:48,870
Otherwise you wouldn't choose to be
student council secretary.

678
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:51,860
You could be a president
of student council.

679
00:49:51,910 --> 00:49:53,100
Look what you chose.

680
00:49:53,630 --> 00:49:55,560
You don't consult with me.

681
00:49:56,530 --> 00:49:58,210
How could I trust you

682
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:00,460
when you choose your girlfriend?

683
00:50:03,870 --> 00:50:07,170
It's my decision.
Why it doesn't depend on me?

684
00:50:11,170 --> 00:50:13,050
Why do you care about what I should do?

685
00:50:13,570 --> 00:50:15,390
But you don't care what I want to do.

686
00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:21,850
You know what?

687
00:50:22,450 --> 00:50:24,350
When I see friends having their dreams

688
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:27,830
I'm so jealous because I couldn't have it.

689
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:34,060
I only have the duties.

690
00:50:34,410 --> 00:50:35,910
I have to do everything perfectly.

691
00:50:36,090 --> 00:50:37,940
I should take care of others.

692
00:50:38,050 --> 00:50:39,480
What about me?

693
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:41,090
What I can own as mine?

694
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,450
The area of Phumiphat house is large.

695
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,400
But it's nothing.

696
00:50:52,770 --> 00:50:54,600
I'm not even here.

697
00:51:13,450 --> 00:51:15,670
Actually, It's no need for me here.

698
00:51:18,910 --> 00:51:21,130
Just someone who is good enough for it.

699
00:51:23,370 --> 00:51:24,670
I think

700
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:26,620
that one is not me.

701
00:51:28,430 --> 00:51:29,430
Phun!

702
00:51:31,030 --> 00:51:32,030
Phun!

703
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:07,380
Noh!

704
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:09,190
Are you still here?

705
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:11,740
Oh, shit.

706
00:52:11,770 --> 00:52:13,470
I should go taking a shower and sleep.

707
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:14,700
Me too!

708
00:52:17,690 --> 00:52:20,190
Noh, when will you get home?

709
00:52:20,610 --> 00:52:21,610
I don't know.

710
00:52:22,830 --> 00:52:24,070
I'm waiting for the Phun.

711
00:52:25,230 --> 00:52:26,230
It's late.

712
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:28,330
Hurry up and go.

713
00:52:34,530 --> 00:52:35,530
Noh

714
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:39,600
Are you really at Phun's home?

715
00:52:42,770 --> 00:52:44,530
Then, help me for something.

716
00:52:44,770 --> 00:52:46,670
My sister likes Phun.

717
00:52:46,670 --> 00:52:47,980
Tomorrow is her birthday.

718
00:52:49,710 --> 00:52:51,850
Can you tell Phun to call to my sister?

719
00:52:58,330 --> 00:53:00,470
Hey, it's okay if you don't want to.

720
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:13,430
Hey, let's talk tomorrow.

721
00:53:15,630 --> 00:53:16,760
Noh

722
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:19,970
What should I do?

723
00:53:20,090 --> 00:53:22,540
Phun and dad is quarrelling.

724
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:26,100
I can't help anyone.

725
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:43,980
Don't worry.

726
00:53:45,790 --> 00:53:47,510
Phun is good enough to handle.

727
00:53:48,430 --> 00:53:51,030
But I'm afraid if dad knows about you

728
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:53,830
he would force you to break up.

729
00:53:57,910 --> 00:54:00,480
Do you think he would break up with me?

730
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:03,910
He wouldn't break up with you.

731
00:54:04,050 --> 00:54:05,710
Phun loves you so bad.

732
00:54:11,730 --> 00:54:14,190
Then, don't worry too much.

733
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:17,420
It's nothing.

734
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:19,300
Really?

735
00:54:20,670 --> 00:54:21,670
Yeah

736
00:54:23,090 --> 00:54:25,740
Shall we eat some snack to get a good mood?

737
00:54:25,770 --> 00:54:26,770
Yes!

738
00:54:32,330 --> 00:54:33,330
Phun

739
00:54:56,490 --> 00:54:57,930
Where are you going?

740
00:54:59,140 --> 00:55:01,110
I'm going to the kitchen.

741
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:03,940
What about you? How is it?

742
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:05,760
Are you okay?

743
00:55:06,630 --> 00:55:08,820
Do you want to have some snacks with me?

744
00:55:10,870 --> 00:55:12,170
You can go first.

745
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:14,230
I'll talk with Noh first.

746
00:55:16,270 --> 00:55:18,370
Yeah, I'm going now.

747
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:39,920
Are you okay?

748
00:55:47,570 --> 00:55:48,570
I don't know.

749
00:55:51,370 --> 00:55:53,370
But I've never been like this before.

750
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:59,270
I know he wishes me best.

751
00:56:01,170 --> 00:56:03,350
I want to make him comfortable.

752
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:06,570
But

753
00:56:29,230 --> 00:56:30,860
I'm freaking bad.

754
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:35,800
I don't want to be like this.

755
00:59:30,470 --> 00:59:31,470
Noh

756
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:34,040
Yes.

757
00:59:35,090 --> 00:59:36,810
Come and talk with me.

758
00:59:44,090 --> 00:59:45,090
Yes.

759
00:59:50,770 --> 00:59:52,130
Did Phun sleep?

760
00:59:53,550 --> 00:59:54,550
Yes, he did.

761
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:01,430
Did he tell anything to you?

762
01:00:10,170 --> 01:00:11,530
I'm quite shocked.

763
01:00:13,390 --> 01:00:15,450
I have never ever thought

764
01:00:15,630 --> 01:00:17,800
Phun would say that.

765
01:00:21,510 --> 01:00:24,270
When Phun is with friends

766
01:00:25,770 --> 01:00:26,770
How is he?

767
01:00:29,870 --> 01:00:30,870
He's good.

768
01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:33,730
He is very good.

769
01:00:36,750 --> 01:00:39,420
No one doesn't like him.

770
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:43,480
That's good.

771
01:00:45,870 --> 01:00:47,880
Phun has been a really good boy.

772
01:00:54,370 --> 01:00:55,750
Do you know?

773
01:00:57,100 --> 01:00:59,340
Phun, the one I know him,

774
01:01:01,470 --> 01:01:02,870
He's a good one.

775
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:04,760
He is a good boy.

776
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:08,590
He is very kind.

777
01:01:10,030 --> 01:01:11,740
He's a responsible person.

778
01:01:18,830 --> 01:01:21,760
I pray sacred things every night

779
01:01:21,780 --> 01:01:23,340
because I'm thankful.

780
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:26,890
to let me have Phun as my son.

781
01:01:31,030 --> 01:01:32,830
I have just found it out.

782
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:35,600
I just understand.

783
01:01:37,770 --> 01:01:41,800
The point isn't only Phun is a good boy.

784
01:01:45,010 --> 01:01:47,250
But the most important point is
Phun's happiness.

785
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:56,030
Dad and mom didn't mean to.

786
01:01:58,470 --> 01:02:01,390
We just thought we'd take care of him.

787
01:02:02,570 --> 01:02:04,470
We are in the spotlight.

788
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,440
Everyone can see.

789
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:11,810
Dad just wants to protect Phun.

790
01:02:11,830 --> 01:02:13,830
I want to take care of Phun.

791
01:02:15,590 --> 01:02:17,330
But we never knew,

792
01:02:17,370 --> 01:02:19,900
that he is so uncomfortable for it.

793
01:02:26,070 --> 01:02:28,030
Can you tell me?

794
01:02:28,290 --> 01:02:31,440
Who is he dating with now?

795
01:02:44,310 --> 01:02:48,370
Well, if he doesn't say it

796
01:02:51,260 --> 01:02:52,260
I understand.

797
01:03:00,490 --> 01:03:02,030
I'm glad.

798
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:06,900
Phun has a good friend like you, Noh.

799
01:03:08,990 --> 01:03:11,290
You're always by his side

800
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:13,290
even in this situation.

801
01:03:16,430 --> 01:03:18,830
Please take care of Phun.

802
01:03:20,420 --> 01:03:21,740
Take care of him

803
01:03:22,890 --> 01:03:25,090
to help him found out good love.

804
01:03:26,140 --> 01:03:28,300
As a good boy like him deserves it.

805
01:04:33,370 --> 01:04:34,370
Pam

806
01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:37,430
Hey, Phun only helps her for tutoring.

807
01:04:37,650 --> 01:04:38,650
It's nothing.
