00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,440
[English subtitles available].
[Phun] So, what 's up with Earn?

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:03,520
Earn likes you, you know?

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:04,520
[Noh] Phun!

4
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:05,760
[Noh] Listen to me.

5
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,240
I only like Phun!

6
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,920
Phumiphat and no one else.

7
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,040
[Yuri] Don’t you think Phun’s acting strange lately?

8
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,240
[Noh] How so?

9
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,080
I noticed Aim looks stressed out lately.

10
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,080
Maybe it’s because of Phun.

11
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,760
[Noh] Maybe she's stressed about other stuff.

12
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:21,800
[Noh] How’d you come here?

13
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,040
[Phun] Pang thought we were sulking,

14
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,960
[Phun] so she told me to make up with you.

15
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,360
[Noh] Did Pang really make you come here?

16
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,400
[Phun] Yeah.

17
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,840
I don't have to hide anything from you.

18
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,800
[Phun] How about you, Noh?

19
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,720
Oh, where’d Phun go?

20
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,080
He's left already.

21
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,000
After we finished filming, we showed him some clips.

22
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,600
He only watched for a bit and then left.

23
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,800
[10.10 p.m.]

24
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,600
I’m telling ya.

25
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,040
Noh probably won't come down.

26
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,080
Bet he got sucked into the toilet for sure.

27
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,440
Should we call for rescue or something?

28
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,200
Hey!

29
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,160
But if it comes down,

30
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,800
you better not tell him my story.

31
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,560
-About you and that...
-Stop, Ohm!

32
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,480
Eh, Ohm!

33
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,920
How could Noh go to the toilet without grabbing his phone?

34
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,120
Can teens these days really go without their phone?

35
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,480
Eh, give me the phone.

36
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,560
Time to mess with this chicken.

37
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,440
You know his password?

38
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,920
Look at this!

39
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,240
What an idiot password!

40
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,200
I already told you he's an idiot.

41
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,880
Since the whole gang's here, should we take a selfie?

42
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,000
Come one, guys!

43
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,920
Get closer, guys!

44
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,479
Not as handsome as the front one.

45
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,800
Right!

46
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,360
One more!

47
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,440
But in these times,

48
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,040
we better dance on TikTok or something?

49
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:13,880
Yes, sure!

50
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,120
[Per] I’ll film for you guys.

51
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,240
3...2...1...

52
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,640
Dude, this clip’s gonna be massive—

53
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,400
Million views!

54
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:37,880
Looks good.

55
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:39,079
Check it out again.

56
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,600
Man, my moves were so off there

57
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,200
Just use the first one!

58
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,560
Give it to me!

59
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,280
Phun!

60
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,240
You choose, man.

61
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,720
-Let’s just post whatever.
- Are you sure?

62
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,440
Yeah, sure.

63
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,320
It's his fault for leaving the phone.

64
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,240
Just post one.

65
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,720
Choose the one you look good.

66
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,400
[Aim] Why’d you do this?

67
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,280
[Aim] Don’t you care?

68
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,079
[Lee] You did care about me?

69
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,280
[Lee] Can you stop this?

70
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,079
[Aim] When I said I loved you,

71
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,440
[Aim] did you even think about it?

72
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,920
[11.00 p.m.]
You guys...

73
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,600
are the reason Phun went home.

74
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,000
What’s that got to do with us?

75
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,760
How messed up was that video?

76
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,360
Even Phun couldn't handle it!

77
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,400
What the heck!

78
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,920
We're practically a boy band.

79
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,960
If they have a band called BUS,

80
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:43,960
we're...

81
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,720
the BUM band!

82
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,080
Eh Noh, what's wrong with you?

83
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,800
Noh, where're you going?

84
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,800
[Phun] I have nothing to hide from you.

85
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,000
How about you, Noh?

86
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,560
Nope.

87
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,040
No.

88
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,000
[Can you open the door?]

89
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,720
[I'm in front of your room.]

90
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,840
[Can I have some time alone for a bit?]

91
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,080
Hey, Noh!

92
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,640
[Everyone] Hey, Noh!

93
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,160
♫You showed me what love truly means,♫

94
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:15,560
♫Now I know why my heart trembles like this,♫

95
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,320
♫Every time we're near.♫

96
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:24,440
♫You taught me what warmth feels like,♫

97
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,080
[EP8 Aim-Lee]

98
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,760
Whoa!

99
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,800
Bomb went off last night or what?

100
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,680
Why's everyone like that?

101
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,640
Unbelievable!

102
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,080
Oh, look! Nong Noh!

103
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,600
Nong Noh!

104
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,200
Nong Noh!

105
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,640
Noh!

106
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,760
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

107
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,520
He’s not waking up.

108
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,800
Try to do as in The Voick UK.

109
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,960
-He's now waking up.
-Yeah, right.

110
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,840
-What a scare!
-It’s us.

111
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,520
Nong Noh!

112
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,800
And where’s Ohm?

113
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,600
Good question.

114
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,000
Not here either.

115
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,400
Noh, try calling him.

116
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,120
Not answering?

117
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,200
What's with him?

118
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,000
Not answering?

119
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,160
-Hung up on me.
-Whoa!

120
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,640
[Im] Maybe we should report it?

121
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,080
[Im] Poor Ohm!

122
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,520
[Am] Don’t report it.

123
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,120
Who left the A/C on?

124
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,440
Im and Am didn't clean things?

125
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,720
Ouch!

126
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,640
Eh, Ohm!

127
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,520
Wake up now, man!

128
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,720
Ohm!

129
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,840
-Come out now!
-Give me 5 minutes.

130
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,160
Are you going to stay like this,

131
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,000
or should we get Mick to wake you up?

132
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,760
Asshole!

133
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,600
Let's take a shower.

134
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,640
-Can you scrub my back?
-Whoa!

135
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,040
No way!

136
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,760
Go...go!

137
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,000
Come on! Let's take a shower.

138
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,760
-Eh! Don't drag my leg.
-Come on, Noh!

139
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,600
Noh, take it easy, man.

140
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:09,920
Take it easy?

141
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,720
You’ve got so much dead skin here!

142
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,760
Take it easy, huh?

143
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,240
I don’t want to ruin my skin.

144
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,560
-You get it, right?
-Really sensitive, huh?

145
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,120
Just try scrubbing lighter.

146
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,800
That's right, you can do it.

147
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,640
Right in the middle.

148
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,400
That’s the spot.

149
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,840
You...

150
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,960
Yeah?

151
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,160
-Are you flirting with Nong Mick?
-Huh?

152
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,400
Do you believe in Per?

153
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,960
You jerk!

154
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,400
If I ever have anyone,

155
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,240
you’ll be the first to know.

156
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,560
Okay?

157
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,840
-You sure?
-Sure!

158
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,800
Now, keep scrubbing.

159
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,000
And what about you and Phun?

160
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,040
You haven’t told me anything.

161
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,520
We’re friends!

162
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,200
What the hell kind of friends?

163
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,120
You think I’m stupid?

164
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,840
Or you don't see me as a friend?

165
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,000
Funny...

166
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,560
Not funny at all.

167
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,400
Don't you trust me that much?

168
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,600
It’s not that.

169
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,000
I just didn’t know how to tell you.

170
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,040
It’s just…

171
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,080
I don’t know, man.

172
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,760
But are you okay with this?

173
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,400
Alright, look.

174
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,160
If there’s anything you need my help with,

175
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,680
just tell me.

176
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,640
Meddling in someone's life, I'm a pro!

177
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,240
I'm good at it.

178
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,600
Really?

179
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,040
Asshole!

180
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,200
Noh, get me water.

181
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,240
-So you can butt in clearly, right?
-Water!

182
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,280
Hey, you guys!

183
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,960
Tie your shoes, quick.

184
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,280
My mom’s calling—move it!

185
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,560
So fierce.

186
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,280
Thank you so much.

187
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,960
The Pad Mee Korat was delicious!

188
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,200
-Really?
-For real, ma'am.

189
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,120
I had three plates!

190
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,800
[Everyone] See you later!
[Im] Alright, guys! See you!

191
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,760
[Im] You can visit us anytime.

192
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,680
[Noh] See you later!

193
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,480
[Ann] Next time, I’ll make some Budu for you to try!

194
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,880
Eh, Noh! See you later!

195
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,000
See you!

196
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,320
See you later, An!

197
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,280
Goodbye, Im!

198
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,120
What's with you?

199
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,320
Ohm's mine!

200
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,720
Ohm, come visit again!

201
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,480
Ouch!

202
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,200
-It hits my lip!
-You deserve it.

203
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,560
Stop interrupting! Can't you see I'm about to fall in love?

204
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,000
Before falling in love,

205
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,640
-Go buy groceries first!
-Whoa!

206
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,160
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?

207
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,720
I could’ve gone with Ohm.

208
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,800
Ohm, wait for me too!

209
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,400
Hold on... hold on!

210
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,560
Go buy food first!

211
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,280
I'll go buy groceries with him first, okay?

212
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,920
-You’re gonna get locked up.
-You're crazy!

213
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,120
Just get to know each other,

214
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,400
find out where he lives and where I live.

215
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,880
♫I’ll take you down south for a beach trip.♫

216
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,400
I'll go by myself.

217
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,520
Really?

218
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,560
Yeah, I’m free today.

219
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,000
You sure? There’s a lot of them.

220
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,200
No problem.

221
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,440
Really? I feel sorry for you.

222
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,000
A lot, huh?

223
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,480
Yes, a lot..

224
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,600
Nah, it’s fine.

225
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,920
I’ll head back quick, see you!

226
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,120
Bye-bye!

227
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,800
-Safe journey!
-Yes, ma'am.

228
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,880
Please tell Ohm I love him.

229
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:57,760
Enough!

230
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,640
Hey, Win!

231
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,840
What’re you doing here?

232
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,120
We have tutoring today.

233
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,600
Have you forgotten?

234
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,800
Here, my mom sent you something.

235
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,560
She knows you've come here?

236
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:21,800
Yeah!

237
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,920
Where’ve you been?

238
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,280
I had hotpot at Noh's house.

239
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,600
Was it fun?

240
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,320
Why didn’t you invite me?

241
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,760
Invite me next time!

242
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,480
Today, we’re studying seriously, alright?

243
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,200
Don’t fall asleep.

244
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,680
I never fall asleep!

245
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,040
Let's go.

246
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,000
[Noh] What's up, Yu!
[Yuri] Noh!

247
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,480
[Yuri ] Noh, how’s it going? You awake yet?

248
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,200
[Noh] Awake for what?

249
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,200
[Yuri] Didn’t you have a party last night?

250
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,600
[Yuri] Didn’t invite me, huh?

251
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,600
It was all guys; why would you wanna come?

252
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,240
[Yuri] I wouldn't worry because you were there too.

253
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,280
[Yuri] You’d keep me safe, right?

254
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,640
Think it over!

255
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,960
What did you want again, Pang?

256
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,359
Oh, right.

257
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,800
Okay, I’ll go grab it for you.

258
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:17,880
That’s all, right?

259
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,040
Okay.

260
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,840
Are you done yet?

261
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,720
Almost there.

262
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,640
Can you really do it?

263
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,600
Of course, with my skills!

264
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,840
Then why are you so slow?

265
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,200
I already showered.

266
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,560
Alright, I’m done here.

267
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,760
All correct, sure.

268
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,160
Can you really do this, right?

269
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,560
Yeah!

270
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,920
Come check the score.

271
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,560
Were you asleep in class?

272
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,000
Or are you trying to piss me off?

273
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,200
You'd better change your major;

274
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,440
otherwise, you’re not gonna make it.

275
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,240
No...

276
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,080
No what?

277
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,000
You said you didn't want to study science.

278
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,720
Why are you studying then?

279
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,880
Well, now I want to study it.

280
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,800
Don’t lie to me.

281
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,640
I’ll tell the teacher Monday to change your major.

282
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,160
No!

283
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,600
Why not?

284
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,600
I want to study with you.

285
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,800
Are you crazy?!

286
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,480
This is your future!

287
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,280
It's all about you.

288
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,080
Think about yourself for once!

289
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:23,960
I already thought it through.

290
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,520
I just want to be with you.

291
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,600
Even when we're in the same class...

292
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,640
and you're like this.

293
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,080
If we're in different classes,

294
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,000
what would you be?

295
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,120
You’d...

296
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,320
probably have new friends.

297
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,400
But I don’t want new friends;

298
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,200
I told you I want to be with you.

299
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,200
The reason why you push me like this...

300
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,040
Is it because I told you I liked you?

301
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,120
Can we forget about it?

302
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,040
Go back to how we were.

303
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,280
How can I forget that?

304
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,800
Hey!

305
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,200
Yeah!

306
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,440
I’m sorry for coming here,

307
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,040
but we need to talk about this.

308
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
How long have you known?

309
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,600
And then...

310
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,480
Does anyone else know?

311
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,200
Grace knows,

312
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,160
but I didn’t tell her.

313
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,360
She already knew this.

314
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:05,600
Do you know why I didn’t want you to come?

315
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,960
I didn’t want you to see me like this.

316
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,360
I don't know what to do...

317
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,560
I don't know what to say.

318
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:41,800
You don't have to say anything.

319
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,800
If you’d rather let it go, then I’ll let it go too.

320
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,400
I’ll be right here with you.

321
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:45,160
[Phun already knows now.]

322
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,160
[Did you tell him?]

323
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,320
[He saw the clip.]

324
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,840
[Damn it!]

325
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,240
[I didn't mean you]
[Mistakes can happen]
[What's next?]

326
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,720
[Nothing]
[It's up to him]

327
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,520
[Geez, Nong Noh!]
[Is the supermarket in Chiang Mai?]

328
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,080
Oh shit!

329
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,480
[Teacher] Two sources are in the same medium.

330
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,520
produce continuous waves with the same amplitude,

331
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,520
, frequency, and wavelength.

332
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,320
They are light sources,

333
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,280
or coherent sources.

334
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:42,240
The waves spread out, as shown in figure 9.23.

335
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:47,400
Moving waves cause interference throughout the day.

336
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:48,840
Naphat!
[Noh's first name]

337
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,040
Are you following?

338
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,040
Can you answer?

339
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,760
Uh...

340
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,680
Can I help answer?

341
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,040
Let your friend answer, Piti.

342
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,400
Answer me already!

343
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,240
Uh...

344
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,480
I can't.

345
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,400
I thought so;

346
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,280
you’ve been daydreaming since I started.

347
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:24,600
I don’t know what’s so dramatic in your teenage life,

348
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,120
but right now, this is class.

349
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,640
You’re here to study, got it?

350
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,600
Yes, ma’am.

351
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:35,280
Then stand like this until I tell you to sit.

352
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,240
Everyone, keep writing.

353
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,320
Ohm!

354
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,880
I have a mission for you.

355
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,560
Can’t you see I’m eating?

356
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,000
Eh, just a little thing.

357
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,840
What the heck?

358
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
You selling someone’s info?

359
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,440
I'm just being a matchmaker, you know

360
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,160
What the fuck!?

361
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,720
Fi likes Mick?

362
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,240
Fi is a good guy also student president

363
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,080
Lucky Mick!

364
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,200
But does he like him?

365
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,200
Careful, Mick might get mad.

366
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,560
Take good care of those who respect you.

367
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,520
It's rare to have someone like that in your life.

368
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:23,800
Oh shit!

369
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,280
I'll be back.

370
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,200
Mick!

371
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,880
Can I borrow this?

372
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,920
Just smile a bit.

373
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,520
Save it for the afternoon.

374
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,520
[Just smile a bit :)]

375
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,480
[Thanks]
[Smiling already]

376
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,520
Just put it down.

377
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,080
-When’s your birthday
 -Huh?

378
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,960
Are you deaf?!

379
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,880
F-February 14th…

380
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,560
Blood type?

381
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,640
O…

382
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,880
Shirt size?

383
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,440
M…

384
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,560
Shoes?

385
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,400
42…

386
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,920
What about the MBTI?

387
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:18,960
I don't know, sir.

388
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,920
Why're you asking all this??

389
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,200
I'm just keeping records...

390
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,400
of the club member, that's all.

391
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,840
[Detective Mission]

392
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,000
Did someone ask you to ask?

393
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,720
Yeah… it's Fi…

394
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:13,640
I think he’s a good guy. You should try talking to him.

395
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,720
But I’m not into him.

396
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,320
You haven't even talked to him, how do you know?

397
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,480
I just know, sir.

398
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,800
If I don’t like it, I don’t like it.

399
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,600
The person I like is…

400
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,960
I never thought you’d do something like this.

401
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,400
If nothing else,

402
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,080
I’ll be going then.

403
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,520
Goodbye, sir.

404
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,880
-What’s wrong with you?
-What's wrong with you?

405
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,120
What’s wrong?

406
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,560
-What's up with you?
-Something's wrong with you?

407
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,080
-What's wrong with you?
-What's your problem?

408
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,000
-What are you, huh?
-You, it’s you!

409
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,800
What are you doing here?

410
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,600
You need documents for sponsors?

411
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,560
Isn't it supposed to be Fi work?

412
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,840
He’s not available.

413
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,400
And you can do it?

414
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,000
No, I can't.

415
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,040
Totally confused now.

416
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,239
I guess I'll go home in the next life.

417
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:20,560
I can’t stay with you. I have to deliver something to my dad.

418
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,320
Alright, you go. I’ll handle it myself.

419
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:26,080
Go deliver to Dr. Waen!

420
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,000
Asshole! That's my dad name.

421
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,760
-I'm leaving then.
-Alright.

422
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,159
-Let me know if you need help.
-Yeah.

[Documents for sponsors]

424
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,639
[Teacher] Let me check them first.

425
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,080
[Noh] Sure.

426
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,920

-Are you Aim, right?

427
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:07,000
Can we interview you for a quick content piece?

428
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,440
[Aim] Can you not bother me? I want to be alone, don't you see?

429
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,360
[Content creator] All right, no worries then.

00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,760
Waiting for the teacher to check documents.

433
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,000
It takes long?

434
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,280
Shouldn't be.

435
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:57,080
If it's good, I'm outta here.

Yeah!

440
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:21,840
Huh?

441
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,080
Can you?

442
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,440
It's simple stuff.

443
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,000
Just a moment then.

444
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,160
Can you do this one?

445
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,800
Bring them all; I'll do it for you.

446
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Then take it.

447
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,400
Good boy!

448
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,400
Dude, you’re awesome!

449
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,200

450
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,240

I’ll drop you home.

452
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,200
Okay with you?

453
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,400
I’ve called the car.

454
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,560
I’ll take you home myself.

455
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,720
Wow, you're really kind.

456
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,440
God bless!

457
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,960
Sometimes good, sometimes evil.

458
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:04,120
But with you, I always want to be good.

459
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,280
Has the car arrived?

460
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,400
Almost here.

461
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,800
Delete the clip now?

462
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,480
What if the producer saw it?

463
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,560
What would they think?

464
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,800
It's too late now.

465
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,880
Even if deleted, someone else already has it.

466
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,240
Why did she behave this way?

467
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,600
Aim, why did you do this?

468
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,400
I told them I didn't want to be shot.

469
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,160
They are still going to post it? That’s rude.

470
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,160
Aim!

471
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,760
They posted it because you behaved like this.

472
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,560
Behave well; will it kill you?

473
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:31,880
What did I do wrong?

474
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,480
I said I wasn't ready; I didn’t want to be filmed.

475
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,280
You can't be not ready.

476
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:35,760
Who are you?

477
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,360
Still not apologizing, huh?

478
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:40,160
How will I face the series producer now?

479
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,360
If it can’t be, then no need.

480
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,640
I don’t want to be an actress anyway.

481
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,200
It's just that you're forcing me.

482
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,000
Forcing?

483
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,920
What’s so bad about it?

484
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,240
I invested in everything for you,

485
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,480
from your clothes to your social circle.

486
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,400
There are millions of people in this world who would want to be you.

487
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:59,000
But you ruined it just by a video clip.

488
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,360
What's ruined?

489
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:02,440
Myself?

490
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,080
Or your reputation?

491
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,640
Let me tell you something.

492
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,520
Nobody in this world would want to be born as me.

493
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,840
Even my own mother doesn't like me.

494
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,640
You made me get my face done,

495
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,760
you choose my clothes,

496
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:24,320
you made me take singing lessons, dance classes, and golf.

497
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,760
I never wanted to do any of it.

498
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:30,240
And what have you ever done for me?

499
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:34,080
Just love me, you couldn't even do that.

500
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,160
Are you saying I don't love you?

501
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,800
If I didn’t love you,

502
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,040
why would I invest millions to perfect you?

503
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,520
Why would I work so hard to make you perfect?

504
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,080
Huh?

505
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,280
I want you to be in a good environment and be happy.

506
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,360
So you can wear nice clothes like everyone else...

507
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,000
and to have nice things like everyone else.

508
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,480
I’m so tired, do you even know?

509
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,000
And you still say I didn’t do anything?

510
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:05,800
Oh, so this is...

511
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,200
what you think makes me perfect?

512
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,280
All my life,

513
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,720
you told me to do everything,

514
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,440
but you never asked what I wanted to do,

515
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,840
or what I wanted to be.

516
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,440
But I’m done now.

517
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,600
I don’t want to be perfect anymore.

518
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,400
If you can't love me as I am,

519
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,600
that’s your problem,

520
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,200
because this is who I am!

521
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:41,640
-Nong Aim!
-Aim!

522
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,440
-Nong Aim, don't go yet.
-Eh, Aim!

523
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:44,960
Come back now.

524
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,520
I'm making a deal with the producer, understand?

525
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:03,360
[Phun] Wow, thank you so much.

526
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,160
[Noh] Thank you!

527
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,360
Wow!

528
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:11,080
I’m telling you, this place is the best!

529
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,040
My dad loves it.

530
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,320
Thought you’d head home early, Noh.

531
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,040
Why rush?

532
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,960
I gotta treat you to dinner first.

533
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,760
You helped me a lot today.

534
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,920
Come on, let's eat.

535
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,760
You eat a lot too.

536
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:34,800
That's enough.

537
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:36,600
It fell off here.

538
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:46,040
Phun!

539
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,240
How's the band?

540
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,720
Started the practice yet?

541
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:54,800
Yep, we even have a surprise.

542
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,400
Surprise?

543
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,440
What surprise?

544
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,120
Not telling.

545
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,200
Up to you.

546
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,120
What's with the smile?

547
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,000
No, nothing.

548
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:20,440
And then...

549
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:22,760
Aren’t you going to ask about that day?

550
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:24,440
That day?

551
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:25,840
What was that?

552
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:29,360
Oh, yeah.

553
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:32,600
That thing, right?

554
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,080
Forget it.

555
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,600
it’s your business anyway.

556
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:43,280
If you need help, just let me know.

557
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,200
Right now,

558
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,120
help me finish this off first.

559
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,440
How I'm supposed to eat it all?

560
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:08,800
Ahhh!

561
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,240
Have another bite.

562
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:12,680
That's enough.

563
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:16,000
Go on, eat a lot, grow fast.

564
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:17,640
How is it?

565
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:19,120
Delicious.

566
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,520
Missing one book, right?

567
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,400
You’re pretty clever, huh?

568
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:42,840
DOG!

569
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:47,680
Another book is on its way, and I’ll send it to the faculty myself.

570
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,800
Alright, I’ll tell my dad.

571
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,600
All set now, right?

572
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:53,000
All set’ means the money, right?

573
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,280
-Yes, sir!
- Payment’s done!

574
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:55,840
Your dad’s not like you guys.

575
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:58,160
You make it sound so bad.

576
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:03,080
If you're free, ask the teacher to stop by me.

577
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:04,680
I've got a lot of things to show.

578
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:08,240
Here’s your stuff.

579
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:11,480
Thank you.

580
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,280
But I'm not paying for this.

581
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,360
Just kidding, I've paid it all.

582
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:19,720
What will you do now?

583
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,920
I'm waiting for your school kid here.

584
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:24,480
Said he’d come buy the horn from me.

585
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,320
So I bought them for him to choose from.

586
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:27,800
From my school?

587
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:31,680
Here he is.

588
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:33,880
-Hello, sir!
-Hey, there!

589
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:01,880
Mick!

590
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,600
You buying the horn, huh?

591
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:08,680
I only look at it for practice at home.

592
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:12,560
Isn’t it too soon?

593
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:13,920
How do you know you’ll like it?

594
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:16,080
You might play it and then not like it.

595
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,080
Just wait and see.

596
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:19,920
It's okay, sir.

597
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:23,080
I’m the kind of person who knows quickly what I like.

598
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,320
If I like something, I just do.

599
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:27,120
Time doesn’t matter.

600
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:36,680
[Fi] How's the mission going?

601
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:39,160
[Fi] Don't be so quiet.

602
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:57,920
[Fi] Someone said they saw you guys at the mall.
 [Fi] Really?
[Fi] Can I go there?
[Fi] Don't be quiet.
[Fi] Don't want the shirt anymore?

603
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:00,640
P' Ohm!

604
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,280
I'm sorry.

605
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,000
Sorry for what?

606
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:09,680
I was rude to you earlier today.

607
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:25,680
Mick... look at this.

608
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:30,080
Fi was actually hiring me.

609
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:32,520
-Hiring?
-Yeah!

610
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:35,200
But I won't do that anymore.

611
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:36,960
If you don't like it.

612
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:40,200
I probably couldn’t like him.

613
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:00,680
Mick!

614
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:02,640
I give it to you.

615
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,200
And don't be mad at me, okay?

616
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:09,400
Oh, I wasn't angry at first, sir.

617
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:18,360
P' Ohm!

618
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:20,360
Are you really giving this to me?

619
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:23,240
Yeah!

620
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,320
I don't know how long you'll like blowing the horn,

621
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:30,360
but since you're with it now, I think you should have this.

622
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,440
P' Ohm, don’t forget what I told you.

623
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:43,560
I’m quick to know when I like something,

624
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:47,920
And I won’t give up on it easily.

625
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:50,280
I mean the horn, and you.

626
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:01,440
I like you, P' Ohm.

627
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:03,480
And I'll even make you my boyfriend.

628
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:05,320
You get ready for that.

629
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:38,600
[Aim] Lee, stop being so damn sarcastic!

630
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,000
[Aim] Don't you feel sorry for me?!

631
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:44,040
[Aim] You don't love her. You love me.

632
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:46,400
[Aim] And now I love you.

633
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:49,120
What more do you want?!

634
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,240
I used to love you,

635
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:53,920
but it's over now.

636
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:57,200
It ended since the day you chose Phun.

637
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:00,840
You left me, what else do you want?

638
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,760
It's not like that, Lee.

639
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:06,920
I thought it could work with Phun,

640
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:09,320
but it wasn't possible, Lee.

641
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:12,400
I never stopped loving you.

642
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:14,360
Never even forgot you.

643
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,000
Even though I was with Phun,

644
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:18,760
I was always thinking of you.

645
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,480
[Lee] Enough already.

646
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:25,520
I have someone I love now; I've moved on.

647
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:27,880
Let's just be friends, okay?

648
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:31,920
Lee, come back.

649
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:33,200
Lee!

650
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:36,280
Come back here, Lee!

651
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,520
Why didn't you come back to talk with me?

652
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,120
[Aim] Why didn't you come?

653
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:45,160
Come back and talk to me!

654
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:46,880
Come back here!

655
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:48,480
Aim, be careful!

656
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:50,440
Lee!

657
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,600
Don't go with anyone else, Lee!

658
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:03,520
I have no one left...

659
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:05,960
Mom doesn't want me anymore...

660
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:07,760
I really have no one left...

661
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,640
Stay with me!

662
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:28,440
I wanna be with you.

663
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,000
Does everyone have a safe zone?

664
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:10,000
Someone who just seeing their face makes you feel at ease...

665
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:12,080
Do you realize that you just smiled today.

666
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:13,080
Mr. President,

667
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:15,080
please don't just flirt here beside the stage.

668
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:17,160
Right now, the amp is broken.

669
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:19,680
Noh!

670
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:21,000
Huh?

671
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:24,440
Tomorrow, I have something to tell you.

672
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:32,400
