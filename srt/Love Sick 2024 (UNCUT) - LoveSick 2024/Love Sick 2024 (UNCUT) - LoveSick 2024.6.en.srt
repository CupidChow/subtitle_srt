00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,800
[English subtitles available].
P'Taeng!

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,600
Nah, they’re not a ship.

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,160
-The real deal.
-She even bragged to me.

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,400
Said they’re going to Hua Hin.

5
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:08,840
Hua Hin?

6
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,840
That thing you said about the four of us being on a trip...

7
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:11,640
You serious?

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,640
Yup!

9
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,600
My mom just redeemed some credit card points.

10
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,720
It's for a hotel in Hua Hin, two nights.

11
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,240
Eh, Phun and Aim still together?

12
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:22,880
Of course.

13
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,600
My friend had been chatting with her for days,

14
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,200
and my friend said she also likes girls.

15
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,560
Turns out it was Aim!!

16
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,240
Aim, really...?

17
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,600
Eh, one by one.

18
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,200
You’re asking me this much?

19
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,680
Better get your friends to sign up too!

20
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,400
Here we go. We're going to sign up anyway.

21
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:34,920
Take a look!

22
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:45,759
That’s so cool.

23
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:46,920
I wanna compete!

24
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,360
Why though?

25
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,000
To make the girls scream, duh!

26
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:50,920
Count me in!

27
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,800
We’ll make those girls scream like crazy!

28
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,600
Ugh, headache.

29
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,600
Khom, you just don’t get it.

30
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:58,400
Okay, listen up.

31
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:00,480
If we compete, our followers go up.

32
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,800
Idol life, get rich!

33
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,440
We get sponsorships!

34
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,600
Cast the Y series, rich!

35
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,760
Before you hit the drama scene,

36
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,039
Maybe try this first.

37
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:09,960
What instrument you can play?

38
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:10,880
A tambourine!

39
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,760
You jerk!

40
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,920
Hey! I told you guys to discuss,

41
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,800
not to chit-chat.

42
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,240
Since you're like this, I've got no choice.

43
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,440
Class 5/5

44
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,920
besides collecting trash if you fail,

45
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,280
If your average score is below 65%

46
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,320
you'll scrub toilets too!!

47
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,520
Man, I can’t even keep up with the class.

48
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,000
I’m barely scraping a 70.

49
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:22,079
Now they’re talking 65? Hell no!

50
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,400
Guess I better start training to clean toilets then.

51
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,440
Yo, don’t pass out yet!

52
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,280
You guys know about manifesting?

53
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,680
What’s that even mean, bro?

54
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,600
Law of attraction, man.

55
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,040
If you think positive stuff,

56
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,240
you attract positive stuff!

57
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,120
So if you believe you’ll pass the exam,

58
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,600
you’ll pass, simple as that!

59
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,000
I've thought like that for 3 semesters now, you know.

60
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,720
Noh!

61
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:48,920
Hey!

62
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,960
I just submitted my application.

63
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,640
You got a band?

64
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,880
Yeah, with the cheer squad.

65
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,080
The student council has a band too.

66
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,240
Alright, let’s compete!

67
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:16,840
Earn!

68
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,440
Of course!

69
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,120
Let’s do it!

70
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,280
Yeah!

71
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,800
That’s the spirit!

72
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,000
Come on Phun, I'll treat you to lunch!

73
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,560
-I’m off.
-See you!

74
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:40,640
Damn!

75
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,120
That kid's so cute.

76
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,159
That's Mick from 9th grade, from the music club.

77
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,520
Your kid, Noh?

78
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,560
Nah, not mine.

79
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,159
Nah, Ohm's kid.

80
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,640
[Ohm's mouth] Fuck you!

81
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,840
Ohm!

82
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,080
So what are you teaching the kid?

83
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,680
He chose horn.

84
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,080
I’m planning to teach him on Friday.

85
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,480
Come along, man!

86
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,760
Friday? Can't make it...

87
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,840
I might be sick.

88
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,800
-Sick in advance? You little shit, spill it!!!
-It's normal.

89
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,280
What BS are you on?

90
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,520
-You’re coming with me Friday, no excuses.
-Not going.

91
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,840
Seriously?

92
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,600
-You want me to teach him solo?
-Yeah!

93
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,240
-You mean just you and Phun?
-You idiot!

94
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,600
Damn it!

95
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,680
[EP6 Lee]

96
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,560
Friday, going to Hua Hin.

97
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,040
-You dance wrong.
-Oh!

98
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Eh, let's do this first.

99
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,080
One sec, Noh.

100
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,360
Hello?

101
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,280
Where’d everyone go?

102
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,640
We’re out on a trip.

103
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,120
You left me stuck with Nan here?

104
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,360
What about Lee?

105
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,400
She’s on vacation too.

106
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,159
Well, enjoy your studies, I’ll enjoy the trip for you!

107
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,880
-Noh, say hi!
-Hey there!

108
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,480
Gotta go! Get ready for some juicy stories!

109
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,800
Will you buy things for your friends?

110
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,640
That's right, maybe you need to help me buy.

111
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,240
Of course!

112
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,840
[Jeen] Yuri!

113
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:26,120
[Jeen] You two couples really went together?

114
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,480
[Yuri] Yes.

115
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,600
[Yuri] Aim and me; Noh and Phun.

116
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:42,840
[Jeen] Oh my, two couples: you and Noh, Aim and Phun!

117
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,840
[Yuri] What's the difference?

118
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,000
[Jeen] Don't say I didn't tell you!

119
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,800
Aim goes on a trip with her boyfriend.

120
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,360
[Jeen] She has to stay with her boyfriend, right?

121
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,920
[Jeen] And as for you and Noh...

122
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,560
[Yuri] No way, Aim has to stay with me! And Noh will stay with Phun.

123
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,400
[Jeen] Did you come up with it yourself or did you ask Noh?

124
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:39,000
[Jeen] You never know, maybe Noh agreed to come because he has something in mind.

125
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,600
[Jeen] Exciting!

126
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,600
[Jeen] My friend’s finally getting a hubby!

127
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,080
Aim!

128
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,040
Wanna take a pic?

129
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,280
Alright.

130
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,360
1, 2, 3!

131
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,280
I'll tag you.

132
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,880
[Aim to Lee] Where're you ?

133
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,120
Want a snack?

134
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,120
It's gonna be a while before we get there.

135
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,040
[Jeen] You never know, maybe Noh agreed to come because he has something in mind.
Exciting! My friend’s finally getting a hubby!

136
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,360
Yu!!!

137
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,200
Eek! You scared me!

138
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,560
What's to be scared of? It's just me!

139
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,440
That's right,

140
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,120
'just you.'

141
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,800
Why would I be scared?

142
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,160
Noh!

143
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,440
That spot’s really nice! Let’s take some pics!

144
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,080
-Let's go!
-Okay.

145
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,280
Whoa...

146
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,240
The hotel is so big.

147
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,880
Noh, hurry up!

148
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,000
Hurry, Phun!

149
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,400
What?

150
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,640
I won't carry it.

151
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,600
You carry it. I'm off.

152
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,800
Yu!! Wait for me.

153
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:33,840
Hurry up!

154
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:44,720
Noh!

155
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,960
We’re so close to the beach!

156
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,680
I really wanna swim, let’s go later, yeah?

157
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,440
And there is cake. Yoo wants to eat a lot.

158
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,120
I can sit and wait. I'll be right here.

159
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,280
Whoa.

160
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,120
I want to eat a lot of things.

161
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,720
And there’s cake over there too.

162
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,640
-Noh!
-Hmm?

163
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,840
What do we do, No? We haven't stopped eating all day!

164
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,280
Oh, isn't that good?

165
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,760
We'll have our own floaties.

166
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,440
Whoa.

167
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,600
Those floaties might sink instead!

168
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,640
Bullying!?

169
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:16,400
Yeah, really. Look how many there are.

170
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,080
Let’s go!

171
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,800
Here, the key card for you guys.

172
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,520
For us?

173
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,040
Yeah, for you and Noh.

174
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,760
Huh?

175
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,880
Why split the rooms like that?

176
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,520
Isn't it good?

177
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,560
I think we should separate boys and girls.

178
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,560
What do you think?

179
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,040
I...

180
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,160
I...

181
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,600
whatever works...

182
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,040
Hey!

183
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,880
Isn't that Ann-Panthiwa's daughter?

184
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,760
Wow, they said she wasn't pretty as a kid,

185
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,080
but now she's as beautiful as her mom!

186
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,360
A lot of people knows Aim,

187
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,520
and Yuri doesn't seem comfortable.

188
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,240
Aim, you should room with Yu.

189
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,800
Oh, really?

190
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:08,200
I’m sorry, I thought you wanted to hang out with Noh,

191
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,760
, so I figured you’d want to room with him. My bad.

192
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,640
I do wanna hang out with Noh, and you.

193
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,560
but I'd rather room with you...

194
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,600
So you can teach me how to curl my hair.

195
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,120
Alright, I brought my stuff.

196
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:20,960
We'll do it tonight.

197
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,760
Really?

198
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,800
Let’s go!

199
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,640
Bye Noh!

200
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,560
Bye!

201
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,520
You're slow!

202
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,680
Not even helping.

203
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,040
This bed is insanely soft!

204
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,440
Noh!

205
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,080
Why’d you say that?

206
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,080
Saying “whatever works”?

207
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,360
Oh.

208
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,480
I’m good with whatever.

209
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,120
That’s not good!

210
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,680
None of it's good.

211
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,440
Rooming with Yu isn't good,

212
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,800
rooming with you is..

213
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,080
Is' what?

214
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,040
Phun...

215
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:07,960
I'll ask straight up.

216
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,480
Why do you want to room with me?

217
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,960
There's four of us.

218
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,320
If not with you,

219
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,080
who else I sleep with?

220
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,960
I'm not thinking anything weird..

221
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,080
unlike...

222
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,160
I'm not thinking either!

223
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:41,920
I'm not thinking...

224
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:43,880
I'll go take a shower.

225
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,560
The door's so stiff!

226
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,000
Check out this...

227
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,160
The sick man went all the way to Hua Hin to see a doctor.

228
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:17,960
Where?

229
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,680
Damn it! That’s Poon’s RV, right?

230
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,280
I recognize the sticker.

231
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,160
Here we go again with this couple.

232
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,960
I smell something going on.

233
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,520
What are you waiting for?

234
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:49,800
What did I tell you?

235
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,800
Where did I tell you to blow from?!

236
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,080
-The... stomach, sir.
-Do it again.

237
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,160
Shoulders up means you're still breathing wrong!

238
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,440
Again!

239
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:36,880
That's enough.

240
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,160
That's all you've got?! Forget it.

241
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,880
Go run laps instead!

242
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:48,880
So harsh...

243
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,520
Harsh?

244
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,000
Like you when you yelled at Win, right?

245
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,200
Hey, Mick!

246
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,760
Hang in there!

247
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,480
You got this, it’s chill.

248
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,840
Come and let's take a pic.

249
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,560
1..2...cheese!

250
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,080
Give it to me.

251
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,800
Stop fighting over it!

252
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,040
Eh, it'll explode.

253
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,520
Come and catch me.

254
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,480
They’re going to Hua Hin to propose, huh?

255
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,040
Aim, can you get the ball for me?

256
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,000
-Oh no, Aim!
-Eh, Aim!

257
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,120
What happened? Let me see first.

258
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,360
Is it too tight?

259
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,120
Avoid using this foot for now.

260
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:24,840
Keep applying cold compresses for about 20 minutes.

261
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:29,080
But if the pain gets worse, better go to the hospital.

262
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:29,880
Thank you.

263
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,480
Does it hurt a lot?

264
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,680
If it hurts too much, you can cry if you need to.

265
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,480
I’m right here.

266
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:40,880
Remember, Aim?

267
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,960
The first day we met?

268
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,080
You were sitting there crying, just like this.

269
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,320
I always wondered...

270
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,200
why you cried

271
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,160
when everything seemed perfect.

272
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,080
But if it hurts,

273
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,240
no matter how strong you are,

274
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,160
It still hurts.

275
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,120
I’m sorry.

276
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,080
I don’t want to make you cry again.

277
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:36,840
But today,

278
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,280
You know what?

279
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,120
You’re the only guy...

280
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:00,160
that I feel comfortable around.

281
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,320
I’m really happy.

282
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,040
to have met you.

283
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:14,720
I’m happy too.

284
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,040
Is Aim gonna be okay?

285
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,440
She seemed completely still.

286
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,080
Phun can take care of her.

287
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,040
Don’t worry.

288
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:00,200
[Jeen] Maybe Noh agreed to come

289
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,560
[Jeen] because he has something in mind.

290
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,760
[Jeen] Exciting! My friend’s finally getting a hubby!

291
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,360
Yu!!!

292
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,480
Are you okay?

293
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,480
Yu!!!

294
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,160
Hey, what are you doing?

295
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,360
What are you doing?

296
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,080
Wanna try it?

297
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,560
Try what?

298
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,240
What do you think I am?

299
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,360
You’re a guy.

300
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,600
And guys wanna do everything, right?

301
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,600
Then put it on, and we’ll talk.

302
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,480
Put it on, or I’m not talking.

303
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,280
Turn around.

304
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,760
What're you doing?

305
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:35,960
I just wanted to test...

306
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,640
if you turn out to be an opportunist?

307
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,080
This isn’t a joke.

308
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,040
Don’t play games like this again, got it?

309
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,800
Okay, I won't do it again...

310
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,320
But I knew...

311
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,360
I could trust you.

312
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:17,040
I've been flirting forever and you never cared.

313
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,520
You're so tough!

314
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:27,280
I wonder what kind of person you'd like...

315
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,800
When you find someone,

316
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,520
tell me first, okay?

317
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,560
If one day...

318
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,480
I ever mess up,

319
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,480
promise you won't hate me?

320
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:02,840
At least...

321
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,400
Can we stay friends?

322
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:13,880
Sure thing.

323
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,880
Whatever you want me to be,

324
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,800
I'll be that.

325
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:00,120
-What?
-Can I get a hug?

326
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,120
As a friend, of course.

327
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,480
-Hello?
[Aim's mom] -Aim!

328
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,200
[Aim's mom] - Where are you? What are you doing?

329
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,560
I’m in Hua Hin already.

330
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:50,000
[Aim's mom] You didn’t forget about that review I asked for, did you?

331
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,360
Nope, didn’t forget.

332
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:53,880
2 sets

333
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,720
And one sunscreen review.

334
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,040
[Aim's mom] Aim!

335
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,000
[Aim's mom] This job’s really important.

336
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,480
You have to finish it quickly, okay?

337
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,280
Okay.

338
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,600
You have to shoot a review?

339
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,520
Yeah.

340
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,280
Mom called to remind me.

341
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,080
But I’m not sure if I can do it.

342
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,600
It’s fine, I'll help you.

343
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,440
I’ll make sure the shots come out great.

344
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:00,880
Go fall for someone nice.

345
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,080
You.

346
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,360
You’re the best.

347
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,280
That's true.

348
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,040
Sorry for...

349
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,960
for being so damn handsome in your life.

350
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,040
Whoa.

351
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,680
Oh, you cocky.

352
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,280
It hurts.

353
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,160
Come on.

354
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,080
Go take a shower.

355
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,159
Hey, Ohm!

356
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,679
You think the kid’s gonna run himself to death?

357
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,239
Who’s stupid enough to do that?

358
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,280
Film, sit down.

359
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,080
Don’t go helping him.

360
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:43,520
With this heat, he’s gonna faint soon.

361
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,560
Listen to me.

362
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,719
A simple rule for life:

363
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,679
You should know yourself best.

364
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,160
If he keeps running until he passes out,

365
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,040
he won't just miss the band—

366
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,400
he won’t make it anywhere.

367
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:03,880
Hey, man.

368
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,440
What are you doing?  Get down here!

369
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,280
-Calm down.
-Calm down for what?

370
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,440
Get down here!

371
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,080
What are you doing up there?

372
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,280
I’ll swim.

373
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,960
It's a pool and we have to swim.

374
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,720
I’m so dumb.

375
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,080
Aren’t you the kid from that day?

376
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:30,880
Yeah.

377
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,240
Thanks so much for helping me out.

378
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:38,040
How's your wound?

379
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,920
It’s fine. Barely a scratch.

380
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:45,960
-Uh, P'...
-Phong.

381
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,480
If you were not there, I'd have been in trouble.

382
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,680
Thank you very much

383
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,480
Why do you always get into trouble?

384
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,800
Wanna learn to be tough?

385
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,760
I can teach you.

386
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,160
Really?

387
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,880
[Film] Damn Ohm!

388
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:39,440
[Film] He supposed to be a mentor, not a drill sergeant!!

389
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,680
[Ohm] So over this FC crap.

390
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,680
[Film] FC my ass.

391
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,320
[Film] See you Monday, man.

392
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,880
Just waiting to bury the mentor, bro.

393
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,440
Couldn't find you in the room. Thought you'd vanished.

394
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,280
Are you finished compressing for Em?

395
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,080
Is she feeling better?

396
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,080
She’s doing better.

397
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:08,960
The swelling’s gone down.

398
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,040
That's good.

399
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,360
You can head back to the room if you want.

400
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,160
It’s gonna rain soon.

401
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,760
It’s been gloomy this whole trip.

402
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:30,640
Noh.

403
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,080
You ever see something you wish you hadn't?

404
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,240
Something you didn’t wanna see?

405
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,280
What?

406
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,080
Do you see ghosts?

407
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,280
Did you see one?!

408
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,760
Dude, I’m not joking.

409
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,560
I’m actually scared.

410
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,160
Not that.

411
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:54,920
Then what?

412
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:04,680
Well,

413
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,440
I saw you and Yuri...

414
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,040
hugging on the beach.

415
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:44,680
I’ll head up to the room.

416
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:50,920
Phun!

417
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,120
So, do you love Aim?

418
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,760
I don't know.

419
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,600
But I want her to be happy.

420
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,000
Then you probably do love her.

421
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:23,960
What if it were the same for you?

422
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,160
I feel that way about you too...

423
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,320
Sorry that I can't let you go.

424
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,160
I wanna do better than this.

425
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,720
but... I don't think I can do it.

426
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,440
I can't either.

427
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:47,680
Let me see the picture.

428
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,600
I think standing is better.

429
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,640
So we can see the outfit clearly.

430
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,880
- You okay to stand?
- Can you help me?

431
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:06,400
Are you alright?

432
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:21,320
Noh!

433
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:24,480
You're so cute when you're sleepy!

434
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:26,640
Eh!

435
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:28,520
Delete that!

436
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,840
-Look, you're so cute.
-You posting that on IG?

437
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:31,880
Yeah!

438
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,080
-I wanna post it because it's cute.
-Nope, it's not.

439
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,240
-Please, Noh!
-Don't post it.

440
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:39,640
-Nope, I'll post it.
-Just delete it.

441
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:41,560
Lee!

442
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:43,240
Hey!

443
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,440
-Hello, P'Tang!
-Hey there!

444
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:52,240
Aim!

445
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,680
Are you staying here too?

446
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:57,680
I didn’t even know!

447
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:00,200
'Cause all you care about is Noh.

448
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:01,560
That's harsh.

449
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:04,760
I’m going to eat now.

450
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:06,040
I’m starving. Don't wanna third-wheel.

451
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:09,160
Okay, have a good day.

452
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,240
Is everyone full yet?

453
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,120
Do you want to eat anything else?

454
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,880
But with Aim’s foot like this,

455
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,720
she probably can’t go anywhere, right?

456
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:37,120
-I’m okay, I can manage.
-It's okay.

457
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:38,840
Plus, it’s too hot out.

458
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,680
Let’s just chill at the hotel.

459
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:48,480
But I heard the fried bananas on Soi 55 are really good.

460
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,080
I really want some.

461
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:53,120
Noh, could you take me to get some fried bananas?

462
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,480
I’m still not full!

463
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:00,600
It’ll be quick, Noh. Come with me please.

464
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:03,480
Please, please.

465
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:05,880
I’ll go with you.

466
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:06,960
Really?

467
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,080
-Yeah!
-Yay! Going with Poon!

468
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:11,560
Noh, stay here with Aim, okay?

469
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:12,760
I’ll bring you back some bananas.

470
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:14,680
Let me know if you want anything.

471
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:15,960
Let's go, Phun!

472
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,640
I’m gonna hit the restroom.

473
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:30,400
Yeah!

474
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,280
[Aim] I have something to talk to you.

475
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,000
[Aim] See you in the hallway.

476
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,040
Hey, Knot.

477
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:07,760
When's the Prakit assignment due?.

478
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:12,200
Yesterday?

479
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:13,520
I thought that today

480
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:14,840
-And you missed it?
-Per!

481
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:17,600
Hold on a sec.

482
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,000
Hello, Dream!

483
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:31,080
Here’s your water.

484
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,400
Thanks.

485
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:34,800
Hey,

486
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,640
Mr. Tin and Ms. B not home?

487
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Nope, they’re out.

488
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:43,160
I brought this for you.

489
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:46,240
Don’t forget to put it in the fridge, or it’ll go bad.

490
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:47,120
Got it.

491
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:48,640
You bought a lot.

492
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:51,080
Win said you like this stuff.

493
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,280
Well, then...

494
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,720
How it's going?

495
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,760
Has Win mentioned it again?

496
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,560
Sometimes!

497
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:07,040
But don’t forget,

498
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:10,920
Don’t go soft on Win, or you’ll only cause trouble.

499
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,200
And if Dad finds out, he’ll kill him.

500
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:20,720
Got it.

501
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,360
[Yuri] The stall's closed.

502
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:32,680
[Yuri] I'm gonna cry.

503
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:40,520
[Noh] What now?

504
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:45,640
[Yuri] Phun's looking for another place.
[Yuri] We MUST have banana fritters today!!!

505
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:50,440
So you're dating her?

506
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:53,320
Answer me!

507
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,920
Not yet... but soon.

508
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,400
Why are you doing this?!

509
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:01,240
Don't you care about me?

510
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:02,920
You did care about me?

511
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,440
Can you stop this?

512
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:06,160
Easy for you to say,

513
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:08,200
you've got someone else!

514
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,600
When I said I loved you, did you even think about it?

515
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:15,880
Why are you doing this?

516
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:21,000
Why are you being so cruel?

517
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:21,880
You... you...

518
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,320
You, you, you!

519
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:30,320
Did you hear?

520
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:32,240
Aim’s not coming?

521
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:33,840
You all knew already?

522
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:35,680
Is she sick or something?

523
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:37,440
She didn't answer me.

524
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:38,680
I...

525
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:44,880
I don’t know either.

526
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:46,560
Damn!

527
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:48,640
Come here!

528
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,640
[Aim] Can we talk now?

529
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,080
[Aim] Answer me.

530
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:00,440
[Aim] Why the silence?

531
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:04,720
[Aim] Please answer me.

532
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:12,520
[Aim] Lee, don’t be so quiet

533
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:34,760
Isn’t that Nong Aim?

534
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:38,080
-Yes, she looks familiar. She's the celebrity's daughter.
-That's right.

535
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:42,680
Hello, Aim, right?

536
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:45,760
Can we interview you for a quick content piece?

537
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,240
Can we interview you for a quick content piece?

538
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:50,320
This won’t take more than five minutes,

539
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:52,400
we rarely get to see you, you’re so hard to catch!

540
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:54,280
In person, you’re absolutely gorgeous and perfect!

541
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:56,280
Back off!

542
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:02,040
I just want to be left alone.

543
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:03,080
Can’t you see that?

544
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:08,240
Alright, fine, we’ll back off.

545
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:48,080
You went all the way to Hua Hin, and you only brought this?

546
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:50,360
If you’re gonna complain, don’t eat it.

547
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:53,720
I'll eat it. I'm not complaining.

548
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:56,760
By the way...

549
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:00,080
So what's up for Friday?

550
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:01,600
Nothing much.

551
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:03,560
Ms. Patcharee was looking for you,

552
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:06,280
But we covered saying you skipped to Hua Hin.

553
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:10,960
So, about Hua Hin... are you still single or not?

554
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:17,600
Single

555
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:19,400
Boooo!!!!

556
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:22,280
You're so cold, man.

557
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:24,200
Yuri’s pretty cute, though.

558
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:27,960
If he was gonna date her,  it would’ve happened by now.

559
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:32,880
So, nothing new with Yuri?

560
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:37,080
What about Phun?

561
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,280
Why he's involved?

562
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,680
C'mon, four of you went.

563
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:46,480
So, you roomed with Phun, right?

564
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:48,600
That's right.

565
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:50,480
Last term you guys barely talked.

566
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:53,760
Now you’re suddenly close, like...

567
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:58,880
squish-squish...

568
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:00,360
Eh!

569
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:02,880
Squish my ass!

570
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:08,440
-Noh!
-Yes!

571
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:17,560
Alright, guys.

572
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:19,920
I’m heading out.

573
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:21,400
Okay, go go...

574
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:25,880
What Ken said earlier is true.

575
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:28,800
With such behavior, Ohm is surely doomed.

576
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:36,600
Do you need something?

577
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:39,840
Fee wants to know about the audition date.

578
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:43,760
I've told him before, he never listens.

579
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:45,600
Tell me again.

580
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:47,680
This time I’ll listen.

581
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:51,200
-It’s today.
-Huh?

582
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:54,280
After school. At my club.

583
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:58,160
I haven't prepared anything!

584
00:53:58,600 --> 00:53:59,800
Your problem...

585
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:03,280
Golf, oh Grace are coming too.

586
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:04,800
Don’t be shy.

587
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:07,480
Grace, really?

588
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:12,280
No way, it’s too late now.

589
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:37,480
Yes?

590
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:39,720
Are you free this month?

591
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:47,440
I can’t take this anymore.

592
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:51,680
Can I see you this evening?

593
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:01,480
Where are you now?

594
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:06,040
So...

595
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:07,480
Why don’t you come by the school?

596
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:09,680
There’s a music event.

597
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:12,480
Maybe listening to music will help.

598
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:17,320
Alright.

599
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:37,080
Just bring her.

600
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:41,360
She seems stressed lately.

601
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:48,160
Yeah.

602
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:06,480
You’re not mad at me, right?

603
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:13,040
Nope!

604
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:18,080
Hey, Noh!

605
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:21,280
What else is up?

606
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:24,240
See you soon then.

607
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:05,720
Mick!

608
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:07,560
Grab the tape, will ya?

609
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:16,680
Ouch!

610
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:28,640
You such a...

611
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:36,880
Hey, Ohm!

612
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:39,480
Where are you going?

613
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:52,720
Did it hurt?

614
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:57,680
No, I’m fine.

615
00:57:58,440 --> 00:57:59,240
Thanks.

616
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:09,280
Where the hell is Noh?

617
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:33,720
Hello?

618
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:35,720
Mabuhay!

619
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:38,000
Waited so long.

620
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:39,480
Sorry!

621
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:42,200
Hi, Master!

622
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:46,560
It's me, Supharerk!

623
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:49,520
Oh, Supharerk! Visiting friends?

624
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:52,640
Alright,

625
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:53,760
take care of your friend.

626
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:57,840
Yes, sir!

627
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:08,280
Actually, I coulda walked in myself,

628
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:10,080
you didn't have to come get me.

629
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:12,360
No. There’s something you need to know first.

630
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:13,760
What is it?

631
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:18,080
Hey, Golf!

632
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:20,800
What the fuck!

633
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:22,480
I'm sorry.

634
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:24,680
This is Grace.

635
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:28,760
She used to study here but now she's at an international school.

636
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:32,560
Oh, this is Aim.

637
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:34,760
She's my girlfriend.

638
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:39,320
Hey there...

639
00:59:57,360 --> 01:00:01,720
Damn, the band inside is playing so well!

640
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:04,000
Are we gonna beat them?

641
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:27,000
Hey!

642
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:28,680
What are you doing here?

643
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:33,640
-Waiting for you.
-Why are you waiting?

644
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:36,640
Why? I can wait.

645
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:38,720
We could call a ride back together.

646
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:40,320
I told you, don’t wait.

647
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:44,520
-But—
-I said don’t, so don’t!

648
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:45,960
Can’t you understand?

649
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:48,280
What the hell are you standing around here?

650
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:49,920
You are not involved.

651
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Just go home!

652
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:57,160
I'm sorry.

653
01:00:57,160 --> 01:01:00,080
Nothing, just friends saying hello.

654
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:03,480
I think you should go back first.

655
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:05,640
I'll handle the audition.

656
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:07,320
Go first!

657
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:11,560
-Please come in!
-Alright, let's go.

658
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:16,320
Do your best, guys!

659
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:38,040
Noh, you see...

660
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:39,320
Two songs each band.

661
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:41,440
We'll be here till next year.

662
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:43,280
Yeah, I'm sleepy now.

663
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:47,120
Noh!

664
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:49,360
Think Phun's scared you're mad?

665
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:50,280
For bringing an outsider?

666
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:37,360
Next up...

667
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,680
Let's applause for

668
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:44,160
The band from Cheer Club!

669
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:15,360
Damn Noh!

670
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:18,320
Are you cheating? He hasn't started singing!

671
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:21,480
I already know they’re good.

672
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:23,680
How? He didn't sing yet.

673
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:25,360
You'll see.

674
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:00,440
Does it hurt a lot?

675
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:02,160
Let me help you.

676
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:04,760
Thank you.

677
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:09,880
But I like girls, actually.

678
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:12,760
Bye, dude!

679
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:17,840
Alright.

680
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:18,880
You like girls, huh?

681
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:31,360
Noh!

682
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:33,440
Hey!

683
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:37,640
Are you sleepy, Noh?

684
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:41,360
No, I’m not.

685
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:43,160
So...

686
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:46,680
Could you really listen to this song?

687
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:47,960
Oh!

688
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:54,280
Could you really listen to this song?

689
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:51,840
Hey!

690
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:53,160
You’re still here?

691
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:54,840
I’ll stay with you.

692
01:06:55,880 --> 01:06:56,880
So let's do something else.

693
01:06:57,600 --> 01:06:58,400
Noh!

694
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:01,440
So, what’s going on with you and Phun?

695
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:02,840
It’s kinda weird.

696
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:05,400
Weird? We’re just friends.

697
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:09,680
So, what’s up with Ern?

698
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:19,280
