[English subtitles available]
Noh, do you want pork?

2
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:17,500
I'm sorry about what happened earlier.

3
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,770
It's okay.

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,370
It was just a game.

5
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:23,400
Even if you don't think anything...

6
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,930
but I do.

[11th grade, 1st semester]

8
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,330
When voting for the cheerleading president,

9
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,400
-who’d you vote for?
-I voted for Oi. What about you?

10
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,600
Same. Oi too.

11
00:00:58,030 --> 00:00:59,800
Everyone I know voted for Oi.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,300
So how did he win?

13
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:03,400
Makes no sense! Didn’t you know?

14
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,830
Oi actually won the votes, man.

15
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:08,100
Wait, then why?

16
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,630
But his grades weren't good enough.

17
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,600
So that’s why Earn got it.

18
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:14,400
That's weird.

19
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,430
Everybody wanted Oi, man.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,170
Damn it, don't say it too loud.

21
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,530
Yo, Earn!

22
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:22,130
Congrats!

23
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:24,170
New cheerleading president!

24
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,100
Uh, appreciate it.

25
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:34,630
Now that you’re president, what’s the plan?

26
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:38,300
Oh, I just finished measuring the stand areas.

27
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:40,930
This year, I wanna give the juniors some space.

28
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:44,330
Like, for drinks and snacks and stuff.

29
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:48,229
Dude, you’re so thoughtful.

30
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:50,700
Definitely my right choice...

31
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:52,430
to choose you.

32
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,000
Did you choose me?

33
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:00,930
Yeah!

34
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,470
Thanks, man.

35
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:08,800
I won’t let the school down.

36
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,800
Why are you so stressed?

37
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,200
Chill out, man!

38
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,270
It's just a school event.

39
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,600
If you're not enjoying it, why bother?

40
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:20,730
Screw what the school thinks.

41
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,470
Let's do something like...

42
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,470
even 10 years from now, you'll think about it.

43
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,070
We're only young once.

44
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,670
Something that is not cool, we skip it.

45
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,200
Right!

46
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:38,500
Being young happens only once.

47
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,170
Something that is not cool, we skip it.

48
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,900
That’s what I’m talking about.

49
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,970
That's great, dude!

50
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:50,870
Let's celebrate!

51
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:55,100
Woohoo! New cheer president!

52
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,030
Why the hell are you here?!

53
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,700
I've been sleeping since last night.

54
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,900
Don't you remember?

55
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,700
I was here too!

56
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,770
Did I dream or what?

57
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,270
The Hunger Ghost killed me in my sleep.

58
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,700
Back home we call this dying in your sleep, dude.

59
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,570
Hey, Ohm! Did you just kill him?

60
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:06,300
I saw you smiling.

61
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,630
Who told you to sleep without putting the tag away?

62
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,900
The ghost is fierce!

[Vetiver grass planting]

64
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,800
Today we’re getting into the camp’s main activity!

65
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,800
We’ll be planting vetiver grass.

66
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,800
Anyone here know what vetiver grass is?

67
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:39,870
Do you know what they're good for?

68
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:45,670
Vetiver grass has strong roots.

69
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,300
It holds the soil together.

70
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,900
Wherever you plant it,

71
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,500
the soil in that area will remain stable.

72
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:52,900
It reduces the risk of landslides.

73
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,200
That’s amazing!

74
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,700
10 points for the Red Team!

75
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,630
Alright, today we’re planting vetiver grass together.

76
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:06,200
We’ll distribute it to communities in need.

77
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:12,500
I'd like two volunteers to come up here.

78
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:13,500
Me?

79
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:26,730
Please.

80
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:31,330
Okay. So you can start us off.

81
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,800
Planting vetiver grass is super easy.

82
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,130
We’ve already prepped the soil.

83
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,600
Just dig a 10 cm hole,

84
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:44,700
add a handful of fertilizer,

85
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:47,030
stick the grass in, and water it.

86
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:49,400
and that's all.

87
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,400
Ohm is fucking dumb!

88
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:56,800
Excuse me, Mr. Tree.

89
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,400
Earn, you do it.

90
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:21,030
Great job, Red Team leader!

91
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:23,830
You guys can head back to your seats now.

92
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,230
Yes, thank you.

93
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,970
Good job, everyone!

94
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:34,929
Phun, how deep did he tell us to dig it?

95
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,500
About 10 cm, I think.

96
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,630
Jeen, measure with your hand.

97
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,799
You didn't talk to me...

98
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:44,900
but you talked to a girl, huh?

99
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,200
What did you say?

100
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:52,270
Nah!

101
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:54,130
You sleepy?

102
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:55,700
You can take a rest then.

103
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:56,500
I'll wake you up.

104
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,130
All good then.

105
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:34,070
Eh! Give me the rose!

106
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,430
Eh, give it to me.

107
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,900
Give it to me!!!

108
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,800
Give me the rose!!!

109
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,000
Alright, here’s the deal.

110
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,400
Everyone spread out to your assigned stations.

111
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,500
Let's go!

112
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,930
Green team, get up and follow me.

113
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,630
Slowly, one by one,

114
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:19,000
Stay in line, guys!

115
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:20,270
Follow along!

116
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:22,300
Yellow group...

117
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,600
Alright, follow them.

118
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,300
Red team,

119
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,270
you’re up next.

120
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:34,170
Are you good, man?

121
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,600
Yeah, I’m good.

122
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:38,300
-I got an A in PE, you know!
-Probably, in swordplay, huh?

123
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,270
F*** off, no!

124
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:43,730
Eh, Earn!

125
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,930
Go help me carry something.

126
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,100
Me?

127
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,000
Yeah!

128
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,630
Where to?

129
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:53,070
Over there.

130
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,000
Alright, let’s go.

131
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:07,470
So hot, so bored, so tired!

132
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:13,500
I got it!

133
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,730
Seriously,

134
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,800
Why do I even have to do this?

135
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,170
It's so hot, and I’m so tired.

136
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:26,300
Tired!

137
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,830
Tired, my ass. Look at what you’re carrying.

138
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,770
Then look what I'm carrying!

139
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,400
Well, I am the spoiled rich kid, aren’t I?

140
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:36,400
-Then why am I stuck doing this crap?
-No, no, no! This ain’t right at all!

141
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,730
You’re the Dr. Waen's son!

142
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:40,700
Waen!!!

143
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,400
Ugh, whatever. Let’s just get this over with, okay?

144
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,800
Whoa, let' go!

145
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:50,900
Turns out my father-in-law’s name is Waen.

146
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,470
Gosh, Nan!

147
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,700
Let’s finish planting.

148
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,300
I just wanna go back already.

149
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,730
Hey, last night,

150
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,030
Did you sleep okay? I think it was cool.

151
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:12,200
Yeah, comfortable. I think it was warm.

152
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:16,000
How about Noh?

153
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,200
-I think...
-Comfortable.

154
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,230
He slept like a log.

155
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,800
How...

156
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:26,770
How do you know it?

157
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:30,500
You awake?

158
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:32,330
You look sleepy.

159
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Sleepy, yeah.

160
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:35,400
You're...

161
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,700
Remember me? I'm Jeed!

162
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,230
From the Convent Music Club!

163
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:42,730
Oh, right!

164
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:47,300
I saw you earlier but didn’t dare say hi.

165
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,700
,thought you might not remember

166
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,400
Oh, you're on the green team?

167
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,800
-Yeah!
-Same as Ngor?

168
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:56,100
Yes, also Per and Mawin.

169
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:57,730
You're on red, Noh?

170
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,430
-Yeah!
-Is green good?

171
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,970
It's good but I think red is better.

172
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,830
-Did you talk to Ngor yet?
-No, I didn't.

173
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,070
How about Per?

174
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:07,030
Um, I didn't talk to him either.

175
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,700
Noh, want to have breakfast with me?

176
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,470
I don't have anyone to eat with.

177
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,800
Yeah.

178
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,230
What's there?

179
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,100
Not sure, let's go see.

180
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,970
What's up?

181
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:26,530
Didn't you say you got an A in PE?

182
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,800
Dude, I need a five-minute break!

183
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,800
Let me see your hands.

184
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:42,200
Almost done, I'll do it myself.

185
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:43,630
I can do it!

186
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,070
It’s fine, really.

187
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:48,130
Save your hands for playing music.

188
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,770
You guys done yet?

189
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:13,300
Almost. What about you?

190
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:15,470
Done.

191
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,730
Others are playing in the water now.

192
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:19,130
Do they play in the water?

193
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,100
Damn, I really want to jump in. Let’s go!

194
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,000
Hey, Nong Mick!

195
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,700
I brought some snacks from home for you.

196
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,300
Wow, thank you so much!

197
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:31,070
That’s so sweet.

198
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,530
Here, have some water too.

199
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:38,300
Thank you so much.

200
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,630
Two glasses of water, please.

201
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,030
P'Nan...

202
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,700
Can I have two glasses of water?

203
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Sure.

204
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:53,630
Here you go.

205
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:58,500
Tired, sis?

206
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:00,100
Exhausted.

207
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,900
My skin’s totally ruined!

208
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:03,400
Here's the fan.

209
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,200
Luckily, my team has trees.

210
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,330
Mine has no trees,

211
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:08,800
but we do have Earn!!

212
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,030
How envious!

213
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,500
He really take care of me!

214
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,000
He's so nice.

215
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:17,200
Takes care of you? He just asked if you were hot.

216
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,900
But the one who helped you to the shade was Noh.

217
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,300
Oh wait,

218
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,600
are you shipping them? Me too!

219
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:25,800
Believe me...

220
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,130
from the look in his eyes,

221
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:29,670
Earn's definitely fallen in love.

222
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,400
Did you come for water?

223
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:39,130
Yeah.

224
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,100
Can I get a glass too?

225
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,930
Sometimes, you need to give things to those who value them.

226
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:55,370
Okay, sure.

227
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,830
Is everyone done?

228
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:28,130
Well,

229
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,630
I think so.

230
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,230
Your friends came here too,

231
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,000
but they went to play in the water now.

232
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,400
Whoa, let's hit the water.

233
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,200
Let's go jump in the water!

234
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:37,200
Wanna go?

235
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:39,070
Let's go!

236
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,130
Oh, wrong way.

237
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:05,830
What do you like about Noh?

238
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:28,170
-C'mon, Win! Let's dance.
-I can't.

239
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,230
It's okay, just enjoy.

240
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:54,470
Hold on!

241
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,230
When did you die?!

242
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,000
When I was going to the bathroom.

243
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:02,000
-Who's the Hunger Ghost then?
-Who is it?

244
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,330
You'll know soon.

245
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:07,970
Or are you a hunger ghost?

246
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:30,870
Yu!

247
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,230
Feling uncomfortable, right?

248
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,170
Cover up first, so it’s not revealing.

249
00:22:56,930 --> 00:22:58,470
You don’t have to give it back.

250
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,770
Why’d you call me out here?

251
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,970
There’s something I’ve been meaning to ask you.

252
00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:57,770
You and Noh...

253
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,700
Is there something going on?

254
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,170
Does it have anything to do with me?

255
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,070
You already know about Phun and Noh, don’t you?

256
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,270
You do?

257
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,970
Are you angry with them?

258
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,530
Why would I be mad?

259
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,200
Well,

260
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,800
those two are...

261
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:41,930
I’m not mad at all.

262
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,000
Actually, I feel relieved.

263
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:51,070
To be honest,

264
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:54,400
I don’t like Phun either.

265
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,230
I like Lee.

266
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:02,800
Huh?

267
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,230
Don’t be mad at Phun and Noh, okay?

268
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:13,930
Otherwise, you’ll have to be mad at me too.

269
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,070
I think back then I didn’t really know myself.

270
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,030
But now,

271
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,500
I've found someone who's right for me.

272
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,730
I hope you can be friends with Noh again, like before.

273
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,000
Damn!

274
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:26,470
The ghost is still fierce tonight!

275
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:27,800
I'm gonna put my name tag away.

276
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,070
How do I put it away?

277
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,800
Since you're here,

278
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,300
can you clean up the dishes?

279
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,600
-Huh?
-I'll help you too.

280
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:38,600
Alright, I'll do it.

281
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:41,800
Hey, Noh, aren’t you scared of the Hunger Ghost?

282
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:42,700
The Hunger Ghost?

283
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,230
Don’t let the ghost follow me then!

284
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:51,170
Hold it carefully.

285
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,400
Damn, this a lot.

286
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,000
Eh, where are you going?

287
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:42,330
Not trying to make up, huh?

288
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,700
Why are you angry at me?

289
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,300
Don't make me remind you about Earn.

290
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,070
I remember everything you said.

291
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:55,500
You only heard part of it.

292
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,070
What would you even know?

293
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:05,330
Don't you trust me?

294
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:10,030
If I didn’t trust you, I wouldn’t be here.

295
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,170
Someone who doesn't trust you

296
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,070
would avoid you,

297
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,000
wouldn't listen to explanations,

298
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,670
and would just be jealous...

299
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,670
like someone around here.

300
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,400
So...

301
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,000
Did Earn kiss you?

302
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,600
Was it like when I kissed you?

303
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,430
Why can't you call it a kiss?

304
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,500
It was just a game.

305
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,230
So what? Did you like it?

306
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,300
Yeah...

307
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:07,630
I like Earn...

308
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,200
as a friend.

309
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,870
But I love you way more than that.

310
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:49,770
Damn, Noh!

311
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:52,930
I almost died just now.

312
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,030
You drive me crazy, you know that?

313
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,200
I'll have to get you back.

314
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,370
Get me back for what?

315
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,000
We’re still at camp, dude.

316
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:45,400
Can’t do that.

317
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:57,100
Exactly! Since it’s camp, I gotta follow the rules.

318
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,200
What, are you a Hunger Ghost?

319
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,830
I never wanted to kill you.

320
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,270
But you’re annoying.

321
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:19,000
When you said you liked Earn, I nearly died.

322
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,330
So now I’m killing you—what’s wrong with that?

323
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,800
Phun!

324
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,830
Watch yourself!

325
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:35,200
We’re even now, right?

326
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,070
Noh!

327
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,770
Did the ghost get you?

328
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:01,830
Yeah!

329
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:05,470
-This sucks!
-How'd you get caught?

330
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:13,070
Damn it.

331
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:15,270
Noh!

332
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,100
I already caught Ohm for you.

333
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:18,900
Look at him first.

334
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:22,200
-Game over.
- It's done.

335
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:24,470
I already told you guys—

336
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:25,700
I’m not a ghost.

337
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:28,570
-Then what are you?  A goose?

338
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:41,200
Why does your stuff only have girls’ signatures?

339
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:42,770
Mine’s just you guys.

340
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,730
Of course.

341
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:46,770
I'm handsome.

342
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:51,470
Jealous, huh? Did you get the same?

343
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:53,470
I only got guys—why's that?

344
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:55,530
We've got the same.

345
00:32:57,130 --> 00:32:57,930
Noh!

346
00:32:58,630 --> 00:32:59,430
Are you free?

347
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:00,970
Yeah, he's free.

348
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:02,570
Huh?

349
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:16,100
Thanks for helping me wash the dishes.

350
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:20,500
Aren’t you scared I’m a ghost?

351
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:24,630
Why would I be? You’re already dead, aren’t you?

352
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:28,800
Oh, right.

353
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,930
Who killed you, huh?

354
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:34,200
You can tell me.

355
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,170
I’ve got a friend who’s a shaman.

356
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:37,200
They'll handle it.

357
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,400
Hey!

358
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:40,100
Don’t mess with this ghost—

359
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:42,270
-It’s seriously haunted.
-Really?

360
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,300
-Just don't!
-Okay!

361
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,730
Why don’t you and Yu talk anymore?

362
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:57,070
You guys were so close.

363
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:00,430
Did she stop flirting with you?

364
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:03,700
Or you don't let her flirt anymore?

365
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:07,730
Honestly,

366
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:13,199
I don’t think you and Yuri are a match.

367
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:15,300
One’s a musician,

368
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:17,500
the other’s cutesy

369
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:20,600
How could you two ever get along?

370
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:27,800
We’re done now. I’m heading out.

371
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:28,699
Wait.

372
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:33,270
If you’re single now…

373
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,429
How about we try dating?

374
00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:40,100
We both play music,

375
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:44,230
and I’m not clingy or annoying like Yuri.

376
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:48,170
We’d totally get along.

377
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:50,330
Yuri’s my friend.

378
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,530
I never thought she was annoying.

379
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,370
And besides,

380
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,200
I don't want to date someone...

381
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,630
who talks bad about my friend.

382
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,400
Sorry.

383
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:05,500
You don't want to date...

384
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,670
or are you actually not single?

385
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,170
You're dating Phun, right?

386
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,600
You're gay, right?

387
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,600
Yeah, so what?

388
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:31,200
It's still love, isn't it?

389
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,830
Where were you just now?

390
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:14,670
With the Convent girl.

391
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:18,930
Her name is Jeed.

392
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:24,600
Stop sulking!

393
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,800
I just went to wash the dishes.

394
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:30,570
Wash dishes?

395
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,230
You're kind, huh?

396
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:35,970
Like you!!

397
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,200
Damn, your tag is full of signs.

398
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,600
Well, your boyfriend’s hot.

399
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:49,130
But I only love you.

400
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:53,000
I saved a spot for you to sign.

401
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:55,130
Here!

402
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:56,870
Sign it for me.

403
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:58,630
I don't have a pen.

404
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:06,870
Eh, you came prepared.

405
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,300
You even added a heart?

406
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:30,370
Yeah!

407
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,100
Just for you.

408
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:56,370
It's nothing, really.

409
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:58,270
I just wanted to say sorry...

410
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:00,430
about Noh.

411
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:06,130
You guys are mad at each other about this?

412
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,100
It's okay.

413
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:12,730
I’ve made up with Noh.

414
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:21,570
No matter how many times, he never gets mad anyway.

415
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:31,800
Yeah, I know.

416
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,530
But I really wanted to apologize to you.

417
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:36,400
I don’t want you two to have problems.

418
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:38,470
That was an accident.

419
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:41,970
Yeah, thanks a lot.

420
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:44,300
I'm not mad at you.

421
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,500
But if you really want to apologize...

422
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,300
I have another way.

423
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:01,100
I guarantee this way...

424
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,800
I'll completely forgive you.

425
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:10,970
How though?

426
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,770
Who would dare kill the cheer president?

427
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:18,170
Shit!

428
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:19,730
The ghost is fierce! Look!

429
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:25,130
I'm going to sleep with my name tag on tonight.

430
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:35,230
I don't think the ghost is fierce...

431
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:36,970
but jealous.

432
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:41,670
Yeah,

433
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:42,970
whatever.

434
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:45,230
Just go to sleep, all of you.

435
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:46,400
I'm turning off the lights.

436
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:49,370
Sleep, sleep, sleep...

437
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,300
It was you last night, wasn't it?

438
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:49,630
Maybe.

439
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:06,870
Sweet dreams.

440
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:09,900
See you in my dreams tonight.

441
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,570
The weather is so nice.

442
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,130
Not like in Bangkok.

443
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,600
What are you looking at?

444
00:42:08,830 --> 00:42:11,400
I just want to look. Can't I?

445
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:13,800
Sure.

446
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:17,100
It's the last day...

447
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,500
that we’ll be together.

448
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:21,630
Who said?

449
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:25,870
I told you, if someone takes you away...

450
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,700
I'll keep looking until I find you.

451
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:32,600
And if you do?

452
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:35,930
What can we do?

453
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:38,730
We’re so young.

454
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:42,930
We’re young now,

455
00:42:43,830 --> 00:42:45,070
but I’m good at waiting.

456
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:46,700
And I’m patient.

457
00:42:48,330 --> 00:42:50,400
We’ll just go do our own thing.

458
00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:52,830
And when the time’s right,

459
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:55,200
if you still feel the same,

460
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:56,600
so will I.

461
00:42:58,430 --> 00:43:00,370
I won't forget who I love.

462
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:02,930
And I won’t forget...

463
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:06,000
that I love you.

464
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:33,400
You're awake?

465
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:35,900
Yeah.

466
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:43,300
It's the last day.

467
00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:45,970
Did you do anything?

468
00:44:52,730 --> 00:44:53,670
Do what?

469
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:56,170
You know, about P' Noh.

470
00:44:56,930 --> 00:44:59,000
I didn't see you do anything.

471
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,600
I don't...

472
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:21,830
I only think of him as a friend.

473
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:24,200
And I don't want to be anything else.

474
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,200
Are you sure?

475
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,530
I'm giving you one last chance.

476
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:35,470
If this day passes...

477
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,370
I won't let you go to anyone else.

478
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:48,000
Then you better do what you say, kid.

479
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:19,170
Phun!

480
00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:27,870
You rolled so far away in your sleep.

481
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:30,600
From over there to here.

482
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:40,200
Noh!

483
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:51,000
Aww, hugging each other.

484
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:53,730
Have some sympathy for a single person like me.

485
00:46:55,830 --> 00:46:57,330
Aren't you guys going to shower?

486
00:46:57,530 --> 00:46:59,430
We showered last night, why shower again?

487
00:46:59,430 --> 00:47:01,270
We'll shower when we get home.

488
00:47:01,930 --> 00:47:03,130
Oh, right.

489
00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:06,530
No way.

490
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:11,930
-Come here.
-No!

491
00:47:12,070 --> 00:47:14,330
-You have to shower, don't be lazy.
-No...

492
00:47:14,530 --> 00:47:16,730
-Will you?
-No way...

493
00:47:16,970 --> 00:47:18,300
If you don't go, I'll carry you.

494
00:47:21,730 --> 00:47:22,530
Let's go.

495
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:42,930
I've wanted to talk to you for a long time.

496
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:46,400
But I never had the chance.

497
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:54,600
I'm sorry...

498
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:58,230
for making you sad.

499
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,630
And for making things hard for you.

500
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:07,630
It's my fault.

501
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:10,100
Back then...

502
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,200
I don't know myself well enough.

503
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,200
It's okay.

504
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:30,800
That’s all in the past now.

505
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:33,670
You’re doing so great now, really.

506
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:44,130
I wish you and P'Taeng a long-lasting relationship.

507
00:48:46,030 --> 00:48:47,400
If you need anything, just let me know.

508
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:51,000
You'll always be my friend.

509
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:56,500
You too.

510
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:00,770
Don't keep everything to yourself.

511
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:03,000
Talk to us.

512
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:05,100
We care about you.

513
00:49:05,930 --> 00:49:06,730
Me, too.

514
00:49:09,430 --> 00:49:11,400
Wait… you two made up already?

515
00:49:11,830 --> 00:49:13,400
That’s awesome!

516
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,900
I've been telling you guys to clear things up for so long

517
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:17,670
so you can finally stop being awkward.

518
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:19,730
Oh, what a shame.

519
00:49:19,730 --> 00:49:21,100
I just found out about this couple.

520
00:49:21,570 --> 00:49:23,700
I would’ve started shipping Lee and Aim ages ago!

521
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,200
Easy there, they just said they're friends.

522
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,500
Please hop on the Lee-Taeng ship first.

523
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:30,100
Fine! P’Taeng’s adorable anyway.

524
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:33,730
Or do you guys want to board the Nan-Ohm ship?

525
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:35,400
This ship is super fast!

526
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:37,170
Jeez!

527
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:44,270
So that's how you can date those people.

528
00:49:45,330 --> 00:49:46,070
What do you mean?

529
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:48,200
Friday guys...

530
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:51,000
Pretending to be a couple.

531
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,900
In fact, one is gay.

532
00:49:54,930 --> 00:49:56,270
And one is a lesbian.

533
00:49:57,030 --> 00:49:58,170
Funny.

534
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:00,800
Can you not meddle in other people’s lives?

535
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:02,600
I don't know.

536
00:50:03,730 --> 00:50:08,500
At least I’m not crushing on a gay guy

537
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:11,300
Falling for him, chasing him for a long time...

538
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:13,100
but he’s just not into you

539
00:50:14,270 --> 00:50:15,900
Because he's gay.

540
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:17,100
Is it Noh?

541
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:19,100
Yes!

542
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,170
Don't you guys know that...

543
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:22,970
Noh and Phun are gay.

544
00:50:23,530 --> 00:50:25,130
Seems like they're dating now.

545
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:29,230
In the past, they just used girls to cover their faces.

546
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:33,800
They went to Huay Hin together, right?

547
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:35,200
How was it?

548
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:39,800
I guess gay guys want to try girls too sometimes.

549
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,030
It's okay if you're not a virgin.

550
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:45,630
Just think of it as...

551
00:50:46,230 --> 00:50:47,430
trying something strange.

552
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:56,900
You bitch!

553
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,330
You’re talking about Noh,

554
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:01,230
, but do you even know him?

555
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:03,700
People like you...

556
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:05,400
have never met a good man.

557
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:08,430
So don't generalize and say that everyone has to be as bad as you.

558
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,030
Noh is the best thing in my life.

559
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:16,130
You're not allowed to talk about Noh like that again.

560
00:51:17,330 --> 00:51:18,700
People like you...

561
00:51:19,630 --> 00:51:21,730
have no right to talk about him like this.

562
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:23,900
Release!

563
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:26,600
Come here.

564
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:31,000
Why did you talk about Noh like that?

565
00:51:32,530 --> 00:51:34,470
Yuri, stop it!

566
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:08,530
Yuri, wait for me!

567
00:52:24,430 --> 00:52:26,470
For slapping my friend…

568
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:26,730
Before we wrap up, I’ll announce the top four scores.

569
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,830
Which are obtained from doing activities.

570
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:29,930
Unity...

571
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:31,200
Kindness...

572
00:53:31,330 --> 00:53:32,500
And helping each other.

573
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,700
And the winning team is...

574
00:53:35,530 --> 00:53:40,670
[Everyone shout out their color.]

575
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:43,700
Green!

576
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:54,600
Another equally important award

577
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:55,800
is the best of hunger ghost.

578
00:53:56,130 --> 00:53:58,500
This ghost killed 15 people!

579
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:03,830
The winner is...

580
00:54:04,430 --> 00:54:06,470
Phun from Friday!

581
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:14,100
Who got killed by this handsome ghost?

582
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:14,930
Stand up!

583
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:12,730
Tomorrow is the first day of summer.

584
00:55:13,030 --> 00:55:14,630
Don't skip class, guys. Yeah.

585
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:17,730
Only 3% more, what a pity.

586
00:55:19,730 --> 00:55:21,600
But we don't have to clean the bathroom.

587
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:22,930
Only sweeping the street.

588
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:26,230
But we owe it to Keng, don’t we?

589
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:27,870
If not for him…

590
00:55:28,230 --> 00:55:29,870
We wouldn’t have scored this much.

591
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,400
-True!
-But it’s thanks to all of you too.

592
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:34,830
Alright, see you tomorrow.

593
00:55:35,130 --> 00:55:36,770
Get some rest, Noh.

594
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,170
So you'll get back to your crazy self soon.

595
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,030
Yeah, I’m going crazy tomorrow.

596
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:43,700
Mark your word

597
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:48,970
Noh, go home!

598
00:55:49,570 --> 00:55:50,600
You’re taking him home, right?

599
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:52,170
I'll leave him to you then.

600
00:55:54,870 --> 00:55:56,530
See you guys!

601
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:58,000
Get home safe, guys!

602
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:02,270
Noh, come here, quick!

603
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:04,100
Hurry up, come on...

604
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:06,200
Faster, faster!

605
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:10,130
I'm starving already!

606
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:14,570
Hey! Be careful, it’ll break!

607
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:16,430
It’s still edible though.

608
00:56:16,430 --> 00:56:19,000
It’s broken now. Doesn’t taste good anymore.

609
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:20,800
It’s still fine to eat!

610
00:56:20,930 --> 00:56:22,770
Hey, this is delicious.

611
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:25,600
Noh!

612
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:57,300
-Noh!
-Yu!

613
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:00,130
You say first!

614
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:02,130
Noh, you first.

615
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,330
Mine might take a while.

616
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:10,400
Nothing much… just wondering if you’re hungry.

617
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:12,300
I could find some food in the house.

618
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,430
Is no one home?

619
00:57:18,530 --> 00:57:19,600
They all went on a trip.

620
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:28,630
Phun's staying over tonight?

621
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:31,300
Yeah!

622
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:38,600
About what happened earlier…

623
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:43,430
If you told me there was nothing going on...

624
00:57:45,730 --> 00:57:46,600
I would believe you, right?

625
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:55,300
You believe...

626
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:57,830
because we never lied to you, right?

627
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:03,470
I...

628
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:05,900
I'm really dating Phun.

629
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:13,300
But...

630
00:58:13,630 --> 00:58:15,170
I'm still your friend.

631
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:28,000
Do you know...

632
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:31,330
Why I was mad at you back then?

633
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:37,670
I was mad at you...

634
00:58:38,730 --> 00:58:42,270
because I thought it was you

635
00:58:44,130 --> 00:58:45,830
who made Em and Phun break up.

636
00:58:48,830 --> 00:58:49,730
But now I know.

637
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:53,500
Even without you...

638
00:58:55,030 --> 00:58:56,700
those two would have broken up anyway.

639
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:04,700
I'm sorry, Noh.

640
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:09,230
I was a terrible friend.

641
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:14,500
I never paid attention to either you or Aim.

642
00:59:24,130 --> 00:59:26,270
Today when Jeed scolded you,

643
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:30,430
I got so mad.

644
00:59:33,430 --> 00:59:36,570
I thought how could she scold you without even knowing you?

645
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:43,500
But I'm worse than Jeed.

646
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:52,330
I told everyone that I knew you the best.

647
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:56,300
But when you wanted me to understand you the most...

648
00:59:57,600 --> 01:00:00,570
I didn't understand anything.

649
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,370
I'm sorry, Noh!

650
01:00:22,730 --> 01:00:24,000
I’m sorry too.

651
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:29,230
It’s okay, Yu.

652
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:31,000
No big deal.

653
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:34,730
Whoa!

654
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:36,800
Why so dramatic?

655
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,100
It’s not a good look, you know.

656
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:40,600
Stop crying.

657
01:00:40,830 --> 01:00:41,800
Okay?

658
01:00:42,830 --> 01:00:45,100
Stop crying, okay?

659
01:00:49,830 --> 01:00:51,430
I'm fine now.

660
01:00:53,130 --> 01:00:54,230
Look good now.

661
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:05,300
Noh!

662
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:10,430
So you don't like girls at all anymore?

663
01:01:12,230 --> 01:01:13,470
I don't know.

664
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:17,030
But I still like looking at cute people.

665
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:24,100
What?

666
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:27,170
Cute people.

667
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:34,770
Yeah, you're cute!

668
01:01:36,870 --> 01:01:37,670
So...

669
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:40,430
we're back to how we were?

670
01:01:42,630 --> 01:01:44,000
Back to how we were?

671
01:01:44,930 --> 01:01:46,470
Being friends I mean.

672
01:01:50,100 --> 01:01:51,070
We're not going back.

673
01:01:51,670 --> 01:01:52,500
Huh?

674
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:55,000
Because I won't go anywhere.

675
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,370
Still friends, always will be.

676
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:59,400
Thank you.

677
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:02,730
Noh, you're the best.

678
01:02:14,730 --> 01:02:16,230
Thank you.

679
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:19,400
Let go! Let go!

680
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:21,300
-I can’t breathe!
-You're exaggerating.

681
01:02:21,830 --> 01:02:23,570
Nope, I'm not.

682
01:02:38,970 --> 01:02:39,770
Yes?

683
01:02:40,170 --> 01:02:41,800
-What's up?
-One sec.

684
01:02:48,100 --> 01:02:49,700
Thanks for letting me borrow them.

685
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:52,530
Did it hurt walking back?

686
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:54,130
No, it didn't.

687
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:55,400
Just a little.

688
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:57,000
Wait, wait, wait...

689
01:02:58,230 --> 01:03:00,000
When did you guys borrow shoes from each other?

690
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:40,830
You think you're the only hero?

691
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:43,330
Whoa! So, what's up.

692
01:03:45,700 --> 01:03:46,930
Asking for it?

693
01:03:49,170 --> 01:03:50,370
I'll go back first then.

694
01:03:50,470 --> 01:03:53,070
-My dad will wonder why I'm back late.
-Okay.

695
01:03:53,370 --> 01:03:54,770
See ya, Noh!

696
01:03:56,070 --> 01:03:57,070
Oh, one sec.

697
01:03:57,970 --> 01:03:59,530
And then this one.

698
01:04:04,330 --> 01:04:05,870
And this photo.

699
01:04:07,730 --> 01:04:08,800
Keep it, Noh.

700
01:04:09,230 --> 01:04:10,370
I like it a lot.

701
01:04:18,100 --> 01:04:19,370
Damn, out of focus.

702
01:04:23,730 --> 01:04:24,530
Yeah.

703
01:04:30,430 --> 01:04:32,300
And tell Phun...

704
01:04:32,930 --> 01:04:34,270
If he doesn't take good care of Noh,

705
01:04:34,730 --> 01:04:36,030
I'll steal him away.

706
01:04:36,630 --> 01:04:37,600
Bye!

707
01:04:38,730 --> 01:04:40,070
Bye bye.

708
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:54,900
What?

709
01:04:55,630 --> 01:04:57,900
-There you go again.
-What?

710
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:04,730
Tell her there’s no need to steal you.

711
01:05:05,230 --> 01:05:06,870
'Cause I'm already taking good care of what's mine.

712
01:05:10,570 --> 01:05:11,670
Right.

713
01:05:12,470 --> 01:05:14,330
And even she managed to kiss you on the cheek...

714
01:05:15,570 --> 01:05:16,770
I’ve done way more than that.

715
01:05:21,530 --> 01:05:22,670
Shall we go up to the room?

716
01:05:28,170 --> 01:05:28,970
Coast is clear today, too.

717
01:05:29,900 --> 01:05:30,970
No one's home.

718
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:39,630
Then go back home, dude!

719
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,230
If you’re smart, come in here!

720
01:05:52,530 --> 01:05:54,700
Open the door, stop messing with me, Noh!

721
01:05:55,430 --> 01:05:58,030
This is our teenage life, folks.

722
01:05:59,330 --> 01:06:01,830
We’ve got to ace our studies, shine in activities—

723
01:06:01,930 --> 01:06:03,700
—and figure out who we are.

724
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:06,470
Makes every day exciting.

725
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:13,070
But we’ve got to face challenges that drain us dry.

726
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:19,600
People say we’ve got a long future ahead—

727
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:26,400
But no one really knows what the future holds.

728
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:29,630
What we’ve got right now is—

729
01:06:30,030 --> 01:06:31,130
hope.

730
01:06:42,530 --> 01:06:45,700
But at the very least, if we have a supportive family,

731
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:50,430
teenage life gets 3000% easier.

732
01:06:50,530 --> 01:06:52,100
-Hello!
-Hello!

733
01:06:52,770 --> 01:06:55,170
It's late, aren't you going to school yet?

734
01:06:55,270 --> 01:06:56,970
-Noh woke up late.
-Oh hey!

735
01:06:57,270 --> 01:07:01,400
You're sleeping over at Noh's house so often, I feel bad.

736
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:02,600
Is this okay?

737
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:07,430
Come on, Mom. I fold his blanket all the time, this morning too.

738
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:11,370
If you're going to do anything, don't forget to use protection.

739
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:12,170
Huh?

740
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:16,100
I mean If someone tries to harm you,

741
01:07:16,100 --> 01:07:17,400
don't forget to defend yourself.

742
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:21,400
Gotta go now.

743
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:23,730
And if I get the chance to do...

744
01:07:24,630 --> 01:07:27,800
If anyone tries to harm me, I will defend myself very well!

745
01:07:34,570 --> 01:07:35,730
From now on...

746
01:07:36,430 --> 01:07:38,270
We might have to face a lot of things.

747
01:07:38,270 --> 01:07:39,430
Everyone...

748
01:07:39,670 --> 01:07:42,330
-Ohm and I,
-We're dating now.

749
01:07:43,130 --> 01:07:46,730
We may face changes and misunderstandings.

750
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:49,830
Hey Pong, isn’t that your boyfriend?

751
01:07:49,930 --> 01:07:51,570
-Yeah, we broke up.
-What?!

752
01:07:52,030 --> 01:07:54,930
I only dated him to make him better. Now he’s great—

753
01:07:55,030 --> 01:07:56,430
so we broke up.

754
01:07:56,470 --> 01:07:58,030
That’s a reason to break up?!

755
01:07:58,170 --> 01:07:59,400
Yep.

756
01:08:01,330 --> 01:08:03,230
Smiles or tears—

757
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:08,000
—they’re memories we want to keep forever.

758
01:08:08,900 --> 01:08:10,230
Looking sad, dude.

759
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,569
If he doesn't want it, can I keep it?

760
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,500
Join the music club, guys.

761
01:08:34,130 --> 01:08:38,630
Two pork skewers, one black sticky rice, and lean pork, please.

762
01:08:38,630 --> 01:08:42,300
Wow, handsome and healthy. Got a girlfriend yet?

763
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:45,729
Interested in my daughter? She just became single.

764
01:08:46,229 --> 01:08:47,399
Mom!

765
01:08:48,029 --> 01:08:49,500
No thanks, auntie.

766
01:08:49,930 --> 01:08:51,470
Because this one here

767
01:08:52,899 --> 01:08:53,529
is my boyfriend.

768
01:08:53,529 --> 01:08:56,370
and I’m super protective of him.

769
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:04,370
So, what about you guys?

770
01:09:05,630 --> 01:09:10,000
Any memories you want to keep forever?

771
01:09:17,330 --> 01:09:18,500
As for me—

772
01:09:20,029 --> 01:09:21,100
I think—

773
01:09:22,130 --> 01:09:23,470
I´ve already got.

774
01:10:06,670 --> 01:10:10,300
[We are really pleased to have presented all the characters, and now it's time to bring them back to their novel.]

775
01:10:10,870 --> 01:10:12,900
[Friday School and Holy Convent have officially ended the semester.]

776
01:10:13,230 --> 01:10:16,230
[We hope to remain in everyone’s memories forever.]

777
01:10:17,700 --> 01:10:20,700
