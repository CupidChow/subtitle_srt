189
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,080
Yeah!

190
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,560
Fucking fit, but we're heading to bed.

191
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,600
Can't take it anymore.

192
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,800
Yeah, let's go. Take a rest.

193
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,360
-See you, man!
-Bye!

194
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,320
Hey!

195
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:07,960
Aren't you gonna change clothes?

196
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,720
Where did Ngor go?

197
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:22,720
Hey, Friday scored!!! Friday’s the best, number one!

198
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,920
Wrong stand?

199
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,520
Damn, that goal was freakin' awesome!

200
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:46,320
Too bad! Ken and Geng didn't come. Should I post it in the group?

201
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,040
Damn!

202
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,440
If we win the title, what are we gonna do?

203
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,600
I guess I’ll roll with the coolness.

204
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,880
Nah, you’re rolling straight into a kick instead!

205
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,920
- Eh, I brought a change of clothes...
-Damn, I didn't bring any.

206
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,880
Do you have anymore?

207
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,120
I'll buy some popcorn, do you guys want some?

208
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,040
You're all about food, huh?

209
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,840
Everyone’s going to watch football!

210
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,080
Yeah, are you crazy?

211
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,280
[Ready for Code 3, alright?]

212
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,000
-The card stunt now is about to begin. Let´s go.
-That way!

213
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,480
-Where!
-This way! Hurry up.

214
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:27,000
You think you're tough, huh? Coming into our territory?

215
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:33,960
No, sir.

216
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,880
I just went to the wrong stand, I swear!

217
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:36,720
Really?

218
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,560
Your seniors said that last year.

219
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,760
And they got their butts kicked!!!

220
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,680
You think it's cool?

221
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,640
Nobody fights like this anymore.

222
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,360
It’s... it’s lame.

223
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,840
Eh, did you just call us lame?

224
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,000
Is that true?

225
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,040
If you are lame,

226
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,440
well... that’s on you.

227
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,240
[Carrying dangerous weapons is illegal behavior. Parents should provide guidance to their children.]
With a mouth like this,

228
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,680
no need to watch football anymore, huh?

229
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,560
Hey, move aside.

230
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,240
Hey! What are you guys doing?

231
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,560
Are you okay?

232
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,880
Hey, man!

233
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,080
Why are you sitting alone?

234
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,200
Was waiting for you.

235
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,960
It’s hot out here.

236
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,280
Don't you have a hat?

237
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,880
No, I forgot it.

238
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,480
What about you?

239
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,080
Didn’t bring one either.

240
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,560
No big deal. The sun will go away soon.

241
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,560
I’ll block the sun for you first.

242
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,760
Thanks, man.

243
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,840
Eh, Nong Nan, you're gonna get sued!

244
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,560
But look at them!

245
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,240
Oh, they're so cute!

246
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,960
So cute.

247
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,160
The BL fans, freaking out again.

248
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:55,760
I want you to get the water from the marching band for me on event day.

249
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,080
Hey, no problem! That’s easy, chill.

250
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,800
But you gotta wait until the marching band’s done, alright?

251
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,200
Okay.

252
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,360
I’ll wait.

253
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,160
Yep!

254
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,800
Where is the cap?

255
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,760
Sorry, I'll go find it.

256
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,760
Yeah, go find it.

257
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,880
Earn!

258
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,240
I took P'Ton to the alumni stands.

259
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:51,000
You guys back together?

260
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,880
-How come?
-Eh...

261
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,440
If you want to date him, go ahead, man.

262
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,960
As long as you're happy, don’t worry about me.

263
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:02,440
But if he bugs you and you’re annoyed...

264
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,800
let me know.

265
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,760
I’ll handle it!

266
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,320
Where would you get the energy?

267
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,520
Have you eaten anything?

268
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,520
Nah, it’s fine.

269
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,440
I’m just waiting for someone.

270
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,120
Who?

271
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,800
You'll know soon.

272
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,600
Is this the person you’re waiting for?

273
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,760
Yeah.

274
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,200
Noh, really not coming?

275
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,200
Didn’t you say you needed help?

276
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,280
I wanted you to help, man!

277
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,080
Come drink something.

278
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,200
Noh, come on.

279
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,640
Alright, when I’m free, I’ll come up.

280
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,160
-Noh!
-Don't you want a drink?

281
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,880
-What?
-You want a drink, right?

282
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:11,960
Noh!

283
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,160
Can you come?

284
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,080
Drink it before you get heatstroke.

285
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,680
Stay with Phun first.

286
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,080
Don't you want to eat water?

287
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,760
Yeah, you want water?

288
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,760
You want water, don't you?

289
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,480
Phun!

290
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,120
Earn!

291
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,440
-Taking a break?
-Yeah.

292
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:52,200
Where’s your assistant? Not here to feed you?

293
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,160
You can take him back.

294
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,440
Nah, I'm giving him to you for today.

295
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,640
- I’m leaving.
-That’s it?

296
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,360
-Where’d you get that?
-From the stands.

297
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,040
Whoa!

298
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,960
Is Earn being too nice to his junior or what?

299
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,640
So, how's it going? All good?

300
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,320
Oh man...

301
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,920
Totally good.

302
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,600
The work's easy.

303
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,920
But this outfit...

304
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,880
I’m not giving you back.

305
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,360
Aren’t you afraid if they win?

306
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,360
What’s there to be afraid of?

307
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,920
Gen Z kids don’t fight anymore, man.

308
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,480
What time did you sleep?

309
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,440
Did you even sleep?

310
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,760
Rest your eyes a bit, or you'll crash.

311
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,360
I’ll keep an eye out.

312
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,080
Then...

313
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,040
-Give me 10 minutes, okay?
-Sure.

314
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,720
Eh!

315
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,560
You better wake me up in ten minutes! Don’t forget!

316
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,280
Eh!

317
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,840
If you don't, you'll get this...

318
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,560
...to your face.

319
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,240
Now, folks!

320
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,480
The intense competition in the 2nd half is about to kick off!

321
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:24,200
Let's cheer and see if Friday College can keep their lead!

322
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,480
-Yo, I smell something weird.
-What smell?

323
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,280
Smells like Vicks!

324
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,400
-an ointment?
-Vicks-to-ry.

325
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,680
-Victory, right?
-Exactly.

326
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,120
You guys are at it again!

327
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,480
-But I really do smell something...
-What's it?

328
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,840
Damn Ohm!

329
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,880
Whoa, perfume? Who're you trying to impress?

330
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,880
Just in case there are girls around.

331
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,080
You mean her?

332
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,760
P'Ton, can you hide me?

333
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:04,280
Or do you already like someone else, and didn't tell us yet.

334
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,040
-Is that right?
-Not true.

335
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:11,040
P'Ohm... can I stay with you?

336
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,960
Ooooooh!

337
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,760
Sure, kid! My friend's really nice.

338
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:16,920
Thank you.

339
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,480
All right, but don't bother other people.

340
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,440
Mick!

341
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,120
For you!

342
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,280
But don’t tell anyone I brought it.

343
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,760
-Got it.
-Alright.

344
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:07,360
Only ten minutes left, folks!

345
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:13,440
I bet both schools' cheering squads are on edge right now!

346
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,480
Another goal, please. Let’s end this already.

347
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,360
No, man!

348
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,080
A tie is fine, I didn’t bring a change of clothes.

349
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,280
Don't be a chicken!

350
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:34,480
We've got some tough guys in our gang!

351
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,880
Yeah, that's right!

352
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,400
Fong!

353
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,520
What happened to your arm?

354
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,400
I helped a cat.

355
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,680
It was ganged up on.

356
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,000
-Huh?
-Love animals?

357
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:50,200
-Man, got in a fight with a cat?
-What’s going on with you?

358
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,600
-Hey, Ohm!
-Sup!

359
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,560
Isn’t this kid from the club?

360
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,760
Yeah, why?

361
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,760
-Nothing!
- Oh, come on.

362
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,600
I asked, and you didn’t tell me.

363
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,320
Weirdo!

364
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,240
Hey, the ball’s there.

365
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:14,840
Eh...

366
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,440
And now it’s 2-0, folks! Friday College has scored.

367
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:48,520
And the result is that Friday College takes the champion.

368
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,840
Final code ready?

369
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,880
Go!

370
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,000
Noh!

371
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,440
Noh!

372
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,920
Two zeros

373
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,159
Oh, shit.

374
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,159
Two zeros, jeez!

375
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,040
We won already!

376
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,920
-Man, I’m wide awake now.
-Hey!

377
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:27,280
Hey, let's go boom!

378
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,440
Let's go.

379
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,960
Let's go...1...2...3

380
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,120
Good job!

381
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,320
Thank you, everyone!

382
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:30,240
That was awesome!

383
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,720
Oh, bro...

384
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,760
still haven't left?

385
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,880
No, you guys did a great job today.

386
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,320
It was an amazing day.

387
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,920
Thank you very much

388
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,920
Looks like we don’t have to worry anymore.

389
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,640
Take care of Pete for me, alright?

390
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,720
You don’t need to worry.

391
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,200
Cool... I'm off then

392
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:57,720
Hey, wait.

393
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,160
Oh, any necklaces left? I kinda want one

394
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,200
It's all gone. Sorry,man.

395
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:06,520
That’s too bad.

396
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,400
You've graduated already,

397
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,400
why you bummed...

398
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,480
some things should just be for the kids.

399
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:26,680
True that...

400
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:29,200
But if you ever get bored of kiddie stuff,

401
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,520
hit me up anytime

402
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:45,720
Will you do it?

403
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,120
What?

404
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,680
Pack up, man.

405
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,920
P'Taeng

406
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,520
I thought it was only us checking out guys.

407
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,960
Turns out, she’s here too!

408
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,280
She didn't come to see guys.

409
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,880
She’s here for our friend!

410
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,360
Are you shipping them?

411
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,720
Nah, they’re not a ship.

412
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,160
The real deal.

413
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,200
She even bragged to me.

414
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,520
Said they’re going to Hua Hin.

415
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,720
Hua Hin?

416
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:17,120
Is she gonna ask her out there?

417
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,560
Confess while the sun sets, huh?

418
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,960
It’s like writing a novel!

419
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:35,880
Hi there, P' Taeng.

420
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,120
P'Taeng!!!

421
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,600
Hey, Phu!

422
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,520
Check out this trash!

423
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,120
It’s huge! Let’s clean it up.

424
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,920
♫I have to travel to collect trash.♫

425
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,720
♫ Don't know what we'll eat this evening♫

426
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:10,400
♫Is there still sushi at the destination♫

427
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,000
What's that?

428
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,320
Hey, why aren’t you helping?

429
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,520
I'll pick them up.

430
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,680
Stuffed them into it.

431
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:36,800
You don’t have to help, man.

432
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,200
Go sit over there and wait.

433
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,120
Nah, it’s fine.

434
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,040
I can help.

435
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,320
Why are you so stubborn?

436
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,560
Earlier, you were sitting out in the sun.

437
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:58,920
I could see you clearly from there...

438
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:06,720
So you sat in the sun 'cause of me,

439
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,480
now you're picking up trash 'cause of me?

440
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:15,600
I don't want you to be in trouble?

441
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,400
Not at all.

442
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,560
I’m doing all of this...

443
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,560
for you.

444
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:33,680
So...

445
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,680
Thank you

446
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,520
for...

447
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:41,400
putting up with everything.

448
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,320
I’m not just putting up with it.

449
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,080
I'm willing.

450
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,520
So...

451
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,120
If you're tired, you rest.

452
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:55,920
You don't have to endure everything.

453
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:58,920
I'm not tired at all

454
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,320
when it comes to you.

455
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:10,520
Then after...

456
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:11,880
go grab some food?

457
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,160
Yeah.

458
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:49,640
Oh man, this trash is so heavy!

459
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,000
It’s even leaking, gross!

460
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,320
Smells so bad!

461
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:00,960
Hey, look.

462
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:06,040
There’s still a ton of food left.

463
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,640
You finish it then.

464
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,040
Ridiculous.

465
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,520
People can be such jerks, right?

466
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:14,000
Why can they eat but can't throw their trash away?

467
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,640
Hopefully they will come back as rotten garbage in their next life.

468
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,560
Amen.

469
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,320
What are you guys?

470
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,160
What are you playing?

471
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,920
Hey, bro! What’s up?

472
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,080
You guys did great.

473
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,520
The stands look awesome.

474
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,160
The band’s on point.

475
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,200
And you even won the game!

476
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,560
-That was easy.
-Easy?

477
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,040
-We're cool.
-Ah!

478
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,800
Bragging, huh?

479
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:56,880
But I gotta say, you’re looking good these days. Clear skin, glowing.

480
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,320
Your business must be doing well.

481
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,960
You teasing me too, huh?

482
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,720
About the drums...

483
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,520
I’ve got everything paid.

484
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:09,160
Take care of the club, alright?

485
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:10,600
Love it lots.

486
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:12,960
You'll miss it when you graduate

487
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:14,600
Will do.

488
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,600
I'm off.

489
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,800
See you later, bro.

490
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,120
Noh!

491
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:33,120
Ohm! Staying much longer?  My friend wanna see you!

492
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,800
Not long.

493
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,280
I'm going, bye!

494
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,080
I'll go to.

495
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:40,840
I'm going too

496
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:44,680
What's up with him?

497
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,080
Yu, what's up?

498
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:51,440
Nothing... just wanted to say your school was so cool today!!!!

499
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:53,320
What about me?

500
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,360
You're cool too...

501
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:57,520
even cooler in this outfit!

502
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:02,200
-For sure.
-So, got any plans later?

503
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,440
Dunno.

504
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,080
Come grab dinner with me!

505
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,280
Pleeeease...

506
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:08,680
Sure.

507
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,320
-Let me go change real quick.
-Sure!

508
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,600
And please help me with these.

509
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:15,600
Which bag you want?

510
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:17,920
This one has cockroaches. That one has snakes.

511
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,840
I’m glad you two are close.

512
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,400
Now we can double date more often, right?

513
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:41,320
Huh?

514
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:46,560
I mean...

515
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:49,880
We could hang out as four friends, not just dates.

516
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:53,040
Oh yeah, Noh!

517
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,880
Why you wore that suit?

518
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,400
Thought you didn't get one?

519
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,120
It's Phun's.

520
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,000
Really?!

521
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,280
Do they have women's sizes? I wanna wear one!

522
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:07,480
Don't wear it

523
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:09,520
It's so hot.

524
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,760
Noh’s favorite dish. Let me serve you.

525
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:14,680
Eat a lot!

526
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:19,440
Not gonna serve me too?

527
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,960
Here you go, I'm getting some for you.

528
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:33,480
Eh!

529
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,640
-Can I have some?
-Nope.

530
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:38,640
-Just one piece?
-Nope.

531
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:40,280
No way!

532
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,480
What?

533
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,520
Show me you can steal some!

534
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:46,840
-Noh, it’s gonna fall!
-Don't, man.

535
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,920
Bring it down, man, it’s only one piece.

536
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:49,840
Nope!

537
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:04,920
That thing you said about the four of us being on a trip...

538
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:05,720
You serious?

539
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,040
Yup!

540
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:09,120
Aim, you wanna go?!

541
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,920
My mom just redeemed some credit card points.

542
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:15,320
It's for a hotel in Hua Hin, two nights.

543
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:18,800
You're free next week, right?

544
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:20,800
I'm free too!

545
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:21,920
So is Noh!

546
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:26,640
You said you'd be free after the football event. So he's free.

547
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:29,480
Then I'll tell my mom to book the hotel.

548
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:47,440
Text me when you get home.

549
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:49,120
Kay, bye!

550
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:52,080
Bye.

551
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:04,440
Ohm’s calling me.

552
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:09,480
[Ohm] Hello? Where are you?

553
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,320
[Ohm] Damn, everyone’s here already!

554
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:12,120
[Ohm] Hurry up.

555
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,920
The car’s here, let’s go!

556
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:27,880
Thank you, sir.

557
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:53,920
Eh, Ohm!

558
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:56,040
Keep it down, the kid's sleeping!

559
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,040
Why the hell are you napping here?

560
00:46:58,040 --> 00:46:58,960
Don't scold him.

561
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:00,200
Don't listen to him, kid.

562
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:01,120
If it's too much,

563
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:02,520
just head home, man.

564
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:05,520
I'm not leaving! I'm waiting to go home with Mam!

565
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:08,160
-Then you go home too, Mam!
-Oh!

566
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:09,160
That's enough.

567
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:11,440
If they're going,

568
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,600
you're going too!

569
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:14,880
Huh, how's that my problem!

570
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,480
He lives near you,

571
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:17,680
you gotta take him home!

572
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:19,560
Yeah!

573
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:23,800
Per!

574
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:26,320
Win's not coming?

575
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:28,320
Went home with his sister.

576
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Huh?

577
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:32,640
Hey, music club...

578
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:34,720
Are you guys full yet?

579
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:38,200
Not yet!!! Order more meat,

580
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:42,120
Yeah... and where's Noh?

581
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,560
There he is!

582
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:13,120
-Your table's over there, I'll take you.
-Let's go.

583
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:14,960
Give him the seat.

584
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:16,840
Phun, over here!

585
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:18,920
Sit here!

586
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:38,640
Took you long enough, dude!

587
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:40,840
We're almost full.

588
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:43,200
You're late, dude.

589
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,120
What?

590
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:48,200
Too busy having dinner with your girl? Our BBQ's all cold now.

591
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:53,720
Noh, you were with your girlfriend?

592
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:56,320
Yeah, Earn!

593
00:48:56,760 --> 00:49:00,320
Noh's girl is like this super kawaii Japanese chick!

594
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:03,040
Yeah, that's my type too.

595
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:03,840
Per!

596
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:04,880
Yes, sir.

597
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:06,000
Handle them.

598
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:07,200
I got you, bro!

599
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,280
Eh, Knot! Eat it.

600
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:16,040
So...

601
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:18,040
you really went out with your girlfriend?

602
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:19,760
What girlfriend? Just a friend!!!!

603
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:20,280
Eh!

604
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:22,000
-If it's not, she'll be mine.
-No way, man.

605
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:22,800
This one’s mine!

606
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:25,680
So that means Noh’s single?

607
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,520
Obviously.

608
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:33,240
You sure about that? You want me to say?

609
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:35,120
Hey!

610
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,520
There it is! Another shot.

611
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:40,360
Oh, me again?

612
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:44,920
But hey, Ern, I think the one who’s definitely not single is you!

613
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:48,160
The cheer president's always taken, every year.

614
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:49,880
That's true.

615
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Really?

616
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,320
I wanna be cheer president too, then I'd get a girlfriend!!!

617
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,680
Stop butting into grown-up stuff!

618
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:59,120
Just eat!!!

619
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:01,520
I want a partner too.

620
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:04,280
But not just anyone, you know?

621
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:07,400
Sounds like you're targeting someone.

622
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:09,600
Who's that?

623
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:12,560
Alright.

624
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:16,240
I’ll have him do a backflip twice,

625
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:17,760
then will you tell me?

626
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:21,000
Before he flips...

627
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:22,960
Can you go easy first?

628
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:33,200
Hey!

629
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:36,520
You totally spaced out.

630
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:43,400
Yeah...

631
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:44,720
Eat, eat.

632
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:58,600
Since we’re all here...

633
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,400
Cheers!

634
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,680
Wait a minute! Alcohol?!

635
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:07,720
Oh, you can't see this?

636
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:10,600
You're blind? Let's cheers!

637
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:13,840
Per!

638
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:15,600
What are you looking at?

639
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:17,320
That person down there is hot!

640
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:18,560
10/10

641
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:19,920
Where? Who's hot?

642
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:26,200
Damn, she's freakin' cute.

643
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:35,520
Hey, Golf, right?

644
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:38,320
Yo, what’s going on here?

645
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:40,960
I came to eat BBQ. Wanna join together?

646
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:43,080
Celebrating the championship?

647
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:44,320
Yeah.

648
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:48,200
I already told my mom I’m heading home though.

649
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:51,280
-It's already late.
-That's too bad.

650
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:52,800
Let's do it next time.

651
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:54,760
Noh, the crispy pork is there.

652
00:51:58,880 --> 00:51:59,840
So, who's she?

653
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:02,560
Can't you remember?

654
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:05,800
Guess who she is.

655
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:10,200
Hey, Noh and Earn!

656
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,560
The crispy pork is there.

657
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:15,800
Why are you all crowding around here?

658
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:20,200
Try guessing who she is!

659
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:23,440
No clue, right?

660
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:26,520
Her name starts with a G.

661
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:34,920
-Golf!!
-Yeah!

662
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:38,120
I'm Grace.

663
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:40,960
[Grace]

664
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:44,160
Now, stage name "Gracey". Say it together!

665
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:46,520
Gracey....

666
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:48,600
Great!

667
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,080
The crispy pork is almost finished.

668
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:57,120
Alright, we’ll chat later. Crispy pork first!

669
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:14,880
Guess who I am?

670
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:20,920
I'm leaving for a second, and you're already flirting, huh?

671
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:26,520
I’m Golf!

672
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:31,000
We used to play soccer together.

673
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:34,520
Golf!

674
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,520
Yeah!

675
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:38,160
Gracey

676
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:43,560
And don't call me Golf again, okay?

677
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:44,720
Okay.

678
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:46,120
Gracey

679
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:47,240
Very good.

680
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:51,880
Now, go protect that crispy pork for me, alright?

681
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:53,440
I’ll catch up with her.

682
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,200
Okay.

683
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:09,320
Eh, Phun and Aim still together?

684
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:11,360
Of course.

685
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:16,920
You remember my friend, Eclair? The gorgeous one?

686
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:23,360
The short-haired girl, right?

687
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:25,480
Yeah, yeah.

688
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,040
So, she likes girls.

689
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:29,520
And recently, she went on a date with this girl.

690
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:37,000
She’d been chatting with her for days,

691
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:41,320
and the girl also likes girls, so they set up a date.

692
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:44,000
And she asked me to come along.

693
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,120
Turns out it was Aim!!

694
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:52,320
Huh?

695
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:54,720
I was shocked too...

696
00:54:55,920 --> 00:55:00,040
But I told my friend Em has a boyfriend,

697
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:01,720
so she didn't keep talking to her.

698
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:04,680
Aim, really...?

699
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:14,760
But...

700
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:16,400
I think...

701
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:20,000
that day Aim seemed off...

702
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:22,240
Maybe she just tried.

703
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:24,720
Hey!

704
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:29,320
Did she hide the camera for content?

705
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:31,760
Are you crazy? No way!

706
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:33,760
-It could be.
-Not like that.

707
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:36,200
It's not like that.

708
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:37,720
Actually,

709
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:40,200
I kinda wanna tell Phun about it, but...

710
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:42,080
I don’t think he’ll believe me.

711
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:52,920
But honestly,

712
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:54,920
maybe it’s nothing.

713
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:58,560
Let’s hope so.

714
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:12,800
I'll eat first.

715
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:14,320
See you.

716
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:19,320
- Hit me up if you need anything.
- Okay.

717
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,280
I want to go home already.

718
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:43,480
Hey!

719
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:44,520
Noh!

720
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:46,160
I'm heading out.

721
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:47,520
Yeah, yeah,

722
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:50,600
Hey, take care of him, alright?

723
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:52,000
If not, Film will scold you.

724
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,520
Damn it! I always do.

725
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:58,480
-Let's go home.
-Alright, see you.

726
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:00,760
See you guys!

727
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:02,600
Bye-bye!

728
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:04,160
-See you!
-Get home safe

729
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:06,120
See you later!

730
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:09,320
Bye-bye!

731
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:14,720
-Noh!
-Yes?

732
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:15,640
How are you getting home?

733
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:18,320
I don't know.

734
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:22,240
Not sleepy anymore?

735
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:25,200
You didn't wake me!

736
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:28,160
I said just 10 minutes!

737
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:32,280
Eh, are your shoulders tired?

738
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:35,000
Tired

739
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:37,720
What do you want me to do?

740
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:39,080
Massage?

741
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:41,760
No.

742
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:44,160
What should I do?

743
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:57,120
-Bow your head?
-Bow my head?

744
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:00,360
Bow your head.

745
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:02,560
Down more...

746
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:04,280
I can't more!

747
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:06,040
Practicing for ROTC?

748
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:09,520
-Did you close your eyes?
-Yes I did.

749
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:21,800
Open your eyes.

750
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:25,800
Whoa.

751
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:32,320
There were some left?!

752
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:33,960
It's my own.

753
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:39,760
-Oh, it's okay.
-No, just keep it.

754
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:43,800
If it’s mine...

755
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:45,120
Just accept it, okay?

756
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:51,680
Alright, thanks, man.

757
00:59:58,480 --> 00:59:59,280
Noh!

758
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:01,000
Not leaving yet?

759
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:04,040
Just about to.

760
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:04,920
What about you?

761
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:07,720
Well, still waiting.

762
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:14,520
But our ride’s here.

763
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:17,720
-Can you stay here alone?
-Yeah.

764
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:18,680
You go ahead.

765
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:20,640
Alright then. Bye-bye.

766
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:22,120
See you!

767
01:00:58,720 --> 01:00:59,520
Noh!

768
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:02,240
You ever see something you didn’t wanna see?

769
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:05,320
Honestly, I saw Phun and Aim today.

770
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:07,360
They didn’t really seem that close as a couple.

771
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:09,520
So, do you love Aim?

772
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:12,720
What if it’s like you?

773
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:16,360
I feel the same about you.

774
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:26,680
