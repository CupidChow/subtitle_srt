-Make sure you tidy up.

185
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,480
-Turn off the lights too
-Alright.

186
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,760
Bye-bye

187
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,400
[Don't be like that.]
[Be careful who you choose to be with.]

188
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,760
[A politician's son implicated in a pyramid scheme case.]

189
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,440
[Dad, you know all of my friends.]

190
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,160
Dad:
[And your girlfriend?]

191
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,400
[Don’t get involved with people you barely know.]
[How about Pat, Mr. Thian's daughter? She's pretty.]

192
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,480
President of the Music Club here, requesting a budget review for this semester.

193
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,160
Noh!

194
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,200
Phun!

195
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,839
-Where’s Fi?
-He’s already left.

196
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,800
Damn, what now?

197
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:18,040
[Dad]: What's up!

198
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:19,640
Phun!

199
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,599
So, can you check for me?

200
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,839
Something wrong with the budget.

201
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,720
-Is it wrong?
-Yeah.

202
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,400
Here it is.

203
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,480
Why is there so little left?

204
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,680
Is this your signature?

205
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,600
It's not.

206
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,040
So... who did you send that day?

207
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,280
Who did I send...

208
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,200
Damn Ngor!

209
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,600
Oh man...

210
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,000
What should I do?

211
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,280
We haven’t even paid for the drums yet, and now we’re out of money.

212
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,400
[I'm free this Saturday.]

213
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,560
There's another way.

214
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:28,800
What is it?

215
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,960
Tell me please...

216
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,880
I’ll do whatever it takes!

217
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,640
Just tell me please.

218
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,600
So...

219
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,440
how about you be my boyfriend?

220
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,040
Your dad's a prick.

221
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,760
Damn, it’s so easy for him to say, like inviting me to play soccer.

222
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:24,920
And what did you do?

223
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,040
I cussed him out and just left.

224
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,680
Does he think he can do whatever he wants just because he's on the board?

225
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,320
What the hell are you laughing at?

226
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,760
I knew it. Someone with your fair skin and Chinese looks will be targeted someday.

227
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,320
Not just Phun, others are eyeing you too.

228
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:39,920
F**k

229
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,000
Are you sure you heard him right?

230
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,360
Why?

231
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:49,040
Well, he already has a girlfriend, right?

232
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,120
Her name’s Aim.

233
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,400
She goes to a convent school, really pretty.

234
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,920
You've seen her before, right?

235
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,320
I see...

236
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,200
Yeah, that’s right.

237
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,920
Talk to you later.

238
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:00,840
See you!

239
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,000
[Aim]
[Where are you?]

240
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,880
[I'm already home.]

241
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,120
For such a big house, there’s no doorbell?

242
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,640
Phun!

243
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,840
Phun! Phun! Phun!

244
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,200
Phun!

245
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:33,880
Hello, sir!

246
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,520
Who are you looking for?

247
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,360
I'm Phun's friend.

248
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,640
Phun!

249
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,520
Please.

250
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,040
Your friend is here to see you.

251
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,160
Okay, please.

252
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,120
I’ll excuse myself.

253
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,400
Oh.

254
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,200
Hey, what were you doing? I’ve been calling you.

255
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,800
So... how about you be my boyfriend?

256
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,480
What are you doing here?

257
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,040
And what was that earlier today?

258
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,880
Were you joking?

259
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,040
I wasn’t joking.

260
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,360
Okay, then I’m leaving.

261
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,400
Wait!

262
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,680
You’re already here, might as well stay for a bit.

263
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,720
If you’ve got something to say, just say it.

264
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,760
But it was you who came.

265
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,440
So earlier at the council meeting...

266
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,840
what was that?

267
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,560
Did I hear wrong?

268
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,680
- I thought I heard you say...
- Noh, be my boyfriend.

269
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,080
That’s what I said.

270
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,440
But you already have a girlfriend?

271
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:37,880
Alright, I’m leaving.

272
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,520
I do have a girlfriend,

273
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,160
but my family might not like her.

274
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,240
They’ve already picked someone for me.

275
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,280
Picked?

276
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,360
Look!

277
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,760
If there’s only one way to survive..

278
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,280
I'll ask Pang for help.

279
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,760
Who’s Pang?

280
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,640
But she won't help unless you're involved.

281
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,280
Paeng!

282
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,680
Paeng is my sister.

283
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,720
You could say she’s a bit spoiled.

284
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,480
Our parents give her whatever she wants.

285
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,640
But after she hit 9th grade, she started to change:

286
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,240
the series she watches,

287
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,520
the books she reads...

288
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,520
it’s all different now.

289
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,320
And it's not just fiction and series.

290
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,080
she’s started shipping real people.

291
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,320
And then...

292
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,560
She’s the only one who can talk to my dad.

293
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,120
She said she’d help...

294
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,520
if my boyfriend was a guy.

295
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:43,200
and even better if he’s cute.

296
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,800
And who's cute?

297
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,480
Me? You kidding?

298
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,000
There are many guys in the Barbie gang

299
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,880
There are more than three thousand people in the school

300
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,640
Someone else should be able to impress Pang.

301
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,880
Why me?

302
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,080
Because you’re perfect.

303
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,560
So I can pay you back.

304
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,000
Just play along when she’s around.

305
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,040
And about the club, I'll handle it.

306
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,640
Who are you talking to, Phun?

307
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:21,880
Paeng!

308
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:30,600
[Paeng]

309
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,160
Oh, your friend’s here?

310
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,560
Yes.

311
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,680
Just a friend.

312
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,280
A friend?

313
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,480
This is Noh.

314
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,800
Actually, you said you wanted to meet him.

315
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,400
so I told him to come by.

316
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,880
This is Noh!

317
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,480
My boyfriend.

318
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,720
I'll take it myself.

319
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,680
-Back off, it’s too warm.
-I'll adjust the air-con.

320
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,000
It's easier to just back off.

321
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,840
Go!

322
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:05,280
Try the orange, it's very sweet.

323
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,560
Oh, thanks.

324
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,560
Delicious

325
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,720
Feed me!

326
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,960
-Get your own.
-My hands will get dirty.

327
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,560
Then close your eyes.

328
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,160
Open your mouth.

329
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,440
Want to eat, right? Rich kid!

330
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,080
You eat by yourself. You try to eat.

331
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,880
Try eating first

332
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,280
Phun and Noh, how long have you been dating?

333
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,480
Just now.

334
00:27:59,040 --> 00:27:59,840
It's been a month.

335
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:06,560
And who liked whom first?

336
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,240
-Noh
-Him.

337
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,520
Noh liked me first.

338
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,640
So what do you like about Poon?

339
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,280
Money...

340
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,280
Ouch!

341
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,120
Oh...

342
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,200
Because he's pure handsome

343
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,080
Unanimously handsome.

344
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,040
Out of 10 people,

345
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,600
11 would say he's handsome

346
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:41,760
Super handsome!

347
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,320
Top score in handsomenessม

348
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,160
at least has to reach 99.

349
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,480
Handsome with an aura so strong that even during a total solar eclipse, you can still see the handsomeness.

350
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,880
Handsome with no dark age.

351
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,280
Handsome from birth. Standing handsome, walking handsome,

352
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,520
Even eating spicy hotpot, he’s still handsome.

353
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,840
Because of this.

354
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,440
that’s why I like him.

355
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,080
Wow...you’re giving him more compliments than I ever have.

356
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,560
But...

357
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,080
Phun doesn't eat spicy hotpot, right?

358
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,280
Really?

359
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,440
Oh, we went together once.

360
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:23,080
It’s already past 9 PM.

361
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,000
Noh had better go home now.

362
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,480
Wait a minute.

363
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:36,080
Are you really going to let Noh go home? You said it's late, right?

364
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,400
Then I will take him home.

365
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,360
Let Noh stay at our place.

366
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,080
Huh?

367
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,520
It’s late. How can you go back?

368
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,800
Phun's room is spacious.

369
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,800
I can’t sleep here.

370
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,680
I don’t have any clothes.

371
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,280
It's okay.

372
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,800
It’s okay. Phun has plenty!

373
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,800
You can open the closet and choose.

374
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,840
-What about shoes?
-Phun has many pairs.

375
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,160
-What about bags?
-He has spares.

376
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,880
-Well, the school codes might not match. Will it okay?

377
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,200
No one checks anyway.

378
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,800
See? You just stay here.

379
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,080
No, I can't sleep. I have to go home. Bye bye.

380
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:24,400
You think you can just ask me to talk to dad because you have a boyfriend now?

381
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,480
It’s not that easy.

382
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:31,160
And if you don’t take care of your boyfriend, I’m not talking to dad for you either.

383
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,080
Noh!

384
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,680
Sleep here.

385
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,320
Going back late is dangerous.

386
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,480
My room is huge.

387
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,760
Let's check.

388
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,360
Hello, mom.

389
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,040
Yes.

390
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,560
I'll be sleeping at a friend's home.

391
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,080
Not going anywhere

392
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:19,840
I’ll be back tomorrow.

393
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,080
Yes.

394
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,480
Okay.

395
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,640
Love you.

396
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:27,840
Bye.

397
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,880
Have you called home yet?

398
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,840
Yeah!

399
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,880
Yeah, this one.

400
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:15,880
The uniform for you to wear tomorrow,

401
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,840
Thank you. I got it.

402
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,280
By the way, thanks a lot for today.

403
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,640
Don't forget to pay me.

404
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,640
So, your dad’s trying to find you a partner

405
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,280
because of that news?

406
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,760
Being rich must be tough, huh?

407
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:54,280
Whether you're rich or poor, if your family doesn't understand, it's tough on everyone.

408
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,120
Well, at least

409
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,600
you're tough in an air-con room.

410
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,480
Look!

411
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,480
Go.

412
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:15,720
Let's sleep.

413
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:25,040
Don’t worry about money.

414
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,160
I’ll take care of it.

415
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,440
Thanks.

416
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,040
Um,

417
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:41,560
Phun!

418
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,080
What's up, Paeng?

419
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,880
I just brought an extra blanket

420
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,720
in case Noh's cold.

421
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,640
Well, he's not cold anymore.

422
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,160
Thank you.

423
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,920
Alright, I'm get going.

424
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:31,920
Sorry about that.

425
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,280
No one’s coming in now.

426
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,080
Time to sleep.

427
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:26,960
I need it...

428
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,840
-Hey, Noh!
-Hey, what's up!

429
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:55,520
-Where are you going? Let's talk first.
-Why so rush?

430
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,000
-Where are you going?

431
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,800
Stop, stop...

432
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,520
Wait!

433
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,800
Whose shirt are you wearing?

434
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:05,880
That’s not your pants...

435
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:09,000
Damn! And those shiny shoes, are they even yours?

436
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,360
Your student ID doesn’t even match either.

437
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,560
Damn, Noh!

438
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,680
Where were you last night?

439
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,120
Oh hey!

440
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,880
Yeah.

441
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,160
Sup!

442
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,560
Tell us once, bastard!

443
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,160
Alright...

444
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,600
-I stayed over at Phun’s house last night.
-Huh?

445
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,640
Phun from the council, right?

446
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,080
So, you actually agreed to that?

447
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,520
agreed to what?

448
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,120
No, it’s not like that.

449
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:51,800
Then what’s it like?

450
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,080
Yeah.

451
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,840
Eh, I’ll explain later.

452
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,480
[Yuri]
The true love is calling.

453
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,400
It's not.

454
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,160
Isn't it?

455
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,880
How many years has she flirted with you?

456
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,000
Just go for it. Yuri’s cute!

457
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,800
What’s up, Yu?

458
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,960
Noh, why didn't you answer last night?

459
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,800
Last night?

460
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,760
I was at a friend’s house and my battery died.

461
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,640
And I just charged it.

462
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,600
Whose place?

463
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:53,360
-Do you need something?
- Yes!

464
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,640
Let’s have dinner together. Same place as before.

465
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,200
Please!

466
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,600
I haven’t seen you in forever; I miss you.

467
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,840
But I have club activities this evening.

468
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:05,600
I can wait.

469
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,120
So, you'll come right?

470
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,200
Huh?

471
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,840
Yay!!!!!! See you this evening!

472
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,000
Okay

473
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,600
Hey, Damn Ohm!

474
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,040
That's my food. I still haven't tasted a bite of my food.

475
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,000
Go buy me another one!

476
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:32,160
C’mon, man, just a little bit. I’ll feed you! Come on!

477
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,400
Open your mouth!

478
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,320
Fucking feeding me. It's disgusting!

479
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,160
It’s just a little, geez.

480
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,040
[Jean] [Nan]

481
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,200
[Yuri]

482
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,080
Let's get started.

483
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,200
Here is for Noh.

484
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:00,960
Yes.

485
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,600
So, is Noh coming or not?

486
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,600
And what about Ohm?

487
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,800
If he comes, what should we get him to eat?

488
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,320
You ate everything, Nan!

489
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,880
Well, when you’re in love, of course you get hungry!

490
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,000
Me?

491
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:17,800
I’ve spent all my energy thinking about Ohm.

492
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,040
It’s not like you, who doesn’t have anyone to love!

493
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,800
Don’t worry about it.

494
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,600
If Noh comes, I’ll just order more.

495
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:27,680
Noh doesn’t like this kind of food, though, Jeen.

496
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,880
No Noh only likes junk food.

497
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,120
Wait,

498
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,480
do you even really like Noh?

499
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,000
Right?

500
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,280
Noh!

501
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:41,960
Come sit here.

502
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,400
-Hello, eveyone.
-Hi!

503
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,920
-Hello!

504
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,080
Hey, Noh!

505
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:52,800
Oh, hey.

506
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,160
Why didn't you tell me? We could have come together.

507
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,240
[Lee]

508
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,680
Why are you sitting there, Noh?

509
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,280
Well, this is free.

510
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,360
Come on, sit next to me.

511
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,080
It’s fine, I’ll stay here.

512
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,120
Next to me is free to, come and sit here.

513
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,680
It's okay here.

514
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:14,960
Stop fighting over...

515
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,360
I’ll move so you two can sit together.

516
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,080
There, done!

517
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:18,920
Thanks, Lee.

518
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,080
Making way for love!

519
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,720
Noh, what do you want to eat?

520
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:29,040
I can order for you. I know what you like.

521
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:30,720
Please, I'll order the food.

522
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:36,960
Let me have pizza, spaghetti,

523
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,240
everything that you have...

524
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,280
Wait a minute.

525
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,240
Your girlfriend?

526
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,040
Friend.

527
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,760
[Aim]

528
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,960
Noh and Phun, are you two close?

529
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:04,120
Yeah, we’re close. Noh even stayed over at my place last night.

530
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,600
Ohhh, so it was Noh last night?

531
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:09,480
Yeah,

532
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,320
Here!

533
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,280
Look!

534
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,000
Still wearing my shirt.

535
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:37,720
Hello there.

536
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:41,000
-Are you Aim, from ATM?
-Yes, that’s me.

537
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,160
I follow you online!

538
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:45,800
I love both you and your mom.

539
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,680
Can I take a picture with you?

540
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:53,080
I won’t charge you for the meal. You just tag our restaurant!

541
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,480
Can you please do it too?

542
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,920
The real one is very handsome.

543
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,560
Let me take a selfie.

544
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,760
Hey, they’re not shooting you.

545
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,120
Thanks! Enjoy your meal!

546
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,120
Oh, she's left.

547
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,560
It's okay. I have to be pretty

548
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:11,560
in case Ohm shows up.

549
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,320
-C'mon, let me take it for you.
-Okay.

550
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,480
Let’s take a picture together!

551
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,280
It's too cute.

552
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,320
Bye-bye

553
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,360
Okay, get home safe.

554
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:50,960
Bye-bye

555
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,360
Are we not going to keep walking together?

556
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:00,680
It’s getting late. Your mom’s going to be mad.

557
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:09,160
Alright, let’s do something tomorrow. I’ll buy you whatever you want.

558
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,120
Really?

559
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:13,560
Okay.

560
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,000
See you.

561
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:24,520
Take care of Aim for me, Lee.

562
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,000
What are you doing?

563
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,440
Taking license plate photos.

564
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,680
Don't you do it?

565
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,480
You’re a terrible boyfriend!

566
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,320
Look!

567
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:50,200
Fuckin' high tech, huh?

568
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:55,760
Alright, we can go now.

569
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:58,080
Huh?

570
00:43:58,600 --> 00:43:59,360
We?

571
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:04,200
-Wait, what,
-Did you forget about the bike?

572
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:13,880
Oh shit!

573
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:16,120
Oh right.

574
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:19,360
Damn it.

575
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:21,320
Let's go.

576
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:23,880
Just a quick stop.

577
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,880
Hey, I don’t want to go!

578
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,920
It’ll be quick.

579
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:29,720
Come on, let’s go.

580
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,160
It won't take long.

581
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:45,320
-Phun, have you eaten yet?
--Yes, I've eaten, ma'am.

582
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,080
Where is yesterday's bike?

583
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,720
Bike?

584
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:56,320
-Oh, the orange one?
-Yeah, that's one.

585
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:58,960
Mr. Nan took it to wash.

586
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:03,600
I asked him to wash it earlier this afternoon, but his back hurt, so he just got to it now.

587
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:04,720
Back pain...

588
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:06,520
And where’s the bike now?

589
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:09,640
Over there, he is washing it.

590
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,000
Sir!!

591
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:14,960
Sir!

592
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,720
-Oh sir! You don’t have to wash it.
-It's okay.

593
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,880
I’ll wash it myself.

594
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:22,920
Don’t worry, I’ll wash it quick. Then I'll call you.

595
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:25,240
No, no, I can do it.

596
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,200
But you’re a guest! You can’t wash it yourself!

597
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,680
It’s fine, I wash cars often. I can wash others too.

598
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:31,600
-That thing you even can't do.
-Yes I can.

599
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:34,520
Don’t worry, I’ve got this. I'll call you later.

600
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,920
Mr. Nan let's get inside. We'll handle it.

601
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:40,360
But...

602
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,920
please follow this. You can get inside.

603
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,560
Are you sure it’s okay?

604
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,600
Absolutely, sir!  I’ll handle it.

605
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:51,400
Well, if you say so.

606
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,240
Yes, sir.

607
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:56,920
-Ouch!
-You'd better get inside.

608
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:58,520
I'll wash it myself.

609
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,640
I want to stay here to see if you actually know how to wash a car.

610
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:02,880
Oh, this dude!

611
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,000
Did you say I couldn't do it?

612
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:05,720
Oh, hey!

613
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:14,320
Noh!

614
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:15,640
you're fucking do this?

615
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:17,960
Oh, so now you said fuck huh? Rich kid.

616
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:18,920
Of course!

617
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,040
So cold!

618
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:08,840
Fucking tired.

619
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,680
My eyes hurt.

620
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:17,760
Are they washing the bike?

621
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:19,040
Yes, they are.

622
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:22,160
They’re washing it out on the lawn.

623
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:25,920
Look at them!

624
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:46,360
So cute!

625
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:03,560
Right here, right here, right here.

626
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:04,480
Yeah, it's here.

627
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:05,720
Yeah.

628
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:18,320
Thank you for taking me home.

629
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:20,560
I’m not taking you back, though.

630
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:22,320
All right,

631
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:23,640
take care.

632
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:26,920
-Noh!
-Yeah...

633
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:33,720
don’t worry about the club budget.

634
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:36,520
I'll handle it.

635
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,320
Thanks a lot.

636
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:42,960
See you.

637
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:44,560
See you later.

638
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:18,960
Noh!

639
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:22,320
Yes.

640
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:25,880
The grilled pork is almost finished, come and eat.

641
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:48,520
Hey, daddy!

642
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:52,720
Last night I heard a bike outside the house.

643
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:53,520
Can you hear it?

644
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:55,480
No, I was asleep by 9 PM.

645
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:56,720
I didn't hear anything.

646
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:57,560
Oh, yeah?

647
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:58,480
Okay, okay.

648
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:02,480
Im & Am did you finish? I'm getting hungry.

649
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,760
Here you go, madam.

650
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:06,560
Just only these?

651
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:08,560
Did you already wash that?

652
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:09,520
Go wash it first.

653
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:11,400
Oh, so sorry.

654
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:14,560
-Morning!
-Morning, Noh!

655
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:16,720
Here, eat!

656
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:18,520
Looks delicious?

657
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:29,720
Calm down, son.

658
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:32,560
Or you’ll choke! Careful, eat slowly.

659
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:33,640
Alright?

660
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:36,760
Uh,

661
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:39,640
let me see your arm. What happened?

662
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:41,840
Oh gosh...

663
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:43,760
What did you do this time?

664
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:45,520
You know you’re sensitive.

665
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,960
Did I tell you not to touch random stuff.

666
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,120
-I was just washing the motorbike.
-Washing the bike?

667
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:52,320
Let's do this...

668
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:55,200
Next time, don't bring home a cleaned bike.

669
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:56,480
let Dad wash it.

670
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:57,240
Oh!

671
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:58,480
Why did you say that?

672
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:00,960
Because he’s the one who should be doing it.

673
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:06,280
I don’t understand why the men in this house always make me complain.

674
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:10,000
The other person is naughty. The other person doesn't have to do anything, just play with the Ipad.

675
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:11,640
I'm so sick!

676
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,040
Im & Am, did you already finish?

677
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:17,480
Grapes, there you go.

678
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:19,440
Oh this so good!

679
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:23,240
- This one is coffee.
- Oh, thank you.

680
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:25,560
Just put it here.

681
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:27,880
-Mom!
-Yes!

682
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:29,600
I'll get going.

683
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:31,200
Oh alright!

684
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:35,240
See you later, Dad!

685
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:40,160
Bye-bye

686
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:42,720
Oh, don't you kiss?

687
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:47,080
Bye! focus in class, okay?

688
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:49,920
Mama, why didn’t he kiss me?

689
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:53,200
Because your cheek doesn’t smell as good as mine.

690
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:54,040
Really?

691
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:54,960
Yes.

692
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:56,560
Let me kiss you then.

693
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:58,840
You've already been teasing like this.

694
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,440
You better kiss the grilled pork.

695
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:15,920
Oh...

696
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:19,120
Where’s the watch?

697
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:23,680
Hi mom, I'm sleeping over at a friend's house.

698
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:25,800
Not going anywhere

699
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:37,480
Hello?

700
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:38,600
[Phun] Hello?

701
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:40,360
Are you skipping school today?

702
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:42,360
[Phun] Yeah.

703
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:43,760
Why?

704
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:45,840
[Phun] I’m not feeling well.

705
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:46,960
Oh, what happened?

706
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:49,240
[Phun] Do you want anything?

707
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:50,920
Nothing.

708
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:53,200
Just wanna ask if my watch is at your place?

709
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,880
[Phun] Yeah, I’ve kept it for you.

710
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:55,760
Okay.

711
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:58,120
Okay, I’ll pick it up tomorrow.

712
00:52:58,720 --> 00:52:59,600
Get some rest.

713
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:01,000
Alright.

714
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:02,960
Okay.

715
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:15,280
[Mom] What did you do this time?

716
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,320
[Mom] You know you’re sensitive.

717
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:19,480
[Mom] I told you not touch random stuff.

718
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:32,120
I'm sorry to bother you.

719
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:34,120
No problem at all. Please!

720
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:37,920
-Phun is resting now, alright?
-Yes.

721
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:40,840
-The room over there. You can go ahead.
-Thank you.

722
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:21,480
Allergy meds?

723
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:23,600
Why did he get involved then?

724
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:25,880
Because you started it.

725
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:31,360
Are you really sick?

726
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:34,320
Come to visit me?

727
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:37,760
No,

728
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:39,280
No, I’m here for the watch.

729
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:43,960
It's over there.

730
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:46,520
Okay.

731
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:03,960
Got what you needed? Then go.

732
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:06,840
I’m not leaving.

733
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:10,360
If I leave now, they’ll make me run laps.

734
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:11,680
Better stay here.

735
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:15,120
How’s your allergy? Is it bad?

736
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:21,000
Put ointment yet?

737
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:23,280
Huh?

738
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:35,280
Don't worry about me.

739
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,560
Did you?

740
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:40,640
Oh,

741
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:43,840
Why haven’t you? Come on, let’s put it on.

742
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:46,440
-No,I don't want.
-Get up! Hurry!

743
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:48,080
Get up.

744
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:50,480
Come on, get up.

745
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:53,640
Get up, ge up!

746
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,280
Come on, I'll put it on.

747
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:02,680
You said it already.

748
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:04,920
Yeah.

749
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:08,560
Wait, why are you taking off?

750
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:11,720
Because I’m allergic inside too.

751
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:14,760
Alright.

752
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:03,960
I'm sorry

753
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,520
I didn’t know you were allergic.

754
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:12,480
I didn't think you were either.

755
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:16,760
Let me apply it to you.

756
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:18,880
Hey!

757
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:20,320
What?

758
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:31,320
You put a lot.

759
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:37,120
Does it hurt?

760
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:38,880
A little itchy

761
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:51,920
Your turn.

762
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:03,120
Ouch.

763
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:06,320
-Does it hurt?
-Yeah.

764
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:07,920
Just a little.

765
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:18,320
Done.

766
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:20,320
Let’s get the front.

767
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:25,480
No need the front.

768
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:27,920
Who on earth said that?

769
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:29,000
Stay still.

770
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:45,960
-Does it hurt?
-Yeah.

771
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:30,400
Ouch, Noh!

772
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:31,920
What are you zoning out about?

773
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:37,520
Get some sleep so you can get better quickly.

774
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,120
Yeah, go rest.

775
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:50,720
Don't you go to study?

776
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:52,760
Nope.

777
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:58,760
Well, if you need anything, ask Ms. Noi.

778
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:02,200
I don't want anything.

779
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:04,400
Just sleep well.

780
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:05,680
Sweet dreams.

781
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:13,920
Is Noh not coming? I thought he was just late.

782
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:15,400
Is he sick?

783
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:18,520
Knowing him, if he were sick,

784
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:21,320
He’d still come just to save skip days!

785
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:24,520
-So, he’s skipping class, right?
-For sure.

786
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:30,880
If he were skipping,

787
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:32,160
I'd know that.

788
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:34,840
Maybe. He’s grown up now.

789
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:36,880
True.

790
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:59,840
-Hello.
-Hey, damn Noh!

791
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:02,480
Where...are...you?

792
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:04,320
I'm at my grandma's house.

793
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:05,880
Do you see me stupid?

794
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:07,920
Your grandma lives in Phetchaburi.

795
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:10,080
Yeah, I'm in Phetchaburi.

796
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:22,480
Oh, brother.

797
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:25,680
You cleaning up? Want some help?

798
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:27,480
It's okay.

799
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:29,120
You're sure? There are many.

800
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:31,920
Hold on, Noh, don’t hang up yet.

801
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:34,440
Hey, what’s going on here?

802
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:36,480
I was just offering help to the kid.

803
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:38,160
Just let him take it; not a big deal.

804
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:40,720
Not a big deal? Look at the kid.

805
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:42,240
How can he do it?

806
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:47,360
Let him try first. If he can’t handle it, then help him.

807
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:58,560
Kitty face with Hulk energy.

808
01:01:58,760 --> 01:01:59,640
Look at him!

809
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:01,760
What the hell is weird?

810
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:03,960
I told you he could.

811
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:05,560
Hey, damn Noh!

812
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,120
So where are you now?

813
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:16,600
Cold...

814
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:18,160
Wait, whose voice was that?

815
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:20,200
Alone.

816
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:22,280
So, where are you?

817
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:24,120
Cold

818
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:26,320
Turn off the air-con.

819
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:29,880
Damn, Noh!

820
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:32,400
I’ll talk to you later, man.

821
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:34,080
Oh, Noh!

822
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:38,760
What the heck? I don't know who the fuck is with him.

823
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:53,720
Turn off the AC.

824
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:55,200
If so, it´ll be hot.

825
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:57,880
You’ve got a fever, don’t you?

826
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:03,320
Oh, it's hot.

827
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:06,160
Do you take medicine?

828
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,120
Don't you take medicine?

829
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:13,040
Let's take some.

830
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:55,520
So, I'll see you at Siam this evening, alright?

831
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:58,160
-Ohm!
-Sup?

832
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:01,400
How close can two people be when they are so close?

833
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:04,400
Can we take photos with you?

834
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,280
Are you cold?

835
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:13,920
Hug me like before.

836
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:16,600
You can hug me.

837
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:22,160
