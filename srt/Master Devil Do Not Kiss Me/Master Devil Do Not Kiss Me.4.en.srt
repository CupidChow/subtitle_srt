00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:18,830
Wang Jian Ren!

2
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:25,500
Wang Jian Ren!

3
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:28,020
Don't hit me!

4
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,160
What's wrong with you?

5
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,980
Help me copy some homework.

6
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,520
I have to help Wan Zi.
She has a lot of homework.

7
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,700
I need it before school is finished.

8
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,820
Please help.

9
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:43,230
I can't help you.

10
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:44,530
An Chu Xia! Come out!

11
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:52,540
Wan Zi.

12
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:54,510
I haven't finished yet.

13
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,500
Where is An Chu Xia?

14
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,180
She's not here right now.

15
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,600
I'll pass your message to her.

16
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:08,190
You're so close to her, huh?

17
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:11,230
Are you helping her
to seduce Young Master Han?

18
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,870
I don't know.

19
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:16,120
You don't know?

20
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:18,850
-Really?
-Really.

21
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:21,100
-Really?
-Really.

22
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,970
Say it!

23
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,780
I really don't know.

24
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,900
Wan Zi.

25
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:29,450
Behave yourself.

26
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:33,990
Xin Wei, I'm sure he's an accomplice.

27
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:37,620
I won't let go of any one of them.

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,160
You shouldn't laugh.

29
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:50,370
You'd better give up. We're going
to suffer if we mess with them.

30
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:54,880
I know a lot of words,
but I never remember "give up".

31
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,620
I'm happy with what you just did.

32
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,030
It seems I shouldn't
have worried about you.

33
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,540
It won't kill me.

34
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:06,610
I'm fine.

35
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,890
-I'm worried if...
-Anyway, thank you.

36
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,260
I was afraid that you'd chop
Qi Lu with a knife.

37
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,600
Your concern is necessary.

38
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:20,460
How could I have a boy crazy as a friend?

39
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,810
How can you say that?

40
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:26,910
What I've said is true, you
always put dates before mates.

41
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:31,210
I've never fallen in love.

42
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:34,360
You shouldn't say that.
How am I going to go for a date then?

43
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,050
Meng Xiao Nan!

44
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:42,440
Look at her! She's bullying me!

45
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,460
Are all the girls from
Taiwan as strong as you?

46
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,370
Don't tease me.

47
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:52,710
My Mandarin is not so fluent.

48
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,200
No, it's fluent.

49
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,410
Sorry to make you scared.

50
00:02:58,450 --> 00:02:59,930
See you.

51
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:03,900
Scared? Who makes him scared?

52
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:08,120
-How can you say that?
-Let's go.

53
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,730
Say it!

54
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:10,810
Stop it!

55
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,710
How dare you come back?

56
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:22,850
I just come back to my own class.

57
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:24,300
An Chu Xia.

58
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,640
We meet again.

59
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,730
You turn into a sweet girl
from punk, huh?

60
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,900
You always make me surprised.

61
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:35,950
Gosh!

62
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,150
We're in trouble.

63
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:41,150
Xin Wei is talking to you.
Are you a dumb?

64
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:45,020
Behave yourself and speak nicely.

65
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,630
I heard you're pregnant
with Qi Lu's baby.

66
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:57,330
Only an idiot will believe rumors.

67
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:00,700
Think so.

68
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,450
I can't believe a milk sender can study here.

69
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:09,170
You should be glad
to have classmates like us.

70
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:14,970
You can't get a man
by just sticking to him

71
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,720
Be it school or business,

72
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,740
it's from our generation
to our father's father.

73
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,720
I just wanted to tell you.

74
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:27,790
You should focus on learning

75
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,920
and don't think about others.

76
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:34,660
It's useless to care about others.

77
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:38,760
Study hard and improve yourself.

78
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:39,800
Got it?

79
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:53,440
Got it! A father's father
should be a Grandpa.

80
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:58,870
Terrible.

81
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:01,060
I don't know what she's doing.

82
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,290
Witch!

83
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:11,120
Chu Xia.

84
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,270
Thank you.

85
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:15,320
I can't protect you forever.

86
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,410
Remember .

87
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:18,140
Stand up for yourself.

[Master Devil Do Not Kiss Me]

89
00:06:20,531 --> 00:06:21,265
[Episode 4]

90
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,540
Who did it?

91
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,900
Stand up!

92
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,380
We just wanted to play
a prank on the teacher.

93
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,520
Master Han, it's a misunderstanding.

94
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:49,280
We didn't expect to fool your maid.

95
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:55,980
Misunderstanding?

96
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,310
It creeps me out.

97
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,240
Insane!

98
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,840
Mo Xin Wei went to
Class B to meet An Chu Xia.

99
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:20,020
But An Chu Xia fought back bravely.

100
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,900
An Chu Xia stole Mo Xin Wei's boyfriend.

101
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:25,800
And Mo Xin Wei was kicked out
when she went to see her.

102
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:28,170
How could a mistress be so bold?

103
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,680
An Chu Xia, you stole my man!

104
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,980
An Chu Xia was so bold.
Looks like we guess it right.

105
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,840
She must be pregnant with Han's baby.

106
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:41,520
An Chu Xia was proved to be
pregnant with Han Qi Lu's baby.

107
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:43,000
They will get married soon.

108
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,560
I'm An Chu Xia.

109
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:53,400
If you make the rumor again,
I'll sew your mouth.

110
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,500
Oh!

111
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:15,040
I was relieved when I saw you

112
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,180
teaching her a lesson.

113
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,110
I can eat four more bowls of rice today.

114
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:22,400
Meng Four Bowls.

115
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,720
Didn't you ask me to give up?
Aren't you afraid of it?

116
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,540
Afraid, we're going
to keep a low profile.

117
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,220
But Wan Xi is a small potato.

118
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:37,070
Mo Xin Wei is the most terrible person.

119
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:39,230
She's Han Qi Lu's real girlfriend.

120
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:41,720
I'm not even afraid of
Han Qi Lu, let alone her.

121
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:44,620
No, I have check it out.

122
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:46,280
It was just her wishful thought.

123
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,540
So nothing to be afraid.

124
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,830
Alright, we're not afraid of her.

125
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:51,680
You're awesome.

126
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,330
I'm going to get another bowl of rice.

127
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,200
Chu Xia, here you are.

128
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,290
Do you mind if we sit together?

129
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,980
Can we sit here?

130
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,110
Chu Xia, look at this.

131
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:13,400
The seafood rice ball
was specially made by our chef.

132
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:16,890
Well, I'm allergic to seafood.

133
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:22,420
Chu Xia, are you still angry with us
because of our behaviour before?

134
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:22,870
No.

135
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:23,600
Chu Xia.

136
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,620
Sorry that I didn't know your
relationship with Master Han.

137
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,740
We would never do that if we knew it.

138
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:32,120
Please forgive us.

139
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:34,080
I never get angry with you.

140
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,890
Chu Xia...

141
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,260
Cai Xia, don't cry.

142
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:39,370
Do you really think we're the bad guys?

143
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:42,830
Please don't let Master Han kick us out.

144
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:44,900
We are not close.

145
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,300
Okay, I promise.

146
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,200
No one will make hard on you.

147
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:55,730
-You are the best.
-That's so kind of you.

148
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,450
Chu Xia will back up us later.

149
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:59,530
-No one dares to bully us.
-Yeah.

150
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,070
Dig in.

151
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,010
Dig in.

152
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:02,920
It's delicious.

153
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:03,360
Dig in.

154
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,620
It's good for the baby.

155
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,420
Baby?

156
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,580
I'm not pregnant.

157
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,950
-Alright.
-We got it.

158
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,980
Keep a low profile.

159
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,520
Don't worry.

160
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,280
We won't spread it.

161
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:23,230
Ming Yue, tell your father.

162
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:24,770
If any paparazzi leak the news

163

that Chu Xia is pregnant
with Master Han's baby,

164
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,480
please get him to block it.

165
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:30,420
That's right.

166
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,800
Chu Xia.

167
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,530
-Don't worry.
-We won't spread it.

168
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:38,110
Come on, dig in.

169
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,280
This is delicious.

170
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:39,900
Vitamin.

171
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,600
Dig in.

172
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,400
I'm really allergic.

173
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:44,840
Eat more vegetables.

174
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,030
Alright.

175
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,360
I'll dig in.

176
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:50,460
-Dig in.
-Eat this.

177
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:53,570
-This is nice.
-Eat more.

178
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,110
Eat more.

179
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:57,560
-So delicious.
-So nice.

180
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:05,480
One more.

181
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:09,320
Seafood rice ball.

182
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:18,560
-Dig in.
-Eat more.

183
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:21,480
Even An Chu Xia's friend said that.

184
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,350
it must be true.

185
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,010
Really?

186
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,420
-Must be true.
-How could it be?

187
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,860
Forget it, I don't want to eat.

188
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:35,880
I'm sure you will attend all kinds of
auction when you become a celebrity.

189
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:38,760
So, I'll brief you

190
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:42,240
how to get prepared in the
early stages before the auction

191
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:46,140
and identify the authenticity
of the artwork at the auction.

192
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,950
And the bidding
strategies in the auction.

193
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:54,350
The reference of this
meteorite is 20150408.

194
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:57,780
The Stony-Iron Meteorites
fall to the ground every year.

195
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,440
Are you reborn of Monkey God?

196
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:02,230
You are so excited to see the stone.

197
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:03,680
I'm allergic to seafood.

198
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:07,310
Why did you eat seafood then?

199
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,850
I couldn't reject it.

200
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,460
Scratch for me.

201
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,820
So itchy.

202
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,660
And you didn't even leave one for me.

203
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,230
This is the best of the treasures.

204
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,330
It's a rare treasure.

205
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:21,850
The best of the treasures?

206
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,090
Mr. You Tian.

207
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:26,080
How can you afford it?

208
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:30,190
Well...

209
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:33,470
This is a fake treasure.

210
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,140
There's a legend.

211
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:42,740
The Stony-Iron Meteorites
that fell to Earth

212
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:48,320
is still like a shining star in the sky.

213
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:51,380
It guides the destiny
of people in the midst.

214
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,680
What are you laughing at?

215
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,750
Have you heard of it?

216
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,450
Make a wish to a meteor
and it will come true.

217
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:15,920
I've heard of it.

218
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,280
But it's superstitious.

219
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,840
Because the meteor phenomenon is...

220
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,460
Alright. Don't be a wet blanket.

221
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:28,820
Alright.

222
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:33,790
Actually, I know the wish doesn't
necessarily come true.

223
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:38,190
Sometimes, the power
of our wish is too small.

224
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,830
So we put it on some wonderful legends.

225
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,520
You have the point.

226
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,090
So what did you wish?

227
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,080
I can't tell you.

228
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,570
Otherwise, it will not come true.

229
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,460
It's really too short.

230
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:05,240
If only I could see a meteor every day.

231
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,720
It's easy.

232
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,360
I'll get you the meteors from the sky.

233
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:15,140
So you can wish as much as you want.

234
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:24,540
I took the meteor, but where are you?

235
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,680
Take a look at this.

236
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,210
Blue and white porcelain.

237
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:42,580
Look at it with an intuitive feeling.

238
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,220
Is this genuine or fake?

239
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,020
Chu Xia.

240
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:54,400
Take a look.

241
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:56,660
Is this genuine or fake?

242
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,480
Like a fake one.

243
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:14,310
But also like genuine.

244
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,190
Why?

245
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,810
How do you know?

246
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,870
Be careful.

247
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,000
I don't know.

248
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:27,860
Go back to your seat.
I'll get someone else to see it.

249
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:31,970
It's broken.

250
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:42,380
So, is this genuine or fake?

251
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:55,890
I borrowed the porcelain specifically
from the principal's room.

252
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:58,070
What should I do now?

253
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:02,260
I'll pay for it.

254
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:06,080
How do you want to pay for it?

255
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,330
Can you afford it?

256
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,820
Do you know how much it costs?

257
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:18,320
You go out first.

258
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,080
Will Mr. You Tian scold her?

259
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,220
He was really panic.

260
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,000
What say you?

261
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:36,420
Chu Xia.

262
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:38,000
Did he scold you?

263
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,770
Did you beat him up?

264
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:41,380
How much you are going to pay?

265
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:44,450
He didn't scold me.

266
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:46,210
Don't be kidding. I can't afford it.

267
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:47,770
I've got to figure it out.

268
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:53,090
Since it is irretrievable,

269
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,940
so we can only...

270
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:55,550
What?

271
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:57,960
Let's have some nice food.

272
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:03,810
Let's call Cai Xia together.

273
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,760
-Master Ling.
-What makes you so happy?

274
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:10,740
We are going for a meal with Chu Xia.

275
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,370
Do you want to join us tonight?

276
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:15,260
That's right, let's go together.

277
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,900
Alright, count me in.

278
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:20,530
Let's go together. Chu Xia?

279
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:21,890
I'll pass.

280
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:23,820
-Let's go together.
-Yeah.

281
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:24,970
It will be happier.

282
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:29,750
Let's go together.

283
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,620
I'll bring you to a place.

284
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,580
-Okay.
-Alright.

285
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,340
Okay!

286
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,790
Hurry!

287
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,840
Sit down.

288
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,830
Hurry!

289
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,910
Chu Xia, sit here.

290
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,710
Sit down.

291
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,750
Chu Xia.

292
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:52,670
Can we change to another place?

293
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,860
They don't even have a room for us.

294
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,200
But I've already made an appointment.

295
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,120
Chu Xia, don't bother her.

296
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,110
She is a pretentious chick.

297
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,310
It's a good place.

298
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:04,700
So many people are here.

299
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,560
Will it cause a diarrhea?

300
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:11,270
Touchwood! Only you will have diarrhoea.

301
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:13,540
Who's coming? Do I know him?

302
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,740
Hey!

303
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:19,590
What takes you so long?

304
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:20,320
Sit down.

305
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,980
It was a traffic jam.

306
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,400
Feng Shao?

307
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:30,060
You changed so much.

308
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,810
I almost can't recognize you.

309
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,690
You are getting prettier now.

310
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:37,440
Since you have a sweet tongue,
you must have a lot of friends.

311
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,800
What about me?

312
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:41,130
You are as noisy as before.

313
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:46,320
Meng Xiao Nan, how could you go
with Chu Xia without greeting?

314
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:49,150
You left me alone.
Did you take me as a friend?

315
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:51,100
Let's not talk about it.

316
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:54,040
How did you get hurt on your head?

317
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,870
Well...

318
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:59,060
Introduce your classmates to me first.

319
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,040
Ling Han Yu.

320
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,380
Ming Yue.

321
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:05,610
Cai Xia.

322
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:08,310
Wang Jian Ren.

323
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,740
Ren...

324
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:13,170
Alright.

325
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,120
Stop walking.

326
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,780
You're hurting my eyes.

327
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:25,700
She just went out to dinner with her
classmates and would come back late.

328
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,720
You don't understand a mother.

329
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,460
She's a girl and she hasn't
come back yet. I'm so worried.

330
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,890
Are you her mother?

331
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:38,810
Cut the crap.

332
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,770
Stop eating.

333
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,470
Go look for Chu Xia.

334
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,310
No way.

335
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:51,920
I already got my magnifying...
I got my telescope.

336
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,840
You can't threaten me anymore.

337
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,060
Are you trying to challenge me?

338
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,230
-Han.
-Yes.

339
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,880
Donate the astronomical magnifying
glass to go to kindergarten.

340
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:05,930
Okay.

341
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,870
Don't! I'll go now.

342
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:15,460
I'll go now.

343
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,920
Don't think I can't deal with you.

344
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:32,010
I'm not a good talker.

345
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:34,240
All my words are in the beer.

346
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,710
Cheers.

347
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,660
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

348
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,100
Don't drink too much.

349
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:49,270
Don't drink too much.

350
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,630
You're really something.

351
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,460
Chu Xia, Qi Lu is coming over.

352
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,490
Why?

353
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,500
Of course he's looking for you.

354
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,310
Although we know he's your boyfriend,

355
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,890
I'm still a little scared.

356
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,440
What?

357
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:25,730
Enjoy your food, I have something to do.

358
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,920
Flying Lobster.

359
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:39,090
We're all living here.

360
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:40,480
I have guests today.

361
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:43,660
You may come another day.

362
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,420
I'll be there.

363
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,480
So called brotherhood, huh?

364
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:49,550
Alright.

365
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:52,140
I'm giving you face now.

366
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:53,760
Give me the money.

367
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:55,710
I'll take my man away.

368
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,160
Otherwise,

369
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:06,000
don't think all of you can run away
from here. None of them!

370
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:12,450
3,000 yuan as compensation for a bad
hair cut? Is his hair made of gold?

371
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:14,880
So you are not going to pay?

372
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,650
Feng Shao.

373
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:17,830
Who are they?
