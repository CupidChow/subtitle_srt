00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:19,180
Get out of the way!

2
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:26,500
An Chu Xia, good luck!

3
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,290
I'm looking forward
to seeing you in the final.

4
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,210
Thank you, I won't let you down.

5
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:35,290
It's about beauty, not boxing.

6
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:39,180
I'd like to see how you are not going to let me down.

7
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,390
Isn't that boxing?

8
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:44,210
I always thought my opponent was Tyson.

9
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:46,390
You're stubborn.

10
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:48,270
See you in the final.

11
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,670
Mo Xin Wei, An Chu Xia, look here!

12
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:53,820
Take a picture.

13
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,880
Okay! Thank you.

14
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,010
Chu Xia, what should I do?

15
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:17,740
I feel like I really
like Jiang Chen Chuan.

16
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:19,330
It's true love.

17
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:21,220
All your crushes are true love.

18
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,050
It's different, this is the truest love.

19
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:30,630
I got it. I'll help you get him
when I have time.

20
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:39,160
Chu Xia.

21
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:40,950
Come here.

22
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,060
Look at this.

23
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:46,990
What's going on?

24
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:50,450
These are all from your
little fans and admirer.

25
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,950
Look! There are flowers and snacks.

26
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:59,290
You're getting hot now.

27
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:02,830
As your one of your first loyal fans,

28
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:05,020
I feel so glad.

29
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,720
Look at this.

30
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:12,520
It's like a poem.

31
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,740
Chu Xia, take a look!

32
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,280
What are you doing?

33
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,130
Chu Xia.

34
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:18,850
What are you doing?

35
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:20,630
Don't give it to me!

36
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,600
You...

37
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:24,550
What do you want me to do?

[Episode 23]

40
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:29,340
Welcome back to the final of
our annual Campus Beauty Contest.

41
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,790
First of all, please give your applause

42
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:34,260
to our finalists to cheer them on.

43
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,110
In the final session,

44
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:45,310
first, we'll welcome the Campus Beauties

45
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:48,040
to give their manifesto
and monologue on the stage

46
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,920
Then, all the students,

47
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,110
teachers and judges can start to vote.

48
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:54,620
Okay, I'll just stop here.

49
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,390
Now I'll officially announce

50
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:59,570
the final of the Campus Beauty Contest
officially begins.

51
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,790
Hello everyone, I'm Mo Xin Wei.

52
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,070
Actually, I'm not very good at

53
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,730
giving manifesto and monologue.

54
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:14,730
Many people say I'm pretty.

55
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:19,720
But I think our appearance
will change with age.

56
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:23,250
Only the inner beauty will stay.

57
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:27,010
I'll work harder to be better.

58
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:28,730
I hope you will support me.

59
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:29,540
Thank you.

60
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,710
Xin Wei, very good!

61
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,380
Ready?

62
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,230
Sure, I'm done.

63
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:46,080
An Chu Xia.

64
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:49,170
I'm going to let everyone
see your true colour.

65
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,380
I'm An Chu Xia.

66
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:06,150
I didn't belong here.

67
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,720
Until now,

68
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,170
I still don't feel like I'm here,

69
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:12,740
but in a dream.

70
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,790
Because everything here
makes me feel unreal.

71
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:20,780
I used to live in a place
called Cat Ears Lane.

72
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:30,970
What's going on?

73
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:32,970
I have no idea.

74
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,730
-What's that?
-What's going on?

75
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:41,930
Done!

76
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:44,790
What's going on?

77
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:50,220
Who did it?

78
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,390
Don't look at it!

79
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,540
Turn it off!

80
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,610
As you can see,

81
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:12,960
the girl in the VCR was me.

82
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:17,380
I used to live in a place
called Cat Ears Lane.

83
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,100
My mother and I

84
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:23,470
were staying in a small house.

85
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:27,190
My father left us
when I was very young.

86
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:30,930
So my mother and I relied on each other.

87
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:35,930
When I was young, I used to be
bullied by other children.

88
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,300
But I knew my mother would be worried.

89
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:41,410
So every time I was bullied,

90
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,390
I'd go home with my face covered.

91
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:48,140
Because I was hurt and
I didn't want my mother to see it.

92
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:52,620
When they've had enough
of beating me, I'd get up,

93
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,440
tidy up my clothes and go home.

94
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:58,390
But then I saw my mother

95
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,910
being bullied in the lane.

96
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:05,440
She was home with a smile and told me,

97
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:06,660
"Little Chu Xia,

98
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:08,480
you have to be happy".

99
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,190
"Forget all the troubles and be strong".

100
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:15,160
"Because joyful people are strong inside".

101
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:21,070
"Don't care about people's view".

102
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:23,870
From then,

103
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:26,260
I became strong.

104
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,070
I learned Taekwondo

105
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,810
so that I could protect
myself and my mother.

106
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:33,390
I dressed myself up

107
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:39,820
as what you see and
even what you don't see

108
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,870
to make me look stronger.

109
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:45,170
I don't care people's view.

110
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:47,270
Because since I've changed,

111
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:50,150
no one's ever bullied me
and my mother.

112
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,430
That's my story.

113
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:59,230
I'd like to tell everyone,

114
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:03,110
don't care about the other's view.

115
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:07,280
Be a strong and brave person.

116
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,580
To live the life you want.

117
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,350
Remember.

118
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,480
Be happy.

119
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:39,730
Chu Xia.

120
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,150
Are you ready? It's your turn.

121
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:43,750
Where is my dress?

122
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,550
Xiao Nan, did you see my dress?

123
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,330
No, I didn't. Where did you put?

124
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:48,790
I just put it on that chair.

125
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,330
How could it go missing?

126
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:59,250
Chu Xia.

127
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:04,330
Is this your dress?

128
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:11,810
An Chu Xia, get ready on stage.

129
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:14,010
What now?

130
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:19,930
An Chu Xia.

131
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:22,330
Go for it!

132
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:24,620
Don't forget what I've told you.

133
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,190
What's going on?

134
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,550
Go to the waiting room.

135
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,820
What's going on?

136
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,230
Do you have a sewing machine?

137
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,440
Sewing machine?

138
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:36,110
There's one in the utility room.

139
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:39,430
What's going on?

140
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:41,200
It's not working.

141
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,170
Oh, my God!

142
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:45,120
It's not true.

143
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:55,140
What should we do now?

144
00:09:58,610 --> 00:09:59,610
Where's Chu Xia?

145
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:03,254
Something's wrong with her dress,
she's mending it in the utility room.

146
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:10,850
What should we do now?

147
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,190
Mom, please bless me.

148
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:28,950
Let's go.

149
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:30,450
Let's get another dress.

150
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:32,520
-It should be in time.
-It's too late.

151
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,460
Please try if you can
help me get some time.

152
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:39,130
Alright, it's all done.

153
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,250
You'll play the finale.

154
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,730
Are you going to act as
the Mad Monk with the costume?

155
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:52,450
Can you do me a favor? Is the
projection on that day still there?

156
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:00,250
Qi Lu.

157
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,690
Just do it like last time, okay?

158
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:09,170
What's wrong?

159
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:15,350
That's not enough.

160
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:21,240
Do you remember
you sang the Little Star?

161
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,060
Qi Lu.

162
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,010
Although it sucks,

163
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:33,400
it shouldn't be so bad
with the stage effect.

164
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,750
-But,...
-Alright.

165
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,100
Get ready.

166
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:45,250
You can do it.

167
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:49,710
What's wrong?

168
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:53,050
Don't cry. It's not
the time for sentiment.

169
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:03,330
By the way...

170
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:04,030
Chu Xia.

171
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:07,610
Actually, the little star
is the song of ABC.

172
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,650
A, B, C, D, E, F, G.

173
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:17,610
H, I, J, K, L, M, N...

174
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:18,670
Qi Lu.

175
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:21,260
Thank you.

176
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,030
Young Master Ling.

177
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:40,950
Master wants to see you.

178
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:51,700
My little Chu Xia,
what are you going to do?

179
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:54,510
But it's okay, there are
two men protecting you.

180
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:57,210
What about me?

181
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:59,850
Where's my Young Master Jiang?

182
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,340
Jiang Chen Chuan.

183
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,630
I'm telling you.

184
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:07,340
I like you.

185
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:11,130
Say my name if anyone
bullies you in the future.

186
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:15,610
No way, that's rude.

187
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,560
Young Master Jiang.

188
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,890
I want to be with you.

189
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:29,710
Not so good, it sounds too proactive.

190
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:33,170
Meng Xiao Nan, why are you so timid?

191
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:35,870
Chu Xia, I like you.

192
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,010
Chu Xia.

193
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:40,960
I like you.

194
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,050
Chu Xia, I like you.

195
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:47,610
Chu Xia.

196
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,340
I like you.

197
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,960
I've had a crush on you for a long time.
I hope you...

198
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:12,830
Hello.

199
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,410
Are you An Chu Xia?

200
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:15,560
Yes, I am.

201
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:18,390
Are you looking for your father?

202
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:22,480
Yes.

203
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:25,110
Let's talk.

204
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,850
Where are you?

205
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:29,390
Outside the hall.

206
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:30,330
I'll wait for you.

207
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,780
Don't hang up.

208
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:41,930
Let's welcome our last contestant.

209
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,910
Wow! So nice!

210
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:06,730
Amazing!

211
00:15:07,663 --> 00:15:08,663
Look at that!

212
00:15:12,092 --> 00:15:13,092
What's this?

213
00:15:14,853 --> 00:15:16,353
-Meteor rain?
-That's right.

214
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,030
Thank you.

215
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:51,310
An Chu Xia.

216
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,490
Actually, I...

217
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:57,130
I had something to tell you.

218
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,490
But I didn't have a chance to do so.

219
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,040
After seeing your performance

220
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,580
and your story,

221
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:09,410
it makes me get to know you again.

222
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:11,890
So,

223
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:19,010
I'd like to pour my heart out
on this important day.

224
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:28,940
Please pay attention!

225
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:33,870
Please pay attention!

226
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:35,310
What is he doing there?

227
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:37,260
That's right.

228
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:43,530
That's not what I'm trying to say.
I want to tell you...

229
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,120
Xiang Man Kui?

230
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,740
Unbelievable.

231
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:06,950
Xiang Man Kui?

232
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,650
Xiang Man Kui is back.

233
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,040
Who's that?

234
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,920
Who's that?

235
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,310
Where are you? I'm outside the hall.

236
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:31,010
Tell me where my father is.

237
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:34,350
Don't worry, I'm just near you.

238
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,370
Go to your left.

239
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:38,060
Do you see us?

240
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,410
Where are you?

241
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:44,930
I'll be right there.

242
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,310
Wait for us.
