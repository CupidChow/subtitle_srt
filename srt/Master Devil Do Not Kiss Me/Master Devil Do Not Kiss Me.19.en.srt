1
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:12,960
Jia Jia.

2
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,930
I still don't understand
the law of diminishing marginal.

3
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:18,180
Please explain to me.

4
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,070
I'll give you a simple example
to make you understand.

5
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:22,750
Do they have to be so serious?

6
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:24,300
Even study in the toilet.

7
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,780
Aren't they afraid of constipation?

8
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:28,690
Now I understand it.

9
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:31,260
But I'm still worried.

10
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:35,120
After all, Ma Jian Guo and
An Chu Xia made a deal.

11
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,290
I don't want to get
Chu Xia into a trouble.

12
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,240
It's decided by our effort.
I'm sure we can make it.

13
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:42,850
If we fail,

14
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:45,470
Ma Jian Guo will give
An Chu Xia a hard time.

15
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:46,780
That's right.

16
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,180
An Chu Xia offended Ma Jian Guo before.

17
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:51,830
-I'm sure he'll revenge.
-That's right. What now?

18
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:53,370
No turning back.

19
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,280
Cherish your time and try your best.

20
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,440
We're going to do it well and
get a full score like An Chu Xia.

21
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:02,920
Gosh!

22
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:05,610
What sudden news!

23
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,640
Xin Wei, I have big news!

24
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,650
Why are you rushing?

25
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,530
I'll tell you what.

26
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:17,210
An Chu Xia...

27
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:18,620
Class B...

28
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:22,780
Take your time, don't rush.
What are they going to do?

29
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:25,820
An Chu Xia got a full score in her exam.

30
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:29,030
Now the whole B class
is studying hard like crazy.

31
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:31,350
It's terrible.

32
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:35,550
An Chu Xia got a full score in her exam?

33
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:37,050
She must have cheated.

34
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:41,330
That's why she bet with Ma Jian Guo.

35
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:43,150
If that bitch loses,

36
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:44,570
she has to listen to Mr. Ma.

37
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,650
If she wins,...

38
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,430
If she wins,

39
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:50,880
Class A's position will be shaken.

40
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:54,270
Class A always holds
the first place in China.

41
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:57,320
If she makes it,

42
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,780
the whole school will look up to her,

43
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,180
including Qi Lu.

44
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,210
Little Chu Xia.

45
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,770
Come here. Help me
translate the English sentence.

46
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:23,300
Didn't you come back from America?
I don't think you need my help.

47
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:26,520
Why must people who came
back from America know English?

48
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:30,910
It must have been hard for you
to live all those years in America then.

49
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:33,690
I have translators in America.

50
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,460
With your background,

51
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,650
I think Ma Jian Guo won't complain

52
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:41,410
if you let the translator
sit the exam for you.

53
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:44,190
But don't you think
you're living like a waste

54
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,290
when you rely on others in everything?

55
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,800
I only feel like living like a waste

56
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:52,280
when I spend my valuable time
on meaningless issues

57
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:54,400
when I can use my resources to do that.

58
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:59,310
Gosh! He's so manly.

59
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,580
Dear Sir, why don't I translate for you?

60
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,700
No, thanks. I'll do it myself.

61
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:13,430
After all, wasting precious time

62
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:17,470
to keep in touch with common people
will make life more interesting.

63
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,300
Which question?

64
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:29,370
This one.

65
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:54,190
If you can't get the first place,

66
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,820
make an apology to Ma Jian Guo.

67
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:58,690
I'll plead for you.

68
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:02,940
Don't worry, I'll never do that.

69
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,240
What did you say?

70
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,700
I'm helping you.

71
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:07,460
Do I need to thank you?

72
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,570
Chu Xia.

73
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:11,030
Qi Lu really wants to help you.

74
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:13,240
Even you are trying to hit us, huh?

75
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:17,260
If you are really so free, cultivate
your own hobbies and interests.

76
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:22,050
Why do you always stop us
when we try our best to do something?

77
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:25,840
I only want to lead Class B to get the
first place in China, is that so hard?

78
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,270
Why must the devils like you guys
come one after another?

79
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,250
You're right.

80
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:34,270
To get the first place in China,

81
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:37,520
Class A is the biggest
mountain in front of you.

82
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,610
Mountain?

83
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:42,330
I think you are just a small potato.

84
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:45,450
Class A gets the first
place in China every year.

85
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:47,560
No exception so far.

86
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,990
Then you have to work hard this year.

87
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:54,270
Because your honor
is going to change hands soon.

88
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:56,910
The fate always changes.
Do you understand?

89
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:00,250
Well said.

90
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:03,560
You dare to say it boldly.

91
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:07,450
Look at your members.
It's like a sow climbing up the tree.

92
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,370
I've only seen it from a picture.

93
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:11,500
Wan Zi.

94
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,300
You're so knowledgeable.

95
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,880
I can't believe that
you even got that rare picture.

96
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,730
You are really something, aren't you?

97
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,350
An Chu Xia.

98
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:25,070
You refuse to surrender
until you see the reality, huh?

99
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:27,550
If that's the case, let's compete.

100
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,440
Let's do this paper.

101
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:39,000
I can't answer any of it.

102
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,600
These are only our usual
exercise in the Math class.

103
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,770
It's only an intermediate level.

104
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:46,930
Chu Xia, you'd better...

105
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,120
Come on.

106
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,110
Hey.

107
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:52,220
Go and get the teacher.

108
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:52,576
[Master Devil Do Not Kiss Me S1]

109
00:06:52,922 --> 00:06:53,922
[Episode 19]

110
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:56,740
An Chu Xia challenges Young Master Han
in a Math Competition.

111
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,160
Ma Jian Guo works as a judge.

112
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,340
Both strength and background
are very different.

113
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,290
Han Qi Lu and An Chu Xia
love and kill each other.

114
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,760
Mo Xin Wei enjoyed the good show.

115
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,300
Mr. Ma watched it with folded arms.

116
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,170
An Chu Xia and Han Qi Lu
are going to break up.

117
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:11,800
Mo Xin Wei is working with
Mr. Ma to kick An Chu Xia out.

118
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,020
-To kick out An Chu Xia?
-Yes.

119
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,620
An Chu Xia lost her crown

120
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:15,950
because she wasn't pregnant.

121
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:18,170
Will Mo Xin Wei climb up again?

122
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:15,230
Both of them scored full marks
in this competition.

123
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:20,460
I now announce

124
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,980
the winner is Han Qi Lu.

125
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,290
What's going on?

126
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:29,690
-Why?
-Why?

127
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:32,650
That should be a draw since
they both scored full marks.

128
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:34,490
Although Qi Lu is handsome,

129
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:36,460
you can't play favourite.

130
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:39,710
-Yeah.
-That's right, why?

131
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:52,750
I lost.

132
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,310
Let's take a look.

133
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,750
The same question and
the same time given.

134
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,300
But Han Qi Lu calculated it
with two methods.

135
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,790
Gosh!

136
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,510
I told you that

137
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:27,010
Qi Lu was struck by lightning
when he was small.

138
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,950
After he woke up,
he became extraordinary.

139
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:31,830
His IQ hits 170.

140
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,150
Losing to him is not a shame.

141
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:36,790
Struck by lightning?

142
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,470
He must have done too many bad things.

143
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:42,450
I did feel a little sad,

144
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:44,860
but the bigger part I felt was conflict.

145
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:48,070
I don't even know him even
I've lived with him for so long.

146
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:52,690
I thought he was
just a useless rich child.

147
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:55,010
I've been asking
people to not look down on me,

148
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:57,770
but I've always been biased against people.

149
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:02,030
When did you start to be so emotional?

150
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:04,480
When I lost to Han Qi Lu just now.

151
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:08,510
You said you didn't care about it.

152
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:11,340
I pretended.
How could I not care about it?

153
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,740
Don't be upset.

154
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,810
No one knows who will be the winner.

155
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:20,590
But there is a big
strength gap between us.

156
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,590
Can I turn the tide
with my strength alone?

157
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:28,140
Well...

158
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,950
Plus me.

159
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,170
I'll help you.

160
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,030
You mean...

161
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:29,210
[Baby.]

162
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:31,570

00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:36,270

[Have some drink.]

166
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:53,290
[And then...]

167
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:00,910
[Fart.]

168
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:05,180
Chu Xia...

169
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:08,080
Ouch!

170
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,930
Sorry, I didn't mean it.

171
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:13,630
It's okay, I know.

172
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:19,310
I should think how to accept the
punishment instead of useless things.

173
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:23,790
Why don't you think about
how to live with honor?

174
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:27,690
Didn't we create many miracles before?

175
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:29,630
I believe we can do it again.

176
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:33,240
We weren't scared because
we didn't know anything.

177
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,890
But now...

178
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:38,620
No matter how hard it is, we should
get stronger with every setback.

179
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:41,750
Do you think my strength alone

180
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:46,530
can make an impossible winning?

181
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:48,530
Silly.

182
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:50,160
You are not alone.

183
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:53,770
Class B and I are always there for you.

184
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,000
That's right.

185
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,590
Although Han Qi Lu looks great,

186
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,980
but the rest of Class B...

187
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:05,590
They are great too.

188
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:09,930
Chu Xia.

189
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:15,200
Let's give extra tutoring
to Class B together.

190
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:16,780
Thank you, my dear.

191
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,500
-Chu Xia, we believe in you!
-We believe in you!

192
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,580
Why are you here?

193
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:31,150
It doesn't matter.

194
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:34,230
Let's work harder to beat Class A
in the coming 10 something days.

195
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:34,930
Alright?

196
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:36,570
-Sure!
-Come on!

197
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:39,180
Let's go for it!

198
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:23,180
Is this really Class B?

199
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:24,670
In just two days.

200
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:27,800
I can't believe that An Chu Xia
gets them thoroughly changed.

201
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:40,900
Chu Xia.

202
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:43,120
Look at the last question.

203
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,720
Show me how to do it.

204
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:51,760
Young Master Ling.

205
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,200
-Show me how to do this.
-Okay.

206
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,560
Pick up the pace.

207
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:58,370
Which one?

208
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:59,660
Let me see.

209
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:09,210
Meng Xiao Nan, wake up!

210
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:12,030
You like Jiang Chen Chuan.

211
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,970
Bear in mind.

212
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:16,110
Let's divide it into three steps.

213
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:17,860
The first step is...

214
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:20,510
He has a nice profile.

215
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:23,760
As charming as Jiang Chen Chuan.

216
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:29,050
What should I do?

217
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:32,960
Do you understand?

218
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:40,730
Can you repeat it?

219
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:41,720
Okay.

220
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:47,730
Let me explain to you.

221
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:49,100
You teach Jiang Chen Chuan.

222
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:49,680
Okay.

223
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,730
-Please explain all.
-All?

224
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:05,320
-Let's start with the first question.
-What should I do?

225
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:08,070
He looks so handsome from the back.

226
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:10,660
-This is wrong.
-Answer the question.

227
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,720
Look. Should be like this.

228
00:16:14,983 --> 00:16:16,383
-Like this?
-Yes.

229
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:23,759
This is the way.

230
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,380
How's the book?

231
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,220
You're annoying.

232
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:56,790
Didn't you feel ashamed to flirt here?

233
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,630
How can you walk without a sound?

234
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:00,670
You creep me out.

235
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,430
Because you're guilty.

236
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:04,990
Guilty? Did I steal any cookies
from your house?

237
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,680
You flirted in the bookstore.

238
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:09,960
That's how you teach them, huh?

239
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:12,460
I can teach them as I like.

240
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,090
Like this.

241
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:15,440
Or even like this.

242
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:16,950
Not your concern.

243
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:17,670
That's right.

244
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,800
We learn more efficiently in this way.

245
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,710
-Not your concern.
-Get lost, rascal.

246
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:26,740
Jiang Chen Chuan, I'm warning you!

247
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:29,250
-Chu Xia is my...
-Maid.

248
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:31,800
I know, how much you want?

249
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,740
I'll redeem her.

250
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,370
No way. Even if she's rotten, she won't be yours.

251
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:36,410
Stop!

252
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:37,930
What do you two mean?

253
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:40,770
What's so great about money?
I'm priceless.

254
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:42,570
Okay, I'm going to study.

255
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:43,950
-Jiang Chen Chuan, pay for it.
-Yes.

256
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:45,850
Han Qi Lu...

257
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:48,680
Do whatever you want.

258
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:57,940
Hello.

259
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:00,280
Haven't found out yet?

260
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,910
He's not simple since he
could easily get in the college.

261
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,280
Check it out for me.

262
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:07,650
That's it.

263
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:17,010
Jiang Chen Chuan.

264
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:19,250
I don't care who you are.

265
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:22,090
You will have a hard time from now on.

266
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:29,540
Which point?

267
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,650
Question 18 on page 27.

268
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:35,610
This one.

269
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:38,980
Turn to page 25.

270
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:39,640
Yes.

271
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:40,920
That's it.

272
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,470
So you got it now?

273
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:48,070
Qi Lu, you're eavesdropping
at Chu Xia door.

274
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:24,350
Who's that again?

275
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:25,770
Jian Ren (Bastard).

276
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:27,050
How can you scold me?

277
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:32,270
Wang Jian Ren, what's up?

278
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:35,090
-I see.
-The answer is B.

279
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:39,010
That's wrong.
