1
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:14,810
That's so strange.

2
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,040
How can they be exactly the same?

3
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,410
Excuse me, contestant no. 4,

4
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,616
is this your own design?

5
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:24,540
Yes.

6
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,736
So you're saying

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,426
that you created it independently,

8
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:30,820
no one helped you or guided you?

9
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:32,280
What do you mean?

10
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,100
Answer my question first.

11
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:35,570
Yes.

12
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:37,070
In that case,

13
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:39,186
please explain,

14
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:42,116
why is your design exactly the same

15
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,390
as the new sketches Xiang Man Kui released
half an hour ago?

16
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,206
What's going on?

17
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:49,136
You say this is your own design.

18
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:50,900
Can you prove it?

19
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:51,516
I...

20
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,556
I have the sketches,

21
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,460
they are at home, I can show them to you.

22
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:56,096
Even so,

23
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:59,140
it can't prove that the
creative idea is yours.

24
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,060
But I drew them.

25
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:03,876
Oh right,

26
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:04,896
Xiang Man Kui...

27
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:06,290
Xiang Man Kui can prove it.

28
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,336
Miss Xiang is sick today.

29
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:09,480
She can't come.

30
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,710
What?

31
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,196
I can call her.

32
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,900
We can ask her on the phone.

33
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,676
Contestant, please calm down.

34
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,176
The judges will take a moment
to discuss it.

35
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:19,620
We'll give you and everyone here
an answer.

36
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,234
Let's leave it at that for now.

37
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:46,410
Let's do that.

38
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:48,260
Let's go.

39
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,280
Let's talk somewhere else.

40
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:15,610
Let's go.

41
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:27,900
Stop knocking!

42
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,406
How is she in there?

43
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:35,756
Boss, she's locked inside.

44
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,680
It's fine.

45
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,640
Ok.

46
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,160
Behave!

47
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,930
Do as we say!

48
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,120
We'll let you out soon!

49
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,550
Or else,

50
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,470
I'm gonna make you regret it!

51
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:29,416
=Master Devil Do Not Kiss Me S2=

52
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,166
=Episode 22=

53
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,470
Did you get Xiang Man Kui on the phone?

54
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,440
No one's picking up.

55
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:40,556
That Xiang Man Kui,

56
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,850
she's playing dirty.

57
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:43,876
She's a famous designer,

58
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,436
Chu Xia is just a nobody,

59
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,260
no one will believe Chu Xia!

60
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,420
Don't jump to conclusions.

61
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:52,270
Knowing Little Kui,

62
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:55,840
she wouldn't desecrate a design
she likes like this.

63
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,866
How can you still

64
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:59,430
be on her side?

65
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,686
I also don't think that Xiang Man
Kui would do something like this.

66
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:03,860
Auntie!

67
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,686
Yes, yes.

68
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:06,026
Maybe it's all just a misunderstanding.

69
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,230
Chu Xia, what do you think?

70
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:09,000
I believe her.

71
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,146
Chu Xia.

72
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:13,146
You have to come to your senses.

73
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,690
Did you forget how she hurt you before?

74
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,800
This isn't the same.

75
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:20,766
If she wanted to set me up in this way,

76
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:22,716
she could have done
it since the beginning.

77
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,876
She didn't need to wait till now.

78
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,800
You...!

79
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,550
You make me so angry!

80
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,056
Calm down, guys.

81
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,346
Our priority now

82
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,610
is to find Xiang Man Kui.

83
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,186
Qi Lu.

84
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,030
Let's go look for her at her place.

85
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,496
Ok.

86
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:36,670
I'm coming with you!

87
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:44,690
Don't give up.

88
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,840
Wait!

89
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,150
I'm also coming.

90
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:05,896
Hello?

91
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:06,796
Mr. Jiang.

92
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,396
Yes.

93
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,506
I found out what happened.

94
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:09,600
What's the situation?

95
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:10,456
Oh,

96
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:13,780
the website's staff said that Miss Xin Wei
told someone to upload those sketches.

97
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:16,660
And she said they had to be released
this morning.

98
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:19,830
Mr. Jiang?

99
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:21,046
Hello?

100
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:21,946
Mr. Jiang?

101
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:22,870
Oh.

102
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:24,390
I understand.

103
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,480
Listen,

104
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:28,186
block all news immediately.

105
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:30,320
Don't let this information leak out.

106
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:31,530
Yes, sir.

107
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:43,146
Here,

108
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:45,836
Feng Shao, you and Jiang Chen Chuan
go to the reception office.

109
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,380
Ask the gate keeper for clues.

110
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,776
Han Yu and I will go to
Xiang Man Kui's place.

111
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:50,296
Ok.

112
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:51,036
-Got it.
-Let's do that.

113
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:51,926
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

114
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:53,020
Wait!

115
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,630
What is it?

116
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:06,280
I... I think I know
where Xiang Man Kui is.

117
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:08,910
Really?

118
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:11,330
Don't be afraid.

119
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,920
You said

120
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,480
you know where Xian Man Kui is?

121
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:16,336
No...

122
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,276
I only know

123
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,730
so much...

124
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,430
I-I'm leaving.

125
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:29,510
Does Mo Xin Wei have anything
to do with this?

126
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,146
I... I...

127
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:32,070
Don't be afraid.

128
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,730
Tell us what you know.

129
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,240
We will protect you.

130
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,230
Xin Wei did it.

131
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:43,950
I...

132
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,270
That day, by accident...

133
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:50,620
I saw Xin Wei together with a guy.

134
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:52,830
Xin Wei?

135
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:55,706
I didn't expect a closed
off competition round.

136
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:59,176
But it doesn't matter how, I will make her
fail and unable to ever recover.

137
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:01,120
So you have to make sure

138
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,006
that Xiang Man Kui

139
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:03,736
won't appear at the final round
in three days.

140
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:04,726
I was really scared.

141
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:06,056
I thought about it,

142
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,156
and then decided

143
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,580
to warn Xiang Man Kui this morning.

144
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:14,066
And then...

145
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:15,680
I followed them the whole time.

146
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:19,270
But they only let off Xiang Man Kui after
they came to the school.

147
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:21,610
I was too scared.

148
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,556
So

149
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,670
I don't know where they
are hiding her, either.

150
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,580
You did really well.

151
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:27,766
You can go.

152
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:29,660
We will take care of everything else.

153
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,480
Ok.

154
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:38,440
Think about it,

155
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,270
if you were the kidnapper,

156
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:41,920
where would you put her?

157
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:43,826
Firstly,

158
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:45,036
it won't be the classroom.

159
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:45,876
Too dangerous.

160
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,476
Secondly,

161
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,910
it won't be the sports room.

162
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:49,840
She could be found there by anyone.

163
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,616
If they are looking for a hidden,

164
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,660
unfrequented and closed space...

165
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,060
Unless...

166
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,486
To the west of the school...

167
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:00,590
The old warehouse!

168
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,376
Shit, that's basic deduction!

169
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,220
No shit, Sherlock! Let's save her!

170
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:11,150
Xin Wei.

171
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,040
Dad?

172
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,810
Did you do it?

173
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:22,566
What are you talking about?

174
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:23,490
I don't understand.

175
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:26,510
I've had it investigated.

176
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:30,280
You told someone to upload the sketches.

177
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:32,910
You're setting Chu Xia up.

178
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,636
Oh,

179
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,646
and there I thought I could hide it
for a bit longer.

180
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:40,560
I'm surprised you found out this quickly.

181
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,010
Why did you do this?

182
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,340
I've said it already,

183
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,446
I want to destroy her.

184
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:48,120
But you shouldn't have done it like this!

185
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,580
You are ruining her
future, don't you get it?

186
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:53,496
Didn't you teach me?

187
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,840
I'm the heir of Jiang's Group.

188
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,776
Whatever obstacle stands in my way, I only

189
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:58,696
have to kick them away.

190
00:09:58,780 --> 00:09:59,620
But...

191
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,590
But Chu Xia is different.

192
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,530
She is your big sister.

193
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:08,250
Stop saying her name in front of me.

194
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,736
She isn't my sister,
she's a bastard child!

195
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:11,720
Mo Xin Wei!

196
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,740
What about Xiang Man Kui?

197
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,210
Where is she?

198
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,170
Did her disappearance
have something to do with...

199
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,600
to do with you, too?

200
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,570
I don't know.

201
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:37,880
Child.

202
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,170
Listen to me.

203
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:43,130
What you're doing

204
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:45,600
is committing a crime.

205
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,460
Once this gets out of hand,

206
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,240
it will all be too late.

207
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,180
Dad.

208
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,480
I've been focused on the competition
the entire time.

209
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:57,330
How would I know

210
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,916
where.

211
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,070
Xiang Man Kui is?

212
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,676
Perhaps

213
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,560
she overslept by accident,

214
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:07,800
or perhaps she's in some corner
of the school.

215
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,380
Perhaps she doesn't want to be
here at all.

216
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,400
So it was all your doing.

217
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:18,990
Dad.

218
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,600
If you want to report me, you
can do it anytime.

219
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:25,250
I'm your daughter.

220
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,000
It's up to you

221
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:28,230
what you do.

222
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:37,846
It's here.

223
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,776
They are a lot of people.
It'll be difficult to handle.

224
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:40,666
What do we do?

225
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:41,590
Do we rush in?

226
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:42,890
Don't do anything rashly.

227
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,350
They are too many.

228
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,740
-Call security.
-Wait!

229
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:47,020
How can it be him?

230
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,950
Gao Gan?

231
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:50,296
Hey,

232
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,730
did he and Mo Xin Wei join hands
to kidnap Xiang Man Kui?

233
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:53,556
Not sure.

234
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,836
When I remembered him,

235
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,800
he was already gone.

236
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:56,890
Keep cool,

237
00:11:57,530 --> 00:11:58,436
stick to the plan,

238
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,366
call security.

239
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:00,290
Ok.

240
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,450
Go look.

241
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:06,740
Hurry!

242
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,296
Hurry!

243
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,196
What do we do now?

244
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,120
Shit.

245
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:11,330
What else can we do?

246
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:12,620
Fight them!

247
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:22,130
Come on!

248
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,180
Han Qi Lu!

249
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:25,940
Long time no see.

250
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:29,110
Gao Gan.

251
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,920
Never thought you'd do something
this shady.

252
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:36,310
You and Mo Xin Wei...

253
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,210
Hand her over!

254
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:39,730
Qi Lu!

255
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:42,530
I'm afraid you can't even
fend for yourselves now.

256
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:44,130
Hand her over?

257
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:49,290
Under these circumstances,

258
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,120
I can only...

259
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:53,170
beat you one more time!

260
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:55,016
What are you waiting for?

261
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,050
Fight them!

262
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,560
Hi, boss?

263
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:01,996
Ok, alright.

264
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:02,686
Yes, yes, yes.

265
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:03,620
Yes, sir.

266
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:07,270
Hey!

267
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:08,550
Where are you going?

268
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:09,536
Come back!

269
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:10,750
Where are you going?

270
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:16,880
Qi Lu!

271
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,816
I'm here!

272
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:19,676
Qi Lu!

273
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,386
Let's settle all our grudges today.

274
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:24,430
-Calm down, think twice!
-Say, how do you wanna die?

275
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,366
What do you want?

276
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:27,066
What...?

277
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:27,990
Go away!

278
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:29,290
Go to hell!

279
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:42,326
Open the door, Qi Lu!

280
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:43,166
Qi Lu! It's me!

281
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,484
You guys call security, I'll get her.

282
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:45,550
Qi Lu!

283
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:47,980
Open the door!

284
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:52,380
Qi Lu!

285
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:55,010
You're fine now.

286
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,010
But you have to come with me now.

287
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:00,660
What happened?

288
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,850
Don't bother about me! Just go!

289
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,040
-Jiang Chen Chuan, you've got this.
-Han Qi Lu!

290
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:11,080
Dear teachers, dear students,

291
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,396
I'm sorry for the long wait.

292
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,406
Regarding a quite serious incident
during our competition

293
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:19,446
our judges have now come to a conclusion.

294
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:22,756
Let us welcome the judges'
representative on stage.

295
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,680
Welcome.

296
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,416
After consultation, the jury has come to

297
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,130
an unanimous decision that An Chu Xia's
work is suspected of plagiarism,

298
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,456
she is hereby disqualified,

299
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,920
her previous results are nullified.

300
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,956
Please remain quiet.

301
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,470
This is our final decision.

302
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,390
Please understand and support
our decision.

303
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,196
Quiet!

304
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,636
Since the jury has already
announced their decision,

305
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,490
our competition will
come to an end for now.

306
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:50,446
That would be all.

307
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:51,370
Wait!

308
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:05,720
I want to tell everyone

309
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,510
that these sketches were indeed
An Chu Xia's.

310
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:09,990
She did not plagiarize the content.

311
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:13,076
So...

312
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,840
So you're saying...

313
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,920
you plagiarized An Chu Xia's sketches?

314
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:19,990
That's not true!

315
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:20,866
Miss Xiang.

316
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:23,550
Please explain to everyone what happened.

317
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:27,306
I think there were some issues
with the website.

318
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:29,200
The sketches do belong to Chu Xia.

319
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,860
Don't doubt her talent solely because

320
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,216
she's a newcomer, or because

321
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,990
she hasn't made a name for herself yet.

322
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,900
Today's issue

323
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:40,210
was caused by me.

324
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,770
I am deeply sorry.

325
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,480
I'm sorry, Chu Xia.

326
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,350
Don't let her deceive you.

327
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:54,796
Xiang Man Kui.

328
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,726
The sketches are yours.

329
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:58,646
I saw it myself.

330
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:01,996
Why help Chu Xia lie about this?

331
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,556
Did she bribe you?

332
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,760
You're out of line!

333
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:13,070
Don't destroy your future.

334
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,736
You've done enough for me.

335
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:15,406
Thank you.

336
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:16,790
Let me handle the rest.

337
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,076
What?

338
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,136
Did I hit the mark?

339
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,450
Have a guilty conscience?

340
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,170
I found Xiang Man Kui in the warehouse
on the west side.

341
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:26,970
Which means

342
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:29,960
that someone went out of their way

343
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:32,950
to stop her from coming here.

344
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,670
It was you, wasn't it?

345
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:37,320
That warehouse has fallen into disrepair
for years.

346
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:40,530
She may have locked herself inside.

347
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:43,040
Or maybe,

348
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:46,600
she didn't want to come here to
begin with.

349
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:49,956
How do you explain

350
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,610
the guys who kept watch?

351
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,706
How would I know?

352
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:55,330
You need to ask her that.

353
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:57,730
Look, everyone.

354
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:59,936
How can a scene kid like that

355
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,290
create such a design?

356
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:05,330
Mo Xin Wei!

357
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,980
If you say one more thing, I'm
gonna hit you!

358
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:10,296
That's how a bastard child is.

359
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,696
Always hitting and fighting people.

360
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:12,796
Have you got no manners?

361
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,220
-Enough!
-Enough!

362
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:21,210
Xin Wei.

363
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,670
Please stop this.

364
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,540
This is a competition!

365
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,146
You can't take sides with her

366
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:30,176
just because she's related to you!

367
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,430
Mr. Jiang!

368
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,190
How did you become like this?

369
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,330
I can prove...

370
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:38,770
I can prove

371
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:41,320
that the sketches are Chu Xia's.

372
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,230
Because I've injured my hand.

373
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,510
I may not be able to ever draw again.

374
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:54,220
Today's issue happened

375
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:56,900
because someone wants to frame someone.

376
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,760
Even though I don't have any evidence,

377
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,310
but think about it,

378
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:05,240
who would be the one to benefit
most from this?

379
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,046
Don't...

380
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,890
Don't let them trick you!

381
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:11,606
An Chu Xia,

382
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:12,686
she's nothing but a liar!

383
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:15,090
She's just like her mother!
She's nothing but a lair!

384
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,810
Just stop this, please. Let's go home!

385
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,206
Why would I go home?

386
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:19,760
I'm not done yet!

387
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,340
She's a liar! A bastard child! A liar!

388
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:23,380
You...!

389
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:24,886
She's a liar?

390
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:25,916
What am I then?

391
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,740
What do you take me for?

392
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:32,680
You are a liar, too!

393
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:44,530
Xin Wei!

394
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:49,206
Now that it's been proved
to be a misunderstanding,

395
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:50,126
let me announce.

396
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:53,406
In today's Pinkston Design Competition,

397
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:54,806
the winner is...

398
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:56,200
An Chu Xia!

399
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,200
Chu Xia!

400
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,590
Chu Xia.

401
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,560
That's amazing.

402
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,120
Chu Xia!

403
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:26,320
Alright, come on.

404
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:29,056
Let's congratulate
Little Chu Xia on her victory.

405
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,930
Cheers!

406
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,000
Chu Xia.

407
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:39,380
Unfortunately I couldn't watch
your competition.

408
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:41,150
But I'm very proud of you.

409
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:42,036
Let me

410
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:42,960
toast to you.

411
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,800
Go easy on the wine.

412
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:48,600
You only just left the hospital,
go easy.

413
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:50,046
Ok.

414
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:50,970
Ok.

415
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:52,430
Madam.

416
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:54,500
You have a guest.

417
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:58,460
Uncle.

418
00:19:58,820 --> 00:19:59,660
Aunt.
