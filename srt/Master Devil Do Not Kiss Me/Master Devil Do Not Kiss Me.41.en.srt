1
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,100
Hey, Little Kui.

2
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:19,560
Qi Lu.

3
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:22,690
What happened last night?

4
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:26,910
Chu Xia didn't tell you?

5
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:29,030
Tell me what?

6
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,280
Oh,

7
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,630
nothing.

8
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,030
Just, you got drunk last night,

9
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,046
and you cried about wanting to go to my place.

10
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:37,310
You didn't want to go home.

11
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,830
Then, when I have just taken you
to my place

12
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:44,270
Chu Xia and Jiang Chen Chuan barged in
all angry and took you away.

13
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,800
I think they misunderstood the situation.

14
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:49,646
Don't worry,

15
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:51,260
I'll talk to Chu Xia.

16
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:00,980
Hello?

17
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:05,896
Ok.

18
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:06,820
Got it.

19
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:11,916
What's the matter?

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,850
Is everything ok?

21
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:16,940
The company's design concept got rejected.

22
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,450
If this proposal doesn't work,

23
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:23,150
Han's Group will be done for.

24
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:24,150
What?

25
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:25,470
It's that serious?

26
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:28,230
Can I help you with anything?

27
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:33,870
Oh right!

28
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,670
You are a genius designer!

29
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:38,240
How could I forget that?

30
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:40,880
Mhm.

31
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:44,216
Delicious.

32
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,140
It's really good.

33
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,870
Can you eat all of that?

34
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:48,166
Yeah.

35
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,806
I finally got someone to buy me lunch,

36
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,050
I gotta take full advantage of it.

37
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:52,336
Hey.

38
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,570
Where's Jiang Chen Chuan?

39
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,106
I don't care.

40
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:58,170
As long as the lunch card is here.

41
00:01:58,860 --> 00:01:59,806
Meng Xiao Nan.

42
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:01,190
You are too pragmatic.

43
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,330
I just remembered an issue.

44
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,680
What issue?

45
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,720
If nothing unexpected happens,

46
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:13,060
Xiang Man Kui will cook for Qi Lu at his place.

47
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:18,240
Then you will once again become
the third wheel.

48
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,576
-I can't let them get their way.
-Eat more.

49
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,110
Eat more, eat more.

50
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:31,806
Chu Xia.

51
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,256
You have such great memory.

52
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:36,040
You still remember that Qi Lu and I love
the noodles of this place.

53
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,570
You badgered us into coming here to eat,

54
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:41,330
why aren't you eating?

55
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:44,510
Are you still thinking about yesterday?

56
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,256
I already told Qi Lu,

57
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,846
it was just a misunderstanding.

58
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:52,240
Qi Lu got drunk and wanted to go to my place.

59
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,040
Yes.

60
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:55,980
Didn't we have a fight yesterday?

61
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,540
That's why I didn't want to go home.

62
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,370
Oh.

63
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,496
So that's what happened.

64
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,470
Got it.

65
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,440
What do you get?

66
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,300
I get what I should get.

67
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,386
Hey, Qi Lu.

68
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:14,136
Give me the design concept that got rejected.

69
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,356
I'll check it and see what changes
I can make.

70
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,260
Great thinking.

71
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,726
What design are you talking about?

72
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:22,770
What is it for?

73
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:27,390
You wouldn't understand even if I explained.

74
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:30,290
Look for yourself.

75
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:05,656
=Master Devil Do Not Kiss Me S2=

76
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:06,580
=Episode 18=

77
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:10,896
What's the deadline

78
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,220
for that design concept?

79
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,510
I got about three days.

80
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,590
Don't worry,

81
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:22,500
Little Kui will help me find a solution.

82
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:24,486
Is Xiang Man Kui

83
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:27,316
the only one in your mind who can solve
this problem for you?

84
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,206
Yeah.

85
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:29,876
Little Kui is a genius when it comes to design.

86
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,220
-Before--
-Stop the car!

87
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:35,060
-What?
-Stop the car.

88
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:39,610
Hey.

89
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:40,810
What are you doing?

90
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:42,806
I want to walk alone for a bit.

91
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:43,830
Take a breather.

92
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:47,410
An Chu Xia, that's enough.

93
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,850
I've had to put up with you for
long enough.

94
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,460
Put up with me?

95
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:52,570
Yeah.

96
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:55,366
You often lose your temper from time to time,

97
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:56,806
you randomly get angry,

98
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,246
you go crazy periodically.

99
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,546
You'll drive even the most normal

100
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:02,410
people crazy, let alone someone like me
who's in a special situation.

101
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,736
Can't you be a bit more mature?

102
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:04,730
Mature?

103
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:06,816
Little Kui is mature.

104
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,206
Not only that,

105
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:10,306
she can also help you with design concepts.

106
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:11,430
I can't compare to that.

107
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:14,166
What kind of attitude is that?

108
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,630
Hey, what kind of attitude is that?

109
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:16,870
Come back!

110
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:23,690
I think, perhaps we can change this color?

111
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,226
I think green looks quite nice.

112
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,216
It's eco-friendly.

113
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,500
It is eco-friendly,

114
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:30,506
but as for the design,

115
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,306
haven't I seen this kind of bottle somewhere?

116
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,540
Isn't this plagiarism?

117
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:35,110
No way.

118
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,770
What is it?

119
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,070
Who sent it to you?

120
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:49,610
Mo Xin Wei.

121
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:53,060
Give up.

122
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,860
-Do not give up.
-What are you looking at?

123
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,380
-Give up.
-Crazy.

124
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,150
Do not give up.

125
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:01,686
What are you laughing at!

126
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:02,800
-Leave!
-Give up.

127
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:05,370
Do not give up.

128
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,490
Could you please not
put your head on my shoulder?

129
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:12,030
Do not give up.

130
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:13,320
Give up.

131
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:14,756
Do not give up.

132
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,686
If you ask me,

133
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:17,426
you should just give up.

134
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:19,586
It's not like you'll get Chu Xia anyway.

135
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:22,090
I'm not thinking about chasing Chu Xia.

136
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:23,790
What then?

137
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,030
I'm thinking about

138
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,700
whether I should give up
being Jiang's Group's heir.

139
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,270
Heir?

140
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,500
I've decided.

141
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:39,046
I will help Chu Xia make her dream come true.

142
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:41,586
Once she wins the competition and
goes to France, I'll give up on being heir

143
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:42,800
and keep her company in France.

144
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:45,846
During the day I'll sell my singing,
at night I'll sell...

145
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:46,770
Huh?

146
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:48,920
Sell my singing again.

147
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:53,120
Say, should I stop you?

148
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,766
You ruin my mood again.

149
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,040
Hey, Chu Xia!

150
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,320
Why are you here?

151
00:07:58,850 --> 00:07:59,770
What's she doing?

152
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,926
It's all because of Han Qi Lu.

153
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:05,316
He wants some kind of design concept for
a beverage bottle.

154
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,286
Says that if the design is good it will
help the Han family overcome their crisis.

155
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:12,130
Our Chu Xia has been staring at that design
on her phone since this morning.

156
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:14,356
Like she's obsessed with it.

157
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,280
Huh? Why?

158
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:20,980
Xiang Man Kui wants to help Han Qi Lu
with the design, too.

159
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,910
Chu Xia is having a duel with
Xiang Man Kui.

160
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,810
Who is dueling with her?

161
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:27,830
I'm only helping myself.

162
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:30,016
If the Han family goes bankrupt,

163
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,310
my mom would have
entrusted me to them for nothing.

164
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,206
However,

165
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:37,220
that Xiang Man Kui is a genius
who has won a big award.

166
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:38,210
Chu Xia,

167
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:39,790
you...

168
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:44,910
Got it!

169
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,200
I'm off.

170
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:51,410
What's up with him?

171
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,876
He's suffered a little shock lately.

172
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,820
Let him be.

173
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:04,770
-Hey, Han Yu.
-Hi!

174
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:08,430
What's wrong?

175
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,840
Any progress on that design?

176
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:12,240
Little Kui is helping me with that.

177
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:13,606
Xiang Man Kui?

178
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:14,530
Yeah.

179
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,260
Qi Lu.

180
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,180
Be honest with me.

181
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:28,250
Do you like Chu Xia or Xiang Man Kui?

182
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:58,640
Jiang's Group?

183
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,520
Han Qi Lu.

184
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:28,530
Is the one you really love...

185
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:29,690
me?

186
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:34,926
Hello?

187
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:35,930
Hey, Chu Xia.

188
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:38,486
I found the information on that design.

189
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:39,870
Design information?

190
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:40,910
Yeah!

191
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:42,796
Listen,

192
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,416
did you forget?

193
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,206
Our company does design, too.

194
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:47,286
I'm in our company's archives.

195
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:48,300
Really?

196
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:49,926
Where are you?

197
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:50,950
I'll bring them over.

198
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,606
Great!

199
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:53,576
Jiang Chen Chuan,

200
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:54,466
thanks.

201
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:55,976
Wait for me, I'll be just a second.

202
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:56,900
I'll be right there.

203
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:08,886
Come on.

204
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:09,980
-Hm?
-Drink.

205
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:11,120
Come on.

206
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:14,390
Come.

207
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,320
Listen to me.

208
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:27,680
Too many things have happened lately.

209
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:29,330
You...

210
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,200
So useless.

211
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,430
Why do you get drunk so easily?

212
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,230
Ok!

213
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,780
All done!

214
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:55,310
Yeah!

215
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,390
Han Qi Lu, you scared me!

216
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,680
You scared me.

217
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,450
Did you drink?

218
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:20,470
An Chu Xia.

219
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:22,300
I love you.

220
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,670
From now on, no matter how harsh
my words may be,

221
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:31,410
or how much of a jerk I'm being,

222
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:34,190
or how bad my attitude is,

223
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,460
please don't abandon me

224
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:40,460
and leave by yourself.

225
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:44,530
Are you admitting defeat to me?

226
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,570
From this moment on,

227
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,450
I'm yours.

228
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:31,700
An Chu Xia?

229
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:35,580
I'm dreaming.

230
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:51,360
Han Qi Lu, get up.

231
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,410
An Chu Xia.

232
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,590
Last night...?

233
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:12,950
Nothing happened.

234
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:20,390
Impossible.

235
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,520
Han Qi Lu.

236
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:31,700
Nothing happened last night.

237
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,200
Oh.

238
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:36,180
I know that girls are pretty embarrassed
about these kinds of things.

239
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:37,206
Don't worry,

240
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:38,540
I won't tell anyone.

241
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:40,560
Hey, what are you doing?

242
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,900
I just wanted to tell you

243
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:45,660
that nothing happened last night.

244
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,430
But we kissed last night,

245
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:49,500
didn't we?

246
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:51,590
If you know something more,

247
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,736
tell me about it.

248
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:53,740
Han Qi Lu!

249
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,380
What a bore.

250
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:00,690
Geez.

251
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:02,490
Han Qi Lu!

252
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:06,530
Let me see.

253
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:08,500
Hey, Chu Xia!

254
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,256
How did it go with the design?

255
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,630
Yeah, thank you.

256
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:13,180
I'll buy you dinner some day.

257
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:14,270
Cool.

258
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:16,350
Under 50 Yuan.

259
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:17,826
Doesn't matter.

260
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:18,750
Your treat,

261
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:20,126
but I'll pay.

262
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,810
That's how I like my friends.

263
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:29,816
I heard everything.

264
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,100
As for that meal, don't forget about me.

265
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,530
No problem.

266
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:37,716
Students,

267
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,950
I have some important news for you.

268
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:42,146
Especially the students who are

269
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:45,066
entering the designer competition rematch

270
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,120
must pay attention.

271
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:49,440
Each contestant will bring a male model,

272
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:51,816
they will walk the catwalk together
to showcase the clothes.

273
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:52,546
So,

274
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:53,566
it means that the

275
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:57,590
chemistry between the contestant and the
model is very important.

276
00:15:58,530 --> 00:15:59,906
There are only a few days left
till the rematch.

277
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:01,406
Please prepare yourself for it.

278
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:02,276
Alright?

279
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:02,696
Fighting!

280
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:03,516
Ok!

281
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,650
Fighting!

282
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,410
I'm sorry, Little Kui.

283
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,470
It's all my fault for wanting you to help
me with the design.

284
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:30,370
Now your hand is injured.

285
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:31,636
It's fine.

286
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,340
I'm the one who's sorry, Qi Lu.

287
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,936
I thought that engraving it on
the bottle

288
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,630
will seem more creative,

289
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,650
who knew...

290
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:42,370
I'm sorry, Qi Lu.

291
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,566
I may not

292
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:45,270
be able to help you this time.

293
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:48,380
It's fine.

294
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,030
Chu Xia helped me make a design,

295
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:54,860
I'll just have to use hers now.

296
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:55,980
What?

297
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,060
Chu Xia helped you with the design, too?

298
00:16:58,590 --> 00:16:59,566
Yes.

299
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:02,550
I don't know where she found the
resources.

300
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:03,510
I've looked at it,

301
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:04,860
the design is quite good.

302
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:08,450
Oh.

303
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:17,000
Thank you guys for coming in such
great numbers

304
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:20,030
to show your support.

305
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:24,070
I'm sure you know about the requirements
for the rematch.

306
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:28,080
The most important thing in choosing the
right model is a good figure.

307
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:35,000
A good figure can't be discerned
by simply looking,

308
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:37,360
the key to it is the touching.

309
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:39,846
She wants to touch me.

310
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:43,826
As for the touching part, let's welcome
our specialist in men,

311
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:46,790
Meng Xiao Nan. She'll inspect
you personally.

312
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,100
Stand straight!

313
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,300
Do not whisper among each other.

314
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,046
Below (next)

315
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:00,240
is the key to inspecting your figure.

316
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:02,050
Below?

317
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,056
What are you doing?

318
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,436
I'm not done yet.

319
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,740
These are the key parts
to inspecting your figure:

320
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:10,240
Chest muscles.

321
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:11,716
Get ready!

322
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,640
Raise your chests.

323
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,636
A big bone structure is all you got,

324
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,560
get lost!

325
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,016
Your excessive body fat

326
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,636
is off the charts!

327
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,690
Get lost!

328
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:45,036
Hm.

329
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,590
Not bad.

330
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,840
Unfortunately, your bra's padding
is much too soft,

331
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,086
I can tell right away it's fake.

332
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:52,526
Go return it to the shop.

333
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:53,740
Get lost, get lost!

334
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:02,186
Get lost!

335
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:02,746
Go!

336
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:04,006
Go away!

337
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:04,930
Go!

338
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,040
Stop!

339
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:07,700
Don't touch me!

340
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:10,700
Hm.

341
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:12,820
Go away.

342
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:14,890
Go ahead.

343
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,240
Hm.

344
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,130
Quite a strong chest.

345
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,130
Must be at least size C.

346
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:36,030
You got abs, too.

347
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,656
Hey, what are you doing, Meng Xiao Nan?

348
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,290
I'm checking if they are fake.

349
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,076
You are fake!

350
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,020
Chu Xia.

351
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:45,630
Look...

352
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:47,866
That's your only option left.

353
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:48,706
Perhaps,

354
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:49,760
try make do with that?

355
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,730
Who says there's no one else?
