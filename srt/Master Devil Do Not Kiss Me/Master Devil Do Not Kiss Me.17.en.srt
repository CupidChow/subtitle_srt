"Shall I be a shadow of someone else
and let him live in it?"

2
00:01:02,343 --> 00:01:05,224
"Who does he like?
The shadow or the person?"

3
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,090
You've followed me for so long.
What do you want?

4
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:28,580
I like you.

5
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,810
-Go away.
-Let's go.

6
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,610
Are you sick?

7
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,100
I don't like you.

8
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:41,890
I only like...

9
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:43,460
I know, you like An Chu Xia.

10
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,150
But she doesn't like you.

11
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:53,280
I believe persistent will make victory.

12
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:56,140
All right, that's my motto
from today on.

13
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:59,090
Let's see who can hold on to the end.

14
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,780
What do you want?

15
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,490
-Go away.
-No.

16
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,080
I'll leave then.

17
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,960
Don't go! Make it clear first!

18
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,820
You don't go and you
don't let me go either.

19
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,900
-What do you want to do?
-I want to be with you.

20
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,300
It's impossible. Cut it out!

21
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,620
So much things have happened
during this period.

22
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,980
Everyone's struggling
with their feelings.

23
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,860
Everyone has a heartache.

24
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:14,560
Maybe

25
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:17,980
I've never understood you.

An Chu Xia, what's wrong with you?

32
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:43,960
You are absent-minded.

33
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,750
Stop zoning out.

34
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,980
-Sorry.
-Gosh! Do you really hate me?

35
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,500

36
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:53,360
So sorry.

37
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,810
Alright, go back and rest.

38
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,550
Press it yourself.

39
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,500
Go back and lie face downwards.

How could you hire
an unintelligent assistant?

41
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,490
Cut the crap!

42
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:20,000
Else, I'll give you a muscle atrophy!

43
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,520
What's wrong with you?

44
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,370
Who made you angry again?

45
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:38,210
No one's bullying me.

46
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,380
So? Are you in love?

47
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,900
Ms. Liu, stop guessing.

48
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,560
Don't call me Ms. Liu.

49
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:48,830
If there's a third person in the school
who knows my real name,

50
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:49,910
you'll be finished then!

51
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:53,220
Well...What's going on?

52
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:57,200
What's the feeling of
having a crush on someone?

53
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:02,020
Why do some people change their
original habits for someone they like?

54
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:07,350
Oh, my god! You've never
had a crush, have you?

55
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:08,800
I like my dad and mom.

56
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,760
Of course they don't count.

57
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:15,960
When you like someone,
he's your everything in your heart.

58
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:21,610
What if someone you like abandoned you?

59
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:24,680
Is that not everyone can
bear that kind of blow?

60
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,010
Nonsense! Of course!

61
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,260
When I was studying in Japan,

62
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,920
there was an introverted guy...

63
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,810
Is that the guy who jumped for you?

64
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,980
No, don't interrupt.

65
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:43,410
So many introverted guys in Japan, huh?

66
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,930
That's right.

67
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:47,800
Didn't you see the hero
in Japanese movie?

68
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:51,700
They are all blindfolded
and wearing a head cover.

69
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,550
Like the Ultraman.

70
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:55,510
Is it? In which movie?

71
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:56,920
In many movies.

72
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:00,700
You're still young and won't understand.

73
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:05,890
At last, the boy
followed me all the way.

74
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,070
I enjoyed that kind of feeling.

75
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:12,690
But he suddenly came up to me
and confessed his feeling to me.

76
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:15,190
And then you rejected him.
And then he jumped.

77
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:17,430
I'll stop talking
if you interrupt again.

78
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,480
Go on.

79
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:22,850
And then I rejected him.

80
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:24,970
And then he jumped.

81
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:28,290
It has no difference
with what I've said.

82
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:33,800
The ending should be you introduced
him to a beautiful Japanese girl.

83
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:36,950
And then they live happily together.

84
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,020
Is he really dead?

85
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,570
I lied to you.

86
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:47,180
The boy finally met a girl
who looked like me.

87
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:50,960
Even a little better than me.

88
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:52,730
And finally

89
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:57,040
they live happily together
like princes and princesses.

90
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,750
Ms. Liu.

91
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:01,800
Your story has a low credibility.

92
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,860
It's up to you.

93
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:08,690
But love can make people
crazy or become demons.

94
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:11,290
When you love someone,

95
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:13,810
maybe you'll be suffered.

96
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:17,500
Don't split your hairs
because of momentary depression.

97
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:18,970
Many nice guys

98
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:20,710
-in this world.
-Ms. Liu.

99
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,440
I'm not in love.

100
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,590
I know, I will cut the crap.

101
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,320
An Chu Xia!

102
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:29,530
An Chu Xia!

103
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:33,650
Come down! I'm looking for you.

104
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:35,650
I'll be right there.
I'll inform Ms. Liu.

105
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,290
Ms. Liu, I'm going to class.

106
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,920
Ms. Liu?

107
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,780
An Chu Xia, you...

108
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,860
Who else did you tell about my name?

109
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,410
Pissed off!

110
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:56,810
You know what. The annual Campus
Belle Competition is about to start.

111
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,860
Of course I know.

112
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:00,830
I've been preparing for it.

113
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,240
But,

114
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,840
you'd better don't take part in it.

115
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,730
You can't win.

116
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:10,940
You have to go.
Else, no one will be the last.

117
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,180
I...

118
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:34,850
I have the test results
of our class in my hand now.

119
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:37,810
I made a simple statistic.

120
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:42,050
I'll announce the results now.

121
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,160
An Chu Xia.

122
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,380
Don't you care how many points you get?

123
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:57,300
You've been daydreaming
half of a semester.

124
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:00,440
But still confident.

125
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,000
What's your strategy?

126
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:04,950
Share it with everyone.

127
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,920
An Chu Xia.

128
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:15,770
A full score in all the subjects.

129
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:20,750
-Chu Xia, you're awesome!
-Wow!

130
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,220
You're my goddess.

131
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:25,300
An Chu Xia, I love you so much!
You're awesome!

132
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:32,420
Congratulation to An Chu Xia.

133
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:36,370
Now I'm announcing an important thing.

134
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:44,080
The school will take severe penalty
on An Chu Xia's cheating.

135
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,940
-Cheating?
-Did she cheat?

136
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,880
I didn't cheat.

137
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,590
No cheating?

138
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,130
Stop fooling me!

139
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:57,360
I really didn't cheat. Do you have
any evidence that I cheated?

140
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:00,130
What evidence is needed?

141
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,120
You were transferred to our college
from an unpopular college.

142
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:08,360
How could you get a full
score in all the subjects?

143
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,470
If you can do it,

144
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,400
that means the other students
are learning in vain for years.

145
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,440
It's not the student's problem.
It's about the education.

146
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:19,860
What did you say?

147
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:22,130
I said I didn't cheat.

148
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,670
Don't quibble.

149
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:27,320
I tell you what. The school will decide
the punishment on you very soon.

150
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:33,140
If you still deny and reject it, you'll be
dropped out by the school board soon.

151
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:34,690
Mr. Ma.

152
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:36,120
I'd like to ask for a retake.

153
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,420
Retake?

154
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:41,550
Since the school has
no evidence of my cheating,

155
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,320
I'll take the test again.

156
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:50,130
Let everybody see how I'm going to cheat
and get a full score in the exam.

157
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,260
Are you sure?

158
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:56,510
Didn't you always want to drive me away?

159
00:11:56,630 --> 00:12:00,880
I'll give you a good reason
to kick me out of Stiland College.

160
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:03,970
An Chu Xia.

161
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:07,120
I'm starting to admire you.

162
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,680
I'll arrange it for you.

163
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:21,720
Who is actually An Chu Xia of Class B?

164
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,440
-She gets a full score in all subjects.
-Full score?

165
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,480
Yeah! It's a new record of the school.

166
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,960
Mr. Ma said she cheated
and let her retake the exam.

167
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,150
If she can't make it,
she will be dropped out.

168
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,800
Dropped out? It's too serious.

169
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,840
An Chu Xia gets a full score
because of cheating.

170
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,400
Mr. Ma recruits four famous
guards to supervise her.

171
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,630
He wanted to kick
her out of Stiland College.

172
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:41,800
An Chu Xia's in a trouble.

173
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:45,190
An Chu Xia couldn't protect her crown
as Mrs. Han and was claimed cheating.

174
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:45,850
Is it?

175
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:49,340
Ma Jian Guo provokes her and
wants to kick her out of the college.

176
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,870
Big news!

177
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,340
An Chu Xia and Young Master Han
were broken up.

178
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:57,800
Ma Jian Guo wants her to retake
the exam to kick her out of the college.

179
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:15,720
May God blessed Chu Xia.

180
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,000
Chu Xia must make it.

181
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,320
-Good luck!
-God blessed.

182
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,210
Do you think Chu Xia cheats?

183
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:22,260
Impossible.

184
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:26,060
Cheating might get high marks,
but it's hard to get a full score.

185
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,140
Sometimes, we even copy wrongly.

186
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:30,070
Do you think everyone did like you?

187
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,360
Chu Xia made the highest score.

188
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:35,890
Whose answer she could copy?

189
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:38,440
The teachers are not sensible.

190
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,180
-That's right.
-Especially Mr. Ma.

191
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:42,700
-He biased against Chu Xia.
-Agreed.

192
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:47,693
Chu Xia is multitasking, she could study

193
00:13:47,718 --> 00:13:51,200
twice times as much as we could.
It's a natural gift.

194
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,840
I think Chu Xia has no weakness.

195
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,260
She's perfect.

196
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,520
No wonder many people like her.

197
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,520
-Of course.
-Sure.

198
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:07,370
Excepts for singing and ball sports,

199
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:10,690
she's good at everything.

200
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:13,500
-That's right.
-I'm so nervous now.

201
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,510
-Do you think she can do it well?
-That's for sure.

202
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:18,020
Chu Xia, go for it!

203
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:53,530
Actually, I think

204
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:57,400
her conclusion is correct.

205
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,010
It fits with a certain solution.

206
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:02,080
I don't think so. Look at the solution.

207
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:04,850
-Where?
-It's different from what we taught.

208
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:06,070
No...

209
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:07,520
There are many kinds of solution.

210
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,490
She should do according
to what we taught.

211
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:11,170
No, although we have taught it,

212
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:13,540
she has her own idea...

213
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,420
But it's an exam anyway,
you must use the usual...

214
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:19,620
-We just have to...
-That's enough. Don't argue.

215
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,520
It is decided.

216
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:34,580
Alright.

217
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,350
I have the result here.

218
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,420
Unfortunately, An Chu Xia

219
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,280
answered a question wrongly.

220
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,800
So we decided

221
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,680
-to...
-Mr. Ma!

222
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:50,000
Since Chu Xia only answered a question
wrongly under your supervision,

223
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,980
that's proven her strength.

224
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:53,650
Chu Xia didn't cheat.

225
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:56,260
-Yeah!
-Chu Xia didn't cheat.

226
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:57,300
Shut up!

227
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:01,000
If anyone stands up for
An Chu Xia again, he will be punished.

228
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,480
Sir, which question did I do wrong?

229
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,180
Question 16 of
International Finance Law.

230
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,240
Which part of it?

231
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:09,000
There is a mistake in your solving step.

232
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:09,930
Sir.

233
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:12,770
It was a simple algorithm.
Can't you see it?

234
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:14,605
I omitted the basic
additions, subtractions

235
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:16,980
and complex way of multiplying.

236
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:21,110
I used the pure mathematics Calculus and
Cross Multiplication to get the answer.

237
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:25,250
The detailed answer was stated
on page 258 of Economics textbook.

238
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:33,220
Be quiet!

239
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,910
Only a full score of all subjects.

240
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,540
Look at your own result.

241
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,400
How could you laugh, huh?

242
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,990
They can do well too.

243
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:47,030
Stop dreaming.

244
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:48,730
I told you,

245
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:51,840
it was not their problem,
but your teaching problem.

246
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:55,480
What now? Want to bet again?

247
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:01,800
If we get the first place
in Math competition in China,

248
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:06,430
you have to bow and make
an apology to everyone here .

249
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,000
-Chu Xia.
-What if you don't get the first place?

250
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,270
You can do as you like.

251
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,670
Don't get over yourself.

252
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:15,940
Give me 15 days.

253
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:19,190
We'll get the first place in China.

254
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:23,710
Alright, you're the class teacher
of Class B from now on.

255
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,390
Thank you, Mr. Ma.

256
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:28,880
Good luck.

257
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,640
I don't wish to see you fail.

258
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,030
I won't let you down.

259
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:41,320
I can't make it.

260
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,020
Quiet!

261
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:56,680
Xiao Nan.

262
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,910
Listen to my order in these 15 days.

263
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:02,110
Photocopy my relevant notes
and give it to everybody.

264
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:02,830
Yes, madam!

265
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,310
Ming Yue, Cai Xia!

266
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:07,220
Listen to my order and
print out my questions.

267
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,220
-Yes, madam!
-Yes!

268
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,240
-Wang Jian Ren!
-Yes!

269
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:13,490
Forget it, please study hard

270
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:15,330
to get 80 marks.

271
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,580
I'd better quit.

272
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,920
The result of the exam is important.

273
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:25,730
But I hope to improve everyone's
performance through this examination.

274
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,570
Let's work together.

275
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:28,820
Go for it!

276
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,170
Go for it!

277
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:35,270
Hello, everyone.

278
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:39,260
Class A and Class B will be having
your etiquette class together today.

279
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:45,160
And today's etiquette class
is specifically made for girls.

280
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,270
The main content of our course today

281
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:50,660
is about the use of cutlery
in Western dining etiquette.

282
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,060
You might think this is
just a piece of cake.

283
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:57,180
But we'll look into the details

284
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:59,210
about the standard use.

285
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:08,330
Ugly ducklings only become
white swans in fairy tales.

286
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:13,790
Low-class people would only make them
like a fool when she copied others.

287
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:19,420
A swan will be roasted at the end. It
has no difference with a roasted duck.

288
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:21,640
It's better to be a human.

289
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:25,080
Mo Xin Wei, don't always
think about swans and toads.

290
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,370
Learn how to be a human.

291
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:29,250
What do you mean?

292
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:35,020
You caused An Chu Xia ran in the field
and sent her to the remote pig farm.

293
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,580
You think we don't know it?

294
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:39,210
So what? You want to get
even with Xin Wei, huh?

295
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:40,730
I dare not.

296
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:42,720
I know who I am.

297
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,720
I'm not your match.

298
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,390
That's good then.

299
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,140
But someone dares to do it.

300
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:52,820
Don't forget the words of Young Master Qi Lu.

301
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:54,830
Are you threatening us?

302
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:57,800
Mind your identity.

303
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,940
That's true, I shouldn't argue
with people on that level.

304
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:05,850
I have to mind my identity.

305
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:12,860
However, we're still better
than those poor flatterer.

306
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,020
-Who do you mean?
-You should know it.

307
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:19,080
Meng Xiao Nan, you're so bold.

308
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,320
How dare you scold my people?

309
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,120
Hey, there!

310
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:25,670
What's going on?

311
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,920
What are you talking about?

312
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,810
Meng Xiao Nan.

313
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,520
Any question?

314
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:32,610
No.

315
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:35,290
Please be quiet.

316
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,280
I'm not afraid of you.

317
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:41,840
I have Chu Xia.

318
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,840
She'll get the first place
in the campus belle competition.

319
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,770
By then, you'll be a loser.

320
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:50,780
Alright, I'm looking forward to it.

321
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:56,020
I'm looking forward
to see a joke from someone.

322
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:57,200
An Chu Xia.

323
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,290
Don't forget the competition.

324
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:01,530
We never afraid of you.

325
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,150
Whoever is absent
will be called as a grandchild.

326
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:09,603
-My dear grandchild.
