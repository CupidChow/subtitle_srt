1
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:18,590
Bro, it's been a long time
since the school ends.

2
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,440
Go back to your house.

3
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,330
You...I almost have domestic
violence because of you.

4
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,090
Chu Xia is cruel.
How could she be so cold-hearted?

5
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:35,820
She must be influenced by Han Qi Lu.

6
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:39,990
One takes the behavior
of one's company.

7
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,010
Don't worry.
I'll call Chu Xia and lecture her.

8
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,360
It's Chu Xia.

9
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,470
Keep quiet.

10
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:51,550
Hello, Chu Xia.

11
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:52,860
Anything I can help?

12
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:56,380
Do you know where
Jiang Chen Chuan is?

13
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,120
His phone is off.

14
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:01,880
You two always stay together
recently. That's why I call you.

15
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,840
Jiang Chen Chuan?

16
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:07,930
I didn't see him.

17
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:09,110
He left, didn't he?

18
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,180
Alright.

19
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:11,030
Forget it then.

20
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:12,390
Wait.

21
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:13,560
Just a minute.

22
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:15,930
Why are you looking for him?

23
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:18,800
I was in a bad mood in the afternoon

24
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,220
and Jiang Chen Chuan
asked me to go to the resort.

25
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:22,870
I did not pay attention

26
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:23,970
and was rude to him.

27
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:26,140
I might have hurt him.

28
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:28,200
I see.

29
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:31,750
That is quite serious.

30
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:35,080
A rich child like him

31
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:38,040
has never suffered in his life.

32
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:40,490
Especially a setback from a woman.

33
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:42,980
Now you hurt him.

34
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:45,420
He might...

35
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,060
Feng Shao!

36
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:47,860
Don't scare me.

37
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,110
I'm not sure.

38
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:53,260
What about this?

39
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:55,100
You accept his invitation.

40
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,670
I wanted to accept it.

41
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:58,990
But his phone is off.

42
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:00,860
Chu Xia! You finally say yes!

43
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:03,010
Jiang Chen Chuan!

44
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:04,950
-Why are you there?
-I...

45
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,540
Feng Shao, you lied to me!

46
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,830
Chu Xia, I'm here.

47
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,320
So you will go with me, right?

48
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:10,510
Well...

49
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,040
It's late now.

50
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:12,850
Take a rest.

51
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:14,360
Okay. Bye.

52
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:24,820
I'm going on a date with Chu Xia!
I have to to get ready.

53
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:29,690
Gosh!

54
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,670
What a useless guy!

55
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:47,190
Don't look at me.

56
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,150
I'm innocent.

57
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,290
She forced me to come.

58
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:53,020
Chu Xia said, the more the merrier.
Did I disturb you?

59
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,160
No...

60
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,700
Let's go.

61
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,130
Be careful.

62
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:04,810
Sit here.

[Episode 7]

65
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:45,740
-Ms. Maria.
-Hi!

66
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,260
-Are you on duty today?
-Yeah.

67
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,610
Did you see You Tian?

68
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:50,030
No.

69
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,370
He disappeared in a flash.

70
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:02,060
Aren't you tired chasing a man everyday
who's not willing to wait for you?

71
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:03,920
Fight for it if you like him.

72
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:07,260
Without the courage,
it's better to give up.

73
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:08,700
Ms. Maria.

74
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,070
Ms. Maria.

75
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,410
I'm off.

76
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:12,380
Bye.

77
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,100
Fight for it if you like him.

78
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,350
Without the courage,
it's better to give up.

79
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:05,070
Big news! According
to the reliable informant,

80
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:07,150
they dated in a resort
during the weekend.

81
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:10,730
Really? Didn't An Chu Xia
fall in love with Han Qi Lu?

82
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:13,660
-How come she hangs out with Jiang?
-It seems the rumors are true.

83
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:14,760
Xiang Man Kui is back.

84
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,010
An Chu Xia and Han Qi Lu broke up

85
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,640
and found their new lovers.

86
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,230
Two of them

87
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:30,350
hid it very well. I can't see it
although we're in the same class.

88
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:31,840
I can't see it either.

89
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:35,770
This is the school communication group.
Don't send such messages!

90
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:58,830
Han! Check a place for me.

91
00:06:59,020 --> 00:06:59,660
What?

92
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,050
Only two rooms left?

93
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,660
Sorry, Young Master Jiang.

94
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,540
The hotel rooms are always booked.

95
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,620
During our tele-conversation, you said

96
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,150
that you needed 2 rooms.

97
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:09,250
So, we...

98
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,320
I don't care!

99
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,060
Give me two more rooms now.

100
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,140
Hear that?

101
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,210
The rest has been checked in...

102
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:22,040
Someone is showing off here
as Young Master Jiang.

103
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,690
Uncle will be sad if he gets to know it.

104
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:25,670
Mo Xin Wei.

105
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:26,730
Why are you here?

106
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:30,300
Why am I here?
This is a property of Jiang's family.

107
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,070
My father sent me to survey it.

108
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:32,960
What a bad luck!

109
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,860
What did you say?

110
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,050
Give me two more rooms.

111
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:37,030
Forget it. Don't be so hard on her.

112
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:38,940
The three of us can stay in the same room.

113
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,290
An Chu Xia.

114
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:44,220
I had underestimated you.

115
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,300
I didn't expect you are so smart.

116
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,030
You run after Qi Lu

117
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:52,140
and tempt this stupid guy
at the same time, huh?

118
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,570
Who is the stupid guy you mean?

119
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,950
The guy who answers me.

120
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:58,150
It's alright.

121
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:59,190
Don't mind her.

122
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,240
Let's go.

123
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,060
Come on!

124
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:15,690
What a beautiful place!

125
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:18,540
-Thank you for bringing us here.
-You are welcome.

126
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,190
You're a friend of Chu Xia.

127
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:22,450
So you are my friend too.

128
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:23,320
Am I right?

129
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,070
Enjoy the food.

130
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:27,250
Here comes the food. Well...

131
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:29,710
I've done a lot of homework
about the food here.

132
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:30,710
I asked Feng Shao.

133
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:31,450
He said,

134
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:32,960
these are all your favourite.

135
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:35,470
Dig in.

136
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:40,340
Dig in.

137
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,140
Do you mind if I join you?

138
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,260
I'd like to eat too.

139
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,860
Just like a plaster!
Can't get rid of it!

140
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:52,850
Move aside.

141
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:53,690
Han Qi Lu.

142
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:54,850
Why are you here?

143
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:57,760
I was in a bad mood,
so I come and hang out.

144
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,400
I happened to meet you here.

145
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:02,310
Many seats over there.
Why must you sit here?

146
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:04,290
Qi Lu!

147
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,970
Do you want to sit here?

148
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,960
It's your favourite.

149
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,150
When are you going back?

150
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,200
Don't you welcome me?

151
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:16,770
No, there's not enough room here.

152
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:18,590
It is not safe if you go back late.

153
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:21,350
Yeah! It isn't safe if you go back late.

154
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:22,240
Go back now!

155
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:25,820
It's troublesome.

156
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:28,400
In that case,

157
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:31,630
do you mind if I sleep
on the floor in your room?

158
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:32,200
Huh?

159
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:33,710
No way!

160
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:35,370
You stay with me!

161
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,540
You know what.

162
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,120
My room is big

163
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:41,880
and wide.

164
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,760
Stay with me.

165
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,850
Thank you very much!

166
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:49,520
So kind of you.

167
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:51,360
That's it.

168
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:52,600
Dig in.

169
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,170
What makes you laugh?

170
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,300
-Dig in.
-What makes you laugh?

171
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:03,790
Okay.

172
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:04,690
Got it.

173
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,110
It's alright.

174
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:08,200
Enjoy your good time

175
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,530
with Chu Xia.

176
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:10,800
Enjoy yourselves!

177
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:13,130
Don't rush home.

178
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:15,450
Okay.

179
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:16,780
Bye.

180
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:17,660
Madam.

181
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:19,600
Enjoy the fruits.

182
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,030
Han.

183
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,100
You know what.

184
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:26,050
Qi Lu's brain is suddenly open.

185
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:29,070
He went to the resort with Chu Xia.

186
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:29,830
Oh!

187
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,280
The success is around the corner.

188
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:33,390
Madam.

189
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:37,840
As I know, it seems not only
two of them going there.

190
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,720
What do you mean?

191
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:44,830
Young master asked me to check
the address of the resort this morning.

192
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:46,870
Then he hurried away.

193
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
That's Jiang's property.

194
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:51,600
Huh?

195
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,920
Really?

196
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,190
The bed is so big.

197
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:19,600
You pervert!

198
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:28,300
I'll put the pillow here.

199
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:30,170
And I'll put this one here.

200
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:31,640
What are you doing?

201
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:35,710
You sleep here and I'll sleep here.
Don't cross the line.

202
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:39,880
I understand.

203
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,710
But there's only one conclusion.

204
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,060
I sleep on the bed!

205
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:52,730
Hey!

206
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:54,730
Where should I sleep then?

207
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:57,550
Let me see.

208
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,580
Kitchen.

209
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,680
Toilet.

210
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:01,850
Ceiling.

211
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:03,190
Or the pool outside.

212
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:04,390
Wherever you want to.

213
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,620
Go ahead! Don't disturb me!

214
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:08,490
Han Qi Lu!

215
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,690
You have gone too far.

216
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,720
No way! Let's fight!

217
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,790
Han Qi Lu.

218
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,950
Han Qi Lu.

219
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,190
What now?

220
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:08,810
Gross!

221
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:16,440
You're really something!

222
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,780
Why are you still up at this hour?

223
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,330
You too.

224
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:34,690
The room is too noisy.

225
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:35,770
I couldn't sleep.

226
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:40,540
Nice moon!

227
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:53,020
Why do you suddenly come to the resort?

228
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:56,720
I haven't been to an outing for so long.

229
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,750
So I hang out with Xiao Nan.

230
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:02,530
Not because of Jiang Chen Chuan?

231
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:04,920
Not really.

232
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,620
Did you read the news in the group?

233
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:14,860
Yes.

234
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,410
That's not true.

235
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:20,630
What?

236
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:27,160
I mean, the relationship between
Chen Chuan and I isn't what they see.

237
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:29,600
That's good.

238
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,370
I...

239
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:35,790
Can I ask you a question?

240
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:38,730
Sure.

241
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:46,050
Are you really going to ignore
Xiang Man Kui in your life time?

242
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:49,140
What do you mean?

243
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:52,170
I feel pity for her.

244
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,250
-She asked you to persuade me?
-No.

245
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,870
Everybody will get confused
in their life once or twice.

246
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,980
You can't throw them to hell.

247
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:03,730
when they make a mistake.

248
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,790
An Chu Xia.

249
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:07,590
What's up?

250
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:11,170
I've never met anyone
who's more heartless than you!

251
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,590
You really want to make us reconciled?

252
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:16,300
I can see that you can't forget her.
So, I'm helping you.

253
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,990
Look at you now.

254
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:20,860
You are being hard on yourself
instead of torturing others.

255
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:25,160
I won't bother you.

256
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:32,830
Insane!

257
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:43,120
Jiang Chen Chuan.

258
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,640
That's what you've arranged?

259
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,290
That's right.

260
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:47,710
What a poor place!

261
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:48,830
What?

262
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,250
Nothing.

263
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,800
Come and help, I can't do this.

264
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,280
Let's go.

265
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,760
I don't know how to cut it.

266
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:07,440
Look.

267
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:08,710
What about this?

268
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:13,120
Am I smart?

269
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:17,360
Feng Shao.

270
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,190
I'm having a grill.

271
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,450
Barbecue.

272
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,630
That's it?

273
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,770
That's right.

274
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:27,720
Wait.

275
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,980
Is there a horse farm
or something in your resort?

276
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,340
Why don't you teach
Chu Xia riding a horse?

277
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:37,410
I can't do other things.
That's only what I can do.

278
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,980
What about golf?

279
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:42,250
I can't play golf too.

280
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:47,150
Well... Frankly, are you sure

281
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,980
you are the heir to Jiang's family?

282
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,300
Are you an adopted child?

283
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:53,550
I only good at computer game.

284
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:55,970
I think I should
build a game station city

285
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:57,730
and change the whole environment.

286
00:16:57,730 --> 00:16:58,520
What say you?

287
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,670
Forget it. Carry on your work.

288
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:01,790
Good luck to you.

289
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,300
Idiot! You can't even flirt with a girl!

290
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,540
He's so weak in this.

291
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:07,860
Are you good enough?

292
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:09,980
Of course I'm good.

293
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:10,640
Let's go.

294
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:31,050
Hey!

295
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,930
You can't do it, leave it to me.

296
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:33,490
Go away!

297
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,230
Let me do this.

298
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:37,070
Go away!

299
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,470
Chen Chuan.

300
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:40,600
Are you okay?

301
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:44,990
You're bleeding.

302
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,510
Han Qi Lu, I just want to help you.

303
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:51,310
You are so careless.

304
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:54,190
He's such a busy body.

305
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,120
You hurt him.
Shouldn't you apologize?

306
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:02,910
Why should I? It was him who did wrong!

307
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:06,120
You always blame people.

308
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,530
Who do you think you are?

309
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:09,610
The haughty Young Master Han?

310
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,530
Unreasonable!

311
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,200
Incorrigible!

312
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:23,360
Don't be angry.

313
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,770
Just blow on it.

314
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:26,230
Chu Xia.

315
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:31,530
Let me help you.

316
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,550
Stop following me.

317
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:42,880
Qi Lu.

318
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:45,060
Let's talk.

319
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:55,190
Is the bandage nice?

320
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:56,760
Hey!

321
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:05,450
Where's Han Qi Lu?
Hasn't come back yet?

322
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:06,440
I don't know.

323
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,480
Where's Xiang Man Kui?

324
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:10,530
They were together.

325
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:16,480
Do you still think Xiang Man Kui comes
near you without any motive?

326
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:18,920
Come on.

327
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,200
Xiao Nan.

328
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,900
Didn't we talk about it before?

329
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:23,320
Yes, we did.

330
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:24,780
But have you ever thought

331
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:27,110
that no one is good
to anyone for no reason.

332
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,740
She helped you many times.

333
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,190
And there must be a reason.

334
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:34,960
You think too much.

335
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:37,030
Chu Xia.

336
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,380
You should know your feeling

337
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,410
towards Han Qi Lu.

338
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:43,250
I won't force you.
I won't force you to admit anything.

339
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,460
The important thing is,

340
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,950
you have to know what you want
and what you don't want.

341
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:49,090
I don't understand.

342
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,370
An Chu Xia.

343
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:51,600
Don't try to escape.

344
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:53,530
If you like Han Qi Lu,

345
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:55,090
tell him frankly.

00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,790
Don't fear of getting hurt.

347
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:59,030
Love irrevocably and vigorously!

348
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,080
If you don't like him,

349
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:04,090
look at the person around you
who is really good to you.

Meng Xiao Nan!
