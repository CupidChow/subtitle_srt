The location you sent
was really hard to find.

00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:19,860
-Don't act like a ghost again.
-Why is he always there when I'm embarrassed?

4
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,960
Get up, get in the car.

5
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:24,700
Get up.

6
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:25,860
Don't move.

7
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:26,970
What's wrong?

8
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:32,310
What's wrong with you?

9
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,440
I have my menstruation.

10
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,580
I have my menstruation.

11
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:39,130
What?

12
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:43,420
The one you don't have.

13
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,790
Alright, cover with the cloth.

14
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:50,870
Get up. Hurry.

15
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,710
Get up.

16
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:54,590
Give me the bag.

17
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,420
I take you home. Wait.

00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:06,060
Let's go.

Hurry.

21
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,940
How could you get into any car?

22
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,630
Why didn't you stay in the classroom?

23
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:02,170
You even get wet in the rain
during your menstruation.

24
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:04,010
You are really something.

25
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,870
Why are you so quiet?

26
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:22,390
No matter what Mo Xin Wei said,
just ignore it.

Why are you bringing me here?
Aren't we going home?

31
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:57,030
Back home?

32
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,070
Sis Yuan Yuan will kill me
if she sees you in this look.

33
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:05,390
What are you thinking? Come out.

34
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,390
Young Master, welcome back.

35
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,850
This is Han's hotel.

36
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:16,800
Don't disgrace me. Come out.

37

This way please.

38
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,470
Young Master.

-Where's the washroom?
-It is on your right.

42
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:25,840
Take a bath.
Don't let Sis Yuan Yuan worry.

43
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:27,520
Okay.

44
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,590
What are you doing?

45
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,870
Take off the clothes,
I'll let them wash it.

46
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:42,810
You go out first.

47
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,510
Don't worry.

48
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:48,400
I'm not interested in
your skinny body shape.

49
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:16,920
Sis Yuan Yuan.

50
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:20,630
Don't worry.

51
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,040
I am with her now.

52
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:26,510
It's raining outside.

I'm taking her out for a meal.

54
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,230
You go to bed first.

55
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,440
You're like a chatterbox.

56
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:40,710
Okay, I got it. Stop talking.

57
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,840
I'm not talking about you.

58
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,390
I didn't mean you were a chatterbox.

59
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:46,620
I mean...

60
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,850
Forget it, you go to bed first.

61
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:53,780
Here.

62
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:07,630
Young Master Han.

-Quickly wash it.
-Yes, master.

64
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:13,070
Wait a minute.

65
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,220
Help me buy

66
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:17,140
that thing.

67
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:20,770
What's that?

68
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,920
That one.

69
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,530
What brand do you want?

70
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,560
You are annoying.

71
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,900
I never use it. How do I know?

72
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,630
Okay, I got it.

73
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:36,150
Send me the clothes and that thing.

74
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,640
Okay, I'll get it right away.

75

An Chu Xia.

76
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:20,930
Who's that?

77
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:32,640
There are a lot of things
I want to make it clear to you.

78
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:35,180
But,

79
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:38,140
I don't know what to say.

80
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:43,050
At first, I just thought
you were so special.

81
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:48,670
After all, I've never had
this situation before.

82
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,970
I mean, I was not allergic to you.

83
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,320
Is my mouth alright?

84
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:01,370
And then our encounter was so special.

85
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,670
The password is 5276.

86
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:07,130
5276.

87
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,370
Then you absurdly came to my house.

88
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:12,680
And my mom likes you very much.

89
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:16,270
So I was just trying to kick you out.

90
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:20,630
Right, it's all my problems.

91
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,290
But then

92
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:26,950
you made me feel

93
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:29,890
surprised.

94
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:32,080
-Young Master Han.
-A light year...

95
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:35,100
Don't be a wet blanket.

96
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,140
Actually, I've been trying to tell you

97
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:45,740
that I really don't hate you.

98
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:49,330
I've never hated you.

99
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,290
Actually,

100
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:58,710
I look great in this cloth.

101
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,040
No matter what you do,

102
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:04,590
I wouldn't hate you.

103
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:08,960
And...

104
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:13,570
Chu Xia.

105
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:15,890
I like you.

106
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:20,890
Like falling in love.

107
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,230
I just want to say.

108
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,900
About my confession of feeling that day.

109
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:34,230
Can you consider it?

110
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:41,080
An Chu Xia.

111
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:45,220
You can't speak as you're
touched by me, huh?

112
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:48,470
Yeah.

113
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:51,940
Girls have weak willpower.

114
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:57,030
I bet you can't resist
such confession of love.

115
00:11:57,770 --> 00:11:59,790
Well, knock on the door twice

116
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:01,190
if you say yes.

117
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:05,940
An Chu Xia.

118
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:15,880
Don't tell me you are unconscious
because you are too happy.

119
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:20,870
An Chu Xia.

120
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,000
Chu Xia.

121
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:30,220
Chu Xia, don't scare me.

122
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:34,560
Why did you keep quiet?

123
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,300
Han Qi Lu! You freak!

124
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,530
I just saw you standing outside.

125
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:41,320
And now you're breaking in.

126
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,380
How can you do that?

127
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:46,360
What's on your mind?

128
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,430
What a bad guy! You are a pervert!

129
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:51,090
Dirty guy!

130
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:51,990
Rascal!

131
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,090
Pervert!

132
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:02,010
The clothes have been washed.

133
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:03,450
And the thing you asked me to buy.

134
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,250
Is your room soundproofed?

135
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,195
Of course, you can't find a better

136
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:12,554
soundproofed hotel
within 8 miles radius.

137
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:13,800
Alright then.

138
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,130
He's so rushing.

139
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:21,890
Open the door.

140
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:25,400
Clothes and the thing you want.

141
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,130
Hurry up.

142
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:37,190
Han Qi Lu! You pervert!

143
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:38,470
Pervert!

144
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,960
Freak!

145
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,950
I can't believe that!

146
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:43,490
What a bad guy!

147
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:44,860
I'll tell Sis Yuan Yuan about it!

148
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:45,880
Han Qi Lu!

149
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,210
You pervert!

150
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:50,120
I can't believe you dare to do that!

151
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,280
-How did Sis Yuan Yuan teach you?
-An Chu Xia!

152
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,070
Didn't you hear my
confession of feeling to you?

153
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:08,080
What confession?

154
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,250
That's what I just said.

155
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,460
What did you say?

156
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,510
Didn't you hear it?

157
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:19,230
An Chu Xia.

158
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:28,050
I'll buy it for you.

159
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:29,720
Wait here.

160
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,800
Insane. He didn't take medicine today.

161
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:58,170
I have to get it anyway!

162
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:22,250
So much, which one shall I buy?

163
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,300
This is nice.

164
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:28,610
This one? Thank you.

165
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:49,420
Let me buy more.

166
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,820
It's all Xiang Man Kui's fault.

167
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:02,290
Because you are so much like her.

168
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:05,310
The more you look like her,
the more Qi Lu can't forget her.

169
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:12,490
Hey.

170
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:19,670
This is my first time to buy it.
They say it's the best.

171
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:37,690
Qi Lu, let's go home.

172
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:39,460
I've ordered a meal.

173
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,960
I'm not hungry and
don't feel like eating.

174
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:51,910
It's okay, I won't force you.
I'll let the home chef cook for you.

175
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:00,560
Qi Lu.

176
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,470
Wait a minute.

177
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:05,340
Anything else you want to say?

178
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:08,770
Thank you for your help.

179
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:10,890
Thank you.

180
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,130
Thank me?

181
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,040
I don't know what to say.

182
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:28,880
You'd better stay far from me later.

183
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,840
Because...

184
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:55,550
Ms. Chu Xia, madam is waiting for you
in the living room. Quickly get in

185
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:57,230
to make her relieved.

186
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,100
Little Chu Xia!

187
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:03,600
Here you are, my dear.

188
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:09,800
Luckily, you didn't get wet.

189
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:14,010
I was worried that you'd walk back
on your own and didn't wait for Qi Lu.

190
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,340
Where is Qi Lu?

191
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:32,020
Sis Yuan Yuan,
I go back to my room first.

192
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:37,050
I'd like to chat with you.

193
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,030
Come on.

194
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,440
Little Chu Xia.

195
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:49,140
I know Qi Lu always

196
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,690
makes you angry recently.

197
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:54,700
But he's really not a bad boy.

198
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:56,990
I know.

199
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:03,810
Qi Lu was not like this before.

200
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:05,790
He was gentle,

201
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,520
kind

202
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,650
and considerate.

203
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,020
Aunt.

204
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:23,950
In fact, Qi Lu was lonely
when he was young.

205
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,110
He didn't have any friends.

206
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:32,230
And Han family is rich.

207
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:37,170
Many people approach him for benefits.

208
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:42,980
Han Yu is a warm child.

209
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:47,270
He stands aloof from worldly
affairs and he is meek.

210
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:52,400
And Xiang Man Kui's family
is much like Han's family.

211
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:59,660
They know each other since they were
small and used to be a perfect match.

212
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:03,170
So the three of them
became good friends.

213
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:09,330
When they were in junior high,

214
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:12,780
a big change hit Xiang's family.

215
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:16,050
I brought her to our house

216
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:23,590
and send her to Stiland College
with Han Yu.

217
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:27,910
Both of them have been
together ever since.

218
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:31,120
They were so happy.

219
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:34,110
They had great memories.

220
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:36,690
I bet they had oaths too.

221
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,000
But a year ago,

222
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:44,850
Xiang Man Kui suddenly left silently.

223
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,440
She didn't leave a word to Qi Lu.

224
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:52,110
It was a big blow to Qi Lu.

225
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:56,900
Then, Qi Lu was getting more
and more cold-hearted

226
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:58,490
and isolated.

227
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:04,070
He no longer measures everything
by emotional standards.

228
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:08,230
He thinks the rationality
is the most accurate.

229
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:15,900
The scar in his heart is really deep.

230
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:20,770
But, you know what.

231
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:26,090
From the moment you step into our house,

232
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:31,870
I know you're going to change all that.

233
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,100
Because I look much like Xiang Man Kui?

234
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,150
No.

235
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:39,340
You're too much better than her.

236
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,400
You know how to love.

237
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,840
You're a kind girl.

238
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:47,610
You love yourself

239
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:50,160
and know how to love others.

240
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,670
Chu Xia.

241
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:01,890
Please be kind to Qi Lu.
