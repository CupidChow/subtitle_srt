1
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,720
Pretend that you don't know me.

2
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:21,310
Bow respectfully to me
and call me Master Han.

3
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,410
Don't think you're any different from those

4
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,220
who tried hard to be a swan
even if you're living with us now.

5
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,530
Should be a phoenix.

6
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,520
I don't care.

7
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,370
A chicken can't turn

8
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,230
into a phoenix anyway.

9
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,230
Master Han, don't worry.

10
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:41,570
No matter where I am,

11
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:47,560
I'll go away when I see you from far.

12
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,850
-And...
-Enough!

13
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,280
Get out of the car if you've had enough!

14
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,580
Young master.

15
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:56,010
Madam asked me to protect Ms. An.

16
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,110
I am the one in danger, alright, Mr. Batman?

17
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:04,860
Remember.

18
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,410
You have to call me Master Han, got it?

19
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,420
Everybody!

20
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,310
Listen!

21
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,240
She is...

22
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,060
She is my maid.

23
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,200
You may order her as you like in the future.

24
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:06,300
Mom, our dream has come true.

25
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,900
I'm a student of Stiland College now.

26
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:13,440
It was where you and father studied before.

27
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,500
I'll work hard as you did to be excellent.

28
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:19,350
Xiao Nan.

29
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:20,580
Why are you here?

30
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,280
I asked my dad to transfer me here.

31
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,010
Thank you.

32
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,450
I didn't come here for you.

33
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,960
I heard it's full of handsome guys.

34
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:34,690
Why didn't you get in?

35
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:37,380
-Nothing.
-Let's go.

36
00:03:35,985 --> 00:03:37,919
[Master Devil Do Not Kiss Me]

37
00:03:38,366 --> 00:03:39,366
[Episode 3]

38
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,220
Handsome guys, where are you?

39
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,750
Sorry, it's my fault.

40
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:53,260
Are you blind?

41
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,100
-I didn't mean it.
-He's Gao Gan.

42
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,870
Devil No. 2 of Class A.

43
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,320
His family is rich and powerful.

44
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:00,660
We can't afford to mess with him.

45
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:01,950
Let's go.

46
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:07,670
In order to study peacefully here,

47
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,860
you have to be tolerant.

48
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:16,180
It's rare that you didn't give your hands.

49
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:19,730
I'm here to study.

50
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:21,460
It has nothing to do with me.

51
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:23,430
That's right.

52
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,330
Let's go.

53
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,850
Are you having rickets?

54
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,310
You can't even carry the books!

55
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,570
These are the exercise books of Class A.

56
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,040
Hurry.

57
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,790
He's bullying her.

58
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:54,050
Let's go.

59
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:11,180
Hi!

60
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,870
I'm a new comer.

61
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,320
My name is An Chu Xia.

62
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,370
What's up with the students here?

63
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,710
Don't bother. Let's go.

64
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,050
In fact, these are all small cases.

65
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,800
Han Qi Lu is more terrible.

66
00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:00,710
Before we came, he kicked out a girl
who confessed her feeling to him.

67
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,740
And the girl was sitting
in your seat now.

68
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,560
This is his style.

69
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,490
How do you know?

70
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,760
Who am I?

71
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:16,900
I'm a boy crazy

72
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,300
and great busybody.

73
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,080
I have made a thorough
check before I came.

74
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,530
Class, be quiet.

75
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:46,140
I have an announcement.

76
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:50,350
Your class teacher, Mr. Ma Jian Guo

77
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:54,540
was injured in the military
training of Class A.

78
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,920
So he needs to take a rest.

79
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,330
Before his return,

80
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:07,400
the class will be taken
over by Mr. You Tian.

81
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,310
If you have any question and problem

82
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,810
in the future,

83
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,700
you may turn to

84
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,110
other teachers.

85
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,040
Sir.

86
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,000
Hey.

87
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,390
What's wrong with you?

88
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,740
Did someone bully you?

89
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,220
I'm fine.

90
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,000
What happened to your face?

91
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:44,470
Nothing.

92
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,160
"Busybody"

93
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,500
"Do not bother?"

94
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:49,800
"Don't bother!"

95
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:50,940
"I can't stand it."

96
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,930
"I have to do something!"

97
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:54,620
"It's a high society,
not Cat Ears Lane!"

98
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,470
What's wrong with you?

99
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:03,140
I just bumped into a tree.

100
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:07,780
Gosh!

101
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,890
Girl!

102
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,090
What's wrong?

103
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,220
Nothing.

104
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:21,000
Go to your seat.

105
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,990
Have a check at the infirmary later.

106
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,480
Are you done?

107
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,990
Almost there.

108
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:44,450
Relax, take it easy.

109
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,140
I'll sew the inner part later.

110
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,490
Are you sure you can do it?

111
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:52,130
You have no choice,

112
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:53,570
but to trust me.

113
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:57,070
You can't walk around with a ripped skirt.

114
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,500
Ouch! What are you doing?

115
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,240
Do it carefully.

116
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:08,530
Sorry.

117
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:10,640
I pricked voodoo dolls before.

118
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,280
But sorry that I can't sew it well.

119
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:16,500
It's done.

120
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,220
A bit strange.

121
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:24,510
No worries.

122
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,180
I have been studying
fashion since I was small.

123
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:29,640
I added new designs on your skirt.

124
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,980
Like the California Fashion Week.

125
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:34,080
I'm sure you'll be outstanding.

126
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,990
It's Paris Fashion Week.

127
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:40,570
They are two different things.

128
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:47,440
Are you sure my skirt is fine?

129
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:49,380
They look weird at me.

130
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,800
Sure.

131
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,300
Can't you read the envy in their eyes?

132
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:55,030
You'll know how much I love you

133
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,130
when you see it tonight.

134
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,010
Really?

135
00:09:58,010 --> 00:09:59,540
Don't bluff me.

136
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,400
Don't worry.

137
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,670
You should walk confidently
like a famous model.

138
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,760
Be confident and straight up your chest.

139
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:11,910
I'll kill you if you play a prank on me.

140
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,810
You shouldn't say that.

141
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:17,560
Let me remove it.

142
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,820
Wait, I'm sorry.

143
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:21,160
It doesn't matter how you sewed it.

144
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,050
That's right.

145
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:27,800
Don't worry.

146
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:31,270
It's just a piece of cake.

147
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,180
Right?

148
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,160
Alright, let's go.

149
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,020
I believe you.

150
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,870
Why don't we go back first?
She knows how to go back.

151
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:51,020
Madam ordered me to send you
and Ms. Chu Xia home safely.

152
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:53,710
She's not here.

153
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,920
What makes you obey her?

154
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:01,340
Sincerity is our main
objective over the years.

155
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,250
Did you forget it?

156
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,840
Do you know who you should
obey when my father is away?

157
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:08,640
Of course I know.

158
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,730
I should obey madam

159
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,300
when Master Han is not around.

160
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,200
Outrageous! I've been
waiting for so long.

161
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,360
Qi Lu, don't go.

162
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:23,180
Guard!

163
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:23,920
Hands off!

164
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:25,770
Please.

165
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,820
Don't chase me out!

166
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,280
I just want to stay with you.

167
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,150
Don't make me repeat.

168
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,370
What now? Take her away!

169
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:37,780
Qi Lu!

170
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,920
Hey, you! Get in the car!

171
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,350
Chu Xia, come on.

172
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,760
Bye.

173
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,510
Ms. Chu Xia, don't be angry.

174
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,250
The girl has nothing to
do with young master.

175
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,870
Drive your car!

176
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,160
Chu Xia.

177
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,540
How was your study today?

178
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,420
Anything funny?

179
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,560
Sis Yuan Yuan, I'll go
back to my room first.

180
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,530
Anyone bullied you?

181
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,820
What's up? I'll stand up for you.

182
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,510
I'm fine, thank you.
I go back to my room first.

183
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,110
Did you bully her?

184
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,740
I dare not since you're there.

185
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:37,580
I don't care, you have to coax her.

186
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,080
Otherwise,

187
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:40,660
think of the magnifying lens.

188
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:42,640
Alright.

189
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,820
Madam.

190
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,100
What happened?

191
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,310
I have no idea.

192
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:15,750
Are you blind?

193
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:17,800
These are the exercise books of Class A.

194
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:21,340
Qi Lu! I love you!

195
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:31,160
You don't have to knock
just to show your politeness

196
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:35,850
since you are actually not
seeking for the permission.

197
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:39,690
This is my habitual manner.

198
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:42,540
Let me correct you.

199
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:45,770
Don't ever think you are
the master in my house.

200
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:49,500
Since you like to talk,

201
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:52,170
I'll talk to you then.

202
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:54,490
This is your house,

203
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:57,760
but Sis Yuan Yuan said, this is my room.

204
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,850
Before you become
the master of Han's family,

205
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,340
you have to obey Sis Yuan Yuan.

206
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,980
In that case,

207
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,660
I have the authority to use it

208
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:10,800
although I don't have the proprietary right.

209
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:12,620
Since you are strict and square,

210
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,000
you should understand it.

211
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:18,240
You have to get the permission
of the owner before using it.

212
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:22,600
Otherwise, you're a robber.

213
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:28,780
Not bad, you are a good talker.

214
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:34,050
Although Xue likes you, you don't
have to kick her out of the school.

215
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,660
It's up to me.

216
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:42,740
I have my own way.

217
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:47,460
You are always arrogant.

218
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,930
And you used to wipe out

219
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:52,800
the people you don't like.

220
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,020
It's good that you know it.

221
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,790
I always keep my promise.

222
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:02,300
You promised to leave,

223
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,960
but you're still living here.

224
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:07,080
It's annoying.

225
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,060
I stay here because of...

226
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,670
Who cares?

227
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:18,620
I'll give you a hard time

228
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,540
as long as you stay here.

229
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:38,340
Look at the painting.

230
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,880
It's "Guernica",

231
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,600
a masterpiece of Picasso.

232
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,160
Let me brief you about Picasso.

233
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:48,340
His name is Pablo Ruiz Picasso.

234
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:49,640
He's a Spanish.

235
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:53,150
He was born on October 25, 1881

236
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,870
and died on April 8, 1973.

237
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,600
It was a Nazi's bombing on the
Basque town of Guernica in 1937.

238
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:05,520
It blamed the cruelty of the
Spanish Civil War with artistry

239
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:07,440
in a breathtaking way.

240
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:10,740
Defense always goes after oppression.

241
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:12,070
That's right.

242
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,180
I want meat.

243
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,830
What's up?

244
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,070
Gosh!

245
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:24,480
Mr. You Tian's class works
better than sleeping pills.

246
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:25,910
I could sleep in a minute.

247
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:28,160
To me, he did a good job.

248
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:29,980
He explained the painting and

249
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,800
meaning in brief and short sentences.

250
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:34,460
But I still don't understand.

251
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,480
The conclusion is

252
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:40,910
"Defense always goes after oppression".

253
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:41,810
That's right.

254
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:48,160
"Defense always goes after oppression".

255
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:51,360
Action speaks louder than words.
He didn't even defend

256
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:52,720
when he was oppressed,

257
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,240
It needs a process.

258
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:58,060
I believe he will stand up one day.

259
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,820
Chu Xia.

260
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,900
"Frightened"

261
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,410
Handsome guy!

262
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,880
Are you blind?

263
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,620
My eyes can't make a swerve.
Why did you pop out?

264
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:17,070
Can't you learn? You are
eager to learn, aren't you?

265
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:18,620
Mind your word.

266
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,670
I'm not afraid of you.

267
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:22,600
You don't have to.

268
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,790
I just want you to obey me.

269
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:27,930
I'll listen to your last word before you die.

270
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,830
It's said a man will be kind
before his last breath.

271
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,770
How can you talk to
your master in this way?

272
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,080
I've never admitted
that I was your maid.

273
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,140
You don't have to admit it.

274
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:44,260
Are you thirsty?

275
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:45,910
No.

276
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,320
I'm thirsty.

277
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,710
Buy a box of Coke
and send it to Class A.

278
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,190
I'll go with you.

279
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,660
What? Don't you know the road?

280
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:01,730
Don't be so hard on a girl.

281
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,320
So bad.

282
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,840
Why didn't they help me?

283
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,160
-Did you hear that?
-What?

284
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:17,140
An Chu Xia is quarreling with Han Qi Lu.

285
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:19,190
What a bold maid!

286
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:23,200
I can't believe a maid can get in here.
She even dared to go against Han Qi Lu.

287
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,790
It must be something behind.

288
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:26,300
Did you hear it?

289
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,940
An Chu Xia is not only
a maid of Han Qi Lu.

290
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:29,820
Think about it.

291
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,290
She dared to quarrel with Han Qi Lu.

292
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,100
-It must be something behind.
-Yeah.

293
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:40,060
You know what brings An Chu Xia here
and even dares to go against Han Qi Lu?

294
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:42,780
She's pregnant.

295
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:45,870
Pregnant?

296
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:49,050
Gosh! I must tell Xin Wei about it!

297
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:04,460
Xin Wei, I heard

298
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:07,550
An Chu Xia is having a baby of Qi Lu.

299
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,320
You look so calm.

300
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,580
An Chu Xia

301
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:16,140
is having a baby of Qi Lu?

302
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,050
Yeah.

303
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,630
It was what they said.

304
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,360
Waiter.

305
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,860
Ms. Mo, anything we can help?

306
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:26,700
Keep the change.

307
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,090
Thank you, Ms. Mo.

308
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,720
Xin Wei.

309
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,120
Let's go to Class B.

310
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,240
Han Qi Lu, damn it!

311
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:41,730
I'll beat him up to handicap

312
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,890
if it weren't for studying here.

313
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:46,480
If you listened to me,

314
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,420
we won't be suffering now.

315
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:50,390
Sorry to have troubled you.

316
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,590
Don't say that.

317
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:54,830
We're good friends.

318
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,720
We should help each other.

319
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:03,200
-Chu Xia.
-Here you are.

320
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:04,710
The Coke...

321
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:11,000
Damn it!

322
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:13,630
Did it freak you out?

323
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:15,630
We didn't mean it.

324
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:18,140
We have no energy.

325
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:20,640
Really?

326
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:24,900
No, I still have energy.

327
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,990
Alright, distribute the drinks

328
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,340
to the everyone.

329
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,720
Make sure everyone gets it.

330
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,360
Buy again if it's not enough.

331
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,700
Leave it to me.

332
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:45,200
You should have studied for her.

333
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:47,760
Go!

334
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:49,820
I can do it myself.

335
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,980
I'll do it now.

336
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,440
Chu Xia.

337
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:18,290
Are you alright?

338
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,430
Did you get hurt?

339
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:20,280
