An Chu Xia!

00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:55,880
Chu Xia.

3
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,890
Sorry for leaving without telling you.

4
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:00,900
Please believe

5
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,870
that we'll meet again.

6
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:07,480
And please don't blame the principal.

7
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,380
I'm leaving on my own initiative.

8
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,000
I've been here all these years.

9
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:17,260
I love it here.

10
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:23,250
So, I think I should
go out and have a look.

11
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:28,180
This is my resignation letter.

12
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,450
Please support me.

13
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:46,170
I'm very grateful to everyone.

14
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:50,550
Thanks for the wonderful time that
I had with all the students in Class B.

15
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:54,280
Thanks for the precious friendship.

[Episode 11]

18
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:41,810
Principal, we can't let it be.

19
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:43,880
Forget it.

20
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,420
Don't talk about it again.

21
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:50,350
An Chu Xia violated the school rules.

22
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,770
And she incited Class B to rebel.

23
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:57,480
She tried to challenge the school rules
and didn't respect you at all.

24
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,810
So called world-class artist.

25
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:04,050
Does he deserve it?

26
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:08,470
Forget it.

27
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:11,200
I just want to solve the fuss
now that You Tian has left.

28
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,390
So it's over.

29
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:30,800
Chu Xia.

30
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,750
You knocked your head
while taking a nap.

31
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:36,480
Are you having a bad luck?

32
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:40,010
Not only a bad luck,
my right eye lid is twitching.

33
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,610
Feel like something serious
is going to happen.

34
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:45,380
We're not even afraid of the principal.

35
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,800
Who else we're afraid of?

36
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,160
Hey, we have bad news.

37
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,010
-Ma Jian Guo's back.
-Ma Jian Guo's back?

38
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:00,300
Hurry.

39
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,210
Ma Jian Guo?

40
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:08,950
Ma Jian Guo's back?

41
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,570
Mr. Ma, are you okay?

42
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:33,690
An Chu Xia.

43
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:36,260
Remember me?

44
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,570
Long time no see.

45
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:40,600
Mr. Ma.

46
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,760
How are you?

47
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,310
I'm not so good because of you.

48
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:56,150
You've had a great time

49
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:59,370
when I was not around.

50
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,600
I tell you what.

51
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,820
From today on,

52
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,090
your wonderful time

53
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:09,140
is completely over.

54
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:15,540
Who's on duty today?

55
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,700
You didn't even arrange duty
when I was not around, huh?

56
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:29,290
Okay.

57
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:30,880
From today on,

58
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,270
the duty roster will be rescheduled.

59
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:39,190
Starting from An Chu Xia.

60
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:41,560
Stay here to clean the classroom.

61
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,170
Here you are.

62
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,490
What are you going to do
for your birthday this year?

63
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,310
It's the same every year.

64
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:01,540
Is there a special gift that you want?

65
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:03,270
Gift?

66
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:05,780
The sun is killing me.

67
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:08,030
I pick the gift myself every year.

68
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:09,640
Nothing that I want.

69
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:14,870
I'm wondering what
Chu Xia will prepare for you.

70
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:17,460
Well...

71
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:21,840
I guess she will prepare one.

72
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,940
She's now living
in my house for free.

73
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,940
She might feel ashamed
if she doesn't give me a gift.

74
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,160
Well, just forget it.

75
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:33,660
She has not much money.

76
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,040
I'll prepare for her.

77
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,430
Come on. She won't be starving
for buying a gift.

78
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:42,440
Moreover, your gift
is different from hers.

79
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:44,560
Don't always stand up for her.

80
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:49,870
She's having a hard life.
Can't you stop fooling her?

81
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,560
Let's go play.

82
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:05,960
Mr. Han.

83
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,460
What did you want to ask me?

84
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,490
Your birthday is coming soon.

85
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:16,310
Madam let me ask you if you have
any special requirement this year.

86
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:18,140
What gift do you want?

87
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,080
That's right.

88
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,720
My birthday is coming soon.

89
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,850
You all should buy me a gift.

90
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:27,560
Let me think what I want.

91
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:41,860
It's normal for her to buy me a birthday gift.

92
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,610
She doesn't have money?

93
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,690
Or she didn't hear it?

94
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,350
I don't need an expensive gift.

95
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:51,150
As long as you are sincere.

96
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,760
Master Han.

97
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:55,950
What's up?

98
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:57,460
Please lower your voice.

99
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:00,130
I'm tired now, I want to sleep.

100
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:07,140
No need to sleep so much when you're alive

101
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,430
as you will have plenty of time
to sleep when you die.

102
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,440
Young master.

103
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,990
You may invite
Ms. Chu Xia to your party.

104
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,770
I didn't say I want to invite her.

105
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:19,220
Busybody.

106
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:24,630
You wanted to invite
Ms. Chu Xia to your party,

107
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:27,530
but you couldn't say it
as you're afraid of losing face.

108
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,840
What did you say?

109
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,410
Young master.

110
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:34,290
I am asking if you are hungry.

111
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:37,250
No.

112
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:59,430
I thought you wanted to sleep
as you scolded me for making noise.

113
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:04,470
As you say, don't sleep
too much when we're alive.

114
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:07,390
It makes sense. So I didn't go to bed.

115
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:09,650
You bet I am always right.

116
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:11,880
What are you doing?

117
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,100
Writing a review.

118
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,170
The price of helping Mr. You Tian.

119
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:19,640
You should repent yourself.

120
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,220
Why did you write so much?

121
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:26,820
I wrote one for myself,

122
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,720
Ming Yue and Cai Xia.

123
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,950
And I'm writing one for Jian Ren now.

124
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,630
Didn't you want to sleep?

125
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,890
They can't write it.

126
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:38,050
Well, I didn't know until I wrote it.

127
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:39,550
I was shocked

128
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:42,120
that Class B's grades were so poor.

129
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,840
They don't even know
the simple English grammar.

130
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:49,380
We're going to take the exam soon.
I guess they'll fail in all the subjects.

131
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:01,120
-What is this?
-Money.

132
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:07,010
Master Han, you are so kind.

133
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,160
Wait a minute.

134
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,390
Why are you giving me
money at this hour?

135
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:16,710
Are you...

136
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:20,050
I won't do that!

137
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,700
Dirty mind.

138
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,580
Dirty people come with dirty mind.

139
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,390
I won't do that even if you pay me.

140
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:29,410
This is your salary.

141
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:34,360
Thank you.

142
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:38,340
But, this is too much.

143
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:44,370
Take the rest as the money for the ointment.

144
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:47,980
Where are you going?

145
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:50,100
Get the ointment for you.

146
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,000
Where is he?

147
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:08,140
Master Han's Birthday Party.

148
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:10,900
Sounds fun, I wish to go.

149
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,190
I wish to go.

150
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:17,520
I heard he only invited Class A
and those who are rich.

151
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,900
But we are...

152
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:22,650
We have Chu Xia.

153
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,060
Chu Xia.

154
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:29,190
Can you take me to the party?
Must be a lot of handsome guys there.

155
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:30,670
But I'm not going.

156
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:33,460
Come on, you're staying in his house.

157
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,390
I don't live in his party hall.

158
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:38,690
But you have an extraordinary
relationship with Master Han.

159
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,180
You mean I'm his maid, huh?

160
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,650
Today is my birthday.

161
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:00,290
I'd like to invite
more people this year.

162
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:03,430
-Everybody in Class B may join my party.
-Okay.

163
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,780
Thank you.

164
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,830
Happy birthday to you in advance.

165
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,500
I have something to do and I can't go.

166
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:16,700
What could be more important than my birthday?

167
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,020
I'm going to feed the cat.
And I made an appointment with a friend.

168
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:29,350
I don't want you to go.

169
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:32,260
But my mother does.

170
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,560
You should know her character.

171
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,740
Is it because you have no money?

172
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,700
Because you can't afford to buy a gift?

173
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:48,240
I gave you a tip last night.

174
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:52,970
-Master Han gave Chu Xia a tip last night.
-What is going on?

175
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,720
Master Han invited
An Chu Xia to his birth party.

176
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,530
They lived together.

177
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:58,810
Lived together?

178
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,920
Master Han and
An Chu Xia lived together.

179
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,470
And he gave her a lot of pocket money.

180
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:04,410
Really?

181
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:07,210
An Chu Xia becomes Mrs. Han now.

182
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:11,010
Last night, Master Han transferred
the unlimited credit card to her.

183
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:13,400
He confessed his love to her in Class B

184
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,660
and invited her friends
to join his birthday party.

185
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:18,890
Big news!

186
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:21,580
Master Han invites his fiancee,
An Chu Xia and her friends

187
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,090
to his birthday party.

188
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:26,190
He will announce
the wedding date on that day.

189
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:27,320
That's right.

190
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:31,640
Xin Wei, Master Han is going to marry
An Chu Xia. What should we do now?

191
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,760
Aren't you worried?
Quickly go to him now!

192
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,750
That's enough.

193
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,270
Xin Wei.

194
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:44,140
My birthday is very casual. It doesn't
matter whether you bring a gift or not.

195
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,730
As long as you come.

196
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:48,230
No need to bring a gift.

197
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:49,880
Right?

198
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:54,270
Right?

199
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,900
Right.

200
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,380
I don't care whether you come or not.

201
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:08,170
But my mother wants you to come.

202
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,680
So, please come.

203
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:14,090
I've never expected
that you are a filial son.

204
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,560
Are you coming?

205
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:21,170
Alright.

206
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,910
I'll go after feeding the cat.

207
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:28,350
Come earlier.

208
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,210
Don't let us wait too long.

209
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:32,970
No need to bring a gift. I'm serious!

210
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:35,100
Don't bring an expensive
one if you want to!

211
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,390
If you insist to do so,
let Han reimburse it!

212
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:39,480
I got it! Like a chatterbox.

213
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,410
Chatterbox?

214
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:47,200
She's getting more unruly.

215
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,310
What are you looking at?

216
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:55,130
Don't forget the party.

217
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:58,010
So he invited us to his party.

218
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,940
You have somewhere to go later?

219
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:14,070
Today is Master Han Qi Lu's birthday.

220
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:27,510
Who's this?

221
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,990
A mysterious man.

222
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:32,170
Although I don't know who he is,

223
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:35,970
but he always encourages me

224
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,380
when I need it the most.

225
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,980
Encouraged with a few words, huh?

226
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:45,010
When did you become so silly?

227
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:49,650
It takes real actions to treat someone well.

228
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:59,160
A good man won't hurt his beloved woman.

229
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,350
Alright.

230
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,950
I know you care about me.

231
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:07,080
We're buddies. You must care about me.

232
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:09,370
Yeah.

233
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:14,780
Our relationship... I will...

234
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,330
I want to know who you are.

235
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:19,410
Chu Xia, what are you thinking?

236
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:22,410
Nothing.

237
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:25,180
How are you recently?

238
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,370
So far so good.

239
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:31,200
The boss of the salon
is getting more stingy.

240
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:33,000
I've thought about it.

241
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:36,500
Working for others is
not a long-term solution.

242
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:38,190
I want to save some money

243
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,720
and rent a shop in the city

244
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,240
to open a salon with my friends.

245
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,270
I support you.

246
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,010
-Is that good?
-That's great.

247
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:47,140
By the way,

248
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:49,420
the clothes you designed were great.

249
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:52,060
-Of course.
-I sold several pieces in the store.

250
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:56,120
The customers wanted to buy the
clothes when they came for a haircut.

251
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,260
They don't even bargain.

252
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,040
-This is the profit.
-So much.

253
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,730
The clothes you designed

254
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,960
were sold at a high price.

255
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,460
Of course you earned a lot.

256
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,080
Take it.

257
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:10,130
No.

258
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:14,490
How can I spend women's money?

259
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:18,380
Take it. You want
to rent a shop, don't you?

260
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,620
I invest the money for your business.

261
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:22,730
Pay me back when you make money.

262
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:24,710
This is not free of charge.

263
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:27,410
You invest your skill
while I invest money.

264
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:31,050
So this is our business.

265
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,700
Well...

266
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,180
-Well...
-Come on.

267
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:38,030
Cut the crap.

268
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:40,060
Don't hesitate.

269
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,560
Keep the money.

270
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,460
Chu Xia.

271
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,490
-You have changed.
-Do I look more beautiful?

272
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:50,280
I feel like we're from

273
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:53,950
two different worlds now.

274
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:58,120
You are a good talker now.

275
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,740
Quite convincing.

276
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,410
Anyway,

277
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:06,010
no matter where I go,

278
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:12,050
I'm still the head of Cat Ears Lane.

279
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,390
-You think too much.
-Okay.

280
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:19,610
So, I'll take the money.

281
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:23,270
In the future, I'll look after my business
while you design clothes.

282
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:25,350
Let's make a fortune together!

283
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,300
Hello.

284
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:35,090
Okay, I'll be right back.

285
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,200
I'll go first.

286
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,590
-See you.
-See you.

287
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,880
-Bye.
-Bye

288
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,510
Can you make it on time?

289
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:04,010
Sure, believe me.

290
00:20:53,884 --> 00:20:56,151
"Where are you? Hurry up! - Qi Lu"
