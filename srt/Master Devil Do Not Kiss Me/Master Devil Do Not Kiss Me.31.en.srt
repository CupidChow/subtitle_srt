Stop following me!

2
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:24,670
Qi Lu.

3
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:27,060
Let's talk.

4
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:33,980
About what?

5
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:39,930
I feel that you have changed
after I came back here.

6
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:43,520
People always change.

7
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,180
But you didn't change for me.

8
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,550
Is that all you want to say?

9
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:55,380
Qi Lu.

10
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:57,640
I know you are angry.

11
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:00,310
You can get mad at me,

12
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:05,200
but please don't ignore me.

13
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,780
You left without saying a word.

14
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:11,160
Have you thought of my feeling?

15
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,050
But...

16
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:17,490
I told you I'd wait for you
no matter how long.

17
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:20,800
And I waited there like a fool.

18
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:24,660
I knew everyone was laughing at me,

19
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,060
but I believed you.

20
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,000
I believe you knew what
I was afraid of losing the most.

21
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:33,970
But what did you do?

22
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,550
Qi Lu.

23
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,950
I won't do that again.

24
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:49,240
Sorry.

25
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:53,160
The past is in the past.

26
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,470
No second time.

27
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:37,970
Help!

28
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:40,060
Help!

29
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,590
Is there anyone? Help!

30
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,120
Who's that?

31
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,970
Help! Is there anyone?

32
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:58,220
Anyone there?

33
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,230
I'm coming in.

34
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:17,920
Who's that?

35
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,090
Who's that?

36
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,460
Open the door!

37
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:22,890
Is there anyone?

38
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,880
Is there anyone?

[Master Devil Do Not Kiss Me S2]

[Episode 8]

41
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,780
Is there anyone?

42
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:04,640
Is there anyone?

43
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,060
You saw Chu Xia,
why didn't you tell them?

44
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:11,500
What did you say? I don't get you.

45
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:16,080
The reason is very simple.

46
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:19,660
You were kind enough as you
didn't kick her when she's down,

47
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,340
let alone giving her a hand.

48
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,720
So, are you happy when you see
An Chu Xia feeling helpless?

49
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,970
If you have nothing else, I'll go first.

50
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:29,930
Stop!

51
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:34,460
I just want to tell you.

52
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,990
In fact, An Chu Xia
is our common enemy.

53
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:40,500
From a certain perspective,

54
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,760
the two of us are in the same camp.

55
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:44,600
So?

56
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,620
So, we have to

57
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:48,400
kick An Chu Xia out of Stiland College

58
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,390
and Han's family.

59
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,830
Let her stay away from Qi Lu.

60
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:54,710
Then we can have a fair play.

61
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,610
What makes you laugh?

62
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:04,270
You are as stupid as you used to be.

63
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,180
How many times you
want to use the same trick?

64
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,550
Are you going to work with me?

65
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:15,340
The prerequisite is the two sides
are equal in strength.

66
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:16,770
And you

67
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,190
don't seem to be qualified.

68
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,020
Aren't you afraid that I'll tell Qi Lu?

69
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,860
You know better than I why An Chu Xia

70
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,880
was locked up there in the first place.

71
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:31,760
Go ahead if you want
to put yourself into trouble.

72
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,180
Where is Chu Xia?

73
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,950
I'm asking you. Where is Chu Xia?

74
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:47,100
I don't know.

75
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,330
She's gone when I did not notice.

76
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,390
I'll call her myself.

77
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:56,990
Sorry.

78
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:59,900
The number you have dialed
could not be reached.

79
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:01,300
I can't reach her!

80
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,380
Try to call her!

81
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,920
Would there be any bad guys?

82
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,580
How could you let her go out alone?

83
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,400
Ah!

84
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:11,020
Did you take good care of her?

85
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,540
Stop fighting!

86
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,220
Is it the time for fighting?

87
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,410
Just fight as you like
after we find Chu Xia.

88
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:18,850
Xiao Nan is right.

89
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:21,260
Let's split and look for her.

90
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,670
Xiao Nan, let's check the CCTV

91
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:25,980
in the monitoring room

92
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:37,650
Qi Lu.

93
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,540
I'll go with you.

94
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:41,300
No need.

95
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,560
No signal?

96
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:00,930
No battery.

97
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,530
Anyone knows I'm missing?

98
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:23,170
How is it?

99
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:27,020
We have checked the footage of CCTV.

100
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:30,130
Ms. An Chu Xia was last seen

101
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:31,830
near the artificial lake.

102
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,740
What?

103
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:34,940
Young Master Jiang.

104
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:37,940
As the resort is under renovation,

105
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:40,470
some of the equipment is not perfect.

106
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:44,140
And the monitor has not been
installed in some remote places.

107
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,460
What? Pardon!

108
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:49,000
Where's the manager?

109
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,720
Is there anyone to check it?

110
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,780
How can this happen
in Jiang's property?

111
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:58,320
Hey!

112
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,370
Why are you crying?

113
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,580
Hey!

114
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,590
Why are you crying?

115
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:06,090
Hey!

116
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,710
Stop crying.

117
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:15,050
Many people are looking at us.
They may think I am bullying you.

118
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:15,920
Stop crying.

119
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:19,280
Please.

120
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:23,440
If I hadn't been mad

121
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,740
and thrown a tantrum,

122
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,810
Chu Xia wouldn't have gone missing.

123
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,380
Don't say that.

124
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:31,100
It's related to me.

125
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,050
It's all your fault.

126
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:37,230
Do you really know how to like someone?
You're just...

127
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:38,420
Ouch! My hand!

128
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,440
Does it hurt?

129
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,030
Does it hurt?

130
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:54,180
-You fooled me!
-Are you still crying?

131
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:56,640
Let's go.

132
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,830
Let's look for her.

133
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:09,200
No!

134
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:14,490
I can't just sit and wait here.
I must find a way to get out.

135
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,160
Chu Xia!

136
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:41,780
It's me!

137
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,140
-Qi Lu?
-Why have you been locked up here?

138
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,790
I have no idea.
I thought someone needed help.

139
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,160
I was locked up as soon as I came in.

140
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,980
Wait, I'll get people right now.

141
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:00,800
No signal.

142
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:02,180
I've tried to call out.

143
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:04,180
Maybe it's too remote here.

144
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,500
Wait! Don't be afraid,
I'll be right back.

145
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,460
An Chu Xia!

146
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:11,240
Chu Xia!

147
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:13,740
Hello.

148
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:16,450
-We'll be right there.
-What's up?

149
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:18,930
Qi Lu found her locked up
in the hut behind the mountain.

150
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:20,700
Really? Let's go now.

151
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,220
-Where are you going?
-Qi Lu found Chu Xia. Come!

152
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,360
Chu Xia.

153
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:36,840
Yes.

154
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:42,550
You sound tired.

155
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:45,550
Is it?

156
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:51,210
It reminds me the place

157
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,200
I used to stay when I was young.

158
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,780
Not Cat Ears Lane,

159
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,770
but a place before that.

160
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,080
When I was young,

161
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:03,120
my mom and I often moved.

162
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,870
The house was small and broken.

163
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:11,340
And I used to live in the basement too.

164
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,120
Sometimes my mom
worked overtime at night.

165
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,680
I was afraid at home alone.

166
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:21,740
So,

167
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,480
you become a strong woman after that.

168
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:26,710
That's right.

169
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:28,860
Because I had to protect her.

170
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,200
You were trying to kick the door open.

171
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,820
Where did you get that genius idea?

172
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,860
I had to find a way out!

173
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:45,590
Otherwise,

174
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:48,030
what if no one notices me missing?

175
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:49,090
I will.

176
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:51,840
And I'm sure I'll find you!

177
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:54,610
Thank you, Han Qi Lu.

178
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,310
I am suddenly not so scared.

179
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:00,260
By the way,

180
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:04,120
sorry for yesterday.

181
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,310
I was full of myself.

182
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:09,210
It has nothing to do with you.
I did wrong too.

183
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:14,470
I just don't want

184
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:17,240
to see you being pressed by the past.

185
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:19,350
I  want to help you.

186
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,790
Thank you.

187
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:31,310
Over there.

188
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,110
They're coming.

189
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,930
Chu Xia, don't be afraid.

190
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:51,480
It is alright.

191
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:56,390
You are fine now.

192
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,910
Thank you.

193
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,760
Chu Xia.

194
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,650
We finally found you.

195
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:13,880
I'm sorry.

196
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,440
I shouldn't throw a tantrum.

197
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,330
Don't cry.

198
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,210
You owe me.

199
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:20,440
Buy me an ice-cream.

200
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:25,740
Let's go.

201
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,110
Wait for me.

202
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:30,020
Han Qi Lu.

203
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:33,580
I have a question.
Do you like An Chu Xia?

204
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:36,300
Do I need to answer you?

205
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:37,490
Okay.

206
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,790
I'm telling you.

207
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,320
I like Chu Xia.

208
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,340
And I am serious.

209
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:48,320
No matter what, I'm not going
to give her to anyone else!

210
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:05,980
Madam.

211
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:07,670
Both of them are back.

212
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,380
Here you are.

213
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:12,810
Did you enjoy it?

214
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:14,400
Anything to share with me?

215
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:17,280
Not bad. I'll go back to my room first.

216
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:22,880
-What's wrong with Chu Xia?
-Nothing.

217
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,850
She was locked up for an afternoon.

218
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,320
What do you mean?

219
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,240
Nothing.

220
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,840
I'm tired.
I go back to my room first.

221
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:35,130
Don't go! What's going on?

222
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:36,300
This is...

223
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:40,430
I... Did I miss anything?

224
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,840
What's going on?

225
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,650
I have no idea.

226
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,290
I feel like

227
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,240
it's not what you think!

228
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:51,310
It is not what I think?

229
00:15:58,590 --> 00:15:59,240
Han Yu.

230
00:15:59,240 --> 00:15:59,980
Have a seat.

231
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,710
-When did you come back?
-Just now.

232
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,510
How is it?

233
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:06,740
Is your hand alright?

234
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,860
I can even hit the tiger.

235
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:11,200
That's good.

236
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:13,710
But, my grandpa often
talked about you and

237
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,460
asked why you didn't visit him.

238
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,280
Many things happened and I forgot it.

239
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,710
Say sorry to him for me.

240
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:23,600
It's better that you tell him yourself.

241
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,180
What do you mean?

242
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,380
He holds a family dinner at home

243
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,290
for my recovery.

244
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:33,490
In fact, it's just me and my grandpa.

245
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,170
He wants to invite you.
The more the merrier.

246
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:38,650
Sure.

247
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,670
So I'll pick you up this weekend.

248
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:51,850
Here you are.

249
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,230
I just talked to Chu Xia.

250
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,200
Sure enough, An Chu Xia
is more important.

251
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,760
I heard Man Kui is back.

252
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,650
Yes.

253
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:09,560
What do you think?

254
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:15,340
What now? Even you are
trying to persuade me.

255
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,660
Three of us grew up together.

256
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:21,380
Man Kui left without telling us.

257
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,820
I know how deep she hurts you.

258
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,810
But I know her character.

259
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,600
She is not a bad person.

260
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,340
You both can't always be indifferent.
so I want to know what you think.

261
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,340
Is this important?

262
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:45,390
At least it could prevent some
innocent people from being harmed.

263
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:48,250
Like Chu Xia.

264
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,990
I hope you handle
your relationship with Man Kui.

265
00:17:56,550 --> 00:18:00,320
It shows that you still care about her

266
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:02,360
and can't forget the past!

267
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:06,300
You are torturing yourself.

268
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:14,020
I'll consider it.

269
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:32,960
Qi Lu.

270
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:35,340
Why are you here?

271
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:38,010
You don't look good

272
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,220
Are you sick?

273
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:40,200
No.

274
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,290
What are you doing?

275
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:45,340
Come with me.

276
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:00,764
How is she going?

277
00:19:00,789 --> 00:19:02,100
Her physical function is poor.

278
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:04,840
We can't do a
comprehensive check up here.

279
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,060
You'd better take her to the hospital.

280
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,400
-I'm fine.
-Typical words from my patients.

281
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:17,320
Give me the Stiland health card
to fill in the information.

282
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:18,950
I haven't got it yet.

283
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,170
Haven't got it yet?

284
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:22,560
-I'm just back from abroad.
-Come with me.

285
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:32,790
Qi Lu.

286
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:34,920
Thank you.

287
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:38,530
You're welcome.

288
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,160
I thought you wouldn't forgive me

289
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,900
even if I were dead.

290
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:47,920
Don't curse yourself.

291
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:52,500
It's time for class.

292
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:53,760
Good bye.
