1
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:18,100
He is

2
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:20,050
out of the woods for now.

3
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,570
But he needs to stay in the hospital for
observation for a while.

4
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,286
Before he leaves,

5
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:28,210
don't let anything affect him.

6
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:29,720
I'm going now.

7
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,640
Qi Lu.

8
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:52,960
Don't be sad.

9
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,830
Brother Liu will get better.

10
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:20,120
So such a huge matter
happened at the company?

11
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:23,280
No wonder Brother Liu never told me.

12
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,050
A project the company invested in failed,

13
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:28,370
it caused an issue with the capital chain.

14
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:32,250
The older and big stockholders
are in disagreement.

15
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,150
They want to withdraw their money.

16
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,820
Madam.

17
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:38,810
You should make an appearance at this time

18
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,420
and manage the
situation for the president.

19
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,666
Me?

20
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:45,590
Yes.

21
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:48,270
But I'm just a housewife.

22
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,216
I...

23
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,246
I don't know the stockholders.

24
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:53,790
I've only been to the
company a handful of times.

25
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:54,860
Er...

26
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,200
And he hasn't graduated yet.

27
00:01:58,850 --> 00:01:59,850
Oh.

28
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,460
Secretary Liu,

29
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,910
is there perhaps another way?

30
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:05,846
How about...

31
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:07,530
Young Master, you could do it.

32
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,130
Me?

33
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:14,240
Yes, Young Master.

34
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,046
You are 20 years old already.

35
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:18,000
You should be taking
on this responsibility.

36
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,530
The stockholders have watched you grow up.

37
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,240
They all like you a lot.

38
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,176
Moreover,

39
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:25,980
Stiland College is famous
for its business focus.

40
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,570
Sister Yuan Yuan...

41
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:31,750
I...

42
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,050
-I...
-Go.

43
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:08,176
=Master Devil Do Not Kiss Me S2=

44
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,100
=Episode 15=

45
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,950
Uncle Han.

46
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,640
Mom.

47
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,920
You have to hold on.

48
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:49,640
Live on.

49
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,640
I'm working hard every day.

50
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:56,360
I want to become the person I wish to be.

51
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:58,120
I beg you,

52
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:01,300
please live on.

53
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:05,030
Chu Xia.

54
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,610
Don't cry.

55
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,160
Your uncle and your mom will be fine.

56
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,496
What?

57
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,890
The Han family is in trouble?

58
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,716
To be precise,

59
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,290
the Han family is about to go bankrupt.

60
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:37,940
It's that serious?

61
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,246
I heard it from my dad.

62
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:43,290
I heard that the stockholders
are withdrawing their investments.

63
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:46,850
Han Qi Lu's dad was hospitalized
because of this matter.

64
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,300
No wonder Qi Lu didn't
come to school today.

65
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,710
What did you two do yesterday?

66
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,020
Is that any of your business?

67
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,650
Xiang Man Kui.

68
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:00,340
You shouldn't speak to me in that tone.

69
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:04,400
The only one who can help the Han family
now is our Jiang's Group.

70
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,836
My dad only needs to say one word

71
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,690
and he can help Han's
Group out of their crisis.

72
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:10,520
But you?

73
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,760
What can you do?

74
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,320
Yes.

75
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:14,850
I'm just a small character.

76
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,190
You do you.

77
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:18,100
Wait!

78
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,450
I don't like talking to people like you
who can't think clearly.

79
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:26,046
Alright.

80
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:28,510
Since I'm not important,
I'm a small character,

81
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,610
then let our partnership end here.

82
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:58,130
Those old guys are trying
to make it difficult for me.

83
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:00,296
Young Master.

84
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,666
They just think you're young and don't
understand business,

85
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,400
that's why they make
things difficult for you.

86
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,550
100 million?

87
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:10,280
Where am I gonna get
100 million in one week?

88
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:13,420
But that's the only solution right now.

89
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,350
Find a new partner to
help us over this crisis.

90
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,000
Then the stockholders won't want to
dissolve the partnership.

91
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,020
Hey, Sister Yuan.

92
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:55,250
Qi Lu.

93
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,420
I told Xiao Cui and the others to have
some days off and go home.

94
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:00,806
Old Han and I are
taking care of Brother Liu.

95
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:01,756
For the next few days,

96
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,280
take care of yourself.

97
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:04,980
Ok.

98
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,030
Bye bye.

99
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:14,960
Who is it?

100
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:21,440
A ghost!

101
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,240
You are a ghost.

102
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:28,400
An Chu Xia.

103
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:31,236
Why pretend you're a ghost
in the middle of the night?

104
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,456
Who's pretending to be a ghost?

105
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:34,970
The street lights here are broken, I
had to find a key to open the door.

106
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:38,520
What are you doing here?

107
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:42,516
I heard that someone is
alone at home and scared.

108
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,990
So I came to keep him company.

109
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:45,880
Tsk, who's scared?

110
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:47,046
You're wrong about that.

111
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:47,916
Go home.

112
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,836
-Go. Go home.
-Hey, what are you doing? I'm not leaving!

113
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,820
I'm not leaving! I'm not...

114
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:53,370
Alright.

115
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:54,840
Since you are intent on staying,

116
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,200
come in.

117
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:59,000
I wanted to spend some quiet days.

118
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:00,080
It's fine.

119
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:02,170
I lack a maid at home anyway.

120
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:03,910
Come in.

121
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:23,530
I can't let Chu Xia see you.

122
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:42,610
Still not going to bed?

123
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:44,446
Come here.

124
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:45,430
Let's talk.

125
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,480
Talk.

126
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,340
Sit closer.

127
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,950
Sit closer.

128
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:13,350
Do we have to sit this close?

129
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:14,810
Just say what you wanna say.

130
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:26,860
Chu Xia.

131
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,130
From now on,

132
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:36,860
no matter what problems we encounter,

133
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:38,616
we won't ever fight again,

134
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,540
ok?

135
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,260
Ok.

136
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:50,140
Why are you laughing?

137
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:52,070
I'm not.

138
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,360
I'm just happy...

139
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:56,650
to see you.

140
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,520
Thank you, Chu Xia.

141
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,290
Thank you for coming back.

142
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:13,690
Your heart is beating so fast.

143
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:18,440
It must be yours.

144
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,350
Oh, I think it is.

145
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:38,240
Is there a cat here?

146
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:40,530
No.

147
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,790
You must have heard wrong.

148
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:49,630
Meow.

149
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:51,320
Meow.

150
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:54,106
Actually I made that cat sound just now.

151
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,176
It's very similar, right?

152
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,210
Meow, meow.

153
00:11:58,130 --> 00:11:58,970
Really?

154
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:00,310
Yes, definitely.

155
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:02,400
Why would I lie about something like this?

156
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:03,380
Meow.

157
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:04,390
Meow.

158
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,210
Meow.

159
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:07,820
Meow.

160
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:09,456
I think you're too tired, Chu Xia.

161
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,616
You must be too tired.

162
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:11,896
You must have been busy all day.

163
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,096
Come on, quick, quick.

164
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:13,796
It's late.

165
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,916
Hurry and go sleep in your room.

166
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,666
Come, come.

167
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,910
You heard wrong. There were no cat sounds.

168
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,330
It was definitely a hallucination.

169
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,540
Meow.

170
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:35,610
Here comes a grand meal.

171
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,760
Dig in.

172
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:45,166
Let me check if dying by poison is covered
by my insurance.

173
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,090
Sit down!

174
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,720
Eat.

175
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:01,940
I'm eating.

176
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:09,746
It's good!

177
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,030
-Really?
-Yes!

178
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:12,320
Try it.

179
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,370
It's really good.

180
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:14,700
Here.

181
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:21,010
Is it good?

182
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,330
Han Qi Lu!

183
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:26,960
It's disgusting!

184
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:31,946
-Enjoy it.
-What the hell?

185
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:33,120
I'm going to school.

186
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,680
You make me eat this disgusting food?

187
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:39,806
Have you heard?

188
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:40,266
What is it?

189
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:43,700
Han Qi Lu's company is in trouble.
The stockholders are withdrawing.

190
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:44,746
What a surprise.

191
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:46,126
The Han family's gonna go bankrupt?

192
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:47,440
-Go bankrupt?
-Yes!

193
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:50,316
No way, Han Qi Lu's family
is gonna collapse like that?

194
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,716
No wonder they all say
that An Chu Xia is a jinx.

195
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,640
Whoever meets her is gonna have bad luck.

196
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,196
What a pity for Han Qi Lu.

197
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,516
He turned from a prince into a frog.

198
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,020
That's right.

199
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,840
What's going on with them?

200
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:11,890
Ignore them.

201
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:14,976
Chu Xia.

202
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:15,980
What is it, Xiao Nan?

203
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,720
Oh, nothing. I'm off.

204
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,010
Meng Xiao Nan!

205
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,320
What?

206
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:26,020
It wasn't nice of me last time.

207
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,340
I apologize.

208
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,190
I hope you won't take it to heart.

209
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:32,790
Oh.

210
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:35,260
Oh, it's fine.

211
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,300
We are all Chu Xia's friends.

212
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:38,616
That's right.

213
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,430
We should all be happy.

214
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,680
Let's go.

215
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,120
Let's talk.

216
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,180
About what?

217
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,840
Let's talk about our future.

218
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:10,400
What future?

219
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:13,930
I don't need you to worry about my future.

220
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:20,160
Do you really plan on giving up the
chance to save your family business?

221
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:22,700
Hm?

222
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,610
You

223
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,920
only need to be with me,

224
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:42,260
and I'll tell my dad

225
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:44,920
to help your family's business.

226
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:48,740
Really?

227
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,090
Of course.

228
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,750
It's a very easy feat

229
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,240
for my family.

230
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:58,470
Oh.

231
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:02,866
According to you,

232
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:04,890
if I give up on this chance today,

233
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,450
then I really am an idiot.

234
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:08,990
Right?

235
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,310
As long as you know that.

236
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:13,520
But now when I think about it,

237
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,440
our family backgrounds are similar,

238
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,920
we are a perfect match.

239
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:22,960
If the two big families...

240
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,420
become one, we'll have a promising future.

241
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,250
However,

242
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,430
love is something you don't have.

243
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,730
So save it.

244
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,800
Move.

245
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:49,316
Feng Shao!

246
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,950
Stop playing! Something huge happened!

247
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,656
What is it?

248
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,926
Han Qi Lu slept with Chu Xia!

249
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:54,850
What?

250
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:56,040
When did that happen?

251
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:57,566
In a few days.

252
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:57,966
Soon.

253
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:58,486
What...?

254
00:16:58,570 --> 00:16:59,596
What do you mean, in a few days?

255
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,260
Did he or did he not sleep with her?

256
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,560
Not yet.

257
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:03,916
Shit.

258
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,206
You scared the hell out of me.

259
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:06,380
Why say that when he didn't?

260
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:07,776
No, listen.

261
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:08,856
Listen to me,

262
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:11,946
Han Qi Lu's dad is in the hospital.
She and Han Qi Lu are alone at home.

263
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,466
It's only a matter of
time that it happens.

264
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:14,076
This won't do.

265
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,986
I can't watch Chu Xia
get fed to the wolves.

266
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:17,620
Hey, wait. I'm confused.

267
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,356
Isn't Chu Xia staying at the hotel?

268
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,556
Why did she move back in?

269
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,120
It's a long story.

270
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:26,276
Look, the sun will be
down in just a few hours.

271
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,166
Feng Shao, please help me.

272
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,146
Hey, don't. Don't.

273
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:30,176
Help me, help me please.

274
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,656
Help me, please.

275
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:32,696
-Let go of me.
-Help me!

276
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:33,216
Help me!

277
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,026
I'll help! I'll help you!

278
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:36,056
Let's go, let's go.

279
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,096
Lead the way!

280
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:37,606
Come.

281
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:38,880
-Lead the way!
-Let's go.

282
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:40,276
Let's go.

283
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:40,816
Let's go.

284
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:41,750
Let's go, let's go.

285
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:47,766
Oh, Old Han.

286
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:49,346
Didn't I tell you?

287
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:52,116
Old people shouldn't eat junk food.

288
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,560
It's bad for your health.

289
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:56,430
Oh,

290
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,490
old people

291
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:01,960
should live as they wish.

292
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:03,246
Ha ha.

293
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:05,030
The mister understands me.

294
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,350
Sometimes I think

295
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,760
that people

296
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,090
think too much,

297
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:15,100
ponder too much.

298
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,870
In the end,

299
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:20,130
not a lot of things happen as we wish.

300
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:22,530
A simple life

301
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,440
and a healthy amount of unrestraint

302
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,120
lead to more happiness.

303
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,106
Brother Liu.

304
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:31,026
I'd be so happy

305
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,940
if you can really think like that.

306
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,840
Oh right.

307
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,100
Where's Qi Lu?

308
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:39,900
Qi Lu and Chu Xia are at home.

309
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,960
When Chu Xia saw that you came to the
hospital, she moved back in.

310
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:44,156
Don't worry.

311
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,986
The children have grown up.

312
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:47,340
They are fine.

313
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,470
I'm so hungry.

314
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:58,430
Why does she take so
long to buy some soy sauce?

315
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,230
Idiot.

316
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:07,546
Hey, Feng Shao?

317
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:08,156
Chu Xia.

318
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,320
Let's go eat street
food tonight. My treat.

319
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,646
I'm not going.

320
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:13,266
I just bought some soy
sauce to cook at home.

321
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:15,606
Is that Han Qi Lu really ordering you
around like a maid?

322
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:17,096
No, he isn't. Talk to you later.

323
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,140
I'm hanging up. Bye.

324
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:24,026
I'm back!

325
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,090
You're back.

326
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:27,800
Chu Xia, you're back.

327
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,170
What are you doing here?

328
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,150
Oh,

329
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,576
Xiao Kui knew that we are alone today,

330
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:35,980
so she came to cook for us.

331
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,560
Do you need help?

332
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:42,596
-Oh, it's fine.
-Don't.

333
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,520
Er...

334
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:45,790
You should wait here with me.

335
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,280
Xiao Kui is a great cook.

336
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:48,950
Yeah.

337
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,380
I can do it by myself.

338
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:51,980
Give me the soy sauce.

339
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,420
I'm off.

340
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:02,426
Hey!

341
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:03,350
Where are you going?

342
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:05,500
Feng Shao asked me to go eat street food.

343
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,036
Since someone is cooking for you,

344
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,456
I'll go.

345
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,470
You're not allowed to go.

346
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,540
Come back.

347
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,230
You aren't going.

348
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:17,110
Why?

349
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,840
Because I say so.

350
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:20,520
Come, wait here with me.

351
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,680
I'll go see if I can help.

352
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:30,086
Can I help you?

353
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:31,210
Oh, it's fine.

354
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:32,530
You can wash the vegetables.

355
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:35,750
Chu Xia.

356
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:38,430
Are you still angry?

357
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,760
No.

358
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:45,290
Actually, I've always
wanted to be your friend.

359
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:49,160
When I see you with Xiao Nan,

360
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:51,210
I feel quite jealous.

361
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:56,830
What happened last time
made everyone quite unhappy.

362
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,040
Do you still misunderstand it?

363
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:03,980
Actually, I was at fault too.

364
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:08,070
So we can still be friends, can't we?

365
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:09,070
Yeah.

366
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:12,956
Oh, the water is boiling.

367
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:13,726
Oh.

368
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:14,650
I got this.

369
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:20,730
Are you ok?

370
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:22,770
It was too hot.

371
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:23,706
I'm fine, I'm fine.

372
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:24,630
What happened?

373
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,486
The water was too hot.

374
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:27,916
The lid slipped from her hand.

375
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:28,840
Where does it hurt?

376
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,450
I'm fine.

377
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:32,500
It slipped and I burnt my foot.

378
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,890
Come, let me help you.

379
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,380
I'm fine.

380
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:05,220
It's not hot.
