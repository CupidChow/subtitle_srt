1
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:17,760
Chu Xia.

2
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,090
Don't you want to consider
Jiang Chen Chuan?

3
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,880
I'd like to rely on my own.

4
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,600
I'm not talking about this.

5
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,610
What then?

6
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,310
Chu Xia.

7
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:36,950
Hi!

8
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:40,320
The best actress is coming.

9
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,310
Lower your voice.

10
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:43,390
Chu Xia.

11
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:44,200
Can I sit here?

12
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,180
Sure.

13
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:49,680
Chu Xia.

14
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:50,990
Thank you.

15
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:52,800
If it weren't for you,

16
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:56,300
I didn't know if Qi Lu
would talk to me in my life.

17
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:59,080
You don't have to thank me.

18
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:02,090
Sooner or later,
you two will still be together.

19
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,510
Chu Xia.

20
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,080
Are you free tonight?

21
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,480
I'd like to invite you to dinner.

22
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:09,110
Tonight...

23
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,190
She will do the homework at my house.

24
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,850
That's right.

25
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:14,910
I forgot it.

26
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:20,500
Alright, I'll have to
go alone with Qi Lu then.

27
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,240
Actually,

28
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:25,930
I haven't been alone
with Qi Lu for a long time

29
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,900
and I feel uneasy.

30
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,230
So I wanted you to go with me.

31
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:34,280
Meanwhile, I'd like to
thank you for helping me.

32
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,040
But...

33
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:42,170
I suddenly remember. My mom will
take me to my grandma's house tonight.

34
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,860
Let's do homework together next time.

35
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,270
Won't you take me along?

36
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:53,860
It's okay. There's still time
left until the class ends.

37
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,010
Think about it.

38
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,480
Well...

39
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:01,620
I'm off.

40
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,590
What's this?

41
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,540
The registration form
for the Youth Design Competition.

42
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:15,530
And it's wet.

43
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:20,170
Are you sure you want to
take part in this competition?

44
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,350
Yeah.

45
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,630
Well...I'm off.

46
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:30,610
It's all right, don't bother.
Get a new one from Ming Yue.

47
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,090
What?

48
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,460
Is that so complicated now?

49
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:40,050
Think about it.

50
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,720
I like Chu Xia.

51
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,640
An Chu Xia likes Han Qi Lu.

52
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:46,840
Han Qi Lu likes Xiang Man Kui.

53
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,750
Maybe Xiang Man Kui likes Han Qi Lu too.

54
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,110
And Han Qi Lu may like An Chu Xia.

55
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:55,510
Anyway, Chu Xia may not like me at all.

56
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:58,950
I am not even the co-lead.

57
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,290
Wait.

58
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,050
-There are only two men among them.
-Yeah.

59
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:05,850
Tell me.

60
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:10,720
How can I have a chance
to wipe out the leading man?

61
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:13,900
Young Master Jiang,
why are you so stupid?

62
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:15,370
Wait!

63
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:19,170
What's that?

64
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,100

Jiang's Group.

68
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,440
Chu Xia likes designing.

69
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,310
From what I know about her,

70
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:42,670
she will definitely
sign up for the competition.

71
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:46,950
Coincidentally, the competition
is organized by Jiang's Group.

72
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:50,780
So easy. I can ask my uncle to let
Chu Xia win behind the closed door.

73
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,890
Would Mo Xin Wei agree with it?

74
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,170
Moreover,

75
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:57,010
it is said that your uncle

76
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,120
held the competition

77
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,680
in order to send his daughter
to Pinkston Institute.

78
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,500
No...

79
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:05,530
Impossible.

80
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:06,910
My uncle won't do that.

81
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:08,830
But,

82
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,650
don't worry.

83
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,170
I'll help Chu Xia
clear all the obstacles.

84
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,020
That's good.

An Chu Xia!

88
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,150
What's up?

89
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:56,650
Why do you ignore me these days?
What makes you angry?

90
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,060
Well, I'm talking to you now.

91
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:58,970
What's up?

92
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:01,960
I just want to ask.

93
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,510
Will you go out to dinner
with me tonight?

94
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:05,880
Only two of us?

95
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:09,520
Xiang Man Kui will join too.

96
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,020
Enjoy yourselves.
Why do you bring me along?

97
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:14,810
Why are you getting mad?

98
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:15,540
Jealous?

99
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:18,780
Have you ever seen a light bulb jealous?

100
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,120
Light bulb? Who's the light bulb?

101
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,490
Han Qi Lu.

102
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:24,370
I am very happy

103
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:27,040
to see you two reconciled.

104
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,320
But, can you share the joy between you?

105
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,720
Don't share it with me.

106
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,320
If you want a candle light dinner,
just light up a candle.

107
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,740
Don't bring a light bulb along.

108
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:41,400
-Okay?
-Don't deny it, you are jealous.

109
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,420
Are you going to go with us?

110
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:47,410
Of course not.

111
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,920
-Why are you here again?
-Han Qi Lu.

112
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:55,950
Stop messing around if you are a man.

113
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,440
Be loyal to a woman.

114
00:07:58,170 --> 00:07:59,010
What an evil guy!

115
00:07:59,010 --> 00:07:59,950
What do you mean?

116
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,940
You should know it.

117
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:07,040
Bull shit.

118
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:12,730
-Chu Xia, are you going or not?
-Take me to your grandma's house.

119
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:13,690
Don't pretend.

120
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:14,820
I made it up.

121
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,010
You should know it.

122
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,500
I really don't understand you.

123
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,750
You don't want me
to stay with Han Qi Lu.

124
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,020
Why did you push me into the fire pit?

125
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,530
This is not a fire pit.

126
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:27,080
It is about the dignity of a woman.

127
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,440
Xiang Man Kui was trying to provoke you.

128
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:32,100
I don't want you to be
timid in front of her.

129
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:36,920
You didn't trust me when I disliked her.
Now you read her motive, don't you?

130
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:40,820
Listen to me. Go!

131
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,840
You have to demoralize her!

132
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:45,710
If you like Han Qi Lu,

133
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:48,640
today will be the first
round in the battle.

134
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,660
I didn't say...

135
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:50,680
An Chu Xia.

136
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,120
Get into the car.

137
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:54,880
No!

138
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,060
Why are you so rude?
Open the door for me.

139
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:25,700
That's right.

140
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:28,260
Bull shit!

141
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,440
Oh, my God!

142
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,570
Jiang Chen Chuan.

143
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:33,720
Why do you keep appearing from nowhere today.

144
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,640
You should have stopped Chu Xia.

145
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:38,950
What's up?

146
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:40,540
Are you jealous?

147
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:44,260
I had a bad feeling about it.

148
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:49,280
You've been so weird recently.

149
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,110
There's one more.

150
00:09:58,730 --> 00:09:59,680
Thank you.

151
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,610
You eat first.

152
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:08,070
Qi Lu, I'm not hungry.
You eat first.

153
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,310
You two eat first.

154
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:16,510
I ate too much at noon

155
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:17,640
and I'm still full.

156
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,950
Oh yeah, Qi Lu.

157
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:26,650
Remember you always
laugh at me for not taking chili?

158
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,950
I was just kidding. Don't take it seriously.

159
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:35,770
Thank you for remembering that
I like the spicy noodle here.

160
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:41,340
It was not so long ago. You only left
for one and a half year.

161
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:44,380
Qi Lu.

162
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:48,920
There's oil on your mouth. Wipe it.

163
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:52,040
There.

164
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,010
Stupid! Let me help you.

165
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,230
Here.

166
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,640
-I've had enough. See you.
-Sit down.

167
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:14,080
Sit down.

168
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,240
I've had enough.

169
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,060
I'm not finished yet.
We'll go home together.

00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,810
Qi Lu.

171
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:29,310
We kept on chatting
and left Chu Xia in the cold.

172
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,370
Chu Xia.

173
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:31,690
Don't be angry with me.

174
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:34,840
No, I want to thank you
for inviting me to dinner.

175
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:38,210
Today, there are two things
we're going to celebrate.

176
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:39,780
First,

177
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:40,850
I want to thank you.

178
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:44,820
Second, I want to celebrate that
Qi Lu and I are reconciled.

179
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,130
That's right.

180
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:48,810
I'm happy today.

181
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:50,100
Let's drink together.

182
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,080
Cheers!

183
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,250
Cheers!

184
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:03,300
Why are you drinking so fast?

185
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:06,380
I won't take you back to your room
if you get drunk later.

186
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:10,300
Chu Xia.

187
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:13,020
Did you hand in the registration form?

188
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,410
Registration form?

189
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:17,120
Yes, I've submitted it.

190
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:18,880
What form?

191
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,930
The registration form for
the Youth Designer Competition.

192
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:24,990
Time flies.

193
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:27,230
It's the time again.

194
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,830
I wonder who is so lucky

195
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,240
to be able to study
at Pinkston this year.

196
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:35,250
Chu Xia.

197
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,580
Good luck to you.

198
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:38,750
Thank you.

199
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:03,820
-Thank you for sending me home.
-You are welcome.

200
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:06,240
Chu Xia, see you tomorrow.

201
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,420
Bye.

202
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:09,270
I'm off.

203
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:10,050
Be careful.

204
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:11,210
Bye.

205
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,270
Bye.

206
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,210
Sit at the back.

207
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,600
No!

208
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,550
Sit at the back.

209
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,650
No!

210
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:39,150
Sit at the back.

211
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,060
No!

212
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:49,930
According to scientific analysis, your
position now is the most dangerous one.

213
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:52,650
It means you'll be
in danger at any time.

214
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:55,200
Sis Yuan Yuan won't let me off
if you are in danger.

215
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,480
And she will take away
my astronomical telescope.

216
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,810
If she takes it away, I'll give you

217
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:00,100
-a hard time!
-Shut up!

218
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:07,370
Where are you going?

219
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:08,740
Where are you going?

220
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:13,950
-Don't you want the money?
-You've talked too much!

221
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:15,760
What are you doing?

222
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:17,890
Walk back!

223
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:21,070
Are you crazy?

224
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:22,730
Why do we need to walk?

225
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,020
Take a cab.

226
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:27,870
Why do we need to walk
since there're cabs? Are you sick?

227
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:30,430
You don't have to lose
your weight in this way!

228
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:31,150
Let's go.

229
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:32,930
Hurry!

230
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,120
Sir, please stop here.

231
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,500
Why did you let the driver go?

232
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,570
-Don't you want to go home?
-No.

233
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:14,740
What's wrong with you?

234
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:18,680
I've been your light bulb as you wish.

235
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:20,970
But you are still unhappy, huh?

236
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,460
I don't like who you are now

237
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,580
and even the current me.

238
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,020
Let's draw a line between us later.

239
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,160
Hey!

240
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:34,310
Let me go! I'm going home to sleep.

241
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:40,150
You want to draw a line?

242
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:40,730
Yes.

243
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:44,130
So you took part in
the stupid design contest.

244
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,660
You want to win

245
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,020
and go to France.

246
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,730
So that you can break up
with me forever, huh?

247
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:50,640
No...

248
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,750
Does the competition
have anything to do with what I've said?

249
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,240
Don't jump to another topic.

250
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,100
Look at me

251
00:15:58,310 --> 00:15:59,010
and tell me.

252
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:00,280
Is that right?

253
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:02,200
Say something!

254
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:03,570
I...

255
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,370
Han Qi Lu.

256
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:15,580
I'm sleepy.

257
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:16,300
Let's go home.

258
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,690
I'm sorry, Qi Lu.

259
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:45,730
Can't you stay for me?

260
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:51,820
I've always been dreaming
to study at Pinkston Institute.

261
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,690
It's not easy for me to be the champion.

262
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,680
I can't give up the opportunity.

263
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,310
Can you understand me?

264
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:07,170
Don't leave me.

265
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:08,960
Please...

266
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,570
I'm sorry, Qi Lu.

267
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:41,900
Class.

268
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:42,940
Come on.

269
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:46,620
These are the entry passes
of the Youth Design Competition.

270
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:49,250
Come and get the pass
when I call your name.

271
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,380
Ming Yue.

272
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:53,710
Thank you, sir.

273
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:54,970
Cai Xia.

274
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,060
Wang Jian Ren.

275
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:57,880
Yes.

276
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,330
Here I am.

277
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,460
Alright.

278
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,720
Good luck to all the participants.

279
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,380
Go for it!

280
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:05,950
Alright?

281
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:08,190
You will get good results
if you work hard.

282
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:09,350
Sir!

283
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,070
Where's my entry pass?

284
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:12,520
You signed up too?

285
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,780
I submitted the form yesterday.
You can ask Ming Yue.

286
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:18,338
I can prove it.
Her form was wet yesterday

287
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:20,164
and she asked me to get another one.

288
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,310
So strange.

289
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:27,180
I submitted it to the Pinkston system
according to the form you've handed in.

290
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,740
The system will not go wrong.

291
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:34,160
Would it be someone threw
away your registration form?

292
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,400
Who would do that?

293
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,450
Who else?

294
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:45,470
Xiao Nan.

295
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,500
Mo Xin Wei.

296
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:54,430
What makes you so fierce?

297
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:56,700
Want to scare away the ghosts, huh?

298
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,690
Let's go, Xiao Nan.

299
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:59,160
Leave it to me.

300
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:02,730
She has to admit it
as she dared to play such a trick.

301
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:06,970
-What did I do?
-You stole Chu Xia registration form

302
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:09,670
to stop her from joining
the contest. Stop pretending!

303
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:12,340
You're jealous of her talent.

304
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:16,440
She has only informal skill,
why should I be jealous of her?

305
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,560
And what makes you say
I stole her registration form?

306
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,350
Mo Xin Wei.

307
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:24,540
We know that your father held
the competition for your sake.

308
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:27,850
But you shouldn't take away
people's opportunity to join it.

309
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,760
Why?

310
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,730
Are you afraid that people can't
be convinced with your winning?

311
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:35,110
That's why you wipe the opponents out!

312
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:36,210
Don't argue with her.

313
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:36,860
No point.

314
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:40,050
I'm not going to take part anyway.

315
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:43,700
Wait a moment.

316
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:49,190
Don't think you can escape easily
after insulting me.

317
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:51,830
I haven't finished yet.

318
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:53,040
What do you want?

319
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:02,270
Hurry up! Look for it!

320
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:04,340
In the books and drawers.

321
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:06,520
-Or pencil case.
-Nothing.

322
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:09,870
Maybe it's in the book.

323
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:10,790
Look for it!

324
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:12,190
Nothing's under the table.

325
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,350
I've looked around.

326
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:15,900
I don't know what else to do.

327
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,300
What's the point of finding it now?

328
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:20,200
How could it be?

329
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,210
Found nothing here.

330
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:23,710
Could it be here?

331
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:25,900
What now?

332
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,080
Oh! Xin Wei!

333
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,510
I found it!

334
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,680
Xin Wei, look at it.

335
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:41,610
I was so surprised that you stole
An Chu Xia's registration form.

336
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,900
I was framed!

337
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,310
I didn't steal it.

338
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,530
We have the concrete evidence.
What else you want to say?

339
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,700
I have never expected you'd do it.

340
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:58,040
You were the champion last year, right?

341
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,970
You are even a design genius.

342
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:02,960
Why did you do that to An Chu Xia?

343
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:05,320
Chu Xia.

344
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,570
You believe me, don't you?

345
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,730
I didn't steal it.

346
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:17,640
So no one believes me here, huh?

347
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,310
I don't know.

348
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,100
I believe you.
