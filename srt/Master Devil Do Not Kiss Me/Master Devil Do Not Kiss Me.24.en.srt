00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:15,340
Chu Xia officially decided to take
part in the Campus Beauty Contest

2
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:17,580
and declare war on Mo Xin Wei!

3
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,550
I want to play with this!

4
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:05,180
Don't mention it. It's all because
of the Campus Beauty Contest.

5
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,340
Now I'll officially announce

6
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:10,380
the final of the Campus Beauty Contest
officially begins.

7
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,940
I'm going to let everyone
see your true colour.

8
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:23,410
Who did it?

9
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:27,240
Where is my dress?
Xiao Nan, did you see my dress?

10
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,310
Is this your dress?

11
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:31,590
Young Master Ling.

12
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:34,280
Master wants to see you.

13
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,860
Do you remember
you sang the Little Star?

14
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,280
I like you.

15
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,080
Chu Xia, I like you.

16
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,870
Chu Xia.

17
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:51,980
I like you.

18
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:55,560
That's not what I'm trying to say.
I'd like to tell you...

19
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,940
Are you looking for your father?

20
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,990
Where are you? I'm outside the hall.

21
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,080
Tell me where my father is.

22
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:33,410
Chu Xia.

23
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:35,030
I like you.

24
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,530
Chu Xia, I...

25
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:38,820
I hope you can...

26
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:49,920
What are you doing here?

27
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,650
Eavesdropping on your confession.

28
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,540
Chu Xia.

29
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,820
-Help!
-Don't move!

30
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:15,100
Help!

31
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,710
Chu Xia?

32
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,530
Stop the car.

[Episode 1]

35
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:58,120
Young master, are you okay?

36
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,610
Help me get up.

37
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:01,540
I can't move my arm.

38
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:03,600
What?

39
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:06,350
-Come on!
-Cut it out!

40
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,560
Chu Xia was kidnapped.
Come with me now!

41
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,410
Kidnapped?

42
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:13,710
Qi Lu!

43
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:21,514
All the judges unanimously
decided to disqualify An Chu Xia

44
00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:24,534
from the contest because
she left without permission.

45
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:30,520
-Where is she?
-Where shall we look for her?

46
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:34,419
Han Yu said, An Chu Xia was
kidnapped by a silver commercial car

47
00:05:34,444 --> 00:05:38,054
with the plate number ending with 87
heading to Hong Yun Street.

48
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:44,580
-Hello.
-Feng Shao.

49
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,210
Something happened to Chu Xia.

50
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,460
Chu Xia, wait for me.

51
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:06,830
Help!

52
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:09,010
Are you crazy?
Haven't you taken the medicine?

53
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:11,640
Quickly untie me! Insane!
I'll tell you what!

54
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,494
I am not an ordinary person.

55
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:16,220
I'm the head of the
gang in Cat Ears Lane.

56
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,760
Is there anyone?

57
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,480
Hey!

58
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,350
Xin Wei.

59
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:38,300
Now An Chu Xia has gone,
you'll definitely be the champion.

60
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:41,270
I'll be the champion too even if she's here.

61
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,020
That's why she was scared
and left all of a sudden.

62
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,900
What should we do now?

63
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:08,700
Find a silver commercial car
with the plate number ending with 87.

64
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:12,110
Then we will be able
to find Chu Xia's location.

65
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,020
Okay, come with me!

66
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:15,140
-Let's go.
-Move.

67
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,680
Gao Gan?

68
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,020
Surprised?

69
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,280
Where is my father?

70
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,690
How do I know?

71
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,300
You fooled me?

72
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:05,020
You kidnapped me and committed a crime!
Are you crazy?

73
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,380
Untie me!

74
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:11,860
Do you think I'm kidding with you?

75
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,140
Duh!

76
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,200
I'll tell you what!

77
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,860
I did kidnap you!

78
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,910
This is what Han Qi Lu owed me!

79
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:26,340
I'll get even with him today!

80
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:38,410
What?

81
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:40,270
Han Qi Lu owed you?

82
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,180
Do you have a big feud with him?

83
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,010
You bet!

84
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,300
Xiao Xue was expelled
because of Han Qi Lu.

85
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,300
She was unconscious.

86
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:07,000
It's not easy for her to be healed.
But now she wants to leave me.

87
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:10,620
I stayed with her all day

88
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,500
until she was recovered.

89
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:18,890
It is me who is guarding her.

90
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:25,180
In the end, she said she
couldn't forget Han Qi Lu.

91
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,860
Everybody knows Han Qi Lu and you
have an uncommon relationship.

92
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:32,110
If I hadn't kidnapped you,
he would not come here.

93
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,510
I found the vehicle!

94
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:40,620
Hurry! I found the vehicle!

95
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,990
Is this correct?

96
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:47,200
We've searched all over,
but no one's here.

97
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,680
"Come to Warehouse C alone ,
she's there. Or you will regret it"

98
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:02,680
You and Meng Xiao Nan
go to Warehouse A.

99
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:05,440
Feng Shao goes to Warehouse B
and I go to Warehouse C.

100
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,880
Alright, let's go.

101
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,690
Let's move.

102
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:32,720
You are an idiot!

103
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,750
Gao Gan kidnapped me because of
Xiao Xue. Why did you come?

104
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:40,480
You shouldn't come, he won't hurt me.

105
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,590
Idiot!

106
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:45,590
Han Qi Lu!

107
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:49,150
Bastard!

108
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:51,330
Han Qi Lu! Don't go!

109
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:53,920
Wait here.

110
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:32,070
Come on.

111
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:38,000
-You have the nerve, huh?
-Huh?

112
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,200
Let her go.

113
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,650
Let her go!

114
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:49,830
You always act like
a hero in front of women.

115
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:53,850
No wonder Xiao Xue was obsessed with you.

116
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:02,190
Xiao Xue has nothing to do with me.

117
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,750
If you hate me because of her,

118
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:10,430
you can do whatever you want to.

119
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,340
Let go of my woman.

120
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,460
Your woman?

121
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,110
Do you think the whole world is in love with you?

122
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,040
I can let her go.

123
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,880
But I want you to
break one of your legs.

124
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,600
Will you let her go
after I break my leg?

125
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,260
Yes.

126
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,360
Alright.

127
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,510
Gao Gan, stop it!

128
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,100
You outnumber him. How is that fair?

129
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,820
Aren't you jealous of Han Qi Lu?

130
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:48,770
He is smarter, more handsome
and even richer than you!

131
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:49,640
Beat him up!

132
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,950
He is smarter, more handsome than you!

133
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:55,540
His family is richer than yours.

134
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,750
-Ah!
-Shut up!

135
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:18,640
Stop it!

136
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:19,850
Stop it!

137
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:29,300
Now, your leg is mine.

138
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:33,700
Stop it!

139
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,840
I was wondering
who was the kidnapper.

140
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,440
It's you.

141
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,500
How did you come in?

142
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:54,320
The two scraps outside
were knocked down.

143
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,450
Just the few of you, huh?

144
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:01,630
Damn it!

145
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:03,480
-Beat them up!
-Wait a moment.

146
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,470
Listen to the sound out there.

147
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:37,020
Now I'll announce the champion
of the 28th Campus Beauty Contest is

148
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,710
Mo Xin Wei.

149
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:54,040
-Congratulation!
-Thank you.

150
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,670
I'll tell you what...

151
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,300
Talk to you later.

152
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,100
An Chu Xia left suddenly
because she was kidnapped.

153
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,770
And she was kidnapped by Gao Gan.

154
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:09,200
How did you know?

155
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,970
Because the police
are outside the college.

156
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:13,870
But, Gao Gan has run away.

157
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:20,060
Well...

158
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:22,720
Xin Wei.

159
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,020
It hurts.

160
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,480
Go easy.

161
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:32,900
I'm sorry.

162
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:34,300
I'll be more gentle.

163
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,510
Does it hurt?

164
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,740
It's fine.

165
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:38,570
Just go on.

166
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:45,080
What's wrong?

167
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:47,810
Qi Lu.

168
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,140
I'm sorry.

169
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:51,340
That was my personal feud with him.

170
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,300
It was me who put you into trouble
and made you lose the contest.

171
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,210
How come you speak softly today?

172
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,940
I'm not used to it.

173
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:43,040
Chu Xia.

174
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:47,480
Let's not be friends after this.

175
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,010
Let's be lovers.

176
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:00,130
Chu Xia.

177
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,250
Be my girlfriend.

178
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:21,350
Hello.

179
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:24,460
It's me.

180
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,820
It has nothing to do with you.

181
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:38,720
I'm not interested in it.

182
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:44,460
It's getting late, I'm going to bed.

183
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,320
Who's that?

184
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:59,700
Just a harassing call.

185
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:16,300
Time flies.

186
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,820
We both graduated
from high school in a flash.

187
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:24,950
Do you think we will
study in the same university?

188
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,190
Sure.

189
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:29,470
Think about it.

190
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,850
We'll be on a foundation
course for two years

191
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,700
and go to the British
headquarter together.

192
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,930
We'll be together for a life time.

193
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,010
And I'll give you a starry wedding.

194
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,460
It's late now.

195
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:04,770
You have to go to bed.

196
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,340
I'm off.

197
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:12,920
Hey!

198
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,640
Don't forget, you haven't
replied to me yet.
