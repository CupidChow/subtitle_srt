1
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:13,630
So you are not going to pay?

2
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,590
Feng Shao, who are they?

3
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,170
It's okay, they are my friends.

4
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:21,130
Go back with your friends first.

5
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:22,780
Bullshit!

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,810
I know all of your friends.

7
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:27,970
Hey! Your friend owes me money.

8
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:29,580
Why don't you pay for him?

9
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,300
Was he injured by you?

10
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,210
Yeah, so what?

11
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,560
You are so bold.

12
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,570
You want to stand up for him, huh?

13
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,870
Behave yourself and speak nicely.

14
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:44,720
Beat them!

15
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,270
Beat them!

16
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,810
They're fighting. Hurry!

17
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:51,960
Steamed lobster, huh?

18
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,390
What about spicy lobster?

19
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:54,780
Girls, go first.

20
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,890
Just leave it to us.

21
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:58,660
Leave it to the guys.

22
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:00,570
Let's go.

23
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,680
Sorry to trouble you guys.

24
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:07,310
I'm just exercising after dinner.

25
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,990
I owe you a bottle of beer.

26
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,550
Not bad.

27
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,190
It's easier than chopping a plank.

28
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:02,760
Just not a gentleman way.

29
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:11,200
It seems a long war.

30
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:22,710
What say you?

31
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:25,580
Considering our combat capacity
and number of men...

32
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,440
Run!

[Episode 5]

35
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,320
Be gentle.

36
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:35,480
Don't move.

37
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,720
I...

38
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,780
I'm looking for my earring.

39
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:48,650
My earring just fell here.

40
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:50,830
I can't find it.

41
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,940
It doesn't seem safe at home.

42
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,620
You guys must be careful.

43
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,280
Be gentle.

44
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:05,500
Don't move.

45
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,320
An Chu Xia.

46
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,300
You'll cause more problems

47
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,700
if you continue to stay here.

48
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:17,490
So,...

49
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,660
I'll find a house and move out.

50
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:22,580
As long as you let me finish
my study in Stiland College.

51
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:26,140
Sure, as long as you're
willing to leave my house,

52
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,310
you can continue your
study in Stiland College.

53
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:32,060
Thank you.

54
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:35,310
I'm sorry to have troubled you.

55
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:39,290
I'm off then.

56
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:06,490
Why don't you get in there?

57
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,410
I'm waiting for Xiao Nan.

58
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,650
I left in a hurry yesterday.

59
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:12,560
Then I found out that
I didn't have your phone.

60
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,630
I'm just fine.

61
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:15,710
Don't take it to heart.

62
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,570
I'm sorry to have troubled you.

63
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:21,630
We're friends, don't mention it.

64
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,660
-Why are you looking for Xiao Nan?
-Nothing.

65
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,910
Really?

66
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:34,300
Alright, I'm still an
outsider in your heart.

67
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:38,990
I am looking for a house.

68
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:41,160
Not happy staying at Han's mansion?

69
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,930
No, Sis Yuan Yuan is good to me.

70
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:47,880
But it's not a long-term solution .

71
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:50,590
I understand it.

72
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:53,870
Do you have class this afternoon?

73
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:58,390
-Only the first and second class.
-The first and second class.

74
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,750
Alright. I'll show you the house
after the second class's over.

75
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,710
No need. I always give you trouble.

76
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:07,610
And I can't afford to repay it.

77
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:11,330
Pay it back when you can afford it.

78
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:12,300
I'm off.

79
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,630
It is my grandma's house.

80
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:30,070
She used to be a teacher of
fashion designing in our school.

81
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,950
It's not far from the school,
so you can walk.

82
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:43,370
This is a good choice for you.

83
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,820
Is your home far from school?

84
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:48,530
How could she have a house here?

85
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:52,950
Not far, but my grandfather
was bad tempered.

86
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:55,910
And my grandma was stubborn.
They used to fight a lot.

87
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:58,470
So my grandma moved out of the house

88
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:01,400
until my grandpa coaxed her back.

89
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:08,450
It was left by my grandma too.

90
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,870
After she's gone,

91
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,070
the house is empty.

92
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:17,700
My grandpa used to send people
to clean it. So it's still clean.

93
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:22,120
But nobody uses it now.

94
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,270
It will be okay after getting some oil.

95
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,360
You know how to use it?

96
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,930
My parents used to study in Stiland College.

97
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:35,870
My mother is an excellent designer.

98
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:37,760
But at last...

99
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:44,330
I love it very much. How much is
the rental? Can you rent it to me?

100
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:49,220
Just move in, I just
have to tell my grandpa.

101
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:52,470
But, you live in Han's mansion now.

102
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:55,940
Do you have to inform
Aunt Han before moving out?

103
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:58,380
I'll tell her tonight.

104
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:03,250
You're so nice to me.

105
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:07,520
I don't even know how to repay you.

106
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,980
I'll give you a suggestion.

107
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:14,200
As long as it's not giving myself to you.

108
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:16,390
Alright then.

109
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:18,550
I was to take the chance
to confess my feeling to you.

110
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:26,510
Well. Tomorrow is weekend.

111
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:29,350
-Why don't you go out with me?
-Where?

112
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:31,570
Don't ask.

113
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:35,150
You said it, you can do everything
as long as not giving yourself to me.

114
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:40,660
Alright, I'll do whatever you say.

115
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:45,310
There are notes and drawings
left by my grandmother.

116
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,450
You can look at it.

117
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,590
If you keep being so nice to me,
I might give myself to you.

118
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,760
I'll work harder.

119
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,710
Let's go.

120
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,190
Let's go.

121
00:09:58,870 --> 00:09:59,580
Let's go.

122
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,560
No way, I disagreed.

123
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,020
I can't let you go.

124
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,870
Did Qi Lu the bastard make you angry?

125
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,660
If you want to scold or beat him,

126
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:20,370
I'll help you, but please don't go.

127
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:25,540
Who are you if I'm a bastard?

128
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,200
I just want Chu Xia to stay here.

129
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:32,050
Think about it.

130
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:34,460
My husband is resting abroad.

131
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:37,880
He never sees you and thanks you.

132
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:41,970
If you go now, he'll divorce me
after he comes home.

133
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:43,870
He dares not.

134
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:45,100
Don't interrupt!

135
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,360
Chu Xia.

136
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:54,300
What about this?
Why don't you wait until

137
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:58,830
my husband comes back
and expresses his gratituded?

138
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:01,180
-You are trying to delay it.
-Shut up!

139
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,210
No, I was thinking...

140
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:06,480
Good, it's decided.

141
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,040
Dismiss.

142
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:12,640
Ms. Chu Xia, young master, good night.

143
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,260
I tell you.

144
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:27,050
you must leave soon
after my dad comes back.

145
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,240
I'll leave here.

146
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,100
Chu Xia.

147
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:57,850
Go away!

148
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:01,340
-Let's go.
-Wait.

149
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:03,050
I'm waiting for someone.

150
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:05,830
You mean him?

151
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:08,560
Let's go.

152
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,110
Where are we going now?

153
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:23,250
Can you tell?

154
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,460
Don't worry.

155
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,260
We won't sell you.

156
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:28,420
As no one's going to buy it.

157
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,090
Shut up!

158
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:31,790
Don't listen if you don't like it.

159
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:38,570
I'm who I am.

160
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:43,020
It's a firework of different colors.

161
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:45,490
Why did you bring her along?

162
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:49,440
I don't want to be alone with you.

163
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:54,140
Come on.

164
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:58,060
-Enjoy the last bit of time living with Chu Xia.
-That's not enjoy, but endure!

165
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,550
The sky is high and the sea is wide

166
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:07,520
To be the strongest bubble.

167
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,690
I have to clean my ears
due to the sound pollution.

168
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:16,440
You don't know how to appreciate.

169
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,860
It was a killing voice.

170
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:20,220
Han Qi Lu!

171
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,650
We seldom come out together.

172
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:24,110
Stop fighting like roosters.

173
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:25,970
He's talking about you.

174
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:31,580
It's so beautiful here.

175
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,980
We seldom come out, so
we must choose the best place.

176
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,220
What are you doing?

177
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:59,050
Stop it!

178
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,000
Focus here!

179
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,560
Han Qi Lu!

180
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,150
Thank you.

181
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:44,890
Delicious.

182
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:57,660
I haven't been so happy for a long time.

183
00:14:58,170 --> 00:14:59,400
I'm happy too.

184
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,570
I'm happy to stay with you

185
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:03,060
during this period.

186
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,040
Your nose will grow longer if you cheat.

187
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:10,750
Haven't you seen Pinocchio?

188
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,680
It's so nice here.

189
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,320
Fresh air, free of haze

190
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,750
and there are stars. Look!

191
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,980
Qi Lu! Look!

192
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:28,480
That star is so bright.

193
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:31,140
That's Sirius.

194
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:33,610
Sirius is the brightest star.

195
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:36,660
The second brightest is Old Man Star.

196
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:39,380
Besides the sun,

197
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:41,800
the closest star to Earth
is Proxima Centauri.

198
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,360
It takes 422 million light-years
for its light to reach Earth.

199
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,720
Master Han.

200
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:51,130
-Don't be a wet blanket.
-Don't be a wet blanket.

201
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,140
Never eager to learn.

202
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,180
Only you are knowledgeable, huh?

203
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:04,980
Among the stars and planets in the sky.

204
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:07,860
I'll salute you if you can name

205
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,550
any one of them.

206
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:13,350
Do you know that?

207
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:16,250
Say it.

208
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:18,840
Chain Stars.

209
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:24,590
Chain stars are far from Earth.

210
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:26,430
Even farther than the Sun.

211
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,800
It has a beautiful legend.

212
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:33,290
The daughter of the God of War
was captured and hid.

213
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:37,280
She was cursed by magic
and no one can find her.

214
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:42,850
The God of War tried so hard to find
his daughter everywhere in the world.

215
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:47,765
-In the end, he found his daughter.
-You lied.

216
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:49,420
Didn't you say no one could find her?

217
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,400
How could the God of War find her?

218
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:58,740
Because there's a constant feeling
between father and daughter.

219
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,520
It was leading the God of War

220
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,050
to his daughter.

221
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,730
So, the people named the chain of stars

222
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:11,260
as Chain Stars as a memory of
the feelings of father and daughter.

223
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:13,030
The God of War is great.

224
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:20,450
All the fathers will
look for their daughters.

225
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:23,670
Because this is
a father's responsibility.

226
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:28,050
What if I go missing?
Will Dad look for me?

227
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,370
Yes.

228
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:37,400
Your dad will come and find you.
He will find his daughter.

229
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,410
He will.

230
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:45,900
That's the legend of the Chain Stars.

231
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:49,620
That's crap!

232
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,330
No.

233
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,330
That's what my mom told me.

234
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,670
Even if you don't know, you can't
make up stories to cheat people.

235
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:05,410
There're many mosquitoes here.
Let's go somewhere else.

236
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:11,030
Okay. I salute to you.

237
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:13,560
I lose.

238
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:16,580
Let me buy you a meal.

239
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:19,470
You didn't lose.

240
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:23,260
My mom really lied to me.

241
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:28,270
Maybe the story is a lie.

242
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:39,610
Xin Wei, do you know An Chu Xia
and Qi Lu went camping together?

243
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:43,110
There was another man too.

244
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:46,920
Even Master Ling went together,

245
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:50,090
but maybe he tried to cover them.

246
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:51,960
Wan Zi.

247
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:56,890
Did you go against An Chu Xia
because she disgraced you

248
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:59,200
in front of the people that day?

249
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:01,790
No, I was framed.

250
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:04,960
You should know me well.

251
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:08,610
I really care about your
relationship with Qi Lu.

252
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:10,870
Wan Zi.

253
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:14,040
I don't like to be used.

254
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,450
I dare not.

255
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:21,130
Don't underestimate An Chu Xia.

256
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:25,740
Moreover, think of Qi Lu's ex...

257
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:30,360
Think twice before you speak.

258
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,150
Sorry.

259
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,230
But even if he doesn't care,

260
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:41,460
An Chu Xia shouldn't spread the rumors.

261
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,340
Let her shut up then.

262
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,980
I don't get you.

263
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,950
Wait. What happened?

264
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,990
Are you breaking any taboos?

265
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:17,630
The curse begins.

266
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:28,550
Chu Xia.

267
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:32,760
What happened?

268
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:34,470
That's what I found on your desk

269
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:36,860
when I arrived the school today.

270
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,070
Everybody's scared off.

271
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,620
Why didn't you run?

272
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,830
I'm blood phobia.

273
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:51,550
Don't destroy the scene.

274
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,590
Come out! I'll call
the police right now.

275
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:54,630
No need.

276
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:56,430
It's artificial blood.

277
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:58,100
Just a little trick.

278
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:02,310
Feng Shao used to cheat
with this long time ago.

279
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:05,450
I'll play with you then.
