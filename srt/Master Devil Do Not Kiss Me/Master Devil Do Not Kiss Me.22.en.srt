Han Qi Lu.

2
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:25,620
Han Qi Lu.

3
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:31,580
Han Qi Lu!

4
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:40,930
Are you sick?

5
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:43,090
They reminded us not to beat people!

6
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:46,360
You're the Master Devil.
Not just anyone else.

7
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:50,370
Are you okay?

8
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,920
Just a few punches.

9
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,380
Of course I'm fine.

10
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:59,880
Don't rub it, or it'll be swollen.

11
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:03,870
I'm sorry.

12
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:07,310
What did you say?

13
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:11,370
Nothing, forget it.

14
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,150
Let's find some clues.

15
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,540
How do we find since it is dark?

16
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:24,700
Change the spotlight

17
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:28,490
to astigmatism
so that we can see a little more clearly.

18
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:30,500
Wait here.

19
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:33,190
Han Qi Lu.

20
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:35,010
Han Qi Lu!

21
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,000
Mamma mia!

22
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,430
It's beautiful.

23
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,470
This is my treasured photo of the stars.

24
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,700
So beautiful.

25
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:50,130
What were you thinking?

26
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:55,120
Nothing.

27
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,610
It's so stuffy here.

28
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:05,760
Are you hungry?

29
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:09,470
I mean, are you feeling hot?

30
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,570
Why don't you take off the clothes?

31
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,640
Bah!

32
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,520
Forget it.

33
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:18,030
It's up to you.

34
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,700
I'm sorry.

35
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:05,710
I'm sorry.

36
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,110
Let's go.

37
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,980
I'm really sorry.

38
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:13,180
I'm sorry.

39
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,300
I'm sorry.

40
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:16,850
Chu Xia.

41
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,340
Chu Xia, wait for me.

[Master Devil Do Not Kiss Me S1]

00:05:22,426 --> 00:05:23,226
[Episode 22]

44
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,220
Little Chu Xia!

45
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,200
Come here!

46
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:30,560
Come on!

47
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,230
I heard you took part
in the Campus Beauty Contest.

48
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:36,870
Why didn't you tell me?

49
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:40,350
It's not a big deal.

50
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,670
I might be eliminated
in the first round.

51
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:45,880
I'm always with you. Don't be afraid.

52
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:52,650
I used to be a beauty pageant.

53
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,380
At that time,

54
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,440
there were many people.

55
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:07,210
I was the most outstanding person
among all the participants.

56
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:12,540
Thousands of men
adored me after the contest.

57
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:16,400
And I was so hot all over
the streets in a night.

58
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,830
To commemorate that glorious history,

59
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:23,460
they gave me a nice name for that story.

60
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:28,380
"The girl we've been
running after together".

61
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:32,610
Sis Yuan Yuan...

62
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:36,860
Don't worry.

63
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:39,520
With my proficient skill,

64
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,610
even if you look so ugly,

65
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,520
I'll make sure you win.

66
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:46,910
Thank you, Sis Yuan Yuan.

67
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:48,330
It's alright.

68
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,780
I am well-prepared.

69
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:51,220
Really?

70
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:54,250
You just have to support me spiritually.

71
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:00,540
Go for it!

72
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,730
My bread's burning.

73
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:05,600
Get some clothes from me later!

74
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,330
Do you have any emollient milk?

75
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:37,450
Hey!

76
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:39,800
I'm coming in.

77
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:44,790
Where is she?

78
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:20,490
I have a little donkey
that I never ride.

79
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:24,120
One day I feel like riding it...

80
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,050
Han Qi Lu! You pervert!

81
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:50,180
I can't believe you are a freak!

82
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,610
It's not what you think.

83
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,350
Don't misunderstand!

84
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,440
You pervert!

85
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,000
You pervert!

86
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,230
What a rude girl!

87
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,470
I'm here to take...

88
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,940
Oh, my God!

89
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,660
Go on and play safe.

90
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:29,920
I've been caught.

91
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,420
Sorry.

92
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,010
The cat food basin is broken.

93
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,940
I've fixed it for you.

94
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,250
Thank you.

95
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:49,420
What's your name?

96
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:57,610
Look at there.

97
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:03,360
You two...

98
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:04,660
No...

99
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:05,890
Chu Xia.

100
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:08,380
We are...

101
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:10,620
I'm sorry, Chu Xia

102
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,420
Say it properly!

103
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:16,930
We are...

104
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,150
We are together now.

105
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,620
-Well...
-Sis!

106
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,800
Thank you.

107
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:26,350
Finally someone's
willing to accept Feng Shao.

108
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:30,350
I hope you two get along well,
don't quarrel or fight.

109
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:33,300
-Don't use weapon.
-Alright.

110
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:36,290
Why did you text me? Is there anything?

111
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:46,620
What's wrong? Anything's eating you?

112
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:49,120
Don't mention it.

113
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,370
It's all because of
the Campus Beauty Contest.

114
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:53,600
I don't know how to prepare for it.

115
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:56,570
So easy.

116
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:57,920
Don't forget.

117
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:01,360
You're a big shareholder
in our barber shop.

118
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,770
We'll support you.

119
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:06,140
I'll take care of your styling.

120
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:09,970
I'll make you the coolest hairstyle
of Paris Fashion Week.

121
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:10,620
Okay?

122
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:14,380
The back must be particularly pomp.

123
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:18,040
Not like her.
Her hair looks like instant noodles.

124
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,430
I'll blow it pomp with the hair dryer.

125
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:22,480
-And the front...
-That's enough.

126
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:26,380
I shouldn't make a reckless decision.

127
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:29,870
It's not like you.

128
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:35,390
Think about your beauty and my skill.

129
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,810
It's a sure-win for you!

130
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:42,450
I don't have beauty,
and you are not skilled.

131
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,480
I need some quietness (Jing Jing).

132
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:51,810
Who's Jing Jing (quiet)?

133
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,700
It's vulgar to ask for my name.

134
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,130
I have an even more vulgarer request.

135
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,910
When shall we meet?

136
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:55,260
-Thank you.
-Not at all.

137
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:58,350
Is the cat walk specially
designed by Chu Xia?

138
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,630
It's too special.

139
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,360
What's wrong?

140
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:44,030
Chu Xia! Chu Xia! Chu Xia! Chu Xia!

141
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,390
Chu Xia! Go for it!

142
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,560
Chu Xia, we believe in you.

143
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:59,880
Go for it! Go for it!

144
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,720
I let my father transfer me to here.

145
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:18,310
Don't do that to her!

146
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:20,580
Mr. Ma, don't kick Chu Xia out.

147
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,600
Here you are.

148
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,940
It hurts.

149
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:41,110
As long as you stay here,

150
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,960
I'll give you a hard time.
