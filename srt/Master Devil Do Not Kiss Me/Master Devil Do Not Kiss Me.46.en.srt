1
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:14,150
Madam.

2
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:15,750
You have a guest.

3
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:20,260
Uncle.

4
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:21,330
Aunt.

5
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,970
I invited Little Kui.

6
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:28,790
Come, Little Kui, sit here.

7
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,056
Listen,

8
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:39,020
today's competition was all thanks
to Little Kui.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,840
Come.

10
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:44,496
Little Kui.

11
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:45,530
Let me

12
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,750
toast to you.

13
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:50,280
I was extremely petty before.

14
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,280
Please forgive me.

15
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,130
-Come.
-Thank you, aunt.

16
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:57,820
Little Kui.

17
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:00,980
Has your hand gotten better?

18
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,640
Actually, it's not that serious.

19
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:05,690
I will be able to draw
again after a while.

20
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,170
So you don't have to worry about me.

21
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,516
Little Kui.

22
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,580
Remember,

23
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:13,420
the Han family's doors will always
be open for you.

24
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:15,380
We are a family.

25
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:18,656
Thank you, uncle.

26
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,256
Come, cheers!

27
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,640
Let us get drunk tonight!

28
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:28,530
Thank you.

29
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,340
You said that 100 times already today.

30
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:34,210
But I still want to say it.

31
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:35,516
If it weren't for you,

32
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,826
I'd have become a plagiarist.

33
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:38,530
I'd never be able to turn my life around.

34
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:40,646
Actually,

35
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:42,500
you only had to say

36
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:44,416
that Xiang Man Kui's hands are broken

37
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,810
and will never be able to draw again,

38
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,040
then everything would have been solved.

39
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,216
But I promised you

40
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,940
not to tell anyone.

41
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:55,380
That's why I came to help you.

42
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,340
Chu Xia.

43
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,970
Actually it was you who helped yourself.

44
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:05,176
Oh right,

45
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:06,156
don't talk about me,

46
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,190
let's talk about you.

47
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,320
What's there to talk about?

48
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:13,000
You're going to Pinkston next week.

49
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,190
What are you and Qi Lu going to do?

50
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:17,820
I don't know.

51
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:21,230
If you let me choose again,

52
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:23,410
I think I'd still go to France.

53
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,870
Pinkston is too tempting to me.

54
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,630
It's the paradise for every designer.

55
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,660
It's just,

56
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,520
my only regret is

57
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,140
that back then I thought...

58
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:39,440
I didn't have to explain it to Qi Lu
for him to understand me.

59
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,490
I was too self-confident.

60
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:46,300
I thought it didn't matter
how much I hurt him,

61
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,550
he'd always wait for me.

62
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,280
Don't misunderstand.

63
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,910
I'm not telling you all this

64
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,020
to drive you away

65
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:58,760
and seize the chance to get Qi Lu back.

66
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,500
I already gave it up.

67
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:03,740
I know.

68
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:05,730
Chu Xia.

69
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:09,650
I just hope that you can hold on to
the most important things,

70
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,430
unlike me.

71
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,670
Go talk to Qi Lu.

72
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:17,410
He will understand you.

73
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:19,326
Ok,

74
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:20,250
I will.

75
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,630
Xiang Man Kui.

76
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:24,440
Let me tell you a secret,

77
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,000
Actually,

78
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,890
I'm your big fan.

79
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,196
Are you serious?

80
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,320
I have a collection of all your works.

81
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,950
Did you not make your feelings clear
to Qi Lu because

82
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,666
you're secretly in love with me?

83
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,890
What are you talking about?

84
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,820
Actually, I'm the same.

85
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:43,050
What?

86
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,240
Chu Xia,

87
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:46,460
the truth is I've always admired you.

88
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,290
Your talent,

89
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:50,990
your perseverance.

90
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,180
I'm sure that we will one day

91
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,380
become enemies again.

92
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:58,730
But this time as designers.

93
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:02,480
When that day comes,
I won't go easy on you.

94
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:03,690
Me neither.

95
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:36,536
=Master Devil Do Not Kiss Me S2=

96
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,460
=Episode 23=

97
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,200
Chu Xia!

98
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,650
I need to talk to you.

99
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:02,160
What are you doing here?

100
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,020
I've been waiting for you.

101
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:06,980
Are you by yourself?

102
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:09,070
There are some things

103
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:11,160
we can only talk about in private.

104
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,050
Let's have a good talk.

105
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,330
There's nothing to talk about.

106
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,620
What if it's about Han Qi Lu?

107
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:27,560
What do you mean?

108
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,340
Here,

109
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,000
let's make a deal.

110
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:34,746
I can help the Han family,

111
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,240
help them out of their crisis.

112
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,310
Isn't that what you want, too?

113
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:40,000
You've been inquiring about me.

114
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:42,410
I'm sorry.

115
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:44,310
I had to do so.

116
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,770
Has anyone told you

117
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:48,516
that I'm the legal representative

118
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,200
of the company the Han family
is doing business with right now?

119
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,446
How is that possible?

120
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:53,006
You...

121
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:55,246
The Jiang family has many companies
under their flag,

122
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:57,100
distributed under the name
of different shareholders.

123
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,300
It's normal if you didn't know.

124
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,000
Chu Xia.

125
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:06,590
I'm being very honest.

126
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:11,020
Tell me,

127
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:12,420
what is your condition?

128
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:16,940
You wouldn't use such a big deal
to bribe me into calling you "dad".

129
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:21,150
If that's really the case, I would feel
extremely flattered.

130
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,970
Chu Xia, it's not like that.

131
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:24,566
You only need to promise me

132
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:26,890
that you will go to France whether you

133
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:28,500
win the competition or not.

134
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,160
What are you trying to do?

135
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,126
You only have to give me a

136
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:35,140
yes or no answer.

137
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,110
Ok.

138
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,110
I promise you.

139
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,120
You've been working
hard for the competition.

140
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:49,030
Go home and rest early.

141
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:52,780
I will go to France.

142
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,220
What?

143
00:07:57,730 --> 00:07:59,176
I will go to France.

144
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,570
It's my dream.

145
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:03,660
But before that,

146
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:05,520
I need to do something.

147
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:07,660
Ok.

148
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,246
If you need my help with anything,

149
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:12,260
tell me.

150
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,326
I'll help you.

151
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,250
No need.

152
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:16,446
It's something

153
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:17,660
only I

154
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:18,436
myself

155
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,490
can do.

156
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:25,350
Thank you.

157
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:41,016
Xiao Nan.

158
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:41,976
I need your help.

159
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:42,930
What happened?

160
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,746
Don't ask, just come over.

161
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:46,780
I'll be right there.

162
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:49,420
Come, sit down.

163
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:50,950
The most important thing

164
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:53,636
for a love confession is a pretty dress

165
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,750
and beautiful make up.

166
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:08,250
Done!

167
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:10,430
Perfect.

168
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:11,910
I'm actually a genius.

169
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:13,950
Look.

170
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,280
This is the real An Chu Xia.

171
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,906
Take out your unique ability,

172
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,570
take down Qi Lu!

173
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,140
Go for it.

174
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,100
Qi Lu.

175
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:43,740
You wanted to meet me,
yet you're the one being late.

176
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:47,620
Do I look pretty?

177
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:50,710
I guess.

178
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,550
Will you die if you compliment me?

179
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,010
I meant...

180
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,000
you're pretty.

181
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:01,960
Han Qi Lu.

182
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,450
I need to tell you something.

183
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:04,670
Perfect,

184
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,680
I need to tell you something, too.

185
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,670
Meng Xiao Nan, where are you taking me?

186
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,350
Meng Xiao Nan!

187
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,190
Begin.

188
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:18,536
Feng Shao?

189
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,460
Hey!

190
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:24,216
One, two, three.

191
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:24,996
Get going.

192
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,536
-We sway together.
-We sway together.

193
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,736
We sway together, we sway, we sway.

194
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:29,900
We sway together!

195
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,800
What's the matter?

196
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,806
The string is torn.

197
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:44,320
Idiot, didn't you know to check
before you came here?

198
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,636
Xiao Nan.

199
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,430
You brought me here to show me them?

200
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:50,546
Er...

201
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:52,090
Wait for me. Just a second.

202
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:55,996
Feng Shao, what are you doing?

203
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,847
I told you to start a band.
And this is what you made?

204
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:58,726
Hey,

205
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:00,780
there wasn't enough time
for such an important task.

206
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:02,830
They are brothers from Cat Ear Alley,

207
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:04,416
we can make a hair cut,

208
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,136
but...

209
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,710
who knows how to play these things?

210
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:09,126
This was already the best I could do.

211
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,740
Whatever. So be it.

212
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:11,960
So be it.

213
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,546
Come on! Continue.

214
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:15,750
Let's continue.

215
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:19,856
We sway together, we sway, we sway.

216
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,220
We sway, we sway.

217
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:21,936
We sway!

218
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:22,860
Alright,

219
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:23,920
you go first.

220
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:28,730
-When are you going to France?
-I do!

221
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:40,020
This is what you wanted to talk
to me about?

222
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:41,810
Yeah.

223
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:42,666
Also,

224
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:43,786
did you apply for visa yet?

225
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,340
I think Sister Yuan Yuan has gotten
your visa ready a long time ago.

226
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:47,600
What about your admission?

227
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,660
Did you contact the people at Pinkston?

228
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:50,196
Also,

229
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,226
how's the weather in France?

230
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:52,250
Enough! Enough!

231
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:59,150
Do you want me gone so badly?

232
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:05,800
Isn't going to Pinkston your dream?

233
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:08,250
What about you?

234
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,090
What do you think?

235
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:11,660
Me?

236
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:15,420
Is it very important what I think?

237
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:18,320
It is to me.

238
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:19,810
Han Qi Lu.

239
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,690
Do you perhaps think that
I'll be like Xiang Man Kui

240
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:24,570
and leave you after I go to France?

241
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,140
It's not like that.

242
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,030
I love design.

243
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:29,670
But I love you, too.

244
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:31,950
Han Qi Lu.

245
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:34,320
I love you! I love you!

246
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,480
Do you understand?

247
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,100
I'm sorry.

248
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,910
I won't consider romantic matters
for the time being.

249
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,180
What?

250
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,030
I just changed my choice
for field of study.

251
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,970
I'm behind on my studies.

252
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,780
If I don't make an effort now,
it'll be too late.

253
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:03,430
Han Qi Lu.

254
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,630
I, An Chu Xia,

255
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:07,600
am confessing my love to you.

256
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:16,636
Didn't you want to ask me

257
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,200
what I think?

258
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:19,870
So let me tell you,

259
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,230
the Han family has just overcome
a major crisis.

260
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:27,210
Brother Liu's health has only
just gotten better.

261
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:32,740
Sister Yuan Yuan can't face the directors
of the company at all.

262
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,820
Right now,

263
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:40,330
I can't think about these trivialities

264
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:41,806
of who I love,

265
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:44,100
and who I don't love.

266
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:49,000
All I want is to solve
the issues in peace.

267
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:50,310
Ok?

268
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,790
Trivialities?

269
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,380
Alright.

270
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:00,720
In that case,

271
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,380
I won't make things difficult for you.

272
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,270
I wish you a speedy success.

273
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,910
Young Master Han.

274
00:14:58,710 --> 00:14:59,680
Wait.

275
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,360
You didn't tune your guitar.

276
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:05,920
And you,

277
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,267
you're holding it the wrong way.

278
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,200
And what's that for?

279
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:14,980
Starting a band.

280
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:16,180
An Erhu?

281
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,220
A mix of China and the West.

282
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:19,970
To develop traditional Chinese culture.

283
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:23,056
Let's go?

284
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:23,826
I think we should go.

285
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:25,196
Wait a bit longer.

286
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:25,806
Oh right,

287
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:27,096
guests are waiting for me in my shop.

288
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:27,876
Wait a little longer.

289
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,240
We'll leave once he's satisfied.

290
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:34,650
Hey, boss.

291
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:36,600
I'm not neglecting work. I'm not.

292
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:39,660
I'll be right back.

293
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:42,046
Big brother got beaten up?

294
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:42,970
Wait for me.

295
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:45,740
Wait!

296
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,236
I'll be right there!

297
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,600
Are you two ok?

298
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,176
It's fine, it's fine.

299
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,016
I'm still here.

300
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,370
I can play for three.

301
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:00,970
Hello?

302
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:02,670
Little angel.

303
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:04,180
Tell me.

304
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:05,370
I'm free.

305
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:08,180
A movie?

306
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:09,290
Sure.

307
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,816
Ok, ok.

308
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:11,676
I'll be right there.

309
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,600
Feng Shao!

310
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:15,860
Let them go.

311
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,736
I'm sorry.

312
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,040
It's all my fault.

313
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:29,390
What does it have to do with you?

314
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,410
Why are you crying, Xiao Nan?

315
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:46,700
Fool.

316
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,300
Thank you for doing this for me.

317
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,170
You're welcome.

318
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,480
If I knew this would happen,

319
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:23,690
I wouldn't have given up on Chu Xia.

320
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,680
Why did you lie to Chu Xia?

321
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,100
I didn't.

322
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:37,630
You don't have to hide it from me.

323
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:46,370
I just think

324
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,740
that Chu Xia has lost enough already.

325
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,610
I can't let her lose this opportunity too.

326
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,070
Love and dream aren't mutually exclusive.

327
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,600
But I'm talking about reality.

328
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:07,320
I can't go to France with Chu Xia.

329
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,540
I can't hinder her from moving forward.

330
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:14,780
She can go study at Pinkston.

331
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:16,590
But me?

332
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:21,440
I'm beginning to doubt that you are the
Han Qi Lu I know.

333
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:27,080
I'm not that Han Qi Lu.

334
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:29,330
I'm not that selfish.

335
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,450
Yes.

336
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,560
But you are still just as egocentric.

337
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,980
You didn't even ask
what Chu Xia's feeling.

338
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:42,130
You don't ask for her opinion.

339
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,520
Maybe this situation

340
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:46,370
isn't as complicated
as you make it out to be.

341
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:53,460
Maybe.

342
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:58,960
Buddy.

343
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,980
You reap what you sow.

344
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:07,410
So you have to take responsibility of it.

345
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,130
You should think carefully now,

346
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,930
while you still have a chance.

347
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,280
Sister Yuan.

348
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:30,836
Thank you for taking care of me
all this time.

349
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,310
Please take care of
yourself while I'm away.

350
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,600
Ok.

351
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:37,120
Chu Xia.

352
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:38,626
Once you're there,

353
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:40,846
tell me if there's anything lacking
with the food

354
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:42,196
and the living situation

355
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,136
or if you need anything.

356
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,820
I will let someone bring them to you.

357
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,246
Your Brother Liu is in bad health,

358
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:48,526
he couldn't come.

359
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:51,520
He told me to tell you
to take care of yourself.

360
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:53,680
I will, Sister Yuan.

361
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:54,780
Rest assured.

362
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:57,456
I have everything arranged for Chu Xia.

363
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:58,920
Someone will take care of her.

364
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:00,210
Good.

365
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,280
Chu Xia.

366
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,016
I don't want you to go.

367
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:04,976
Ok, ok.

368
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,390
Alright, alright.

369
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,160
Look at you. It's not
like I'm leaving forever.

370
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:10,606
You will come back.

371
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:12,170
You have to come back often.

372
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,696
Be good.

373
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:14,620
Ok.

374
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,220
Chu Xia.

375
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,316
Take care of yourself.

376
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,310
Thank you.

377
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,340
Qi Lu left early this morning.

378
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,140
I don't know where he went, either.

379
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:50,916
It's fine.

380
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,460
Perhaps he just didn't want to come.

381
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:55,846
Ok.

382
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:56,636
Alright.

383
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,290
It's about time.

384
00:20:58,870 --> 00:20:59,710
We are leaving.

385
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:01,550
Bye bye.

386
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:38,340
If you want to cry, cry.

387
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:01,236
Stop hiding!

388
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,160
Come out!

389
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,570
Who are you talking to?

390
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:09,866
Thank you for not exposing me.

391
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:12,466
Han Qi Lu, you are here!

392
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:14,650
Do you know that Chu Xia
kept looking for you?

393
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:18,110
I knew you'd be here.

394
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,096
Thank you for not exposing me.

395
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,170
Han Qi Lu.

396
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,030
I didn't think you'd be such a coward.

397
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,780
Whatever you say.

398
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:30,756
I'm leaving.

399
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:31,680
Wait!

400
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,600
Do you know how much
Chu Xia sacrificed for you?

401
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,400
What?

402
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:39,870
I'm saying

403
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:43,230
someone like you don't deserve love.

404
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:45,380
Not that.

405
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,560
What did you mean?

406
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:47,606
Ok,

407
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:48,550
I'll tell you.

408
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:52,440
Do you think it was that easy for
your company's design plan to pass?

409
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:53,990
That man is the master of his own fate?

410
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:55,960
That you will succeed
as long as you put in effort?

411
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,686
Han Qi Lu, wake up.

412
00:22:57,770 --> 00:22:59,960
You can't even deceive yourself
with such a reason.

413
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:03,290
Have you never wondered how this matter
came through so smoothly?

414
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:07,770
This had something to do with Chu Xia?

415
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:10,140
Listen carefully.

416
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,940
She made a deal with my uncle.

417
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:15,236
That whether she wins or loses,

418
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,240
she will leave behind everything
and go to France.

419
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,766
She hated my uncle so much,

420
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:20,690
yet...

421
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,490
For your family, for you,

422
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:26,120
she didn't even hesitate and agreed!

423
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,250
How do you know that?

424
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,636
My last name is Jiang!

425
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,170
How can I not know?

426
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:36,540
You listen to me.

427
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:39,286
If you don't chase after her now,

428
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:41,260
I promise you you will regret it forever!

429
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,400
Go!

430
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:56,970
Why...

431
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,320
Why did you help Han Qi Lu?

432
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,340
I'm helping my sister.

433
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,640
I hope she will find happiness.

434
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:59,130
(An Chu Xia I love you)

435
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,960
What are you doing?

436
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:20,880
You haven't left?

437
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,910
There's bad weather in France.

438
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,860
The flight got cancelled.

439
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,596
B-But I clearly...

440
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,580
Don't "but" me.

441
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:29,850
Anyways,

442
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:32,170
I need to wait a few days
till I leave for France.

443
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,720
Did you come here

444
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:41,340
to tell me something?

445
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:42,330
I did.

446
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:45,506
Chu Xia.

447
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:46,686
Actually, it was me who

448
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:49,050
communicated with you through that wall.

449
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:50,750
That's it?

450
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:52,210
I already knew that.

451
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,000
Huh?

452
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:56,770
Since there's nothing you want to tell me,

453
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,480
I'm leaving.

454
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:03,460
Come back!

455
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:05,196
Why should I?

456
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,186
Because I told you to.

457
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:07,526
You think I'll do whatever you say?

458
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:08,450
I love you.
