1
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,490
You know what? There has been a lot of perverts
at the school gate recently.

2
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,180
Many students saw them.

3
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:20,870
Be careful when you go out!

4
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,510
Xin Wei.

5
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:28,660
A person's temperament

6
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:30,060
is natural-born.

7
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:34,320
Unlike some people who tried
hard to join the upper class society,

8
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,800
you still can smell the misery of her.

9
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,660
You know?

10
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,570
The Pinkston Institute of Design

11
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:43,480
has a strict management.

12
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:47,650
If they find out that someone employed trickery,

13
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,360
-she might...
-Shut up.

14
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:53,900
Go over there first.

15
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,210
I need to talk to her.

16
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:56,980
Oh!

17
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:05,790
You didn't even say hi to me since
you've been back here for so long.

18
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:08,410
Long time no see.

19
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:10,470
Xiang Man Kui.

20
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,460
You're really born to be strong.

21
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:23,240
Why are you here?

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,880
To move the props.

23
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,290
Go over there, don't disturb me.

24
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:34,805
The USA medical researchers
have experimented

25
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:37,604
with 5,000 women with
freckles on their faces.

26
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:39,360
It shows that

27
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,610
when they are depressed,

28
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:45,050
the effect of drug treatment
on their skin is not ideal.

29
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:47,780
But when they get better,

30
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:49,600
the freckles go away.

31
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:52,030
What do you mean?

32
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:54,610
You have freckles on your face recently.

33
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:02,440
Anger would accelerate brain aging

34
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,930
and cause lack of oxygen in the brain.

35
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:08,060
Just like people in anger,

36
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,430
they can't think straight

37
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,300
because of lack of oxygen.

38
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,070
Do you understand what I mean?

39
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:17,710
Yeah.

40
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:19,070
You mean I'm stupid.

41
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,730
Calm down!

42
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,600
A few days ago, you said,
"Stay away from my woman".

43
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,380
And now you say I'm ugly

44
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,960
and stupid.

45
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,960
I've never seen
a short-tempered guy like you!

46
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,200
No...

47
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,000
I didn't mean it.

48
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,120
I don't care!

49
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:42,590
I'll tell you what.

50
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,930
I'm not going to be
your girlfriend even if I die.

51
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:46,440
You...

52
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,500
Get lost!

53
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:55,880
What a nasty woman!

[Master Devil Do Not Kiss Me S2]

00:04:34,022 --> 00:04:36,022
[Episode 4]

56
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:40,680
Imagine the plot here.

57
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,920
Jane was invited to her
beloved Bingley's home.

58
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,640
But there was a heavy rain on the road.

59
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,300
The wind was chilling.

60
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:54,840
Elizabeth was worried about
her sister's safety.

61
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,280
She went to visit her sister.

62
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,940
As a result,

63
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,460
she heard Bingley's two sisters

64
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,640
saying that Jane is a country girl.

65
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:07,880
Understand?

66
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:09,050
Okay!

67
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:10,060
Start!

68
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,720
I've never expected Jane
would run out in the rain.

69
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:22,590
I bet she likes Mr. Bingley very much.

70
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,350
Humph!

71
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,780
That's right.

72
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:29,110
Look at her sister, Elizabeth.

73
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:32,190
Have you seen her skirt?

74
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:34,160
It's all muddy.

75
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,960
So dirty.

76
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,840
What a hayseed!

77
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,930
Mr. Darcy?

78
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:43,740
What do you think?

79
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,500
I don't think Jane is too much.

80
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:50,780
Han Qi Lu.

81
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,090
This is my dialogue.

82
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:53,470
You are wrong.

83
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,600
You are acerb

84
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,380
and always insult people.

85
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:09,520
Don't you know how ugly your dance is?

86
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:14,070
Forget it.

87
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:16,080
I don't know what to say about you.

88
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:19,530
And you!

89
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:24,750
They were insulting your beloved woman.

90
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:27,330
Aren't you angry at all?

91
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:28,840
Mr. Darcy.

92
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,720
What's wrong with you?

93
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:35,310
What makes you say that to me, Ms. Jane?

94
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,540
Can't you tell

95
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:41,820
that I argue with them for your sake?

96
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,240
I don't need any help from you.

97
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,730
Mr. Bingley and I
danced happily yesterday.

98
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:51,150
And his sisters liked me very much.

99
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:53,690
But he dares not fight for you.

100
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,240
But I like Mr. Bingley.

101
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:58,010
Mr. Darcy.

102
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,990
Mind your own business.

103
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,020
In my heart,

104
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,950
he's just a stupid coward.

105
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,080
Why don't you

106
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,340
follow me back to Pemberly today?

107
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:15,560
I'll take you to see
the most beautiful scenery.

108
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:20,570
Han Qi Lun, we're in the class,
don't mess it up!

109
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,860
But I'm acting seriously.

110
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:27,110
Are you trying to drag everyone
to retake with you?

111
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:29,840
What are you talking about?
I'm playing it very well.

112
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,490
I'm serious with the role.

113
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:36,880
Are you sick?

114
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,770
Well done!

115
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,810
This is the dramatic
tension that I want.

116
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,920
This is the love which breaks the
medieval bondage and the taboo!

117
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,720
Well done!

118
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,850
Fireplace! Umbrella!

119
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:52,310
Stand properly!

120
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:55,300
What are you talking over there?

121
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,630
It's not a fantasy show.
What are you two talking there?

122
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,240
-Han Qi Lu.
-An Chu Xia.

123
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,140
Go on.

124
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,760
Let's go to the Pemberly now.

125
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,860
Come on!

126
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,210
Mr. Darcy.

127
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:12,890
Please behave.

128
00:08:13,403 --> 00:08:14,403
Come on.

129
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:17,780
Well done!

130
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:18,810
That's good!

131
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:21,150
The expression is great!

132
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:22,340
Some more.

133
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:23,750
Come on, prolong it.

134
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,320
Come on.

135
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,860
I can't stand it anymore!

136
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:34,410
Xin Wei, are you okay?

137
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:35,890
-Get up.
-Are you crazy?

138
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:39,130
An Chu Xia.

139
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,040
Why did you push me?

140
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,690
I didn't.

141
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:43,520
It's you.

142
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,090
I saw you push Xin Wei.

143
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,600
Are you two sick? It's me who hit you!

144
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,600
An Chu Xia.

145
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:53,890
I know you don't like me as I beat you
in the Campus Belle Contest.

146
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:56,670
But you shouldn't play tricks on me.

147
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:57,510
Hey!

148
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:59,410
Are you trying to disfigure Xin Wei?

149
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:01,550
I didn't do it.

150
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,140
Chu Xia won't do that.

151
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,800
Qi Lu.

152
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,640
-Never judge a book by its cover.
-Are you okay?

153
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:13,150
It's easy.

154
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:15,360
Let's check the CCTV.

155
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:20,880
Forget it.

156
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:25,000
-I'm not going to investigate it.
-Mo Xin Wei, stop!

157
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,330
-Mo Xin Wei!
-Xin Wei!

158
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,970
Xin Wei!

159
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:33,670
Are you okay?

160
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:42,660
Get out.

161
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:43,710
Let's talk.

162
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,010
Get lost!

163
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,680
You're still bad tempered

164
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,270
and never changed.

165
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:56,570
You too. You still like to run after
girls like you used to be.

166
00:09:58,170 --> 00:09:59,090
Wait.

167
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,120
I've said it for many times.

168
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:02,690
It's not my fault.

169
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,240
But she framed me.

170
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,230
Understand?

171
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,000
But you were expelled
at last, weren't you?

172
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,280
Come on, can you please be reasonable?

173
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,580
Be reasonable?

174
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,300
How dare you say it to me?

175
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,730
What did I say when you
came to Stiland College?

176
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:20,930
Keep an eye on Chu Xia and
take her away from Han Qi Lu!

177
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:22,410
I didn't promise it.

178
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:24,830
Come back!

179
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:26,980
What do you want to do?

180
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,230
I warn you now.

181
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:31,080
Never disturb An Chu Xia again.

182
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,440
Otherwise, bear your own consequences.

183
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:36,660
What makes you laugh?

184
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:40,400
I laugh because you're
falling into An Chu Xia.

185
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,910
I'll tell you what.

186
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:44,030
You'll never win Han Qi Lu.

187
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,870
Mo Xin Wei.

188
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:01,080
Jiang Chen Chuan! Stop!

189
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,460
What's wrong?

190
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,900
Look at him!

191
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,190
He's an ungrateful hypocrite!

192
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,530
I was forced to be here.

193
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,200
It's okay, you don't have to deal with it.

194
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,870
I'm going to show you his true colour
and let's see how hypocritical he is.

195
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,770
Meng Xiao Nan, are you sick?

196
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:19,470
Humph!

197
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:23,870
Chu Xia, he has only one
motive to get close to you.

198
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,970
What's my motive?

199
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:26,870
Stop pretending!

200
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:28,690
You are a spy sent by Mo Xin Wei.

201
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:29,380
Huh?

202
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,640
Really?

203
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:34,660
I heard what you said just now.

204
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:37,250
Wait.

205
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,820
Let me explain to you.

206
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:42,510
It was the mad woman who came to me herself.

207
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,840
-I...
-Jiang Chen Chuan.

208
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,160
You are irresponsible!

209
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,260
How can you push everything to a woman?

210
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,280
No, I didn't!

211
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,780
She came to me herself!

212
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:51,820
Jiang Chen Chuan!

213
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,850
Now I see your true colour!

214
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:57,070
You lived on a woman
and you are a bastard!

215
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:57,980
What?

216
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:59,480
Who lived on a woman?

217
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:03,130
You are a spy sent by
Mo Xin Wei to cheat Chu Xia.

218
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:04,120
Really?

219
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,490
What a good acting!

220
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,280
Nonsense!

221
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,670
You heard it, didn't you?

222
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:13,040
Aren't we talking about
me being expelled in England?

223
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,080
Expelled?

224
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,100
Yeah.

225
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,020
When I was studying in England,

226
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,620
I was framed by a paranoia

227
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,700
that I had a crush on her
and followed her.

228
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,330
So the British expelled me

229
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:24,580
regardless of truth.

230
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,130
Huh?

231
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:29,860
So you are not Mo Xin Wei's pretty boy?

232
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,580
What? Pretty boy?

233
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,100
Mo Xin Wei is my cousin.

234
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,380
-What?
-What?

235
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,840
Wait, didn't I tell you about it?

236
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,170
Just a moment.

237
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:44,190
Why you two have different surnames?

238
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,840
She follows her mum's surname.

239
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,680
My father is Jiang Hai.

240
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,220
Her father is Jiang He.
They are brothers.

241
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,880
But they are not so close.

242
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,600
Well...

243
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:56,600
Since I have told you about my family,
let me confess my feeling to you.

244
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:58,460
Confess?

245
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,910
Everyone, listen to me!

246
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:07,900
I now officially announce.

247
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:08,900
Chu Xia.

248
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:10,900
I like you.

249
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,840
From now on, I'll not spare

250
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,540
anyone who tries to bully her.

251
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,870
Listen!

252
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:19,820
Come down!

253
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:20,890
Wait!

254
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:47,050
Answer it!

255
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:50,840
Are you angry?

256
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:52,240
Nonsense!

257
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,720
Why should I be angry?

258
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,020
The USA studies have shown that

259
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,840
anger would cause spots.

260
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:01,940
It could lead to lack of oxygen
in the brain and confusion, right?

261
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:02,650
Humph!

262
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:04,590
So you understood it.

263
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:08,830
Actually, I don't know what's
on Jiang Chen Chuan's mind.

264
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,850
He suddenly confessed his feeling.

265
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,780
-He looks...
-I don't want to hear it.

266
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:13,630
Don't explain it.

267
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,500
Young master.

268
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,960
You can't do this.

269
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:22,440
Give the present to Ms. Chu Xia.

270
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:24,810
What present?

271
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,580
Nothing.

272
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:27,820
Focus on your driving.

273
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:30,510
You two quarrelled before

274
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:34,360
and young master regretted it.

275
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,920
He asked me

276
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,890
to buy a gift for you

277
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:41,590
as an apology.

278
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:42,970
Really?

279
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,300
Where's the gift?

280
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,140
I threw it away.

281
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:49,800
You threw it away?

282
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,090
Because it's a useless thing.

283
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:56,520
That's good.

284
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,640
-What are you doing?
-To dress your wound.

285
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,300
Stupid.

286
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,120
You're scolding me again.
Looking for a fight?

287
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,770
It's not a serious wound.

288
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:27,200
It's fine after a day.

289
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,180
Where do you go?

290
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,120
You won't die anyway.
I'll go and do my homework.

291
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:35,600
Come back.

292
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:44,670
Ahem!

293
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,920
Here you go.

294
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:00,970
Didn't you throw it away?

295
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:02,880
No.

296
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,110
You said you threw it away.

297
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:07,520
Uncle Han can be the witness.

298
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,260
Oh, you remembered it wrongly.

299
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,580
Thank you.

300
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,580
I bet you remembered it wrongly.

301
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,560
Otherwise, I...

302
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,310
What did you say?

303
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,860
Han Qi Lu, thank you.

304
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,260
I like it very much.

305
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:33,630
Chu Xia.

306
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,500
About Jiang Chen Chuan...

307
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:38,740
Do you like him?

308
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:43,250
Am I blind?

309
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:54,520
Hey.

310
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:56,520
Come closer.

311
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,150
Come closer.

312
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:00,860
Why?

313
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,320
Do as I say.

314
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,300
Closer.

315
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,220
What are you doing?

316
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:22,820
Hey.

317
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:27,860
-Aren't you going to dress his wound?
-He won't die.

318
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,320
Well done, my son!

319
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,110
Uncle Han is finally right.

320
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,600
Girls are born to be coaxed.

321
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:04,760
Hey.

322
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:09,130
Jiang Chen Chuan of Class B is the son
of Jiang Hai, the boss of Jiang's Group.

323
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:09,750
Oh, my God!

324
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,700
He is like a crown prince!

325
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:15,310
No wonder it's weird between him
and Mo Xin Wei. They are family.

326
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:16,310
Really?

327
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:18,290
Didn't they fight for family property?

328
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:21,570
-One badly injured and one hospitalized.
-That's crap!

329
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:24,050
Jiang Hai focused on
foreign business and

330
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:26,070
even developed houses in the South Pole.

331
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:28,050
Jiang He is a fashion giant

332
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:29,700
who is doing a small business.

333
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,500
-They are just fine.
-Really?

334
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,800
I heard the house price
in Uruguay falls sharply.

335
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,520
Let's ask Jiang Chen Chuan.

336
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,320
Alright.

337
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,320
Really?

338
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,460
He has never mentioned it.

339
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:48,770
Young Master Jiang.

340
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,340
-What's up?
-Your bag is heavy.

341
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,540
Let me help you.

342
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,010
Why did you grab my bag?

343
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,970
-Let me help you.
-Cut it out.

344
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:00,600
Let me help you.

345
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,550
Xiao Nan.

346
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,030
Xiao Nan!

347
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,310
Are they sick?

348
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:23,220
What's going on?

349
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,820
What's going on?

350
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,720
I've never expected
that you're such a person.

351
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,860
Didn't I explain it yesterday?

352
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,480
I am not a spy of Mo Xin Wei.

353
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:35,780
You can't hide your identity either.

354
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,550
Why? Are you afraid to be pestered?

355
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:42,430
Can't you please be reasonable?

356
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,740
Are you sick?

357
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:45,500
Chu Xia.

358
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,090
Come out, we need to talk.

359
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:51,710
Okay.

360
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:54,800
Take your time.

361
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,760
Jiang Chen Chuan.

362
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:06,560
It might hurt you,

363
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:09,450
but I must make it clear to you.

364
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:10,800
Hmm.

365
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:13,270
We haven't known
each other for a long time,

366
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:19,100
but your style of work
is in line with my standard.

367
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,240
Hmm.

368
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,940
You are straight
to the point and frank.

369
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,220
But,

370
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,320
we're just friends.

371
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,050
Understand?

372
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,580
I understand.

373
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,400
That's good.

374
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,660
I thought you...

375
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,600
What now?

376
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,560
Don't you like the pose?

377
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:39,250
-Didn't you understand what I said?
-Yes, I did.

378
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,610
You rejected me.

379
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,570
What are you trying to do now?

380
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,420
-I'll continue to run after you.
-What?

381
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:50,060
Most of the girls will reject
for the first reaction

382
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:53,230
when a man confessed to her.
It's stated in the tips book.

383
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:56,880
I wanted to tell you indirectly.

384
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,440
Forget it.

385
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,280
Jiang Chen Chuan.

386
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,390
Listen carefully.

387
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:00,620
That's impossible for us

388
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:02,040
to get together.

389
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:05,180
Bingo! It's stated in the tips book too!

390
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:08,020
Most of the girls say dislike
when they actually like it.

391
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:10,900
When they say impossible,
it means possible.

392
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,480
What funny books do you read?

393
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,360
You guess.

394
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,250
Don't step on my foot.

395
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,540
Here you go!

396
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:19,820
I told you!

397
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,590
I hate chatterbox!

398
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:24,620
Ouch!

399
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:25,560
Chu Xia!

400
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,460
Chu Xia! Wait for me!

401
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:28,760
Chu Xia!

402
00:21:57,510 --> 00:22:00,590
That's what happened.
Too bad.
