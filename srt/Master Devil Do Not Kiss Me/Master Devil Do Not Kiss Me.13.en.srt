1
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,640
Time flies.

2
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,920
We both graduated
from high school in a flash.

3
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:25,010
Do you think we will
study in the same university?

4
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:27,830
Sure.

5
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:31,265
Because we'll be on
a foundation course for two years

6
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:34,004
and go to the British
headquarter together.

7
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,050
We'll be together.

8
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:39,050
We'll be together

9
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,470
for a life time.

10
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:46,770
And I'll give you a starry wedding.

11
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:50,990
I don't need a starry wedding.

12
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:55,210
As long as you're there.

13
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,240
Because you're my star (Orangutan).

14
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,940
Orangutan?

15
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,980
I'm an orangutan.

16
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,000
It seems Xiang Man Kui
can't make it here.

17
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,690
Let's listen to Han Qi Lu's solo.

18
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,130
I am sorry.

19
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:18,080
It's alright.

20
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:21,010
I said I'd stay with you.

21
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,850
I have to grab the opportunity.

22
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,690
If you go there merely for studying,

23
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:35,550
I can go with you.

24
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,770
There's another reason
for me to go study abroad.

25
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,500
Another reason?

26
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:47,680
What's that?

27
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:48,900
Tell me.

28
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:52,240
I'll make it happen
as long as I can do it.

29
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:01,050
Because I don't have to see you
anymore as long as I go abroad.

30
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,150
I am sorry, Qi Lu.

31
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,710
I don't want to be your shadow,

32
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:16,140
your wife

33
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,790
and your accessory.

34
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:22,140
I want to live like myself.

35
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,000
Can you let me go?

36
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,010
I'll wait for you.

37
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,450
Don't wait for me.

38
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,970
I'm not coming back.

41
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:27,310
Qi Lu.

42
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:32,530
I've forgotten her.

43
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,550
Who did you forget?

44
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:36,910
What's going on?

45
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:40,350
I want you to apologize to Chu Xia.

46
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,050
No way.

47
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,420
What are you doing?

48
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,660
You pissed me off!

49
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,570
Brat!

50
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:01,750
You pissed me off!

51
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,150
How can you do that to me?

52
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:07,690
How do you want to
explain to your late father.

53
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:09,930
Madam.

54
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:13,810
Master Han is taking rest in England.
He's still alive.

55
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:17,450
What's wrong with you?

56
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,850
Can't you see I'm acting?

57
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:23,290
Can't you work with me?

58
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:37,890
Honey.

59
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,840
Come down for breakfast.

60
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,070
I have made your favorite food.

61
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,650
What takes you so long?

62
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:53,210
Let's dig in.

63
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:09,350
Little Chu Xia.

64
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:13,610
What game are you playing?

65
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:18,770
Tell me. Or let me join your game.

66
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:20,910
I've had enough.

67
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:26,050
I've had enough too.
I'm going to school now.

68
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:44,740
Come on.

69
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,730
Uncle Han, is Qi Lu going to school?

70
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:55,890
He is on leave today.

71
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:57,320
He is not going to school.

72
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:22,280
A shroud!

73
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:26,540
She gave me a shroud!

74
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,930
An Chu Xia!

75
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:40,810
Looks like someone's scolding me.
Must be the bad guys at school.

76
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:42,690
They want to play a prank again.

77
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:54,630
Master Han had a big quarrel with
An Chu Xia at his party last night.

78
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:57,850
An Chu Xia became conceited and spoilt.
She rubs him the wrong way.

79
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:59,140
-Really?
-Really?

80
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:01,820
She wanted to grab the crown,

81
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:04,200
but fell down at the critical point
because of the empress.

82
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,450
-What about Mo Xin Wei?
-She is another consort.

83
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:09,000
-The empress is that woman.
-Gosh!

84
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:11,480
An Chu Xia messed up
Master Han's birthday party.

85
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,100
He's bad tempered,
I guess he won't let her off.

86
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,610
Big news!

87
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:18,840
Due to the fuss in the birthday party,
Young Master Han issued a wanted notice.

88
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,560
Now, Chu Xia is like a rat
running across the street.

89
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:27,600
She's suffering now. Sigh, heaven and
hell are only within a flash of thought.

90
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:11,400
Ming Yue, let me tell you.

91
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,890
Cai Xia, let me tell you.

92
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:24,790
What is going on?

93
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,450
Anything on my face?

94
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:28,960
Are they haunted?

95
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:31,290
Am I so scary?

96
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,290
I'm quite beautiful.

97
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:13,590
Han Yu, help me.

98
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,090
Where are you?

99
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:17,550
I'm in Class B.

100
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:19,060
Okay, I'll be right there.

101
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,330
Hurry up.

102
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:33,670
Chu Xia.

103
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,550
If you want to cry,

104
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:38,620
I can lend you my shoulder.

105
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,470
Nothing to cry about.

106
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:43,090
When I lived in
a rented room with my mom,

107
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:44,810
I used to fight with my friends.

108
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:46,470
I injured more than this.

109
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:48,510
Don't worry, I'm tough.

110
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,160
Both of you are so similar.

111
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:54,820
You can't even mention her name.

112
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:58,020
I guess it's Han's first girlfriend.

113
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,630
Taboo girlfriend?

114
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:04,020
Childish.

115
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:05,970
Like Lord Voldemort.

116
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:07,980
Chu Xia.

117
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,560
Get further away from Mo Xin Wei later.

118
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:14,130
I'm angry as soon as you mention her.

119
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:16,190
She kept on fooling me.

120
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:21,860
Never offend the wicked.

121
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,650
Mo Xin Wei is a wicked person.

122
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,510
The most wicked among them.

123
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:33,440
You are not her match.

124
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,620
I'm not afraid.

125
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,110
I have you around me.

126
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,190
I have Feng Shao,

127
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:38,450
Xiao Nan,

128
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:40,620
Ming Yue, Cai Xia and Jian Ren.

129
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,880
I won't spare her if she fools me again.

130
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:47,460
I'll always be there

131
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:49,280
to protect you.

132
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:58,500
Class! Let's have our PE class today.

133
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:02,190
Class A and Class B
will be combined today.

134
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:04,190
Because the teacher of Class A

135
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:06,630
has a diarrhea. You know that?

136
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,480
-Yes.
-You are in one class.

137
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,750
Are you happy?

138
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:10,870
Yes.

139
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,880
So, for the PE class today,

140
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,660
we'll have a basketball practice
which all the boys and girls like it.

141
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:19,300
-Yay!
-Look at the antagonism between you.

142
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,790
Let's see who's stronger
among the two classes.

143
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:27,050
We're going to start the class now.

144
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,590
Sir.

145
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:30,720
I want to take a leave.

146
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,590
I have a stomachache.

147
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:36,880
Go ahead.

148
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,010
Thank you, sir.

149
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:42,410
-Let's go on...
-Sir.

150
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:47,140
I want to take a leave. I have
a stomachache and can't run and play.

151
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:50,480
Why can't you run and play?

152
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,510
I have my menstruation.

153
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:55,790
You have your menstruation
in the recent 8 classes.

154
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:57,820
Stop cheating.

155
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:01,170
I really have a stomachache. Ouch!

156
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:04,760
Can you make your menstruation by month?

157
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,770
-Okay?
-Okay.

158
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:07,930
Thank you, sir.

159
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:14,270
Let's do some stretching.

160
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,970
First, do your leg press.

161
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:17,970
Come on, 1, 2, 3, 4...

162
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:23,680
Chu Xia.

163
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:27,620
I heard Master Ling saved you yesterday.

164
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,300
Yeah, what's wrong?

165
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:36,900
I decided to give him to you.

166
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:38,630
What's on your mind?

167
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,390
Han Yu and I are buddies.

168
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:43,830
Change! 1, 2, 3, 4...

169
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:52,250
Wan Zi! Are you sick?

170
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:56,610
I just learned it from you
and it was quite fun.

171
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:57,530
Forget it.

172
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,300
What are you doing? Be serious.

173
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:01,790
She didn't mean it.

174
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:03,660
Continue.

175
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:05,790
Now Ma Jian Guo is back.

176
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:09,090
We are all in the teeth of the storm.
Let's tolerate to make a peace.

177
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:16,760
Alright, relax yourselves.

178
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,940
Let's do a three-week
jogging relaxation exercise.

179
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:20,500
Alright!

180
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,090
-Okay.
-Okay, dismiss.

181
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,700
She's so happy to be hit by the ball.

182
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:34,090
Not bad.

183
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,480
What should we do now?

184
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,540
They weren't trapped.

185
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,810
Force her then.

186
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:43,530
Force her.

187
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:46,120
Everybody has a bottom line.

188
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:49,330
Let's see how long she can bear it.

189
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:05,660
Don't block the way.

190
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:07,450
I should say this.

191
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:08,830
Don't block. Get out of the way!

192
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,560
Mo Xin Wei, you bullied me twice
before and I put up with it.

193
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,360
Don't go too far.

194
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,500
Don't make me go back
to my old style because of you.

195
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:19,360
Chu Xia.

196
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:22,060
What are you talking about?
I don't understand.

197
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,660
It doesn't matter.

198
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,780
As long as you do it.

199
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,460
-Get out of the way!
-Go away.

200
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:28,740
Meng Xiao Nan.

201
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:32,800
I heard your father is going
to do a business with my dad.

202
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:35,020
We are two different people.

203
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,630
Don't mix it up.

204
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:38,410
I didn't say anything.

205
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:39,960
Xiao Nan, don't be afraid.

206
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:43,680
I believe Mo's business
is related to Han's family.

207
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,210
You knew how Mrs. Han treated me.

208
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:50,200
You'll pay the price if something
goes wrong with Xiao Nan's family.

209
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:56,160
Hey, parasite! How dare you bully
Xin Wei with your master's power?

210
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,860
You'll be finished!

211
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:04,360
An Chu Xia!

212
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,260
Are you okay?

213
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:13,070
-Are you alright?
-I'll help you up.

214
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:16,870
An Chu Xia! Why are you
always hitting people?

215
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:19,880
I heard you hit Gao Gan and teacher.

216
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,790
Now you even hit women.

217
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:23,800
You want to hit everyone in the school?

218
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:25,220
Sir.

219
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:27,020
Since she doesn't know the rules,

220
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:29,100
you'll have to teach her then.

221
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,160
Of course I have to.

222
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,710
Until she understands it.

223
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:33,190
Sir.

224
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:36,180
Chu Xia didn't mean it.

225
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,770
Let's forget it.

226
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,420
Mo Xin Wei, stop pretending!

227
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,660
An Chu Xia, are you
going to hit her again?

228
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,050
-Run 20 laps!
-Mr. Ma.

229
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:44,900
30 laps!

230
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:46,490
Compulsory!

231
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:48,090
Wan Zi, supervise her!

232
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,380
Okay.

233
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,020
The rest, carry on your exercise.

234
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:55,450
Be careful, Xin Wei.

235
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:08,380
She's not our match.

236
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:29,450
-What's going on?
-Is that Chu Xia?

237
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:31,460
-Let's take a look.
-Let's go.

238
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:34,280
Go.

239
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,780
Wait a minute.

240
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,660
What are you doing?
Are you trying to mess around?

241
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,990
-What's wrong with An Chu Xia?
-What's up?

242
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:48,390
I'll tell you what.
Mr. Ma asked me to supervise her.

243
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:52,100
He wants An Chu Xia to run alone.
You guys can't help her.

244
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,830
That's it.

245
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:57,350
-What's going on?
-Let's go.

246
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,190
What should we do now?

247
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,210
-Let's go.
-I don't know.
