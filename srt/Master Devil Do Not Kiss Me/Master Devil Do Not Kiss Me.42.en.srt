1
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:14,776
That's your only option left.

2
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:15,700
Perhaps,

3
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:16,920
try make do with that?

4
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:19,680
Who says there's no one else?

5
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,176
-You?
-Han Qi Lu.

6
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,496
Why disturb us here?

7
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:27,496
The beauty contest is over.

8
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:28,890
You're too late. Go, go, go.

9
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:33,260
An Chu Xia is my maid.

10
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:34,126
This matter

11
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:35,790
has been prearranged already.

12
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:36,986
Han Qi Lu, you...!

13
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:38,036
Alright, enough.

14
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,026
Stop fighting.

15
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:40,370
Let Chu Xia make her own choice.

16
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,380
You gotta think carefully before
you choose.

17
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:46,316
Alright,

18
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,016
done.

19
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,000
We're leaving.

20
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:49,350
Hey.

21
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:51,120
Who did she choose?

22
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,410
Who did she choose?

23
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,680
Idiot.

24
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:55,820
Who did she choose, Feng Shao?

25
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:52,356
Chu Xia.

26
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,370
Let's do it together.

27
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,640
Oh right, Xiao Kui.

28
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,650
How did you hurt your hand?

29
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:06,790
Oh,

30
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,750
I wanted to cut a special pattern
into the bottle with a knife,

31
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:13,170
it would have looked more interesting.

32
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,950
But I ended up hurting myself.

33
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:52,936
=Master Devil Do Not Kiss Me S2=

34
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:53,860
=Episode 19=

35
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:00,166
Dear teachers, dear students.

36
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:00,766
Hello everyone.

37
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:03,676
Welcome to the Pinkston Rematch.

38
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,196
After a fierce competition,

39
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,836
15 contestants have made it to
our rematch.

40
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,526
Now let us welcome our contestants

41
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:11,480
onto the stage!

42
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:19,290
What is it?

43
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,620
I keep thinking that something bad will
happen today.

44
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:28,260
Why are you nervous?

45
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:30,200
I'm here, aren't I?

46
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,250
Give me your hand.

47
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,630
Give it to me.

48
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:37,580
Hurry up.

49
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:40,270
Now you don't feel nervous anymore.

50
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:41,750
Chu Xia!

51
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:43,886
What are you doing?

52
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:44,246
Hey.

53
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:45,446
Han Qi Lu, I'm warning you,

54
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:46,900
don't always take advantage of Chu Xia.

55
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:48,480
It's none of your business.

56
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,076
Chu Xia.

57
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,136
I bought this for you.

58
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,740
-I wish you...
-Jeez.

59
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:55,200
You didn't have to do this.

60
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,596
It smells quite nice.

61
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,546
Go buy your own flowers.

62
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,900
This is for Chu Xia.

63
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,780
I just like your...

64
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:04,960
flowers.

65
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,540
Fight me.

66
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,256
Chu Xia, stop playing.

67
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,436
Good luck. You can do it.

68
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,720
I believe in you.

69
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,096
Alright, now let us see
what our first contestant, Mo Xin Wei,

70
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:21,116
has brought us for her piece of fashion.

71
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,360
Let us give her a warm applause.

72
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:51,676
Alright, the design of that piece
was really stunning.

73
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,976
On to our next contestant, An Chu Xia.

74
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:57,620
What kind of work will she bring us?

75
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:39,216
Seeing him like that,

76
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,470
Han Qi Lu really is quite handsome.

77
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:44,510
I bought the flowers.

78
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:48,176
These were all the contestants who have
made it to the final round.

79
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,126
However,

80
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:51,936
we are faced with a
little awkward situation.

81
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,196
Two of our contestants

82
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,556
are tied for first place.

83
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,796
These two contestants are Mo Xin Wei

84
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,556
and An Chu Xia.

85
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,376
So, according to our rules,

86
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,816
these two contestants are tied
for first place.

87
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,996
Let us ask our judges here

88
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,626
to decide on the winner through

89
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:12,076
a live voting.

90
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,366
Let's see.

91
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:17,130
Firstly, the teachers who vote
for Mo Xin Wei are...

92
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:20,246
-Mo Xin Wei.
-Mo Xin Wei.

93
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:21,526
Alright. Thank you.

94
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:22,996
Thank you, judges.

95
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,370
The teachers who vote
for An Chu Xia are...

96
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:29,320
-An Chu Xia.
-An Chu Xia.

97
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:32,796
Thank you, judges.

98
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,546
However

99
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:34,496
I noticed that.

100
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,730
Ms. Xiang did not vote.

101
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,700
Who does your vote go to?

102
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,000
An Chu Xia.

103
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,780
Yes!

104
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:53,846
The winner of the rematch is.

105
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:54,916
An Chu Xia!

106
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,320
Congratulations, An Chu Xia.

107
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,820
Congratulations, An Chu Xia.

108
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:22,730
Miss An Chu Xia!

109
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:24,310
Please tell us...

110
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,530
How long have you two been together?

111
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,260
Please tell us.

112
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:31,850
What is the nature of your relationship?

113
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:33,186
Don't leave!

114
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:34,506
Hey, Mr. Han!

115
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:36,246
Please answer our question!

116
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:38,220
Why did you vote for An Chu Xia?

117
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,550
Why are you so anxious?

118
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,676
Why am I anxious?

119
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,526
She won two rounds in a row!
Of course I'm anxious.

120
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:47,250
Can you explain to me your actions today?

121
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,886
Hey.

122
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:50,900
We've been cooperating
for a long time now,

123
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:53,850
why are you still so stupid?

124
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:56,056
Have you never heard the saying?

125
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:58,330
The higher you get the worse the fall.

126
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:01,220
I want Chu Xia to make a fool of herself
more than you do.

127
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:04,870
What are you worried about?

128
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:09,280
Then find a way to deal with her.

129
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,300
An Chu Xia.

130
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,760
I will make you leave the country.

131
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,950
I really can't let you stay beside
Qi Lu anymore.

132
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,340
An Chu Xia?

133
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,250
Chu Xia!

134
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:02,400
Congratulations!

135
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,640
You were awesome today!

136
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:10,750
Chu Xia, congratulations.

137
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,840
Thank you for voting for me.

138
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:13,816
Of course.

139
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,360
It's what you deserved.

140
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:21,310
Chu Xia, can I have an autograph, please?

141
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,076
-Chu Xia!
-Get in line.

142
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,530
I'm first in line.

143
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,796
Chu Xia!

144
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,900
Of course.

145
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:32,930
Your phone.

146
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:36,860
Hello?

147
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,120
Jiang's Group?

148
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:47,350
Jiang's Group made an exception
and wants you to become their designer?

149
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,060
That's great news!

150
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,240
Is it?

151
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,380
Yeah.

152
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,676
That way you won't need to leave
the country.

153
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,970
You can just stay with me as my maid.

154
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,030
But don't you think

155
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,370
that there's something strange
about this situation?

156
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:06,570
I'm Mo Xin Wei's enemy.

157
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:09,790
Why would her dad want to hire me
as their designer?

158
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,766
It must be

159
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:13,970
some kind of scheme.

160
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:15,756
I know, I know.

161
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,516
Yes.

162
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,780
Just do as I say.

163
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:18,980
Dad.

164
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,160
Help me out here!

165
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,926
What happened? Help you with what?

166
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:25,546
Dad.

167
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:28,636
That An Chu Xia from my school,
kick her out of the competition.

168
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,640
She always steals my thunder.

169
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,920
-Dad!
-An Chu Xia?

170
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,160
You dislike her a lot?

171
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:40,806
You can become a designer
without leaving the country.

172
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:42,330
What a great opportunity.

173
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,260
Why do you want to go to France?

174
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,310
To hide from you.

175
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,240
Oh.

176
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:52,716
Actually, you don't have to hide.

177
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,390
We don't have much
more time together anyway.

178
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,510
What do you mean?

179
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,640
I...

180
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,290
Nothing.

181
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,096
Hey,

182
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,436
I was just kidding.

183
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,360
Don't take it seriously.

184
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:11,930
But.

185
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,150
I won't agree to work for the
Jiang family.

186
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,166
Slow down.

187
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,550
What's the hurry?

188
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:28,770
Eh?

189
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:29,966
Uncle.

190
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:31,420
Who are you calling your uncle?

191
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:33,156
That's my uncle's car.

192
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,590
What's he doing here?

193
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,680
Oh, he must be here to pick up
his daughter.

194
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:59,450
You are An Chu Xia?

195
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:06,370
Wow, so much tasty stuff.

196
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:08,596
Chu Xia.

197
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,090
Looks like Mr. Jiang wants to hire you
no matter what.

198
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,010
Chu Xia, listen.

199
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,456
Uncle Jiang is really nice.

200
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,206
He and Mo Xin Wei don't seem like
father and daughter at all.

201
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:18,756
Don't give up on such a great
opportunity

202
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,640
because of Mo Xin Wei.

203
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,380
Chen Chuan.

204
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:24,870
Don't make this sound like an auction.

205
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:26,926
Chu Xia.

206
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:27,850
Come.

207
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,550
Let me toast to you.

208
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,056
Thank you, Mr. Jiang.

209
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:32,886
Chu Xia.

210
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:33,976
Don't call him Mr. Jiang.

211
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:34,900
Call him uncle.

212
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,200
Thank you, Uncle Jiang.

213
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,890
Come. Sit, Chu Xia.

214
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,270
Uncle Jiang.

215
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:48,750
I've thought about it.

216
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,076
I can't join your company.

217
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,270
I'm sorry.

218
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,400
Why?

219
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,836
Because...

220
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,636
I want to become a designer
relying on my own efforts.

221
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,960
I don't want to take a shortcut.

222
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,596
You aren't taking a shortcut.

223
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,766
Look, you relied on your own ability

224
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:06,550
to win the preliminary round and
the rematch.

225
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,246
You are now

226
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:10,726
a little superstar in the circle
of fashion designers.

227
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:11,710
-Right?
-Yes, yes, yes.

228
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:16,016
So it's nothing unusual for my company to
hire a famous

229
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,260
fashion designer like you,

230
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,320
right?

231
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:19,826
But...

232
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:21,850
I want to take one step at a time.

233
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,560
I'd feel more at ease.

234
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,690
You're just like your mother.

235
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:33,060
You knew my mother?

236
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,500
Chu Xia.

237
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,806
I wanted to tell you about this

238
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:41,890
after the competition has ended.

239
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:43,780
But now...

240
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:48,020
But now I don't think I can wait
another second.

241
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,050
Before I tell you this,

242
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:52,990
I need to tell you a story.

243
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,880
The heroine of this story

244
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:59,220
is called An Shu Ya.

245
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:05,830
Mr. Jiang.

246
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,036
Secretary Liu.

247
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,000
He isn't here.

248
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:12,606
Miss.

249
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:14,570
You are still up?

250
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:15,416
Yeah.

251
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,436
Is Mr. Jiang still not home?

252
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,560
What's the matter?

253
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:20,100
N-Nothing.

254
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:22,236
Mr. Jiang told me to...

255
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,310
bring him some files.

256
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:26,350
Put them here.

257
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,460
Oh... alright.

258
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,540
After our graduation,

259
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,930
our lives became difficult.

260
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:40,616
My family forced me to break up
with Shu Ya

261
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,850
and marry another.

262
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:44,490
So Shu Ya left me.

263
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:46,140
A few years later.

264
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:49,570
I met her again by chance.

265
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,000
Only then did I find out

266
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,450
that she was already pregnant

267
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,720
when we broke up.

268
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,346
I decided then to give up everything,

269
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:04,470
I wanted to get a divorce and
go back to her.

270
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:07,080
But I didn't expect...

271
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:10,060
But I didn't expect that
Shu Ya would take her child

272
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,730
and move away.

273
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:16,910
She still couldn't forgive me.

274
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,520
She still couldn't forgive me.

275
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,210
DNA?

276
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:48,790
An Chu Xia?

277
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:51,100
Uncle.

278
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,726
The daughter

279
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:54,420
of Shu Ya...

280
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,960
wouldn't be An Chu Xia, would it?

281
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:01,860
It's her.

282
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:07,060
How can Chu Xia possibly be your
daughter?

283
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,140
This isn't a joke.

284
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:11,020
-Chu Xia...
-Uncle.

285
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:14,280
I... don't like this story very much.

286
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,940
If that's all,

287
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,610
I'll be leaving.

288
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,000
Chu Xia!

289
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,100
Chu Xia.

290
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:30,630
Please forgive your father.

291
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,840
I don't have a father.

292
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:40,940
Chu Xia!

293
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,900
Uncle.

294
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:47,360
You took the joke too far.

295
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,060
Chu Xia.

296
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:56,800
It's fine, don't...

297
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:02,030
Cry if you want to.

298
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:15,050
An Chu Xia.

299
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,920
I won't let you steal my things.

300
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:21,460
Whether it's my family or my love.

301
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,660
An Chu Xia!

302
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:41,820
Chu Xia!

303
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,640
Mo Xin Wei!

304
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:45,440
What the hell do you want?

305
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:47,376
You're still protecting her?

306
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,970
You love her?

307
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,536
There's something you probably
don't know yet!

308
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,320
She's your cousin!

309
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,956
She's the daughter of your uncle
Jiang He.

310
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,940
Mo Xin Wei, get the hell out of here!

311
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:01,676
What's wrong?

312
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,840
Now you feel embarrassed?

313
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:08,196
I was wondering why I thought you were
disgusting the first time I met you.

314
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,700
Looks like you are a bastard child!

315
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:12,400
How dare you hit me!

316
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:16,370
Stop fighting! Stop fighting!

317
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:40,650
Mr. Jiang.

318
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:43,840
Perhaps this isn't a bad thing.

319
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:45,106
Miss Chu Xia's identity

320
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:47,580
needed to be made public sooner or later.

321
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:58,086
Miss Xiang.

322
00:19:58,170 --> 00:19:59,226
Can we ask you a few questions?

323
00:19:59,310 --> 00:19:59,996
What is it?

324
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:00,996
Miss Xiang,

325
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:04,056
as a genius designer, why have you still
not released anything new?

326
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,376
There's a new star in the competition,

327
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,506
she's called An Chu Xia.

328
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:08,526
Does her appearance affect you
in any way?

329
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:09,686
I'm sorry, no comment.

330
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:12,480
Were you forced to drop out of school
because of your hand injury?

331
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,626
Can you continue creating new content with
your hand?

332
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:16,916
I'm sorry, sorry.

333
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,826
Miss Xiang hurt her hand
at my place while cooking.

334
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:21,850
Can you please answer a few...

335
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,380
So you've already noticed.

336
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:29,876
Thank you

337
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,460
for helping me out of that situation.

338
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,170
Is your right hand really incurable?

339
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,540
Mh.

340
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:38,440
I don't hold any hope for that anymore.

341
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,240
Chu Xia.

342
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:43,850
Could you please keep it secret?

343
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:45,446
Don't worry.

344
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:46,980
I will help you keep it secret.

345
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,680
You can't tell Qi Lu, either.

346
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,976
Your personality is even stronger
than mine.

347
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,716
You keep all the hurt inside.

348
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,550
You especially don't want the people you
love to share your burden.

349
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:01,460
Chu Xia.

350
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,400
If...

351
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:06,740
If there was no Qi Lu,

352
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:09,300
we'd be great friends,

353
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,280
wouldn't we?

354
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,240
Yes.

355
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,720
We definitely would.

356
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,276
But

357
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,450
it's not too late yet.

358
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,660
I'm going home.

359
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,280
Bye.

360
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:27,910
Chu Xia.

361
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,070
Let's talk.

362
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:35,330
There's nothing to talk about.

363
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,590
What if it's about Han Qi Lu?
