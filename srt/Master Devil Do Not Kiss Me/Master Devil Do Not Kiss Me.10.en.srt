1
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:23,250
Gosh! This is bad!

2
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:25,530
An Chu Xia.

3
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:28,680
You bully your classmates

4
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,560
and don't respect the teachers.

5
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,070
You have never realized your mistakes.

6
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:38,790
I always tolerate you and

7
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:40,970
think you're going to repent.

8
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:43,670
But you're getting worse.

9
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:46,070
You deceived me!

10
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:50,270
Come to my office later.

11
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:51,810
For the rest,

12
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,410
write a review of 5,000 words.

13
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:59,890
-5,000 words.
-Impossible.

14
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:01,250
-In English.
-English? Gosh!

15
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,590
The exhibition is over.

16
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:09,950
Principal, just a minute.

17
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:14,670
I just knew it. Chu Xia didn't
mean to fight against you.

18
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:19,230
You Tian.

19
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:22,230
As a teacher, you should teach
and educate your student.

20
00:01:22,392 --> 00:01:23,570
Yes, I got it.

21
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:27,670
How can you lead them to break
the school rules to hold an exhibition?

22
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:28,950
It's my fault.

23
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,050
I feel disappointed.

24
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:35,350
A fish rots from the head down.

25
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:39,330
If you set a bad example,
the students will follow your suit.

26
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:45,580
It had never happened when
Mr. Ma Jian Guo was here.

27
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,370
They used to be disciplined

28
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:50,420
and well-behaved.

29
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:52,830
Alright.

30
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:55,670
I'll guide them after this.
Don't be angry.

31
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:58,410
Look at you. You are out of your mind.

32
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:08,450
Honesty and trustworthiness are
the main objective of Stiland College.

33
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:09,150
Yes.

34
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:11,450
But you guys

35
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:15,830
hit classmates, cheat teachers,

36
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:17,800
act secretly,

37
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:20,140
bold and reckless.

38
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,890
I can't let it be.

39
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:28,330
As a principal,
I put a lot of hope on you.

40
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:31,780
I hope you'll pick yourself up one day.

41
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:35,530
But you guys make me disappointed.

42
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:42,120
So, I am going to punish Class B.

43
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:46,920
Principal, what are you
going to do with us?

44
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,350
We would not be
disciplined without rules.

45
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:56,430
Without improving your
endurance and determination,

46
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,920
you would not do better.

47
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:03,200
I decided to let you all
have a run on the field.

48
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,070
-Run?
-Run?

49
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:08,260
-50 laps for each person.
-50 laps?

50
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:12,590
Regardless of raining or
thunderstorm, you must finish it.

51
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:15,960
50 laps! That's it!

52
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:19,840
Principal.

53
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,210
You can't punish them.

54
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,820
Why not?

55
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:30,090
I've always regretted that

56
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:33,095
I didn't stand up to protect my student

57
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,410
when you punished An Chu Xia
during the gardening.

58
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:38,610
But today, I can't hide anymore.

59
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,530
Don't even run a lap.

60
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:42,210
You!

61
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:45,150
You're trying to rebel.

62
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,310
Nothing is wrong with my students.

63
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:50,600
They shouldn't be punished.

64
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:52,980
It's my fault.

65
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,476
My students have been
supporting firmly behind me.

66
00:03:58,701 --> 00:04:00,914
But I didn't support them.

67
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:07,110
Today, I'm going to stand up for them.
They're the best.

68
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:17,460
-We support Mr. You Tian!
-Support Mr. You Tian!

69
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,990
-Support Mr. You Tian!
-Enough!

70
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,500
Principal, did you sign the
letter of attorney for Chu Xia?

71
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,460
Yes, I've signed it.

72
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:38,373
But according to the school rules,

73
00:04:38,398 --> 00:04:40,734
students are not allowed to
deceive teachers.

74
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:47,100
There is a condition to let you
hold an exhibition here.

75
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:50,260
What's the condition?

76
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,270
Beg me.

77
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,000
Stop dreaming!

78
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,470
I mean, I won't allow it
even if you kneel on the ground

79
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,170
and beg me.

80
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:06,500
You want me to kneel? Are you dreaming?

81
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,990
Alright, An Chu Xia.

82
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:14,370
Let's fight one to one.

83
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,130
If you win, I'll leave with Class A now.

84
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:20,060
But if you lose,...

85
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:23,320
Come on, I'm not going to lose.
Let's fight.

86
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:26,270
Are you crazy?

87
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:30,680
This is a basketball court.
Let's fight in a basketball game.

88
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:34,040
Qi Lu, basketball...

89
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,430
Don't interrupt.

90
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:39,190
Chu Xia, think twice.

91
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:42,080
You failed in all the
subjects related to balls.

92
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,260
What do you want?

93
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:52,470
You win if you can shoot one ball
more than I do in 30 minutes.

94
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:58,220
Can I beg you now?

95
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:01,650
-Now?
-Stop dreaming!

96
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:04,490
Let's start.

00:07:01,805 --> 00:07:03,805
[Master Devil Do Not Kiss Me S1]

98
00:07:04,127 --> 00:07:04,836
[Episode 10]

99
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,640
-Relax.
-Hurry up.

100
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:09,670
Good luck!

101
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:13,700
Go for it! Don't be afraid!

102
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,060
Believe in yourself. Good luck!

103
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:19,550
-I must beat him down for Mr. You Tian.
-Go for it!

104
00:07:22,056 --> 00:07:23,556
-Go for it!
-Good luck!

105
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,720
She can't do it.

106
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,710
Do you know how to play it?

107
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,040
She can't do it.

108
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,120
That's right.

109
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,800
Give me five!

110
00:08:08,641 --> 00:08:09,741
-Well done!
-Good show!

111
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,560
She's going to lose.

112
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:46,710
-Go for it!
-Go for it!

113
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:17,980
I've never thought that
Han Qi Lu would stand up for me.

114
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:23,360
Of course, Qi Lu is on my side.

115
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:26,210
Han Qi Lu, bastard!

116
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:28,360
You are annoying!

117
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:30,800
Are you okay?

118
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:33,640
Go on the game. I've never been afraid!

119
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:38,640
No one knows who will
be the winner. Come on!

120
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,040
Go for it!

121
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:19,780
What's up? Surrender?

122
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:24,050
Don't make hard on yourself
if you can't do it.

123
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,760
-I told you to beg me.
-Shut up.

124
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,430
You're an inhuman.

125
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:31,630
Inhuman?

126
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,090
I wanted to tell you.

127
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:37,970
Let's play for the last game.

128
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:40,360
What do you mean?

129
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:43,130
It's so boring to beat you.

130
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,280
Let's make it more challenging.

131
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:51,780
If you could shoot a ball,
I'll leave the court to you.

132
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:52,680
Okay?

133
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:54,700
Really?

134
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,380
I always keep my promise.

135
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:09,900
Show us your power in Cat Ears Lane!

136
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:13,370
Go for it!

137
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:50,040
Chu Xia.

138
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,050
It's too accurate.

139
00:12:23,734 --> 00:12:24,534
She made it!

140
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,690
The match is over! Foul!

141
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:28,270
Foul!

142
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,950
Referee! Time's up!
The point doesn't count.

143
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:36,030
Who are you?

144
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:39,630
We don't need a judge
if you could make the call.

145
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,460
What now?

146
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,690
2 points!

147
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:47,520
-Rematch!
-Why?

148
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,910
If everyone doesn't agree with
the point, they must get a rematch.

149
00:12:51,154 --> 00:12:52,154
-Rematch!
-Rematch!

150
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,680
Who are you to make the decision?

151
00:12:55,751 --> 00:12:56,884
It doesn't count.

152
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:00,375
-Can you play it?
-Rematch!

153
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,480
I lost!

154
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:05,140
I bet, I pay.

155
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,410
Can't you hear it? I lost!

156
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:18,740
-Chu Xia, you're something!
-Awesome!

157
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:28,041
-You won!
-You are awesome!

158
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:39,850
Principal, I lost. Please let Class B
hold the art exhibition here.

159
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:41,420
See you.

160
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:54,250
Why are you walking so fast?

161
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:58,590
Don't think I've been beaten by Chu Xia.

162
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:03,570
You still remember that
I said you'd lose to Chu Xia.

163
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:08,570
I didn't lose.

164
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:11,060
Thank you for losing to her.

165
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,540
No, I didn't do that.

166
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,490
I just feel someone
is getting more bold now.

167
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,210
What do you mean?

168
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,390
Think about

169
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:27,270
the garbage can on the last door.

170
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:31,170
If it didn't hit Chu Xia,

171
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,320
who will be hit then?

172
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,730
There were only two of us at that time.

173
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,120
So I guess it is related to Xiao Xue.

174
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:47,770
Someone must have looked for
Xiao Xue and used her to do that.

175
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,600
Who is the mastermind?

176
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:54,720
Maybe more than one person.

177
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,510
No matter who it is,

178
00:14:58,430 --> 00:14:59,790
I can't spare him

179
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,540
as long as I find him out.

180
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:10,140
Principal, if someone could
violate the board's decision

181
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,790
for personal reasons,

182
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:16,020
it means the school rules
are meaningless and nominal.

183
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:18,950
An Chu Xia.

184
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,570
Although you won,

185
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:26,570
but you can't carry on the exhibition.

186
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:30,420
-But you promised us before.
-That's right.

187
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:35,470
I promised, but
the school rules don't allow it.

188
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:38,170
The school rules are
set by the school board.

189
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:41,830
Neither you nor me can decide it.

190
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:44,120
Little Chu Xia!

191
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,260
So sorry that I'm late
because of playing mahjong.

192
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:49,420
Aunt.

193
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,790
Hi, Mrs. Han.

194
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:54,900
What's going on?
It just began? Or it's over?

195
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:58,210
It's over before we start.

196
00:15:58,410 --> 00:15:59,670
What do you mean?

197
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:01,810
It's over before it starts?

198
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:02,880
Mrs. Han.

199
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:08,230
Who doesn't allow Chu Xia
to hold the exhibition?

200
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:10,720
Tell me! Who is that?

201
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,660
You know that

202
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,417
the school board has its own rules.

203
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:19,240
The big events must be studied

204
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:23,710
in the board meeting before we hold it.

205
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,960
Principal, you're right. That's true.

206
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:29,480
Sis Yuan Yuan.

207
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,050
Little Chu Xia.

208
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:34,700
The principal's right.
That's their rules.

209
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:37,230
-But...
-But...

210
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,200
Come in!

211
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:41,420
-Come on.
-Hurry up.

212
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:47,730
Now the board of directors are here.

213
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:50,840
We approve it now,
the exhibition can be carried out.

214
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:54,940
Aunt, I have a tea
ceremony lesson. I'll go first.

215
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,920
-No problem.
-I'll visit you next time.

216
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:04,410
Little Chu Xia,
I always keep my promise.

217
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:06,160
Thank you.

218
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:10,620
Let's start the exhibition.

219
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:12,680
-Okay?
-That's good!

220
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:17,350
The paintings are not bad. Take a look.

221
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:20,420
Didn't we see it in France last time?

222
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:24,920
Hi, Madam, please take a look at this.

223
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,540
Let me explain to you
about the artwork of Mr. You Tian.

224
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,690
It is avant-garde and

225
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:32,310
rich in imagination.

226
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:35,970
It's also unique among
modernist painters in China.

227
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:40,030
It has the potential for the future
as long as to increase in value.

228
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,200
Is it?

229
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,710
I heard the paintings are valuable

230
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,520
usually after the artist's death.

231
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,540
Mr. You Tian is so young.

232
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:52,960
That's not the point.

233
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,600
The fate is unpredictable.

234
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,700
He looks like a timid.

235
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:01,980
-Maybe one day...
-Come on, take a look.

236
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:04,280
This is a nice painting.

237
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:07,450
-Is it nice to hang it in the bedroom?
-It has an artistic sense.

238
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:10,960
I want to buy two paintings
on the right side.

239
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,940
I like the painting of the sea.

240
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,820
I have bought it.

241
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:18,390
-Don't argue.
-See you at the auction.

242
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:21,360
Don't argue. There are
so many paintings here.

243
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,430
Pick if from here.

244
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:28,080
Look at that. It's nice.

245
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:34,400
He's young. Will anything happen to him?

246
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,190
Let's get some men to kill him.

247
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:46,550
They are just joking. Take it easy.

248
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:50,080
I understand.

249
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:38,240
Chu Xia!

250
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:40,710
Did you hear that? Something happened.

251
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:44,800
Any boy smiled at you?
Or any guy followed behind you?

252
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,590
Don't interrupt.
This is something serious.

253
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:50,500
Mr. You Tian was fired by the principal.

254
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:57,860
Don't go to the principal's office.
Mr. You Tian has just left.

255
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,520
Mr. You Tian.

256
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:07,730
Are you leaving?

257
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,780
What's this?

258
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:18,240
Keep it.

259
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:21,710
All my paintings are sold out.

260
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:23,660
You don't have to compensate me.

261
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:28,090
You still have one.

262
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,690
I want it.

263
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:36,620
Although it is valuable for me,

264
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,920
but it doesn't cost that much.

265
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:45,010
Just keep the balance
as what I pay for the vase for An Chu Xia.

266
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:46,680
It's okay.

267
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,540
Give me the painting. And you keep this.

268
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,960
Okay. I'll keep it then.

269
00:20:58,610 --> 00:20:59,360
Qi Lu.

270
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:01,430
Thank you.

271
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:04,390
For what?

272
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:07,370
I've always been a timid teacher.

273
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:11,870
I've studied for so long over the years.

274
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:16,870
Now is the time for me
to go out and practice

275
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,890
and see the outside world.

276
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,840
That's good. You found your target.

277
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,600
Congratulations!

278
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:30,370
Qi Lu, thank you.
And I should thank Chu Xia too.

279
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:37,950
A man will only start
to appreciate after they lose it.

280
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,370
I treasure everything here.

281
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:48,480
I'm going to look for those
I've ever treasured the most.

282
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,600
Maybe it sounds funny.

283
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:54,470
But, that's my dream after all.

284
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:58,480
Qi Lu, you have to treasure
everything in front of you now.

285
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:04,930
I will.

286
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,420
See you.
