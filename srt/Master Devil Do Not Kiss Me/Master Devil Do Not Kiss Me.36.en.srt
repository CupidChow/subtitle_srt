Chu Xia, I'm sorry

5
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,730
to make you fight with Han Qi Lu.

6
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,100
You are my friend.

7
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,310
I should stand up and speak for you.

8
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:30,000
Moreover, we did not fight
just because of this alone.

9
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:31,450
What else?

10
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,680
I think I should give up.

11
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,800
Han Qi Lu should be with Xiang Man Kun.

12
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,910
I don't want to stay between them.

13
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,440
That's right.

14
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,040
But, I gave up on
the competition for Han Qi Lu.

15
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:52,160
I was so stupid.

16
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,010
It's not too late to realize it now.

17
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,450
Jiang Chen Chun?

18
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,800
Get ready for the competition.

19
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:04,430
Here you are.

20
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:07,930
Entry pass?

21
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:11,880
How did you make it?

22
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,560
Wow! You can take part
in the competition!

23
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:17,940
The competition
is organized by Jiangs Group.

24
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:18,930
It's no big deal.

25
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,150
Awesome!

26
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:25,320
Jiang Chen Chun, thank you so much.

27
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,130
Oh, my God!

28
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:28,720
Did you just hug me?

29
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:30,090
Yeah.

30
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,620
I don't know how to repay you.

31
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,050
No need, just give me a hug.

Chu Xia!

36
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,550
I want to know why you gave up

00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,580
such a good chance
to study at Pinkston Institute.

38

Some answers are only
for some particular people.

39
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:00,200
But, you aren't the person.

40
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,680
Go back, don't let people see you.

41

Hello.

00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:17,070
What?

43
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:20,090
You want me to be the judge of the competition?

No problem.

Sorry.

51

Sorry.

Is there really no other ways?

I can expect any surgery.

00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,500
Help me please, okay?

63
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:39,080
Really there is no other way.

64
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,370
Even if you find the best doctor in France,

they're gonna say the same.

It looks like nothing.

67
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,220
But you’re serious inside.

68
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,850
You have to accept the reality.

69
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:55,390

Xin Wei, how's your cousin
at school recently?

73
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:15,440
Pretty good.

74
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:18,510
He has been running after
a crazy girl all day like an idiot.

75
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:21,470
How can you say that about him?

76
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:23,380
Who's the crazy girl?

77
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:24,940
Is that the girl named...

78
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,530
Xia something?

79
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:27,830
Dad.

80
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,430
How did you know?

81
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:33,510
Your cousin requested an entry pass
of the Youth Design Competition

82
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:36,640
for his sweetheart two days ago.

83

He's just like his father.

84
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:40,810
They are love fools.

85
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:44,760
What entry pass?

86
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:49,940
The Youth Design Competition
which was organized by our group.

87
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:57,900
An Chu Xia.

88
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,140
Don't you know
you should give me face sometimes?

89
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:03,440
You threw a tantrum to me

90
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:06,550
even in public.

91
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,760
I am a famous person in the school.

92
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,810
You didn't even give me an out.

93
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,160
-Haha!
-Hey!

94

What are you doing?

95
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,840
Qi Lu, what are you doing?

96
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,920
Lend me for a while.

97

98
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,410

Han Qi Lu.

100
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,170
What do you want?

101
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:56,030
Don't you feel like
saying something to me?

102
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:57,470
Say what?

103
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:00,690
Say sorry to me.

104
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:02,210
Me?

105
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,030
Say sorry to you?

106
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:05,700
Am I crazy?

107
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:09,360
Okay.

108
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,270
Sit down.

109
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,350
Let's talk.

110
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,540
Come here and sit.

An Chu Xia.

112
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,940
I know you are loyal to your friends.

113
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:25,630
Those words just slipped out because you
tried to protect your friends.

114
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,370
But you shouldn't
put me to shame in public.

115
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,820
I had no way out.

116
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:44,780
What do you mean?

117
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:47,860
Jiang Chen Chun purposely
applied for the entry pass for me

118
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:50,410
using his relationship
with Jiangs Group.

119
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:54,330
So, I'll take part in this competition.

120
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:08,900
I'm so pissed off!

121
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,250
An Chu Xia got the entry pass.

122
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,890
There's nothing to be angry about.

123
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,830
This is what I expected.

124
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,000
Don't worry.

125
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,650
Your father would help.

126
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,760
My father?

127
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:24,270
What can he do?

128
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:28,600
All the judges are appointed
by Pinkston Institute.

129
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:32,340
None of them relate to Jiangs Group.

130
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,340
It's okay.

131
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:35,880
I've figured it out.

132
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,090
Do you know anyone?

133
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,450
A judge's pass?

134
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:47,790
Are you the judge of the competition?

135
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,350
Yes.

136
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,560
Did you hear it?

137
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,510
Xiang Man Kun is the
judge of the competition.

138
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,060
I didn't expect it.

139
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,880
An Chu Xia got the entry pass.

140
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,020
The judge stole
the contestant's registration form.

141
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,900
It's going to be a big show.

142
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,310
The most important thing is,

143
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:09,120
Mo Xin Wei exposed
Xiang Man Kui's trick.

144
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,570
What a scheming girl.

145
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:12,490
Yeah.

146
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:14,090
You know what.

147
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,930
Xiang Man Kun is the judge
of the competition.

148
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:19,210
Chu Xia.

149
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:20,690
You have to be careful.

150
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:24,270
I know. I heard everyone
talking about it in the morning.

151
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,750
She is a judge

152
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:27,950
while I'm a contestant.

153
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:29,790
Moreover, Mo Xin Wei is there too.

154
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,660
I only want to participate in it.
No other expectations.

155
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:36,670
Well...

156
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:38,180
Did Han Qi Lu know about it?

157
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,040
He...

158
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,790
Hi.

159
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:46,990
Qi Lu.

160
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:58,320
Come with me.

161
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,110
-Where are we going?
-To catch adultery.

162
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:00,900
Ah?

163
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,520
I think something's wrong
with his brain.

164
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,010
Is it good to do this?

165
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:13,070
If you don't keep an eye on them,
Han Qi Lu will be back to Xiang Man Kun.

166
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,330
I don't care.

167
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,950
I've given up anyway.

168
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:21,660
Wait. Didn't you want me to
be with Jiang Chen Chun?

169
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,170
Why do you focus on Han Qi Lu?

170
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:27,520
It's all about
the aggressiveness of a woman.

171
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,630
I just don't like Xiang Man Kun.

172
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,040
So, I want you to defeat her.

173
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:32,740
Got it?

174
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,350
So called principled.

175
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:36,280
What are you doing?

176
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:41,650
Why are you messing around again?

177
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,580
You haven't answered me yet.
What are you doing?

178
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:50,800
Han Qi Lu.

179
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,660
Hey!

180
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:52,780
Han Qi Lu.

181
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:56,640
Why are you here?

182
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,210
Let's talk.

183
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:03,390
About what?

184
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,180
About Chu Xia's future.

185
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,840
Stop bullshitting! Let's go.

186
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,880
Hurry!

187
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,920
I'm serious.

188
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,090
Han Qi Lu.

189
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:13,930
In order to let Chu Xia
focus on her design

190
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:16,360
and get well-prepared,
I have arranged a hotel room for her.

191
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,530
Hope you don't stop her.

192
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:19,310
Ah?

193
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,400
When did you do this?

194
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:25,190
Why didn't you discuss with me?

195
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:28,590
An Chu Xia.

196
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:30,360
Is this what you want?

197
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:32,410
Qi Lu.

198
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,780
Since Chu Xia wants to study abroad,

199
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,020
you should support her.

200
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:37,880
Moreover,

201
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,320
she will come back.

202
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:41,060
Right? Chu Xia?

203
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:43,600
It depends.

204
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,840
If Chu Xia wins the championship,

205
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,680
she can directly fly to France

206
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,150
and doesn't need
to stay at someone else's house.

207
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,300
Actually,...

208
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:57,710
What happened?

209
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:58,930
Where did you hurt?

210
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:00,920
Which hand?

211
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,310
It's okay.

212
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:09,630
I'll move my things tonight.

213
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,360
Are you sure?

214
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:17,550
Sure.

215
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,920
Chu Xia!

216
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,180
Chu Xia!

217
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:54,270
How do you feel? Are you happy with it?

218
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:03,580
Thank you. You helped me with the
registration and arranged the hotel.

219
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:04,880
I don't know how to...

220
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,970
Stop it.

221
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,080
If you say it,

222
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,280
I think you don't really
take me as a friend.

223
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:12,510
Alright.

224
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,010
Go.

225
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,180
So heavy.

226
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,540
The important surprise is coming.

227
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,240
Come on.

228
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:22,350
3!

229
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:23,380
2!

230
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:23,990
1!

231
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:25,140
Surprise!

232
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:29,710
Come on.

233
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,060
Come on.

234
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,090
This is the main focus.

235
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:36,650
Come on.

236
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:38,660
Ms. An.

237
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,510
Have a seat.

238
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,300
Look.

239
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,060
Papers

240
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,030
and pens.

241
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,450
I have prepared it for you.
It's late now.

242
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:53,790
I should let you unpack your stuff.

243
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:54,530
I'm off.

244
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:56,770
Call me if you need help.

245
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:58,800
You have my number!

246
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,180
Remember to call me!

247
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:02,640
Bye!

248
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:17,540
Dear teachers and students,
good afternoon!

249
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,090
Chu Xia! Chu Xia!

250
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:25,870
Welcome to the first round of the
Pinkston Youth Design Competition!

251
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:29,440
The first round is actually very simple.

252
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,570
In front of every contestant,

253
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:35,340
there is a white T-shirt and a box of pigment.

254
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,980
After the competition begins,

255
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,030
the contestants have to paint

256
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:43,190
on the white T-shirt with the colours
within an hour.

257
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:46,530
Paint it with the most
creative and coolest pattern.

258
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:49,070
The top 15 contestants

259
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:52,120
will enter the next round
of competition.

260
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,550
Dear contestants, are you ready?

261
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:57,550
Let's start now.

262
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:33,820
A simple pattern can
hardly decide the winner.

263
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,720
It's about being creative
instead of skillful after all.

264
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,160
As the minutes ticked away,

265
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,340
we can see all the contestants

266
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,570
are making tense creation.

267
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:45,240
Since the theme is "The Coolest",

268
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,330
well...

269
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:47,820
I got an idea.

270
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,230
What is Chu Xia doing?

271
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,650
It's about time.

272
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:25,610
Let's countdown together.

273
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,720
5.

274
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,890
4.

275
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,040
3.

276
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,050
2.

277
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,070
1.

278
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:32,450
Time's up.

279
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:36,630
Who can make it to our finals?

280
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:38,470
Let's wait and see!

281
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:42,670
First of all, I'll let the contestants
show you their works.

282
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,040
Then,

283
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:49,310
the judges will review
and rate their works.

284
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:25,500
Dear teachers and students,
welcome back to our competition.

285
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,700
Now I'm holding the name list
of the contestants

286
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,220
who make it to our semi finals.

287
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,490
After a unanimous discussion
of all the judges,

288
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:34,567
the contestants who make
into the semi finals

289
00:17:34,592 --> 00:17:37,310
of Pinkston Youth
Design Competition are...

290
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:38,010
How is it?

291
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:39,730
Ming Yue.

292
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,360
Jia Jia.

293
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:43,190
Mo Xin Wei.

294
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,410
An Chu Xia.

295
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:46,850
Li Dan.

296
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:49,050
Wang Jia Xin.

297
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:51,380
Yang Hai Chen.

298
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,800
Liu Shao Zhuo.

299
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,450
And the first place winner

300
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:59,090
in the first round is

301
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:00,730
An Chu Xia.

302
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:02,330
Congratulations! An Chu Xia!

303
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,780
Chu Xia! Chu Xia!

304
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:10,750
Congratulations!

305
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:17,870
Once again we congratulate
all the outstanding contestants.

306
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:22,760
See you in the Pinkston Youth
Design Competition!

307
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,030
Chu Xia!

308
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:38,780
You're awesome!

309
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,230
Chu Xia.

310
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:47,130
Congratulations!

311
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:48,410
You won the first place.

312
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:51,110
The competition has just ended.
Where did you get the flower?

313
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:53,520
He prepared it before the competition.

314
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,120
He said you'd be the first place.

315
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:57,640
Really?

316
00:18:57,890 --> 00:18:59,580
Thank you.

317
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:12,090
Congratulations! Congratulations!

318
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:14,180
What's wrong with
the taste of the judges?

319
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,780
How could they give her high scores?

320
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:18,100
What's the point of you getting mad?

321
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:20,010
Your painting is not as good as hers.

322
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:22,230
You have painted a simple picture.

323
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,580
We focus on creativity in the competition.

324
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:27,140
You stuck in the mud.

325
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,160
I'll tell you what.

326
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,310
A fashion designer

327
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:33,020
is different from a painter.

328
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:35,850
What should I do then?

329
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,770
In that case,

330
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:39,280
I'll lose the competition.

331
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:40,800
Relax.

332
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,160
I'll be there.

333
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:45,690
What's the use?

334
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:47,080
You were there today.

335
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,990
But the judges still let
An Chu Xia get the first place.

336
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:54,480
The precondition of a cooperation
is trust. If you don't believe me,

337
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,550
just do it alone.

338
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:59,940
Tell me your idea.

339
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,670
Mom.

340
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,880
I'm finally one step closer to my dream.

341
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:26,080
Do you miss me?

342
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:31,570
I miss you very much.

343
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,600
"Good luck in your competition!"
