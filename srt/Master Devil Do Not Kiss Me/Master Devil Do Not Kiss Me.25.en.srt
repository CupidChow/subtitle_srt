1
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:16,780
There's a new transfer student.

2
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,080
I don't know when he will come.

3
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,330
I don't know either,
but hope he's a handsome guy.

4
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:23,870
-That's right.
-I heard a rumor.

5
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:25,370
It's a girl.

6
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:27,660
-Oh!
-I wonder what she looks like.

7
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,610
I hope she's a beauty.

8
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:30,370
Handsome guy.

9
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:32,880
I want a handsome guy.

10
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,240
Today,

11
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,380
I'll introduce a new classmate to you.

12
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,080
Let's give her an applause.

13
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:03,690
Hello everyone,
my name is Xiang Man Kui.

14
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,650
Xiang Man Kui, sit there.

15
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:16,730
Hi.

16
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:19,000
Hi.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,330
My name is An Chu Xia.

18
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,840
Nice to meet you.

[Episode 2]

21
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,940
Are you all right?

22
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,080
9 borders and 7 cities.

23
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:17,500
The History of the Great Wall
talks about the 9 borders...

24
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,060
But a year ago,

25
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,570
Xiang Man Kui suddenly left silently.

26
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:27,970
She didn't leave a word to Qi Lu.

27
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:30,720
It was a big blow to Qi Lu.

28
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:36,060
Then, Qi Lu was getting more
and more cold-hearted

29
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,680
and isolated.

30
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,020
Twinkle, twinkle little star.

31
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:44,830
How I wonder what you are?

32
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:46,490
Who asked you to sing it?

33
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,710
Who asked you to sing this song?

34
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,610
The formalities are done.

35
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:13,540
Come on.

36
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:15,810
Here you go.

37
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:17,930
Thank you, Mr. Ma.

38
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:19,400
You are welcome.

39
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,180
I'm so happy that

40
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,850
you come back to Stiland College.

41
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:26,960
I believe the joining of
a design genius like you

42
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,840
will help promote the art courses
of our college in the future.

43
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:33,560
Don't say that, I'm flattered.

44
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,860
But why did you

45
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:40,330
give up the chance to study
at Stiland Headquarter in England

46
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:42,200
and choose to return home?

47
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:44,360
Hmm.

48
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:48,240
There is something in our life

49
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:51,100
that we only know what we give up

50
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:54,050
when we hold it in our hand.

51
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,520
What we give up...

52
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:00,760
If there's nothing else,
I'll go back to the classroom first.

53
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:02,490
Alright, go ahead.

54
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:03,630
See you.

55
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,650
Chu Xia.

56
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,520
Can I call you Chu Xia?

57
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:19,640
You're living in Qi Lu's house now, right?

58
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:23,590
Isn't Qi Lu's mother nice?

59
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:28,060
Butler Han is still enthusiastic, right?

60
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:29,800
By the way,

61
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,950
are Xiao Cui and Xiao Lian still there?

62
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,420
Chu Xia, are you all right?

63
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,040
Why did you pinch her hand?

64
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:39,830
You are?

65
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,430
I'm Jiang Chen Chuan.

66
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:42,890
I'm Chu Xia's friend.

67
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,450
A close friend.

68
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,810
I'm off.

69
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:51,310
That's smart of her.

70
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:54,020
How could you disappear
in a blink of an eye?

71
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,500
Do you know how dangerous it is?

72
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,130
I hate chatterbox!

73
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,540
Chu Xia.

74
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:14,840
Who's this?

75
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:17,000
-It's you.
-It's you.

76
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,690
Are you sick? What are you doing
with the balls under the sun?

77
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:20,970
I'll tell you what.

78
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:23,270
I'm here to be a scout.

79
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,240
There are too many psychos at your school.

80
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,380
I'll tell you what.

81
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,960
I promised my mother-in-law...

82
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,750
I mean An Chu Xia's mother,

83
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:33,530
Mrs. An

84
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,560
that I must protect Chu Xia.

85
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,770
You still like Chu Xia, huh?

86
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,000
You haven't showed up when I liked her.

87
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,920
It's Season 2 now. I've had
a crush on her since Season 1.

88
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:47,250
You couldn't manage
to get her since Season 1.

89
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,760
How dare you insult me?
Such a useless guy!

90
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:51,740
-Useless!
-Let's go somewhere else.

91
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:54,080
-Where?
-Over there.

92
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:56,080
Wait.

93
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:01,210
I heard

94
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:07,440
Xiang Man Kui won
the Youth Design Competition.

95
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,360
Wow!

96
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:09,790
Well...

97
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,300
She has a beautiful face,

98
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,110
but insists to make
a living by her talent.

99
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,630
-Believe it?
-No, I don't.

100
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:21,000
Let's take a look.

101
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,800
Okay.

102
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,280
Let's go.

103
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,220
Come on.

104
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,140
The guys are so tiresome.

105
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:39,400
Xin Wei.

106
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,750
I don't think Xiang Man Kui
can be your match.

107
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:44,600
Not to mention others,

108
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,110
in terms of family background,

109
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,620
she's totally not your match.

110
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:50,990
If it wasn't for Qi Lu,

111
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:52,430
she couldn't enter...

112
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,220
You are getting more and
more talkative recently.

113
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:31,810
I'll tell you what.

114
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,050
There was a gangster

115
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:36,440
in the Cat Ears Lane

116
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:40,330
who used to bully Chu Xia with his gang.

117
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:42,040
Guess what happened?

118
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:42,840
What happened?

119
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,510
Chu Xia managed to wipe them out

120
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:47,280
without my help.

121
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,320
Really?

122
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,560
Chu Xia became famous
because of this matter.

123
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,050
Her story made people sympathetic.

124
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,330
But,

125
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,480
to deal with Chu Xia,

126
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,440
you have to walk a fine line.

127
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,150
Got it?

128
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,250
What line?

129
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,370
Want to know?

130
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,160
Say it!

131
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:17,070
This is a secret book of my ancestry.

132
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,810
Back then, it helped me deal with

133
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:22,580
the girls all over Cat Ears Lane.

134
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:23,880
How?

135
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:31,400
It's full of your sweat.

136
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,170
Look.

137
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:34,330
18 Ways To Get A Girl?

138
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:36,140
And it's a wrong spelling here!

139
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,030
Ancestry of Feng Shao, huh?

140
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:41,560
I didn't show it to other people.

141
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:43,770
Do you want it?

142
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:44,520
Give me back!

143
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:46,040
I want it!

144
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:49,480
Walk a fine line?

145
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,880
Walk a fine line.

146
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,170
I got it!

147
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:57,300
Feng Shao!

148
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,220
What school is this?

149
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,600
What did the idiot get?

150
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,090
Excuse me!

151
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,610
Don't go near An Chu Xia.

152
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,300
Jiang Chen Chuan, what are you wearing?

153
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,610
What a cool style!

154
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:36,570
Be serious.

155
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:38,230
I'll tell you what.

156
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:39,710
After the kidnapping,

157
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:40,980
I officially announce that

158
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:44,180
I am now Chu Xia's bodyguard.

159
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:49,120
Before you approach her, you have
to go through my check first. Okay?

160
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:52,840
Don't laugh.

161
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:57,090
You!

162
00:10:57,970 --> 00:10:58,570
Get lost.

163
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:00,940
Get lost.

164
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,910
I'll still protect you anyway.

165
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,200
Jiang Chen Chuan becomes
An Chu Xia's bodyguard.

166
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,110
-Really?
-I heard

167
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:16,890
one must go through the underwear
check before meeting her.

168
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:18,160
I didn't expect it.

169
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,820
What a great change!

170
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:20,680
What's wrong?

171
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,940
I thought Han Qi Lu and
An Chu Xia were a couple.

172
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,730
I heard Han Qi Lu was hurt badly
in order to save her.

173
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:28,380
Xiang Man Kui was back
to Stiland College yesterday.

174
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:31,070
So, Qi Lu will go back
to the princess's arms.

175
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,460
No wonder.

176
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,860
By the way,

177
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,000
who is Jiang Chen Chuan?

178
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,260
I have no idea.

179
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,050
What's this?

180
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:41,740
Kelp, you want it?

181
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,930
-Let's go to the field later.
-Okay.

182
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,570
Qi Lu.

183
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:55,380
I heard that you were injured.

184
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,540
I brought it back from England.

185
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,690
It is said to be effective for wounds.

186
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,370
Let me apply it for you.

187
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:07,820
No need.

188
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,940
Chu Xia has dressed it for me.

189
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,080
An Chu Xia?

190
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:16,640
I heard Jiang Chen Chuan from Class B

191
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:21,820
has been protecting
An Chu Xia closely recently.

192
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:23,780
What do you think

193
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:25,790
about their relationship?

194
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,460
Are you feeling bored?

195
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,610
Chu Xia.

196
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:49,210
I have something...

197
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,360
Hey!

198
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,180
What do you want?

199
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,810
Jiang Chen Chuan, that's enough.

200
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:53,770
What's up?

201
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,770
From this morning until now,
you scared away 15 people,

202
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:58,390
including an intern teacher,

203
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:00,810
two school directors and three cleaners.

204
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:03,330
The rest are the passers-by.

205
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,930
Do you think anyone
will talk to me if this goes on?

206
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:07,610
I'm here to protect you.

207
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:10,970
The guy looks suspicious.
Must be something fishy on his mind.

208
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:12,660
Hey, come here.

209
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,860
Anything I can help?

210
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,810
I just want to ask if you still want the magazine
"How to Increase Height" next semester?

211
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:22,080
I have to report it to the teacher.

212
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,250
I'll pass.

213
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,460
Okay, you may leave now.

214
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:29,900
Misunderstanding.

215
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,540
Don't run!

216
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,180
Wait for me!

217
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:40,520
Young master, do we need
to wait for Ms. Chu Xia?

218
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,800
Relax. You always want
to wait for her, don't you?

219
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,160
Jiang Chen Chuan!

220
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:46,640
What's up?

221
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,570
That's enough!

222
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:53,370
I just want to wipe your sweat.

223
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:54,950
Young master.

224
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,520
Girls are born to be coaxed!

225
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,200
Chu Xia! Don't run!

226
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,730
You lose.

227
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,160
What do you mean?

228
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,970
Stop pretending like a fool.

229
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:12,110
I won the Campus Beauty Contest.

230
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:15,810
Don't pretend! That doesn't count!
Something happened to Chu Xia that day.

231
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,090
Something happened?

232
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,440
I guess you ran away because
you dared not compete against me.

233
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,420
An Chu Xia, remember that.

234
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:27,330
A pheasant is always a pheasant.
Don't ever dream to be a phoenix.

235
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:28,960
What did you say?

236
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,410
What are you doing?

237
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:31,490
Look carefully.

238
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:33,810
I'll protect her after this.

239
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:37,810
What are you laughing at?

240
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:38,870
Nothing.

241
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:41,640
No, I just think it suits your taste.

242
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,800
You think you have a good taste?
You like who...

243
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,910
Han Qi Lu.

244
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:49,500
He's tall and thin, nothing's
special about him. Just like you.

245
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,230
Qi Lu is handsome, not like you!

246
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:52,760
What?

247
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,440
Do you think you look good in this?

248
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,550
Look at your glasses.

249
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:58,680
So called bodyguard, huh?

250
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,200
Hey!

251
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,430
Except my height, which part of me
doesn't look like a bodyguard?

252
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:03,290
Want to beat me?

253
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:05,100
-What now?
-What's wrong with me?

254
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:08,550
You've been bullying me
since I was young. What do you want?

255
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,520
Young Master.

256
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,630
You may call Ms. Chu Xia

257
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:20,490
if you still feel worried.

258
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,520
I'm not worried about her.

259
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:24,730
I told you.

260
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:27,480
You must do something to coax her.

261
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:30,660
Uncle Han.

262
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,210
You've talked too much.

263
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:37,780
Well...

264
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,560
How do I coax her?

265
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,760
I'm sorry.

266
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:46,120
I've talked too much.

267
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,690
Uncle Han.

268
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:52,840
Wait.

269
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:55,910
Here you go.

270
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:00,680
Give it to me.

271
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,800
Ms. Chu Xia will like it very much

272
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:10,840
after seeing this.

273
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,120
There was a secret of our ancestry

274
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,790
about How To Get A Girl.

275
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:23,080
Since you are full of strategies,
why are you still single?

276
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:25,390
Heh!

277
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:40,700
Did he catch us up?

278
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:44,100
Jiang Chen Chuan is really sick.

279
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,390
Chu Xia.

280
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:51,000
From what Jiang Chen Chuan's doing,

281
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,960
I think he likes you.

282
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,960
How could it be?

283
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,260
Cut the crap!

284
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:00,160
Maybe he was provoked by Gao Gan
and wanted to act like a hero.

285
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:00,960
Don't worry.

286
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,800
I'll help you get him.

287
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:05,110
I don't want to get him.

288
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:06,180
I don't like him.

289
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:06,970
But,

290
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:08,460
you said you liked him.

291
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:12,130
I like all the handsome guys.

292
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:14,350
Remember? I had a crush on Ling Han Yu.

293
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:15,580
But, yesterday...

294
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:17,620
Chu Xia, just forget it.

295
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:19,180
Look over there!

296
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,140
A handsome guy!

297
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,320
So handsome!

298
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,470
Ms. An Chu Xia.

299
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:26,900
My boss wants to see you.

300
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:31,530
This way please.

301
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:34,700
Who are you?

302
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,090
Are you instructed by Gao Gan?

303
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,150
Who are you? Let me go!

304
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:45,800
Why did you catch me?

305
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,920
Who are you?

306
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:57,000
Let me go!

307
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,840
Ms. An Chu Xia.

308
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:00,340
You are too noisy.

309
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,440
I'm sorry.

310
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,820
What are you doing?

311
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,480
I'm talking to you!

312
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:19,940
Yo!

313
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:24,400
Such a beautiful girl.

314
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,480
What a rogue!

315
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,600
But with a good taste.

316
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,200
An Chu Xia.

317
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,160
Yes, I am.

318
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:54,500
Did you bring me here

319
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:57,240
just to appraise me?

320
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,900
If there's nothing else,

321
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:02,520
I have to go as I was boiling
chicken soup at home.

322
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:10,880
What is he trying to do?

323
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,840
Splash water over me? No...

324
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:16,280
Is he trying to hit my head with a cup?

325
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,350
What an old rogue!

326
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,010
He's coming.

327
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:30,290
Grandpa!

328
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,080
Grandpa?

329
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:38,040
Grandpa!

330
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,490
How could you kidnap Chu Xia?

331
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,500
That's enough.

332
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,210
Grandpa Ling.

333
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:44,730
Sorry to have offended you.

334
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:47,230
I didn't know that you were
Han Yu's grandfather

335
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:48,930
and almost hit you.

336
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:50,330
I'm sorry.

337
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:52,490
Do you think

338
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:55,430
you can solve it by just saying sorry?

339
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:57,010
Grandpa.

340
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,240
I just wanted to see
who makes my grandson hurt.

341
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:06,550
I wanted to catch her
and give her a lesson.

342
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:08,440
Unexpectedly,

343
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,920
you are really something.

344
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:15,170
You are beautiful

345
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:17,440
and able to stay calm in danger.

346
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,460
You can even think of a way to resist.

347
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,440
Well...

348
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,320
After your graduation,

349
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,800
you can marry Han Yu to be
my granddaughter-in-law.

00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,960
-What?
-What?
