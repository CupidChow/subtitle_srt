1
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:16,590
Jiang Chen Chuan.

2
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:18,950
The exam is coming soon.
You'd better work hard.

3
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:20,530
I'll keep an eye on you.

4
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:26,120
-Do you know the Campus Beauty Contest?
-Yeah.

5
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,420
By the way, give me the formula that
I asked you to copy yesterday.

6
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,290
Here you are.

7
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,260
Will you take part?

8
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:40,510
It's meant for beauties, why should I go?
I don't want to be a joke.

9
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:44,350
Even Ming Yue and Cai Xia
take part in it. Why don't you go?

10
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:47,780
Jiang Chen Chuan.

11
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,000
Who  are you teasing?

12
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,160
What did you mean by
even the two of us take part in it?

13
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,160
I didn't mean that.

14
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,790
I mean, you all are good friends.

15
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,330
-So you should go together.
-Let go of the boy!

16
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:06,280
Let me see.

17
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,240
Does it hurt?

18
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,760
Let me blow on it.

19
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,090
It's itchy.

20
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:13,570
Cut it out.

21
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:14,570
Where do you feel itchy?

22
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:16,830
Your heart?

23
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,040
You are so naughty.

24
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,760
You're so strong.

25
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,080
How dare you laugh?

26
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:24,970
Don't say that.

27
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:28,360
I'm a weak woman.

28
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:31,820
Everybody on the Earth knows it.

29
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,450
Chu Xia, I'm serious.

30
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,070
Mo Xin Wei took part too.

31
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,910
Why don't you go too? Demoralize her.

32
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:38,870
Otherwise, she'll be arrogant.

33
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,080
That's right.

34
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,100
You hit me for her, huh?

35
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,540
I hit you for this!

36
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,550
How many helpers did you get?

37
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:52,870
The colors are all different.

38
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:55,080
I asked you to copy the formula,
not a text.

39
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,580
Is that so hard for you?

40
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,160
What about this?

41
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,720
If you promise me to join
the Campus Beauty Contest,

42
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,560
I'll work hard then.

43
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,380
Alright?

44
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,290
Deal!

45
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:10,440
So cool!

46
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,700
The consequences of entering
the Campus Beauty Contest

47
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:18,460
is better than being
punished by Ma Jian Guo anyway.

48
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:20,520
You are right.

49
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:23,230
I like girls with logical minds like you.

50
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,570
I like girls with logical minds like me too.

51
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:28,640
So,

52
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:30,880
go back and write 100 times.

53
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,340
No helpers are allowed!

54
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,420
You guys love hitting me.

55
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,860
Chen Chuan.

56
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:51,950
Where are you going?

57
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:53,540
I'll go with you.

58
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,400
Where are you going?

59
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,800
I want to have a pee.

60
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:00,200
Want to go together?

61
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:03,280
You're naughty!

62
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:05,770
Let's go.

63
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:11,070
Rational and irrational numbers are
commonly referred to as real numbers.

64
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:14,810
Usually R is used to represent
the whole real numbers.

65
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:16,400
Elementary function.

66
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,335
It is a function of one variable

67
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,630
which is the composition

68
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:26,400
of a finite number
of arithmetic operations.

69
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:32,040
An operation of a finite number of
constant and basic elementary functions.

70
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:44,870
Are you okay?

71
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,710
My hand got burned by water.

72
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,070
What are you talking about?

73
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,700
English.

74
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,100
Oh, my God!

75
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,870
The reversed order of circulation x equals to...

76
00:05:12,205 --> 00:05:14,472
[Master Devil Do Not Kiss Me S1]

77
00:05:14,509 --> 00:05:15,309
[Episode 20]

78
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,220
Get ready for your exam.

79
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,280
Oh, my God! Look at it!

80
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,320
Here I am! Here I am!

81
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,960
-That's great!
-Look at it.

82
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,890
Chu Xia got the first place!

83
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:44,640
Let's tell her!

84
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,090
Hurry!

85
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:47,220
I'm so happy!

86
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,260
-Pinch me.
-Gosh!

87
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:51,080
-It's real.
-Oh, it's real!

88
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,280
I don't know what
they're giggling about.

89
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:00,440
I guess they passed it.

90
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,680
It's hard for them
to pass the exam after all.

91
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:04,280
-Let's go.
-Come on.

92
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:08,760
I wonder what makes
the three weirdos giggle about.

93
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,860
Don't bother.

94
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:12,970
Check the announcement for me.
Help me check on Qi Lu's result.

95
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:13,930
Okay.

96
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:18,190
Excuse me!

97
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,320
Xin Wei.

98
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:25,940
I can't believe...

99
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:30,130
What's going on?
You look like seeing a ghost.

100
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,440
Class B got the first place.

101
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,540
What?

102
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,280
How could it be?

103
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,540
It's not the first place
in the city though.

104
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,650
They beat Class A, of course
they got the first place of the city.

105
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,260
Because...

106
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,240
-Excuse me!
-Don't push.

107
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,730
Look at this.

108
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,960
"Han Qi Lu 0"
"Ling Han Yu 0"

109
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:56,910
An Chu Xia's done as she didn't
get the first place of the city.

110
00:07:56,932 --> 00:07:57,432
Yeah.

111
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,800
This is the only
good news I heard today.

112
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,200
Let's go.

113
00:08:05,845 --> 00:08:06,678
"Infirmary"

114
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:23,990
Does it hurt?

115
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:25,690
Not really.

116
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,660
You're recovering well, don't worry.

117
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,150
Thank you.

118
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:35,600
You are welcome. It's my job.

119
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:39,970
I heard you made a bet with Chu Xia.

120
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:42,160
She lost.

121
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:47,590
But you don't look happy.

122
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,830
Should I be happy?

123
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:52,290
Maybe.

124
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:54,610
The students said,

125
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,730
you seem to hate Chu Xia very much.

126
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:00,500
Only you and You Tian like her.

127
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:05,480
She's willful, unruly and always
challenges the authority.

128
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:07,440
Not even like a student.

129
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,700
Maybe because You Tian and I

130
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,760
are not competent teachers.

131
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:19,040
We don't know how a likeable
student should look like.

132
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:25,530
Obedient, sensible and good at study.

133
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:27,650
Unite the students and

134
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:28,730
respect the teachers.

135
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,730
It's not hard to do that.

136
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,480
Mr. Ma.

137
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:37,830
What do you think of this wall?

138
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,680
It's just a common wall.

139
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,250
What about this?

140
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,100
Just get straight to the point.

141
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,840
Common is a bit monotonous.

142
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,740
A little special occasionally

143
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:03,320
can improve the overall style.

144
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,760
Right?

145
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,860
Are you trying to plead for An Chu Xia?

146
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,860
Plead for Chu Xia?

147
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:13,720
No, I'm not.

148
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,720
I'm just talking about the wall.

149
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:24,240
I feel like it doesn't fit the wall.

150
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,170
Forget it.

151
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:27,800
I'll take it off.

152
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,930
Wait a moment.

153
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,410
Just leave it there.

154
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,400
Mr. Ma.

155
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:36,660
You have a good taste.

156
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:41,570
Was it drawn by You Tian?

157
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,240
Why did you get zero in your test?

158
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,230
I told you

159
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,760
I could do anything for Chu Xia.

160
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:08,000
If I'm not mistaken, I also told you

161
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:12,840
that I'd protect Chu Xia.

162
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:15,600
Young Master Han.

163
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,320
Why did you get zero in your test?

164
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,410
Me?

165
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,380
Don't you know my mom?

166
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,170
She always says that
I can't be too perfect.

167
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:31,520
She asks me to give ways to the others.

168
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,880
So, I didn't plan to get a full score.

169
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:39,880
To me, all the marks are the same
if I can't get a full score.

170
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:44,280
No other reason except your mom?

171
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:49,160
There is a reason.

172
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,460
It's all because of you.

173
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,190
I know you don't want her to leave.

174
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:02,240
Bear in mind, no next time!

175
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,140
No next time.

176
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,770
But,

177
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,760
although Class B got
the first place in the school,

178
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,440
they have yet to be
the first of the city.

179
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:21,210
In that case, An Chu Xia
is going to lose to Ma Jian Guo.

180
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,110
I'll protect her.

181
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,990
Don't worry.

182
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:32,790
Okay.

183
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:36,710
Tell me anytime you need help.

184
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,040
Thank you.

185
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,800
I'm willing to help because of you.

186
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,190
Thank you.

187
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,880
Mr. Ma.

188
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:07,690
Mr. Ma.

189
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:15,390
I'm willing to bear
all the consequences of losing.

190
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:18,970
So you're willing to bear it, huh?

191
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:21,720
Take the punishment then!

192
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:27,300
Mr. Ma!

193
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:30,040
-Mr. Ma!
-Please don't kick Chu Xia out!

194
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,020
Yeah! It's not easy for us
to get such a good result.

195
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,190
Please let her off!

196
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:35,630
Yeah! Mr. Ma.

197
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:37,930
-Please spare her.
-We can do everything for her.

198
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:40,850
Mr. Ma, if you kick Chu Xia out,

199
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:42,050
we'll leave together.

200
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:43,050
Go ahead.

201
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:44,580
-Go ahead.
-Nonsense!

202
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:47,470
You think you can make the decision?

203
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,140
Who am I then?

204
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,490
No one wants to kick her out.

205
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,600
I've never asked you to come.

206
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,130
Get out!

207
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:59,220
Get out!

208
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:07,850
Mr. Ma.

209
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:11,290
What are you going
to do with Chu Xia?

210
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:14,330
You don't say!

211
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:16,180
She's not pretty and got small boobs.

212
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:18,440
You can't kick her out.

213
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,230
That's right, don't kick her out.

214
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:22,980
Meng Xiao Nan.

215
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,290
Get out!

216
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:27,850
Jiang Chen Chuan, take her out.

217
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:29,450
Let's go.

218
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:31,150
-Chu Xia.
-We're off.

219
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,670
We'll wait for you outside.

220
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,650
An Chu Xia.

221
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,340
I'm a teacher.

222
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,340
To me,

223
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:48,410
nothing could make me happier
besides seeing my students improve.

224
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,830
I used to be worried

225
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,520
that you'd spoil my students.

226
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:59,670
It seems I shouldn't have
been worried about it.

227
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,820
Mr. Ma.

228
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:05,830
-So?
-So,

229
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:08,420
you should accept your punishment.

230
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:13,780
You'll be the monitor
of Class B from now on.

231
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:18,500
Unite everybody in Class B
who was unable to cooperate before.

232
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,240
Roger! Mr. Ma!

233
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,620
Go ahead.

234
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,440
Why are you here?

235
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,800
It's me who should ask you the question.

236
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,090
I was here to see Mr. Ma
because of the deal.

237
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:43,520
-I thought I'd be expelled.
-You are my people.

238
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:46,480
He has to ask me before chasing you out.

239
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,370
Again the same question here!
How much shall I pay

240
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:51,490
-to redeem Chu Xia?
-Stop!

241
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:53,810
Even if you are rich,

242
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:55,760
please take me as a human being.

243
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:01,840
Chu Xia!

244
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,780
There's a letter for you!

245
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,000
Chu Xia, I have to get going now.

246
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,450
Chu Xia, let's go
for dinner tonight. See you.

247
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,410
Here.

248
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,510
I saw Jiang Chen Chuan
and Young Master Ling.

249
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:16,920
How come they are gone
in the blink of an eye?

250
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,850
You're finally here.

251
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,520
Thank you, Xiao Nan.

252
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,990
-Thanks for helping me get rid of them.
-You're welcome, we're good friends.

253
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:27,000
Of course I'll get rid...

254
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:29,260
Get rid of them?

255
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:31,670
-Chu Xia, how can you say that?
-Jiang Chen Chuan!

256
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:37,990
Chu Xia, don't leave me behind!

257
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,530
Hi, Chu Xia!

258
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:47,660
I guess the exam is around the corner.

259
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:50,950
I wonder what exam results you guys will get.

260
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:55,880
But it seems I don't have
to be worried about you.

261
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:58,690
I'm sure you have no problem.

262
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:01,770
What about the rest of the class?

263
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:05,760
Is Wang Jian Ren more manly now?

264
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:10,210
Are Ming Yue and Cai Xia
still close like they used to be?

265
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:13,420
Although we were separated for a while,

266
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:16,210
but I miss you all the time.

267
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:19,780
I'm studying at a good
Academy of Fine Arts.

268
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,710
Now I turn to a student from a teacher.

269
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:26,080
Read ten thousand books,
travel ten thousand miles.

270
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,520
After seeing how vast
the outside world is,

271
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,500
now only I know how small I am.

272
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,360
Chu Xia.

273
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,460
There are many challenges
waiting for us in the future.

274
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:38,780
Let's keep fighting together
when I'm back from studies.

275
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:26,200
Welcome our monitor, Chu Xia!

276
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,630
What's going on? Aliens?

277
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,760
Let's go.

278
00:18:49,424 --> 00:18:51,424
So handsome! Go for it!

279
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,170
It's annoying.

280
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,220
Thank you.

281
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:03,590
Why do you stop playing?

282
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:06,330
I don't want to be
watched like a monkey.

283
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:12,400
Stop following me!

284
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,150
An Chu Xia.

285
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:21,050
What do you want to do?

286
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:23,600
I'm not looking for you. Go away!

287
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,020
It's okay, I'm fine.

288
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,390
You've been very famous recently.

289
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,520
Cut the crap.

290
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:39,960
Go straight to the point.

291
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,840
Nothing.

292
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,660
I just don't like you.

293
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:47,000
I'm happy when you hate me,
but can't wipe me out.

294
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,200
So annoying! Mo Xin Wei is a witch!

295
00:19:53,124 --> 00:19:54,024
I'm so pissed off!

296
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:55,190
She's a witch!

297
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:56,800
Meng Xiao Nan, what's wrong?

298
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,090
Where is Chu Xia?

299
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,160
Over there.

300
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:03,240
Mo Xin Wei messed with us again.

301
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,790
Chu Xia is talking to her.

302
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:07,740
How could you leave Chu Xia alone then?

303
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:12,340
I didn't mean to leave her alone.
Why are you so fierce?

304
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,400
She asked me to...

305
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,810
She asked me to leave.
