1
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:16,690
So no one believes me here, huh?

2
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:22,890
I believe you.

3
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:28,650
I believe Xiang Man Kui won't do that.

4
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:32,770
No point you believe it.

5
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:35,370
The registration form's
in Xiang Man Kui's book case.

6
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:36,830
We have the evidence.

7
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:38,560
Evidence?

8
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:41,680
Anyone saw her stealing
the registration form?

9
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:45,440
Even the form is in her book case,

10
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,320
it might be put there by someone on purpose

11
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:49,730
just to frame her.

12
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:51,490
Mo Xin Wei.

13
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:54,280
When did you start
to concern other people?

14
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:55,440
I...

15
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:58,240
I just want to clear my name.

16
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,530
An Chu Xia.

17
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,370
Now we found the thief.

18
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:02,500
What should we do now?

19
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,410
I told you, I'm not going to
take part in the competition.

20
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:07,380
It doesn't matter who stole the form.

21
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,490
Forget it.

22
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:10,140
Chu Xia.

23
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,720
Don't you believe me?

24
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:15,260
I really didn't steal it.

25
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:27,870
-An Chu Xia.
-Shut up!

26
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:30,480
Do you want to stir it up?

27
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,820
Nothing.

28
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:36,820
I just want to remind you
about our agreement.

29
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:40,370
If I didn't take your form,
you can't take part in the competition.

30
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:42,990
I'm not going to join
whether you take it or not.

31
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:43,690
Alright!

32
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:44,620
Wan Zi.

33
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:45,220
Let's go.

34
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:46,230
Oh!

35
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:53,550
Chu Xia.

36
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:56,410
Xiang Man Kui may have been framed.

37
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,570
I'll apologize to her.

38
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:03,620
Chu Xia.

39
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:14,960
Little Kui.

40
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:23,070
You haven't called me that
for a long time.

41
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:46,030
It's not suitable for children.
Don't look at it.

42
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,170
An Chu Xia, you are stupid!

43
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,600
Listen to me.

44
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,210
Since you like Han Qi Lu,

45
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:21,720
you should tell him frankly.

46
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,320
Don’t beat the bush,
play dumb or get into a huff.

47
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:28,100
None of them speaks louder
than saying "I like you".

48
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:32,890
Ambiguity is the most untraceable thing.

49
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:34,110
It could make people deny,

50
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:36,010
change and leave you anytime.

51
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,340
Now Xiang Man Kui is back
and sticking to Han Qi Lu.

52
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,300
Are you sure you want
to step on the same point?

53
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:48,070
It doesn't sound like
coming out of your mouth.

54
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,730
Everyone has many characters.

55
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,170
Just like you.

56
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,600
You look strong,

57
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,530
but have a fragile heart.

58
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,760
It sounds like you know me very well.

59
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:02,640
To know someone,

60
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,090
you have to always look at her

61
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:05,120
and think about her.

62
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,910
I look at you many times a day.
Of course I know you well.

63
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:11,820
Can't you be serious?

64
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:14,450
I just encourage you to express yourself.

65
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:16,450
I don't want to see you suffering.

66
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,560
But I didn't say I'd give up.

67
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,690
Do you need my help
for the registration?

68
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:27,540
No need. I'm not going to take part.

69
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,250
Why?

70
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,300
Really want to give up?

71
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:35,980
Alright then.

72
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,300
[Master Devil Do Not Kiss Me S2]

73
00:06:07,604 --> 00:06:08,404
[Episode 12]

74
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:26,830
Xin Wei.

75
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:29,080
Aren't we too lenient to Xiang Man Kui?

76
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,390
We wanted to frame her.

77
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:34,040
Eventually, she took the advantage.

78
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:38,400
Just like a pie falling from the sky.

79
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,080
It's always a trap.

80
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:44,070
No one knows who the winner is.

81
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:45,730
Let's wait and see.

82
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,550
You have a point.

83
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:57,690
Chu Xia.

84
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,180
Come here.

85
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,110
Let's go.

86
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:17,480
Why have you been absent these two days?

87
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,190
I'm ready to go abroad.

88
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,830
I've been busy for it these days.

89
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,410
Going abroad?

90
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,050
Yeah, tomorrow.

91
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,980
So sudden.

92
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,920
No choice.
It was arranged by my grandpa.

93
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:35,580
You sure you don't want to tell Qi Lu
that you'll have dinner at my house?

94
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:39,160
No need. He doesn't care
about me anyway.

95
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:40,890
What do you mean?

96
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,900
Young master.

97
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:51,990
Let's go.

98
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,220
Do we need to wait for Ms. Chu Xia?

99
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:02,920
No need. Let's go.

100
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,150
Why don't you call her and ask?

101
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,600
Even if she has something
urgent to leave,

102
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,810
she should give me a call.

103
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,640
Maybe she's waiting for your call.

104
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,350
Let's go.

105
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:25,830
Chu Xia.

106
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,020
Have some fruit.

107
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,270
Thank you.

108
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,720
I'm full.

109
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:31,740
Grandpa Ling.

110
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,490
Why are you so nice to me?

111
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,100
Because you are Shu Ya's daughter.

112
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:38,030
To me,

113
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,590
you are like my granddaughter.

114
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:41,980
Your mom's gone.

115
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:45,160
So I have to love you more.

116
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,160
Grandpa.

117
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,880
I'll be jealous.

118
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,370
It's all your fault.

119
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:57,820
If only Chu Xia can be
my granddaughter-in-law.

120
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,440
Grandpa, it's too late
for you to say that.

121
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,440
I'll go abroad tomorrow anyway.

122
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:05,290
I can't take her away.

123
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,680
Why not?

124
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,040
Chu Xia.

125
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,680
Why don't I send you abroad?

126
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,440
So you two can cultivate some feelings.

127
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,620
If only you could give me

128
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:19,680
-a great-grandson...
-Grandpa.

129
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:22,880
A great-granddaughter will do too.

130
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,380
Thank you.

131
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,260
I don't want to go abroad.

132
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,330
I'll just study here.

133
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,990
I'm serious.

134
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:31,960
I'm not kidding.

135
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,480
If I send you abroad to study design

136
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,660
and train you to be
a good fashion designer,

137
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:41,640
I think your mother will be

138
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:44,200
very happy in heaven.

139
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:47,040
Think about it.

140
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:49,990
Even if you can't go with Han Yu now,

141
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,150
you can come to me at any time

142
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,830
when you change your mind.

143
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:56,970
Thank you.

144
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,610
Okay!

145
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,060
Nice wine.

146
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,440
Of course, heroes deserve for good wine.

147
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:20,510
Hey, brat!

148
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,860
Don't beat the bush.

149
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:26,000
Just go straight to the point.

150
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,040
I'll help you.

151
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,360
Uncle...You know me very well.

152
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:33,910
I have been watching you grow up.

153
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:37,470
Your father's been staying abroad
all these years to develop his business.

154
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:43,460
I've been with you
longer than your father.

155
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:46,360
Of course I know you well.

156
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:47,740
Alright.

157
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:48,320
Say it.

158
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,860
I'll tell you now.

159
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,940
I like a girl recently.

160
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,610
You started to like girls
in the kindergarten.

161
00:10:57,610 --> 00:10:58,670
No difference.

162
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:00,920
No...I'll tell you what.

163
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:03,640
She's a very special girl.

164
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:07,370
Well, she is stubborn,

165
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,850
sharp-tongued,
never gentle to me

166
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:10,620
and violent.

167
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,260
She doesn't even see me.

168
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:13,790
Wait.

169
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,120
You are not having a fever.

170
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:20,110
Shall I call your dad
and tell him to come back to comfort you?

171
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:21,930
No, uncle.

172
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:23,000
Listen to me.

173
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,640
I really like this girl.

174
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,800
I like her very much.

175
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,720
And I would like to help her.

176
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:30,250
How?

177
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,130
I take it you've agreed.

178
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:33,940
What?

179
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,980
Thank you, uncle.

180
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,610
Alright.

181
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,700
It hurts.

182
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:42,410
-Don't break your words.
-Any wine?

183
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,080
Of course, come on! Let me pour it.

184
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:47,940
Thank you, uncle.

185
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,030
What a brat!

186
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,780
It's really touching.

187
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,590
Isn't it?

188
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,960
Why do you fall asleep?

189
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,960
Qi Lu.

190
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:20,280
Is Chu Xia back?

191
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:22,350
No.

192
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,690
Don't fall asleep.

193
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:25,050
Quickly call her.

194
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:25,770
Hurry!

195
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:27,940
I'm so sleepy. I'm going to bed.

196
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:29,910
Qi Lu.

197
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:30,810
Don't fall asleep.

198
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:32,740
Quickly call her!

199
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:33,690
No way.

200
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,010
You finally...

201
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:43,350
I'm sending Chu Xia home.

202
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:48,300
Chu Xia.

203
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,600
Think about it.

204
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:55,870
About what?

205
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:08,190
"Come to my room"

206
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:09,650
"Why?"

207
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,380
"Come to my room"

208
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:17,600
"Anything?"

209
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:26,270
"Yes"

210
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:29,530
Say it.

211
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:34,270
Sit down.

212
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:46,010
What did Han Yu ask you to think about?

213
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,200
Nothing. It's a personal matter.

214
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:50,300
A personal matter between you and him?

215
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:54,540
-I'll go to bed if there's nothing else.
-Chu Xia.

216
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:57,050
Can we stop being at loggerheads?

217
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:06,110
Did you give up
the competition because of me?

218
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,880
Not really.

219
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,800
Actually,

220
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,210
you don't have to go abroad
to realize your dream.

221
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:17,290
Don't worry.

222
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:18,490
As long as you like it,

223
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:21,580
I'll arrange the best
design institute and

224
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,560
open a gallery for you
after your graduation

225
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,660
with your own garment factory.

226
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,360
Then, create your own brand

227
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:28,490
and open a store.

228
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:30,900
Qi Lu.

229
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:32,840
Thank you for your kindness.

230
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,160
But,

231
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:38,810
I'd like to achieve it through my own efforts
without relying on others.

232
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:43,200
Moreover, the registration
of the competition has ended.

233
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:45,320
I can't take part even if I want to.

234
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:49,070
So, let's not mention it again.

235
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:49,810
Okay?

236
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,010
You mean,

237
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:55,380
you wanted to take
part in the competition.

238
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,920
You wanted to go abroad.

239
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:00,240
I'm sleepy.

240
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,280
I'll to bed.

241
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,110
Good night.

242
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:21,417
"Xiang Man Kui is a bitch!
She's a thief!"

243
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,200
Who wrote it?

244
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:29,980
It was there
before we came in the morning.

245
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:36,670
Meng Xiao Nan.

246
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:37,790
Did you write it?

247
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:40,400
Don't wrong me!

248
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,000
Do you have any evidence?

249
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,800
You are the best friend of Chu Xia
and you biased against me.

250
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,600
Who else would write it except you?

251
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:49,650
I did bias against you.

252
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:51,610
But you can't frame me!

253
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:54,830
Be bold to admit as you dared to do so!

254
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,330
Xiang Man Kui!

255
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,600
Don't frame me!

256
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:59,550
Xiao Nan.

257
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:00,410
What's going on?

258
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:02,860
She framed me for writing it!

259
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,640
Did you write it?

260
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,430
Of course not.

261
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,100
I believe Xiao Nan would not do that.

262
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:19,790
Chu Xia.

263
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,850
I explained to you

264
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:25,600
when I was suspected yesterday,
but you didn't believe me.

265
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,750
And now you easily believe her.

266
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:32,120
So you've never taken me as a friend.

267
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,220
No.

268
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:37,400
I knew you were framed yesterday
and wanted to apologize to you.

269
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,060
But,...

270
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:40,910
Everyone here, listen to me.

271
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:47,450
Let's end the issue here!

272
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:51,960
If anyone of you dare to
offend Xiang Man Kui in the future,

273
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:54,250
it means you are offending me.

274
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,790
Got it?

275
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,160
Chu Xia.

276
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,760
It wasn't me.

277
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,830
What's up?

278
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:28,900
Han Qi Lu scolded An Chu Xia
in public for Xiang Man Kui.

279
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:29,580
Really?

280
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:30,670
I didn't expect it.

281
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:33,420
The triangular relationship
changes so fast.

282
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:34,720
Quickly tell me.

283
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,450
Han Qi Lu had an ambiguous
relationship with An Chu Xia.

284
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,240
Then, he confessed to Xiang Man Kui

285
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,090
and dumped An Chu Xia in public.

286
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:43,450
Breaking news!

287
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:45,520
Han Qi Lu hit An Chu Xia in public.

288
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,380
Xiang Man Kui is Han Qi Lu's
better half since they were young.

289
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:52,190
Xiang Man Kui is more beautiful.

290
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,860
Let's go to the library later.

291
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:02,820
Come on!

292
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,360
Come on!

293
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:07,010
Hands off! Why are you pulling me?

294
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:07,880
Come on!

295
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,770
Are you crazy?

296
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:11,200
Are you looking for a fight?

297
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,000
I tell you.

298
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:14,060
Let me go!

299
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,930
Han Qi Lu, listen!

300
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:19,860
If you dare to offend
An Chu Xia after this,

301
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:21,310
I'll not spare you.

302
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,430
Hands off!

303
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,570
I heard it.

304
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:29,780
You hit Chu Xia in public
because of Xiang Man Kui.

305
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,660
You are an ungrateful bastard!

306
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:34,920
Think about how Chu Xia treated you!

307
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,920
She even gave up on her dream for you.
How can you flirt with another girl?

308
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,560
What an ungrateful bastard!

309
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,650
I feel unworthy for Chu Xia!

310
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,300
Are you crazy?

311
00:18:58,170 --> 00:18:59,300
An Chu Xia.

312
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:03,710
You'd better keep an eye on your friend.

313
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,860
Don't let him attack people
regardless of the truth.

314
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:07,960
Who do you mean?

315
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,480
My friend attacked people
regardless of the truth?

316
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,750
You think you can
tell the right from wrong?

317
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,660
Why can't I?

318
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,530
Your friend did wrong first.

319
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:19,940
And you even fight back!

320
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,590
I've tolerated you for a long time.

321
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:23,600
Don't think you are the boss here!

322
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,640
I'll tell you what.

323
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,350
From now on, anyone who insults
my friends is offending me!

324
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:29,560
Xiao Nan, let's go.

325
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,670
You seem to be in a good mood.

326
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:51,310
Don't you think the scenery
is particularly nice today?

327
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:56,800
Didn't you say
I wasn't qualified to work with you?

328
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:00,040
Are you happy
with our cooperation today?
