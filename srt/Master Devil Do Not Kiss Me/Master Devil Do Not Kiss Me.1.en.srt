Peaceful starry summer night.

2
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,300
While listening to
the chirping of cicadas,

3
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,670
I used to make unrealistic dreams.

4
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:26,590
Even though it is a dream,

5
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:28,620
I always remind myself

6
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:30,280
not to believe it.

7
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:33,340
I'm still insignificant.

8
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:42,360
After I get up every morning,

9
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:43,800
I walk in the hallway

10
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:46,340
of a grand villa in a nice dress.

11
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:48,290
The scent of the flowers

12
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:49,910
refreshes me from drowsy.

13
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:53,950
The music wakes up my brain from idle.

14
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,090
The servants are caring,

15
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,340
the elders always attentive.

16
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:04,370
Guess it's every girl's princess dream.

17
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,940
In fact,

18
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:08,400
it's also a dream

19
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,690
for me,

20
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,620
but more like a nightmare.

Let me deliver the milk today.

24
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,920
I can do it alone.

25
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,480
Okay?

26
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,990
You're not the Monkey King,
can't be a tailor cum dispatch.

27
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:36,660
It will be yogurt when it's sent.

28
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,710
Since you don't want to study,

29
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,720
I don't have to work part-time then.

30
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,130
You'll be exhausted
if I don't bother.

31
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,110
Let's talk about the study later.

borrow some money from Meng Xiao Nan?

38

It's been a month since she left.

39
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:01,030
It's not sensible if we

[Episode 1]

91
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,320
In every girl's princess dream,
there's always a prince

92
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,000
riding on a white horse.

93
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:34,520
Smart, chivalrous and courteous.

94
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:38,880
As exquisite as an artwork.

95
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:43,140
Apparently, he's not the prince.

96
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:46,890
He's a demon like the
mumbler Monk Xuanzang.

97
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:52,930
I have to go.

98
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,790
I'm afraid that you can't go now.

99
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,750
Ask him to come over.

100
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,120
I'll teach him a lesson.

101
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,970
If he doesn't show up today...

102
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:15,930
What are you looking at?

103
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:18,260
Didn't you see we're arguing?

104
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,900
Do you know how much I love you?

105
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,700
Be it one or two years,

106
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:22,870
a decade or a century,

107
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,920
I love you for ten thousand years

108
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,250
and ten thousand light years.

109
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,760
The light year is a unit of
length instead of time.

110
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:29,990
It is the distance whereby

111
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,870
the speed of light times a year.

112
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:35,930
The speed of light is 299,792,458 m/s.

113
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,050
By assuming 365.25 days as a year,

114
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,530
One light-year is about
9.4 trillion kilometres.

115
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:43,060
This is the correct
interpretation of light years

116
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:46,300
and the distance between you two.

117
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,800

Why did you pop out then?

122
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:14,630
For fun?

123
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:16,690
You spilled the milk! Are you blind?

The main purpose
of this military training

00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,200
Missing the kiss?

174
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,910
My illness seems healed.

175
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,480
My mouth no longer swollen.

176
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:46,220
A weirdo must be healed by a weirdo.

177
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:51,010
Speak of the devil.

178
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,760
So macho!

179
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,320
Stop!

180
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,380
Give me the pendant!

181
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,060
What's wrong?

182
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,290
Come out.

183
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:40,020
Hurry up!

184
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:40,940
You two.

185
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,000
What's going on?

186
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:45,740
Hurry.

187
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,080
Hurry up.

188
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:52,060
Stop!

189
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,470
One more.

190
00:12:58,090 --> 00:12:59,480
Hey, you! Super Saiyan!

191
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,760
Come on!

192
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,680
Come on!

193
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,060
Come on!

194
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:08,600
Hurry up.

195
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,300
Come on!

196
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:12,070
Come on!

197
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,720
Hand in everything.

198
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,380
-Call the police.
-No signal.

199
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:25,740
You deserved it.

200
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,520
My pendant fell into his bag
when I was falling down.

201
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,640
When you two were kissing?

202
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,790
Just a pendant.

203
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,000
Buy it for her.

204
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,880
You can't buy it with money.

205
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,490
Give it back to me and I'll leave.

206
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,880
The bag's over there.

207
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,930
Can you get it?

208
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:47,740
Can you leave?

209
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,030
Give it to me!

210
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,970
They are coming.

211
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,270
You can't run away.

212
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:54,340
I won't help you even if I make it.

213
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:57,360
Hand it over!

214
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:02,150
I'll give you 1.1 million yuan
if you call the police.

215
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,590
Call what?

216
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:06,830
Idiot.

217
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,650
I'm here to deliver the milk.

218
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:21,750
You are the dispatch girl, huh?

219
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,640
Where's the milk?

220
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:26,210
It was spilled because of him.

221
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,620
You slept with him?

222
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:28,600
They kissed.

223
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,970
It was spilled.

224
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,220
You spilled the milk?

225
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:31,880
All spilled.

226
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,780
-Why are you here then?
-To get something.

227
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,070
-What?
-Something money can't buy.

228
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,760
-What?
-A pendant.

229
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,430
Don't speak at the same time.

230
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:39,650
Okay.

231
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,350
Don't play tricks!

232
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:15,130
I'll tell you what.

233
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:18,590
Our target is simple, we want money!

234
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:22,000
How much do you want?
I'll pay by mobile phone now.

235
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,360
Do you use the POS device?

236
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,600
Give me your account number.
I'll get someone to transfer the money.

237
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,840
Shut up!

238
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:33,250
I didn't ask you to speak. Shut up!

239
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:36,760
What did I say?

240
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:40,070
-Money.
-Yeah, we want cash.

241
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,140
Fake robbers with real guns.

242
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,300
The voice sounds familiar.

243
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,590
We want cash.

244
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,310
Bro!

245
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,790
What are you doing? Come back!

246
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,000
Bro!

247
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,750
How do I address you?

248
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,550
What are you doing?

249
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,810
How do I address you?

250
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:57,350
I'm a gangster too.

251
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,010
I'm An Chu Xia, the head of
Huo Ni Hall in Cat Ears Lane.

252
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,500
-Let's be friends.
-Straight to the point!

253
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:05,810
No money.

254
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:09,300
She's here to deliver the milk.

255
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:12,590
You are the dispatch, huh?

256
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:14,460
Be punctual in the future.

257
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:17,860
-Be careful when you go downhill.
-Okay.

258
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:21,180
Bye!

259
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,200
Be careful.

260
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:23,540
They let her go.

261
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,670
-Bye.
-Be careful.

262
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,800
Be punctual in the future.

263
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,560
It creeps me out.

264
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:35,240
"Call the police"

265
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:40,450
I'll give you 1.1 million yuan
if you call the police.

266
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,440
What's up?

267
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,590
I forgot my phone.

268
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:49,220
What mobile phone?

269
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,260
And the pendant.

270
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,570
In his bag.

271
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,990
Hurry.

272
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,060
Give me back the pendant!

273
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:01,020
What pendant?

274
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:04,270
Is the 1.1 million yuan still effective?

275
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:05,260
Sure.

276
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:08,670
My pendant is in your bag.

277
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,990
Give me the money.

278
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,620
My bag is not here.

279
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,150
Not now.

280
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:17,450
-Go and get the bag!
-The time is almost up.

281
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:18,790
-So fast.
-We can't carry on.

282
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,020
Pay me the deposit first.

283
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,860
We want to get our bags.

284
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,360
He wants to get his bag.

285
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:29,210
Go ahead!

286
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:30,450
Hurry.

287
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,720
Qi Lu.

288
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,550
Now listen!

289
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:40,630
Turn right and run!

290
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:45,680
-I'll give you 500,000 yuan.
-Alright, I'm fine with 1.1 million.

291
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:48,110
Only 500,000 yuan.

292
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,360
I'll pay by cash now.

293
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,330
Why?

294
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:55,540
I'm the eldest son of Han's Group.

295
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:58,720
Look for any banker for VIP
at any bank and say my name.

296
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,110
The password is 5276.

297
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:06,750
5276, deal!

298
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:08,090
Lower down your voice.

299
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,420
I'm not cheating your money.

300
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,880
I'll help you to run away from here now.

301
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,490
Don't mess around.

302
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,260
Don't mess around.

303
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:32,930
Why did she faint?

304
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,690
Can you hear me?

305
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:37,442
What's wrong?

306
00:18:37,467 --> 00:18:39,284
Is she okay?

307
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,500
You are awake.

308
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,190
What did you say?

309
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:50,600
Run!

310
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:01,400
Why are you laughing?

311
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,680
Run!

312
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,330
Idiot!
