1
00:00:15,959 --> 00:00:16,716
Old Han,

2
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,576
Is that true? You know it?

3
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:19,610
Yes!

4
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:21,610
Hey.

5
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,276
Chu Xia won first place.

6
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,316
Why are you still sitting here?

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,680
Why don't you go call her to celebrate
together?

8
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:30,966
I'm going to the hotel.

9
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:32,216
I have to celebrate it with everyone.

10
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,400
-Old Han, let's go!
-Sister Yuan.

11
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,520
Can you please not be so impulsive?

12
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:39,800
She moved out.

13
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,640
You shouldn't disturb her in the middle of
the night.

14
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:45,596
-Then I'll...
-But I think.

15
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,770
Miss Chu Xia wants you to go disturb her.

16
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,700
Old Han.

17
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:56,220
You are exactly right.

18
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:58,096
Alright, Qi Lu.

19
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:58,976
I'm not going.

20
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,030
You should go quickly.

21
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:02,836
Why don't you get it?

22
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,040
Come on, hurry up!

23
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,270
Chu Xia is back!

24
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,140
You are back?

25
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,650
Yeah.

26
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:23,966
Dad!

27
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:26,276
W-Why is it you?

28
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,870
Who else would it be?

29
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,100
Brother Liu!

30
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:33,370
Brother Liu!

31
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:36,686
Why didn't you tell me you're
coming home early?

32
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:39,250
I wanted to give you a surprise.

33
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:41,300
Let's go, let's go.

34
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:44,596
Qi Lu, come here.

35
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,830
I want to talk to you.

36
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:02,940
How is it?

37
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,020
Nice handwriting.

38
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,296
I didn't ask you to look at the
handwriting.

39
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,616
Help me out here, who do you think

40
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,020
wrote it?

41
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,350
It's clearly someone who's close to you.

42
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:18,546
How else would they know about
your competition?

43
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:19,596
If you ask me,

44
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,786
people like Han Qi Lu

45
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,066
are out of the question.

46
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,026
It may be Jiang Chen Chuan.

47
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,096
Why mention Han Qi Lu? I don't

48
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,090
want to hear about him.

49
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,320
That's right!

50
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:28,450
Keep it up,

51
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,950
that's the attitude.

52
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:33,020
We're not gonna mention Han Qi Lu again.

53
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,666
If I see him again,

54
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,680
I'll beat him up again!

55
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:38,146
Again?

56
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:39,070
Yeah.

57
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,620
-You beat him up already?
-Yeah.

58
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:42,010
When?

59
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:43,020
Why?

60
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,236
Because he hit you in front of everyone

61
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,726
in class for Xiang Man Kui.

62
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:49,160
How can I let that slide?

63
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,220
Of course I had to drag him
to the field for a beating.

64
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,256
Buddy.

65
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,186
Good job.

66
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,520
It's nothing.

67
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:00,530
Hey. Hey!

68
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,330
Don't you wanna find out anymore?

69
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:10,506
An Chu Xia.

70
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,190
Why do you keep coming to our class?

71
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:14,450
Where's Han Qi Lu?

72
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,570
You have no shame.

73
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,976
He already turned against you
in front of everyone,

74
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,390
still you make yourself unwelcome?

75
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:22,540
That's right.

76
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:26,020
You should use your time to study
instead of prattling.

77
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,640
Don't want you to get creamed.

78
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:32,300
He came in this morning, but left again.

79
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:34,680
He left with Xiang Man Kui.

80
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:08,816
=Master Devil Do Not Kiss Me S2=

81
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:09,740
=Episode 14=

82
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:39,960
Qi Lu.

83
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,560
This isn't like you.

84
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:42,736
Really?

85
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:43,616
Yeah.

86
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,326
Before, you always sped up during
the first part

87
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:47,996
and slowed down later on purpose

88
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,380
so it'd seem like we're even.

89
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:52,020
People truly change.

90
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,140
You know me so well.

91
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:57,566
You're still the same,

92
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:00,390
when you're in a bad mood, you
come car racing.

93
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,470
And then you want me to skip class
with you.

94
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:09,810
Xiao Kui.

95
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:10,860
Hm?

96
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,130
I'm going abroad.

97
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:18,180
Where are you going?

98
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:20,070
England.

99
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,070
Why are you leaving
right when I came back?

100
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,020
It's my father.

101
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:29,406
He wants me to study economics in England.

102
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,290
And then take over his business.

103
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:36,700
Wouldn't that mean that you'll
have to give up your astronomy?

104
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,000
Yes.

105
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,620
It's fine, Qi Lu.

106
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,690
Even if you go study abroad,

107
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:50,210
you can still make astronomy your hobby.

108
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:53,960
I'll support you in anything you do.

109
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,870
I can go to England with you.

110
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,900
Thank you for your good intention.

111
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,900
But I don't want to go there at all.

112
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,640
It's because of An Chu Xia that you don't
want to go, isn't it?

113
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,136
Not at all.

114
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,410
That's impossible.

115
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,200
Alright, Qi Lu.

116
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,860
Stop struggling with this.

117
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,750
Even if you don't study economics
in England,

118
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:34,250
Chu Xia will go to France
when she wins the competition.

119
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:39,090
The two of you will be separated
either way.

120
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:43,420
Yeah.

121
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:56,290
Chu Xia!

122
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:07,160
Chu Xia, you've been staring around for
half an hour already, aren't you going home?

123
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,530
Yeah.

124
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,886
School's over.

125
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:11,510
Why is she still not back?

126
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:16,180
She left in such a hurry,

127
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:18,380
she even forgot her bag.

128
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:30,150
Xiao Kui!

129
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,070
Come with me!

130
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:43,850
Say, isn't this summer too hot

131
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,820
for the scarf she's knitting?

132
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:48,466
The scarf isn't important.

133
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:52,250
What's important is that Qi Lu dragged her
away on a whim,

134
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,540
they didn't plan it ahead of time.

135
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:56,296
Come on.

136
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,840
Stop pondering over this.

137
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:00,930
Think about how we're going to
celebrate tonight.

138
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:02,850
Celebrate what?

139
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:05,370
You won first place at the preliminaries.

140
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,046
Let's go.

141
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:09,680
I'll take you home so you can get changed,
I've got a surprise for you tonight.

142
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,416
Who is this?

143
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,340
Me!

144
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,990
Feng Shao!

145
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,160
Feng Shao?

146
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:31,970
Oh my.

147
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,530
What the hell is this?

148
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,200
What the hell is this?

149
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:37,100
Why are you so late?

150
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:37,956
Yeah.

151
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,546
We've been waiting for you.

152
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,490
That was so scary.

153
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,026
Didn't I tell you this is
a Qing Dynasty Party?

154
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:46,076
What's all this?

155
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,176
Oh, come on.

156
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:49,656
The Qing Dynasty Party's boss told me

157
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,506
that Qing Dynasty Parties are
really popular.

158
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:53,116
Listen, today,

159
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,986
the Qing Dynasty's emperor,

160
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:55,926
consorts,

161
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:56,776
princesses,

162
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:57,546
princes,

163
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:58,576
maids,

164
00:09:58,660 --> 00:09:59,566
eunuchs,

165
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:00,276
rich people,

166
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,886
and even commoners were all loaned out.

167
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:03,540
Qing Dynasty ghosts were all that's left.

168
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:04,826
Actually,

169
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,830
I wanted to be a butler.

170
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,020
Eunuch?

171
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,546
Butler for eunuchs.

172
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:12,260
That's still a eunuch, ok?

173
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,970
That's not the same!

174
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,566
Chu Xia, I wanted to give you a surprise.

175
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:18,190
I didn't know they'd be so scary.

176
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,976
Here, let me drink one as punishment.

177
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,220
Drink, drink, drink.

178
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,770
Drink!

179
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:43,906
Classmates,

180
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:45,316
I hereby announce.

181
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,850
An Chu Xia's celebration party
has now begun!

182
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:04,710
We're here.

183
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,520
Qi Lu,

184
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,390
I don't want to go home yet.

185
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,070
How about we go take a walk?

186
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,370
Next time.

187
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,570
It's late.

188
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,210
I'm a bit tired.

189
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,140
Alright.

190
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,280
I'm going.

191
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:38,336
Do you want to draw a clear line
between us?

192
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,260
Yes.

193
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:42,440
That's why you joined that damn
design competition?

194
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:44,026
You want to win

195
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,426
and then go to France

196
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:48,050
and never deal with me again?

197
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:54,560
Han Qi Lu!

198
00:11:58,570 --> 00:11:59,530
An Chu Xia!

199
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:10,740
Do you love me?

200
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,790
Don't drink.

201
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:19,970
Answer me.

202
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,010
Hey, slow down.

203
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:11,780
Be careful.

204
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:16,720
Look where you're going.

205
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:20,660
Be careful with your head.

206
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:30,780
Han Qi Lu.

207
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,056
Wrong,

208
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,640
it's Jiang Chen Chuan.

209
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:36,720
Han Qi Lu.

210
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,160
Qi Lu.

211
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:45,930
Chu Xia.

212
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,290
What do I gotta do so you'll love me?

213
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:11,656
Look at the time.

214
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,376
Why is Qi Lu still not home?

215
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:16,580
I already called him, he didn't pick up.
Maybe his phone died.

216
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,880
Hey, don't worry. He'll be fine.

217
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:20,570
He skipped class!

218
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:22,810
Brother Liu.

219
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:25,156
Don't be so strict with Qi Lu.

220
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,920
Give him some time.

221
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:29,000
Didn't I give him time?

222
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,010
Are three days enough time?

223
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:34,470
I wanted to give him three minutes
to consider it.

224
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:36,400
Brother Liu.

225
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,670
Can you please not speak so cooly?

226
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:40,960
I admire you again.

227
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:44,240
Do you?

228
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:51,330
Hello?

229
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,840
What?

230
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:57,770
Ok, I understand.

231
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:01,260
What is it, Brother Liu?

232
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:03,190
It's the company.

233
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:04,340
It's fine.

234
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:05,650
Don't worry.

235
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:09,710
Brother Liu.

236
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:11,600
I wanted to ask you something.

237
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,036
Did you come back so suddenly

238
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,000
because of the company?

239
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:21,580
Is that why you want Qi Lu
to study economics abroad?

240
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,890
I can't keep anything from you.

241
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:29,210
Yuan Yuan.

242
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,030
The company has a little situation.

243
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:34,250
I made this trip back

244
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:36,640
to handle company affairs.

245
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:43,530
I want Qi Lu to study economics abroad so
he can take over the business sooner.

246
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:50,080
I worry that my health... isn't
going to play along for much longer.

247
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:51,926
Brother Liu.

248
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:53,756
What are you talking about?

249
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,726
Look at you.

250
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:57,736
You are a muscle man, why
wouldn't your health play along?

251
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:00,990
I know my health well.

252
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:02,510
Yuan Yuan.

253
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,020
Help me talk to Qi Lu.

254
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:08,850
Ok.

255
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:15,860
Stop!

256
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,306
Have you made up your mind

257
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:21,810
about what I told you yesterday?

258
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,260
Don't I have two more days left?

259
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:30,170
I gave you time so you can figure
it out yourself.

260
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:34,600
I'll ask my secretary to
handle your transfer tomorrow.

261
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:40,320
I won't go to England.

262
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,360
That's not up to you!

263
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:46,270
Brother Liu.

264
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:49,500
I don't like patriarchy.

265
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,130
I have the right to choose for myself.

266
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,196
I will never become a businessman,

267
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,490
let alone study economics!

268
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:57,680
You!

269
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:02,736
Brother Liu!

270
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,066
Brother Liu, what's the matter?

271
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:05,480
Brother Liu!

272
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:06,936
Help!

273
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:07,696
Brother Liu!

274
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:09,140
Brother Liu, what's the matter?

275
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:11,180
Old Han!

276
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:33,256
Hey.

277
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:36,100
What did you two do after I fell
asleep last night?

278
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,406
A girl and a boy alone together,

279
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:39,780
what do you think we did?

280
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:42,286
No way.

281
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:43,880
Tell me quickly.

282
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:48,030
After I took Chu Xia to the hotel...

283
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,420
And then?

284
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,410
And then...

285
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,236
I went home.

286
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,726
Seriously?

287
00:18:57,810 --> 00:18:59,720
-Are you that much of a gentleman?
-You can ask Chu Xia.

288
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:01,910
Chu Xia.

289
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:03,390
Chu Xia!

290
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:04,486
An Chu Xia!

291
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:05,216
Huh?

292
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,280
Is the teacher here?

293
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:07,920
Here my ass.

294
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,480
Hey.

295
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,236
I mean,

296
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,340
why does An Chu Xia keep staring at
Xiang Man Kui's seat?

297
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:21,330
Han Qi Lu and Xiang Man Kui eloped
last night.

298
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,546
See,

299
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:23,900
they even left the bag here.

300
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:27,000
Chu Xia was in a bad mood last night
because of this.

301
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:29,806
Han Qi Lu has been flirting around.

302
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:31,124
This won't do, I have to talk to him.

303
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:47,806
Chu Xia.

304
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:50,480
I like her less and less.

305
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:52,956
Yeah.

306
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,436
Her breasts look bigger than yours,

307
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,136
her legs look longer than yours.

308
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,320
Of course you'd dislike her.

309
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,246
An Chu Xia.

310
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:01,680
How can you side with her?

311
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,246
You got beaten up?

312
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:17,420
Couldn't get beaten up.

313
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:20,856
Looks like your self-defense skill
is not bad.

314
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:21,776
I'm saying

315
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,326
I couldn't beat Han Qi Lu up.

316
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:24,500
Why?

317
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:26,810
Because he didn't come to school.

318
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:27,696
Oh.

319
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:28,880
He didn't come again?

320
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,036
I heard the other students say

321
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,356
that his dad got sick.

322
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,296
He's in the hospital.

323
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,156
So he didn't come.

324
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,346
Uncle Han is sick?

325
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:36,270
That's what I heard.

326
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,040
Hey.

327
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:43,220
The teacher's here. The teacher's here!

328
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:52,166
Miss.

329
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,240
What are you doing?

330
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:55,560
Sir, I have to be somewhere. I have to go.

331
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,850
I don't know whether it's Uncle
Han or Qi Lu

332
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,400
or my mom.

333
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,120
I'm worried about.

334
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,250
Whatever the case,

335
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,990
wait for me.
