1
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,870
Why wasn't Jiang Chen Chuan
at the competition just now?

2
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:17,996
I called him,

3
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:18,920
he didn't want to come.

4
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:20,800
He still isn't over it?

5
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,616
Oh yes,

6
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:23,546
that's right,

7
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:25,097
if it was me, I wouldn't
be over it, either.

8
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,466
You finally fall in love with someone,

9
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:29,150
and turns out they are your cousin.

10
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,970
What a cruel plot twist.

11
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,376
Say,

12
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:33,956
is this perhaps...

13
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,016
all couples end up being related?

14
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:36,996
How can you gloat over

15
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,410
their situation at such a time?

16
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,076
I'm not gloating.

17
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,196
That's my brother, too.

18
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,980
I feel sad for him too, ok?

19
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:45,436
You are one to talk.

20
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,536
If you didn't

21
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,476
teach him how to chase girls

22
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,776
he wouldn't have sunken this deep.

23
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,316
How am I to blame?

24
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,840
He begged me to teach him.

25
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,126
Whatever.

26
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:56,050
Change of topic.

27
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,270
Er, Feng Shao.

28
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:00,396
Do you...

29
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,050
know someone who plays an instrument
really well?

30
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,390
Why would I know someone like that?

31
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:07,460
Didn't you use to play the guitar?

32
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,286
That's because I was
chasing after Chu Xia.

33
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:10,480
I'm just an amateur.

34
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:12,136
I don't care.

35
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:13,800
You have to help me out.

36
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:14,956
Miss,

37
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,160
what do you want?

38
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,866
I want to help Jiang Chen Chuan
start a band,

39
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:22,936
help him realize his dream.

40
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:23,860
Hey, wait!

41
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:28,160
Oh, I get it now.

42
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,170
I understand now.

43
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:32,780
What do you understand?

44
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:34,580
Meng Xiao Nan,

45
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:37,530
are you in love with Jiang Chen Chuan?

46
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:40,056
Hm?

47
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:40,596
I...

48
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,996
Bullshit.

49
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,286
I'm leaving!

50
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:44,680
Remember to help me!

51
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:45,756
-Don't go!
-Bye bye!

52
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,836
Let's talk some more!

53
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,986
I got a book on how to chase boys
back home,

54
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:51,066
it's been passed down from
my grandfather's generation!

55
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,270
Do you want it?

56
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:53,880
-Han Yu.
-Hm?

57
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,920
Do you remember what
you told me back then?

58
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:01,170
What?

59
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:05,320
You told me not to stop others
from chasing their dream

60
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,890
because of my own selfish desires.

61
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,170
You understand it now?

62
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:11,530
I do.

63
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,010
You were right.

64
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:17,050
Chu Xia has the right to chase
her dream.

65
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,490
Besides, she has talent.

66
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,050
I can let her make it further.

67
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:25,520
What about you?

68
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:28,590
If Chu Xia wins this competition

69
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,046
and goes to France to study,

70
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:32,060
what will you do?

71
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,366
I'm planning to study economy

72
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:37,440
and then take over Brother Liu's
company.

73
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:40,040
Seriously?

74
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,986
Every time this was mentioned

75
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,500
you always deeply hated it.

76
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:44,850
Yeah.

77
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:46,450
Oh.

78
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:49,050
But after experiencing this big crisis,

79
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,870
I realized that people can't live
selfishly.

80
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,580
Brother Liu did save the situation,

81
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,390
but his health is getting worse
each day.

82
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,250
He will need to step down sooner or later.

83
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:04,080
So I...

84
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:08,520
have to learn to take on responsibility

85
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:10,380
for my family.

86
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:12,710
You are giving up your astronomy?

87
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:14,346
Yes.

88
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:16,010
But what about your dream?

89
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:20,550
I intend to make reality into my dream.

90
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,260
After I came back,

91
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,140
you've changed a lot, too.

92
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:27,370
Really?

93
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:30,090
Past Qi Lu

94
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,640
only cared about himself.

95
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,640
Present Qi Lu

96
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:37,260
wants to integrate
himself into this world.

97
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,290
But have you thought about

98
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,600
who the person is that

99
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,760
made you change?

100
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:16,216
=Master Devil Do Not Kiss Me S2=

101
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,140
=Episode 21=

102
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,720
Dear students.

103
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,210
This is your working space.

104
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:33,470
The rooms contain the fabrics and tools
needed for the competition.

105
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:34,780
Er,

106
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:37,970
your three meals a day will be
brought to you.

107
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,620
Ok, now,

108
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:41,910
please hand me your cellphones.

109
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:54,480
They will be returned to you
after the competition ends.

110
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:55,450
Alright,

111
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:57,460
let's get started.

112
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,460
Mom.

113
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:00,740
I won't let you down.

114
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,800
You can't have it.

115
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:18,910
I'm back.

116
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:21,850
Qi Lu.

117
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,126
Come,

118
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,050
sit.

119
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:35,710
Your teacher told me that you reported in
your desired field of study today.

120
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:38,520
You decided to study economics?

121
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:40,870
Yes.

122
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:46,510
While I was staying in the hospital

123
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,400
I've been thinking

124
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:53,330
whether I was right in wanting you
to become a business elite in the past.

125
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,680
People

126
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,000
who have walked on the edge of
life and death

127
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,260
see things with much more clarity.

128
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:03,470
A person's life is only this long.

129
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:05,246
Why not use the time you have

130
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:07,500
when you are young to do things you like?

131
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,720
Qi Lu.

132
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,410
From now on, I will let you be.

133
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:14,930
You

134
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,460
can go study your astronomy as you wish.

135
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:25,620
Actually,

136
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:28,370
it was my own choice.

137
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,930
I'm doing what I want to do.

138
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:38,890
Lately,

139
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:41,370
I've been thinking a lot, too.

140
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,440
In the past,

141
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,900
I was too selfish.

142
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,440
I'm sorry,

143
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:55,130
dad.

144
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,050
Did you hear what Qi Lu said?

145
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,180
He apologized to you.

146
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,010
He said he's sorry!

147
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:25,270
Our child

148
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,840
has really grown up.

149
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,570
You taught him well.

150
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,040
It wasn't me.

151
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,240
It was Little Chu Xia.

152
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,240
Shu Ya.

153
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:45,570
I'm sorry.

154
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:49,430
Everything that's happened

155
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,850
is my fault.

156
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,060
Don't blame Xin Wei.

157
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,570
She's still young.

158
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,600
She has a quick temper.

159
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,910
She doesn't understand

160
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,090
a lot of things yet.

161
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:14,730
But don't worry.

162
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,440
I will do my best

163
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,520
to take care of Chu Xia,

164
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,710
and give her the best life,

165
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,980
the best education.

166
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:35,330
Come in.

167
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:39,040
Uncle, you wanted to talk to me?

168
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:40,310
Yes,

169
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,280
I've been so busy these days,

170
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,330
I didn't have time to
really chat with you.

171
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:48,146
You should know

172
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,330
what I want to talk to you about.

173
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:50,756
-Chu Xia...
-Uncle.

174
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,566
It's late.

175
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:52,730
Let's talk another day.

176
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:54,290
Sit down!

177
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:02,790
Chen Chuan.

178
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,136
My whole life,

179
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,146
in the business world

180
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:09,460
I've dared to fight and be ever
successful.

181
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:13,130
The only thing I failed at

182
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:14,920
was handling family matters.

183
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,310
It's quite embarrassing.

184
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,200
Because of my problems,

185
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:21,980
you,

186
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,050
Xin Wei

187
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,070
and Chu Xia

188
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,130
were hurt.

189
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,750
I apologize to you.

190
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,290
But I want you to understand

191
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,240
that people will experience many things
in their lifetime.

192
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,040
You will fall down,

193
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,206
roam about,

194
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:40,900
and even be helpless at times.

195
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:44,186
But since it has already happened,
you have to stand up

196
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,590
and continue ahead.

197
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:49,040
Once you have made
this first step forward,

198
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,650
you will realize

199
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,660
that the road to your future

200
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:55,340
isn't as difficult as you thought.

201
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,420
Uncle,

202
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,360
what are you trying to say?

203
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:01,720
I want you to come with me

204
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,350
to the final competition.

205
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,780
I'm sorry. I can't do it.

206
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:08,830
I don't want this to become an obstacle
in your heart you can never pass!

207
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,180
Think about it carefully.

208
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,520
(3 days later)

209
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:14,480
Let's sit here.

210
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:26,100
Hey, is that Chu Xia's dad?

211
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,610
It's the first time I'm seeing
him in person.

212
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:30,910
-He's quite handsome.
-Keep your voice down!

213
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:38,170
An Chu Xia!

214
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,280
Hurry!

215
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,750
It's your turn!

216
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,390
Coming, coming!

217
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:47,530
All done.

218
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,080
Hi, who is it?

219
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:51,756
I'm Wan Zi.

220
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,680
Oh, what's the matter?

221
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,480
I wanted to discuss something with you.

222
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:57,316
I'm on my way to the competition
right now.

223
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,690
Let's talk later.

224
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:00,360
It's about the competition!

225
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:01,376
An Chu Xia!

226
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:02,940
Someone wants to set her up!

227
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:03,950
What?

228
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:05,366
Where are you right now?

229
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:07,070
I'm right downstairs.

230
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:14,100
Jiang Chen Chuan is really not coming?

231
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,700
Who knows?

232
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:17,436
I just called him.

233
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,546
He said he'd think about it.

234
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:20,540
Tsk. Think about it.

235
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:25,746
Oh,

236
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:27,846
Mr. You Tian, er,

237
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:29,436
why isn't Xiang Man Kui here yet?

238
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,766
There's something I need to
communicate with her.

239
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:33,606
She may need to make some changes.

240
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:35,980
Look at the time, she's still not here.

241
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:37,826
I don't know either.

242
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:38,850
Or let's...

243
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,140
wait a bit longer.

244
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,736
He's here! He's here!

245
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:44,626
Keep your voice low.

246
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:45,610
Miss.

247
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:53,196
Chen Chuan.

248
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,386
I'm really happy

249
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:55,790
you came here today.

250
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,440
I only came to watch the competition.

251
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:04,216
Xiang Man Kui published a new design!

252
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:04,956
Oh?

253
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,480
-How can that be?
-Look.

254
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:07,450
Where?

255
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:08,740
Here!

256
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,150
What's that? Let me see the phone.

257
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,150
Go check what's happening.

258
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:29,530
Mr. Jiang,

259
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:33,260
Xiang Man Kui just released
her newest design sketches.

260
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:36,400
It's titled "Fruit of Dreams".

261
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:39,050
The whole fashion world is abuzz.

262
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:40,720
Alright, I understand.

263
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,190
What else?

264
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:45,840
Miss Xiang

265
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:50,240
published it using our company's
Miscon Fashion platform.

266
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,720
Why don't I know anything about that?

267
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:54,450
I'm not sure, either.

268
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,296
Go find out what's going on there.

269
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,440
Yes, Mr. Jiang.

270
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,490
These are Xiang Man Kui's new works?

271
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,630
This doesn't seem like her style.

272
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:17,070
Hm,

273
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,670
you think you know best.

274
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,090
Qi Lu.

275
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,930
Little Kui's seat is still empty.

276
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:26,330
It's strange

277
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:27,710
releasing the sketches now.

278
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,616
(Xiang Man Kui)

279
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:31,436
(Fruit of Dreams)

280
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,536
Her reputation is well-deserved.

281
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:33,760
-Yes, yes.
-Really.

282
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:39,866
Mr. You Tian,

283
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:41,836
were you able to get in touch
with Ms. Xiang Man Kui?

284
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,516
It's like this,

285
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,116
I just messaged her on WeChat.

286
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,766
She says she isn't feeling well,
she can't come.

287
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:47,206
We can't do anything about that.

288
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:48,566
We'll start now.

289
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:49,920
-Start it.
-Ok.

290
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:26,940
Is there anyone?

291
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,100
Help!

292
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:32,120
Anyone?

293
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:37,566
Let me out!

294
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:39,076
Behave!

295
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,570
Or we're gonna make you sorry!

296
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,126
Alright, dear teachers, dear students,

297
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:47,156
let us now give a warm welcome to.

298
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,200
Mo Xin Wei. Welcome.

299
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:05,816
I always thought that Mo Xin Wei

300
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,636
is only studying design for fun,

301
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,020
that she lacks perseverance.

302
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,850
I'm surprised, she's got some skills.

303
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,150
Are you happy?

304
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:14,900
What are you saying?

305
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,196
No matter how at odds you are,

306
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,540
she's still your cousin.

307
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:20,576
Mo Xin Wei

308
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,200
is at times quite spoiled.

309
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:24,280
But as for designing...

310
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,380
she's quite devoted to that.

311
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,486
Thank you for giving us

312
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:36,516
this brilliant performance.

313
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,976
I'm sure she has a unique say

314
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,706
on this piece of work.

315
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:41,516
So we'd really like to know,

316
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,996
what kind of a design concept
did Mo Xin Wei

317
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,100
have while creating this piece?

318
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,756
I assume the people who watch the news

319
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,500
know what happened to the Jiang family.

320
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,360
My dad

321
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,830
made a mistake when he was young.

322
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,080
Of course,

323
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,536
I'm not in any position

324
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,570
to criticize my elders.

325
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,176
But I have to tell a certain someone

326
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,206
that if you want to destroy my family,

327
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:09,370
or if you want to step foot
inside the Jiang family,

328
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,736
I will always fight you

329
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,730
to the bitter end like a warrior.

330
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,360
I'm on the campus?

331
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,236
Help!

332
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,930
Can anyone hear me?

333
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:31,576
If she's this loud

334
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,706
-she may attract people.
-Anyone?

335
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:33,656
We'll be in big trouble then.

336
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,300
They don't have any evidence.

337
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,290
Besides, the lady has leverage
over them.

338
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,346
I don't get it.

339
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:40,766
-Why bring her to the school?
-Help!

340
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:42,966
The lady doesn't want this matter to get
out of hand.

341
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:43,756
Help!

342
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,886
Now, you may return backstage
to take a rest.

343
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:48,810
Thank you.

344
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:50,576
Next,

345
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:53,946
we'll ask our next contestant,

346
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:56,970
an explosive new fashion talent,
to come on stage.

347
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,496
Let us welcome.

348
00:19:58,580 --> 00:19:59,666
An Chu Xia!

349
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:00,590
Welcome!

350
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:09,706
These are

351
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:10,880
my sketches.

352
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,720
That's so strange.

353
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:16,580
How can they be exactly the same?

354
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,120
Excuse me, contestant no. 4,

355
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:23,276
is this your own design?

356
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,280
Yes.

357
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:26,356
So you're saying

358
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,246
that you created it independently,

359
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:30,720
no one helped you or guided you?

360
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,060
What do you mean?

361
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,940
Answer my question first.

362
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,480
Yes.

363
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,780
In that case,

364
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:39,056
please explain,

365
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,426
why is your design exactly the same

366
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:41,826
as the new sketches Xiang Man Kui

367
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:45,080
released half an hour ago?

368
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:46,470
What?
