00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,140
Master Qi Lu, happy birthday.

2
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:18,590
-Happy birthday.
-Thanks.

3
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:19,660
Thank you.

4
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,390
-Happy birthday.
-Happy birthday.

5
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:24,790
-This way please.
-Thanks.

6
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:35,230
Qi Lu, this is for you.

7
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:37,130
Thanks.

8
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:40,550
Xin Wei picked the gift herself.

9
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:44,744
Cheers.

10
00:00:47,561 --> 00:00:48,061
Cheers.

11
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:49,620
Thanks.

12
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,600
Why didn't Chu Xia come today?

13
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,670
She lives here, right?

14
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:29,230
I didn't see her.

15
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:33,660
Have you done it?

16
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:35,700
Done.

17
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,300
Done it?

18
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:45,420
This should be
the best gift in his life.

19
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,760
Is it?

20
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:52,660
I think this is because
they are not as poor as me.

21
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,910
Can you make one for me?

22
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,770
Anytime.

23
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,430
Why not today?

24
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:01,850
No way.

25
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:05,730
Master Han will get mad if I'm late.

26
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:08,380
-Lady first.
-Thank you.

[Episode 12]

29
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:16,970
Young master.

30
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:19,180
It's about the time.

31
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:22,330
But Master Ling and
Ms. Chu Xia have not come yet.

32
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:30,400
Han, are you hungry?

33
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,980
-I can wait.
-Take it easy then.

34
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:38,970
-Master Ling.
-Uncle Han.

35
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,790
It's good to see you.

36
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,860
Master Han is so worried.

37
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,260
We've been waiting for so long.

38
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,010
You are a chatterbox.
I didn't wait for you.

39
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:55,560
That's right.

40
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:58,110
Shall we start?

41
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,080
Let's start.

42
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,390
This way please.

43
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,880
Hi, everyone!

44
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,030
Thank you so much for
attending my birthday party today.

45
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:22,250
In fact, I hold a party every year. Just
the people who attend it are different.

46
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:25,240
Like someone would walk into my world

47
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:29,040
while some people go out of my world

48
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,120
Like the stars, some will fall

49
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,620
and some are new.

50
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,660
Excuse me that I've talked a lot.

51
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,670
So, I'd like to thank the person
who gives me all the world.

52
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:47,580
Dear Sis Yuan Yuan.

53
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:50,950
And...

54
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:56,020
And you who have come into my world.

55
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,480
Thank you.

56
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:08,020
Really?

57
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:10,540
What are you talking about?

58
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:13,640
I'm asking Chu Xia what
kind of gift she will give you.

59
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,540
What about you?

60
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:17,680
Didn't you bring anything for me?

61
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,860
I will give it to you in the end.

62
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,130
Let's see what Chu Xia brings.

63
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:27,260
I told you, she doesn't need
to prepare anything for me.

64
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:28,900
Busybody.

65
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,810
Forget it then.

66
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:40,080
So boring. Don't just chat here.

67
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,330
Any idea?

68
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:45,960
Let's play "Truth or Dare"

69
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,660
-That's good.
-I'll pass.

70
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:51,570
It's boring to stay in a room alone.

71
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:53,720
Today is Qi Lu's birthday.

72
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,590
Don't be a wet blanket.

73
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,890
It's up to you.

74
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,420
Let's continue.

75
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,320
Let's go.

76
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,030
Let's fool An Chu Xia.

77
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:23,710
-The hall is grand.
-Let's go there.

78
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,060
Where are you going?

79
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,790
Enjoy yourselves, I'll go over there.

80
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,410
Let's play together.

81
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:29,740
An Chu Xia.

82
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,650
Why don't you play with us?

83
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:35,250
Are you afraid of the Truth or Dare?

84
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:40,410
I guess you dare not play with us

85
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:41,880
because you're a maid.

86
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:44,800
Let's start the game,
Mo Xin Wei's slave.

87
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,900
Come on.

88
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:51,810
Let's go.

89
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,820
It's fun.

90
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,470
Master Han, have a seat.

91
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:07,150
Alright, let's play the dice.

92
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:11,120
If you get 6, you have to
choose either Truth or Dare.

93
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:13,380
-Come on.
-Me first.

94
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:13,880
Alright.

95
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,210
I'm so unlucky!

96
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,810
The first round doesn't count.

97
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:29,330
Let's start the game now.

98
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:31,700
That's so kind of you.

99
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,670
I'm willing to do everything
for you in my next life.

100
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:37,080
Let's discuss in our next life.

101
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,310
Alright, next round.

102
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,290
Truth!

103
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:50,920
Well...

104
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:53,560
Chu Xia will ask you a question.

105
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:56,670
-Me?
-Because you sit at the first place.

106
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:59,450
Come on.

107
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,060
Well, Mo Xin Wei,

108
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:05,490
I'm asking you a private question.

109
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,190
Mind your word.

110
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:09,940
Do you like

111
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:11,850
green peppers?

112
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,220
What a private question.

113
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,360
I don't like it.

114
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,820
Congratulations, you passed it.

115
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,900
Next round.

116
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,810
Come on.

117
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,440
Truth or Dare?

118
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:31,880
Dare.

119
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:35,290
You know no one wants
to hear your truth, huh?

120
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:38,310
People who don't want
to befriend you will choose Dare.

121
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,230
Kiss a person of opposite sex.

122
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:52,290
Han Yu, you should help Chu Xia.

123
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,560
You are a coward.

124
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,870
May I have the pleasure?

125
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:08,330
Kissing Master Ling
is not a daring action.

126
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:11,190
Unless you dare to kiss Master Han.

127
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:16,550
She dares not.

128
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,730
I'll have some wine.

129
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:21,450
That's good.

130
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:24,130
You only dare to drink wine.

131
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,380
How much do you want to drink?
A whole bottle.

132
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:33,340
Here you are. Bottoms up!

133
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:36,610
Drink it.

134
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:41,010
What now? Drink it!

135
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:42,470
So lame.

136
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,970
What's going on?

137
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:08,250
I dare to do so!

138
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,630
I did it!

139
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:18,100
It's good that Little Chu Xia
finally takes her step.

140
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,070
God blessed.

141
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:22,770
Let's start the next round.

142
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:24,440
Qi Lu, your turn.

143
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:33,080
Dare.

144
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:36,630
Forget it.

145
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,110
Master Han plays a Dare, huh?

146
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:42,660
It will be really a Dare.

147
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:45,860
Okay.

148
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,650
I'll spare you for once.

149
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:50,490
I choose Truth.

150
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,230
Chu Xia won in the last round.

151
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:56,290
Chu Xia, ask him a question.

152
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,070
When people were talking about you,

153
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:06,200
there was a person
they couldn't tell the name.

154
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,650
Who's that?

155
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,130
She'll be finished.

156
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,690
Chu Xia, ask another question.

157
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:17,220
Okay.

158
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:20,050
I'll ask another question.

159
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,470
What's her name?

160
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,060
Stupid.

161
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,460
I don't know.

162
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,770
Liar! How could you not know?

163
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:33,020
How can you not know
since they know it?

164
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,300
Qi Lu.

165
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:46,150
Qi Lu, wait a moment.

166
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,900
You told her about it?

167
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,060
No.

168
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:55,750
I know it's your taboo, I won't tell.

169
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,050
Looks like you've never left it behind.

170
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:00,720
I've forgotten her.

171
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,250
If that's the case, just forgive her.

172
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:06,980
Chu Xia didn't mean it.

173
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,230
Chu Xia.

174
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:15,990
You guys just looked alright.
Why did he suddenly get mad?

175
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:20,610
Did you bite his tongue
when you're kissing?

176
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:25,450
An Chu Xia.

177
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,890
You caused trouble again.

178
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,840
She always causes troubles.

179
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,270
Do you know why Qi Lu is angry?

180
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,890
I don't want to know.

181
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:39,540
It was just a game. Take it easy.

182
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:43,650
How did your mother die?
She must have suffered.

183
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:45,870
-Mo Xin Wei!
-I am sorry.

184
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:49,710
I just want you to know the pain
of being scarred by someone else.

185
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:53,050
The three taboos
are forever pain for Qi Lu.

186
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,710
I'll apologize to him.

187
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:02,960
Not every apology will work.

188
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:06,050
The holes are still there even if
you pull the nail out from the wall.

189
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:08,510
So what should I do now?

190
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:10,040
Maybe

191
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,930
I can help you.

192
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:14,770
Don't help her!

193
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,740
I'm willing to do anything

194
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:20,500
to make Qi Lu happy.

195
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:23,630
Sing "Little Star" for him.

196
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,370
It's a very important song for Qi Lu.

197
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:28,170
He'll be happy if you sing it.

198
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:30,970
I don't usually help everyone.

199
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,070
It's up to you.

200
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,020
Let's go.

201
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:47,830
Today is your birthday.

202
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:50,320
Please do me a favor and forgive her.

203
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,450
Forgive her?

204
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:54,630
Unless she comes to me
and begs me in person.

205
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:58,900
It means you are no longer angry.

206
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:01,770
Ling Han Yu.

207
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,800
How can you side with her?

208
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,570
No, I stand for justice.

209
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,040
Let's go to your room

210
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:08,810
and see the gift I brought you.

211
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:11,430
Only this time. I'll give you face.

212
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:15,190
Qi Lu, wait!

213
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,170
Twinkle twinkle little star.

214
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:35,730
How I wonder what you are.

215
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:41,070
Up above the world so high.

216
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:45,330
Like a diamond in the sky.

217
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:50,070
I thought I was the worst singer in the world.

218
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:55,970
How I wonder what you are.

219
00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:01,040
Up above the world so high.

220
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:05,050
Like a diamond in the sky.

221
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,770
Why did you sing this song?

222
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:18,090
Why did you sing this song?

223
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:21,030
Han Qi Lu, are you crazy?

224
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:21,800
Qi Lu.

225
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:24,770
Why did you sing this song?

226
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:25,800
You don't deserve it

227
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:27,310
Qi Lu, calm down.

228
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:28,850
Chu Xia doesn't know about it.

229
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:32,790
Why must you sing this song?

230
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,440
Chu Xia, did someone
ask you to sing this song?

231
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:40,690
Mo Xin Wei.

232
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:42,720
Qi Lu.

233
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,710
This has nothing to do with me.

234
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,240
I won't do something that makes you sad.

235
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:50,040
Mo Xin Wei, what a hypocrite!

236
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,880
It was you who asked Chu Xia
to sing the song.

237
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:53,250
I am the witness.

238
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,880
Everybody knows you have
a good relationship with Chu Xia.

239
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:01,100
But you can't frame me.

240
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:03,810
Mo Xin Wei! Just admit it!

241
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:31,970
-Come on.
-Help her.

242
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:34,030
Cover with the towel.

243
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:36,160
What's going on here?

244
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,330
Little Chu Xia, what happened to you?
You were okay just now.

245
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:41,350
Who did this?

246
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:42,360
I don't know.

247
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:44,450
Come on.

248
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,240
You have gone too far.

249
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,530
Little Chu Xia, don't worry.

250
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:52,340
I'll surely stand up for you.

251
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:54,900
Aunt, you can't blame Qi Lu.

252
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,230
-It was...
-Enough.

253
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:58,070
Not your concern.

254
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:08,010
The party is over!

255
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:11,640
Leave!

256
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:14,130
Leave!

257
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:21,570
An Chu Xia is finished.

258
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,620
Thank you for coming.
