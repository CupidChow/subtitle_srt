Chu Xia.

2
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:22,060
What took you so long?

3
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:23,960
Come on.

4
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,740
What happened to you?

5
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:34,970
You look so bad.

6
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:42,330
You look unhappy since you
moved into Han's house.

7
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:46,040
And your hair was nice before.
Why did you make a silly hair cut?

8
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,280
What makes you change all over?

9
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,190
Aunt Jiang doesn't like my old look.

10
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:55,570
I'll dye my hair again after I move out.

11
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:59,520
What's wrong with you?

12
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:04,600
The noble school looks down on you?

13
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:06,200
Someone bullies you?

14
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:14,610
Our relationship has never
faded even my hairstyle changed.

15
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,110
Do me a favor.

16
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:23,620
I'm willing to do everything for you.

17
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,230
Help me get a job,

18
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:29,390
which can make fast cash.

19
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:35,500
-I'm not afraid of being tired and hard.
-Why? Are you short of money?

20
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,180
Han family is so rich,
do they torture you?

21
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:45,370
I broke a vase and

22
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:47,430
spoilt a man.

23
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:49,290
Vase?

24
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:53,230
You spoilt a man with a vase?

25
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:55,860
What do you mean?

26
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,470
Master.

27
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:16,690
Why don't we go in with you?
It's not safe for you to go in alone.

28
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:18,870
No need, go out.

29
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,870
Let me go!

30
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,000
Why are you locking me up?

31
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:07,520
It's been a long time.

32

Let me go!

33
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:22,500
I love Qi Lu.

34
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,490
An Chu Xia's going to steal my Qi Lu!

35
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:28,480
She's a bitch!
She's going to steal my Qi Lu!

36
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:32,690
She's not like the other women.
I'm going to kill her. Let me go!

37
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:34,830
Let me go!

38

Let me go!

00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:40,530
Xiao Xue, don't worry.

I'm helping you.

It's been ten years! What did
you help me for these ten years?

I like you for ten years.

You like me for ten years.

But I only love Qi Lu.

47

I only love Qi Lu. I love him!

48
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:06,970
I'm going to find Qi Lu.

49
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,170

-Sit still.
-Let's go.

54
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,800
Young master, where is Miss Chu Xia?

55
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,310
Don't bother.
She hangs out with people again.

56
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,090
Here you are.

57
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:18,910
What brings you here?

58
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:23,160
-What a pretty girl.
-He's my buddy.

00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,220
-Hi.
-He's Liu Nian,

the supervisor here.

61
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:29,710
Don't you want to get a job
to more fast cash?

62
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:33,900
-We're a good company.
-You'll earn ten yuan for washing a car.

-Yeah, our location is good.

65
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:42,270
There are all high-end neighborhoods.

66
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:44,570
They even queue in
the middle of the night.

67
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,460
As long as you work hard,
you can make money.

-Alright.

-How is it?
-You're awesome!

73
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,830
A friend in need is a friend indeed.

Only our loved one could help
at the critical moment.

-Of course.
-You can get back to your work.

76
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,580
I have to work now.

This is your wages.

-Thank you, supervisor.
-Keep it up, don't be like them.

83
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,930
-Thank you.
-I'm off.

84
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:01,730
Okay.

85
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,780
I'll quit! I'll go on strike!

86
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:18,250
Who's there?

87
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:24,870
Why didn't you sleep
but act like a corpse?

88
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:29,610
I just fell asleep while reading
magazines on the sofa.

89
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,460
You didn't even turn on the lights.
How did you read?

90
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,500
You are trying to scare
people in the late night.

91
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,200
So you know it's a late night now.
I thought you were not coming back.

92
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:47,490
Little Chu Xia, you're back.

93
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:50,620
I wanted to wait for you.

94
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:53,910
Then Qi Lu said he would
wait for you. So I went to sleep.

95
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,290
Are you okay?

96
00:08:55,700 --> 00:09:00,240
I'm fine. I'll tell you earlier
if I come home late next time.

97
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:01,520
Have a nice sleep.

98
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,910
Have a nice sleep too.

99
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,290
No one is going to wait for her

100
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,340
who hung out with someone
in the middle of the night.

101
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:28,780
I can't believe a small girl
like her can be so tough.

102
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:31,070
Yeah.

103
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,760
-She's not afraid of suffering.
-Yeah.

104
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,870
She even made more
than I earned yesterday.

105
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:37,900
Take a break.

106
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:41,540
Take your time. I'm not tired.
I'll work for a while.

107
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:47,680
Hey!

108
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:00,220
Work harder.

109
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,500
She'll quit!

110
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:06,360
-What's wrong?
-You crept me out.

111
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:14,220
You two, wash my car now.

112
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:15,980
I'm washing it now.

113
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:22,400
Make sure you clean it.

114
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:26,050
-Let's go.
-Alright.

115
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:34,790
Why are you working in that place?

116
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,000
It's dangerous.

117
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:40,000
I want to work to pay back the money.

118
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:45,480
Because Mr. You Tian paid for the vase?

119
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,490
-I'll pay for it.
-No need.

120
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,060
I still have to pay you back.
I can't afford it.

121
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,620
I'll find you a new
place for you to work.

122
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:02,690
It is more comfortable and reliable.
And the boss's a beauty.

123
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:05,820
Don't worry.

124
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,850
Not bad.

125
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:24,420
Ms. Maria, I'll leave Chu Xia to you.

126
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:27,680
So, she's your assistant.

127
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,740
Your personal nurse.

128
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,650
You can order me for anything.

129
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:36,600
I really need her favour.

130
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:41,830
But it's between our women.

131
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:42,780
You go out first.

132
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:46,650
Okay, I'll go now.

133
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:50,330
Chu Xia, come on.

134
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,030
Over there.

135
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,730
Go ahead.

136
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,630
I wish to get an injection from her.

137
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:36,750
I'm even willing to get
a poisoned injection from her.

138
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,780
I'm willing.

139
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:44,650
Ouch! Ms. Maria.

140
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:48,930
-Ms. Maria.
-I have a stomachache.

141
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:52,350
-Ms. Maria.
-Help!

142
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:54,630
-I have a headache.
-Ouch!

143
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:15,440
I wanted to beat you up long time ago

144
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:17,820
I finally caught you today.

145
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,790
Sorry for the rudeness.

146
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:22,770
I've been in a bad mood lately

147
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:24,650
and you two are just unlucky.

148
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:39,730
Who requested for a body check-up?

149
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:41,810
-Me.
-It's me.

150
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:46,210
Maybe you don't know.

151
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:53,270
These pliers are imported from Germany.

152
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:56,370
It is refined and sharp.

153
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:59,040
It can easily cut it off

154
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,910
with just a cut.

155
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:06,410
My dear, where do you want to check?

156
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:10,520
-We're fine.
-Above or below?

157
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:15,090
Done!

158
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:18,040
Let's go back to the infirmary.

159
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,180
Come on.

160
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:23,130
Let me help you, come on. Watch out.

161
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:26,240
How could you wear it for so long?

162
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,460
It hurts.

163
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:33,540
Be careful.

164
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,110
What's eating you recently?
You look so bad.

165
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,550
I feel sorry to have
troubled Mr. You Tian.

166
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,880
Because of the vase?

167
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:55,170
You know about it?

168
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:59,580
I don't even have the courage
to apologize to him now.

169
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:04,570
In fact, I had troubled someone before.

170
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:07,120
Is it?

171
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,460
When I was in a medical school in Japan,

172
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:16,230
I met with an introverted and shy boy.

173
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:21,680
He was following silently
behind me wherever I went.

174
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,510
It's a nice feeling to see him around.

175
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:27,510
Like a silent guardian.

176
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:29,480
Like a telepathy.

177
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:32,850
One day, he came to me

178
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:35,820
and confessed his feeling to me.

179
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:37,190
Did you say yes?

180
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:41,970
I didn't want to break the nice feeling.

181
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,161
I didn't know much
about him at the time.

182
00:15:45,186 --> 00:15:47,284
So I rejected him
without hesitation.

183
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:53,850
Then, you know what. He went
to the rooftop of our school

184
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:55,770
and sat there for three hours.

185
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,440
And then?

186
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:00,810
And then he jumped from there.

187
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:04,750
That's it.

188
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:11,600
He died because of me.

189
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:16,950
He died because of you
even you didn't kill him.

190
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:20,370
-Yeah.
-We made a mistake.

191
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:23,130
We've made a serious mistake.
What should we do now?

192
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:27,750
Hey, wake up! Silly girl!

193
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,100
Now, he is living happily in Tokyo.

194
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:33,310
What?

195
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:37,880
In that afternoon, I immediately
introduced him to a girl.

196
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:40,560
She was a Japanese girl
who was prettier than me.

197
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,820
They're a good match
and hit it off quite well.

198
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:48,600
Now, the girl gave birth
to three children for him.

199
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,860
And I'm still single.
I envy them very much.

200
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:56,150
So amazing.

201
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:04,970
From my student time,

202
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:09,700
sickness and death
are just common to me.

203
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:16,640
The feeling of guilt is really hard.

204
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:22,970
So, don't just think how
a man died because of you.

205
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:28,240
You should find a way to save
his life back. That's the point.

206
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:32,560
Find a way to save his life back?

207
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:37,730
Do you know what the
biggest job of a doctor is?

208
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:40,410
To solve the patient's difficulties.

209
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:45,610
Now he's in trouble.

210
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:48,190
Are you willing to solve
the problem for him?

211
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:53,120
I can save his life back too.

212
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:57,430
In fact, it's Mr. You Tian's idea

213
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,540
to let you work here.

214
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:30,370
Principal, I have a request.

215
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:35,450
Class B would like to invite a qualified
artist with a world-class vision

216
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:37,582
to hold a fascinating
painting exhibition.

217
00:18:37,607 --> 00:18:39,884
Can you approve us
to use the exhibition hall?

218
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:45,130
No, the exhibition hall was approved
for a photography exhibition.

219
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,340
What about the auditorium?

220
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,760
No.

221
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,930
The auditorium
was approved for a lecture.

222
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:55,180
What about the black box theater?

223
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,770
No way.

224
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:01,190
It was approved for a drama.

225
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:04,810
Oh yeah!

226
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,620
What about the indoor basketball court?

227
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,190
Indoor basketball court?

228
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,610
There's not many activities these days.

229
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:21,990
We're going to have a
fascinating painting exhibition.

230
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:23,400
Please support.

231
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:27,430
Really?

232
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:30,520
Don't create any trouble.

233
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:35,020
I promise, we won't make any trouble.

234
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:39,130
Please support our cultural activities.

235
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:43,100
It's art appreciation and also a good
practical activity of the auction class.

236
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,770
We're going to have an auction too.

237
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:48,990
There will be a lot of world
celebrities coming to attend it.

238
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:54,110
And the school may attract more sponsors.

239
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:01,350
It's easy to learn it,
but hard to do it.

240
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:05,200
In order to be successful, you have
to learn and do it at the same time.

241
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:10,400
I support the practical activities.

242
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:18,510
Since it's helpful for students'
appreciation and auction class,

243
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:23,270
I'll approve it.

244
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:24,630
Yay!

245
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:28,410
Principal, you're so
understanding and visionary.

246
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:32,200
Stiland College is so lucky
to have a principal like you.

247
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:41,060
Three hours on Friday afternoon.

248
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:43,190
You can't go beyond that.

249
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:46,870
Don't ever break the school rules.

250
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:47,660
Yes, sir.
