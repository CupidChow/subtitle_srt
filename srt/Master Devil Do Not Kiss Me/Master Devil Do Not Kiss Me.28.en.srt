1
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:17,640
Come on! Take it.

2
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,660
Then go over there.

3
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,140
There are students behind.

4
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:24,340
Feng Shao?

5
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:26,380
You're really here!

6
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:30,560
You bet! I promised your mom to
protect you for the rest of your life.

7
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,580
Knock it off!

8
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:32,740
If it weren't for me,

9
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:34,750
Mr. Ma won't allow you to work here.

10
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:35,780
Get a ball for me.

11
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,080
By the way,

12
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,960
Gao Gan hasn't been caught yet.

13
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,870
I heard there are perverts
in the school recently.

14
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:45,550
Ms. Maria seems to have met one.

15
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:47,300
-You two must be careful.
-Alright.

16
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,200
Don't worry.

17
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,410
No pervert can run out of my palm.

18
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,580
Where are you going?

19
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,350
Give me a ball.

20
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:58,250
No more.

21
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:04,380
Go!

22
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,820
Chu Xia, do you really want
to ignore Jiang Chen Chuan?

23
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,090
No.

24
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:13,660
I just haven't figured out
how to deal with him.

25
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:16,160
Anyway, don't worry about me.

26
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,340
I don't have any feelings towards him now.

27
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:20,480
We're really just friends.

28
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,190
What about Han Qi Lu?

29
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:23,910
What do you think of him?

30
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,060
Hi, can I join you?

31
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:33,040
Chu Xia.

32
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:36,310
I can see Sis Yuan Yuan
especially likes you.

33
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,380
Qi Lu also cares about you.

34
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,050
I don't mean anything else.

35
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:46,090
I just hope they can forgive me.

36
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,470
After all, I treat

37
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:50,920
Qi Lu and Sis Yuan Yuan as my family.

38
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,340
Ah!

39
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,970
I'm sorry, Xiang Man Kui.

40
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:56,970
It just slipped.

41
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:59,640
Can you help me pick up the ball?

42
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,120
Okay.

43
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,760
Don't get close to her.

44
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:08,800
What's wrong?

45
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:11,300
Don't you know her relationship
with Han Qi Lu before?

46
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,980
I'm afraid that she has a motive.

47
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,090
You don't say!

48
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:15,110
Why not?

49
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:18,350
Look at Mo Xin Wei. She does
nothing except playing tricks on you.

50
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,840
We can't tar her with the same brush.

51
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,100
Hey, you...

52
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,750
I've memorized it.

53
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,520
-How is it?
-Everything's correct.

54
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:34,440
I'll tell you what.

55
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:37,480
I think Chu Xia likes me.

56
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:40,920
She just hasn't made up her mind.

57
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:42,440
That's good.

58
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,650
I support you.

59
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,710
Feng Shao.

60
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,420
Why did you care so much about me?

61
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,840
I'll tell you what.

62
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,810
I'm not interested in men.

63
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:55,950
What's on your mind?

64
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,620
I'm not gay either.

65
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,090
I'll tell you what.

66
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,610
I help you

67
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:02,780
because I don't like Han Qi Lu.

68
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:03,650
Think about it.

69
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:05,790
He's selfish and arrogant.

70
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:07,330
And even picky.

71
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:09,900
Not like you, handsome, easy going,

72
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,200
rich and good tempered.

73
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,520
Think about it.

74
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,560
If you could get Chu Xia,

75
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,460
you could save her earlier.

76
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,190
Right?

77
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:20,290
You have a good taste.

78
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,350
Bullshit!

79
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,360
I finally caught you.

80
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,280
Ah!

[Episode 5]

83
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,970
You pervert!

84
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:27,800
Let's see his real look.

85
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,640
Mr. You Tian?

86
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,730
You Tian!

87
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,190
You Tian!

88
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:57,310
Hey!

89
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:02,240
Is he the teacher you always mention
who is ambitious and talented?

90
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:04,020
Why was he hiding?

91
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:04,810
Sir.

92
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:06,200
When did you come back?

93
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,590
I've been back for a while.

94
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,220
Why didn't you tell me?

95
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,080
You didn't reply to me for a while.

96
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,440
I'm worried about you.

97
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,920
I've been too busy lately and forget.

98
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:19,300
Why did you dress up like this?

99
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,220
I've been studying

100
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:26,360
Performance Art recently and
looking for creative inspiration.

101
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,320
Last two days,

102
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,920
I met a pervert at school.

103
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,030
Is that you?

104
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:32,900
No.

105
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,840
Sir, how long you are
going to stay this time?

106
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,320
As long as I could.

107
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,770
What?

108
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:46,500
I have no arrangement to leave yet.

109
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,540
Really?

110
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:50,000
Then you can continue to teach us.

111
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,930
But,

112
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:56,110
I'm afraid the principal won't agree.

113
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,830
Maybe my father can help.

114
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:04,490
Really?

115
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,570
Leave it to me.

116
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:07,830
Hey!

117
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,520
Finally, there's something you can do.

118
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:24,640
What's wrong with him?

119
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,750
I heard Mr. You Tian is back.

120
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:34,160
Yeah.

121
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:36,260
Xiao Nan and I plan

122
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,970
to hold a welcome dinner for him.

123
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:39,730
Did you find any venue?

124
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,570
No, Xiao Nan would look for it.

125
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:45,920
It's alright. Just hold it at our house.

126
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:46,450
Huh?

127
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:47,730
Yeah.

128
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:49,380
Call all your classmates.

129
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,060
And I know Mr. You Tian as well.

130
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,770
The more the merrier.

131
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:54,150
Really?

132
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:55,320
Of course.

133
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,440
Qi Lu, is that good?

134
00:07:58,860 --> 00:07:59,860
I'm fine with it.

135
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,270
So, that's decided.

136
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,310
Han, please prepare for it.

137
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,160
Okay, madam.

138
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,130
Thank you.

139
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:07,580
Don't mention it.

140
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,990
We are family.

141
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,010
Dig in.

142
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,720
Mr. You Tian!

143
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:53,360
Mr. You Tian.

144
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,780
I really did not expect
to see you again!

145
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:56,420
Yeah!

146
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,780
Is it fun to be abroad?

147
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:58,730
You bet!

148
00:08:58,730 --> 00:08:59,590
Imagine that.

149
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:02,360
Sunshine, beaches, towers!

150
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:02,670
Hey!

151
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:04,280
It's artistic.

152
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:07,440
Mr. You Tian, did you
meet any beauty there?

153
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,210
Do you think Mr. You Tian is you?

154
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:11,170
You always think of beauty.

155
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:13,370
Sir.

156
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:15,840
Don't leave again until our graduation.

157
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,970
That's right.

158
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:21,280
I didn't expect you
to welcome me so much.

159
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,080
I am so touched.

160
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,480
Actually,

161
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:31,070
I should thank Jiang Chen Chuan
to make me able to come back.

162
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,820
If it wasn't for him,

163
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:35,020
I won't be able to come back.

164
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:40,320
Thank my father.

165
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,910
It's nothing at all.

166
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:45,220
-Don't mention it.
-So cool.

167
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,110
By the way,

168
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,300
the teacher of Literature and Art

169
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,180
just gave me the results of your test.

00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,260
Wang Jian Ren.

171
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,530
-Distribute it.
-Okay.

172
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:22,240
I didn't expect that I could do well

173
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,440
in flower arrangement.

174
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:29,700
Chu Xia, what's wrong with you?

175
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,300
Looks like something's eating you.

176
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,410
I'm finished.

177
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,720
What?

178
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:39,200
Look at it yourself.

179
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,200
"Ballroom Dancing: D"

180
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,150
I remember you chose ballroom dancing.

181
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,290
You are good at it, aren't you?

182
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:51,880
How come you failed?

183
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:54,690
That's what I thought too.

184
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,410
Just a simple dancing.

185
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:58,620
How could it beat me?

186
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:00,740
Eventually,

187
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,520
I have two left feet.

188
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,170
Chu Xia.

189
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:08,500
I can help you.

190
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:12,890
I was selected as
prom prince when I was abroad.

191
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,600
You?

192
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,080
Don't mess it up.

193
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:17,650
What do you mean?

194
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:20,250
It means I don't believe it.

195
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:35,890
But,

196
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:37,350
you're right.

197
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,100
We can't let Chu Xia go on with it.

198
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,200
We have to help her.

199
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,140
How to help her?

200
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,440
She rejected my help.

201
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:47,210
Stupid!

202
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:48,900
Can't you find another way

203
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:51,130
when she rejected you?

204
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,390
Another way?

205
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:54,340
Hey.

206
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,870
Don't tell me to bribe the art teacher.

207
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:00,940
No way! My father
will kill me if he knows it.

208
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:03,370
I'm not that low.

209
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,610
I mean, you can find

210
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:09,420
a professional to help her.

211
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:11,840
Professional?

212
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,860
I'll put it here.

213
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:17,780
I'll go now.

214
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:19,480
Gosh!

215
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:32,570
-Maria.
-Why did you hide from me?

216
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,440
No, I didn't.

217
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,690
You were weird
when you came back that day.

218
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:37,640
Tell me.

219
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,960
What happened?

220
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,070
Nothing.

221
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,440
I knew you were the man I met that day.

222
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,640
I won't get it wrong.

223
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,470
Impossible.

224
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:46,600
That's impossible.

225
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,010
Why did you follow Chu Xia?

226
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:05,970
Ouch!

227
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:37,980
Ouch!

228
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,000
An Chu Xia.

229
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:46,250
It's really you.

230
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:50,590
Why didn't you sleep? What are
you doing here at this hour?

231
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:52,220
Are you trying to scare me?

232
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,800
Mind your own business.

233
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:16,520
Waltz's dance steps.

234
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:20,080
Learning a dance?

235
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,190
Oh!

236
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,230
Why did you learn it?

237
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,240
I...

238
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,950
I failed my art subject
and need to retake.

239
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:35,990
Are you happy now?

240
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:39,600
Let me teach you.

241
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,150
Come on.

242
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:54,920
Let's start.

243
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:59,410
Will you wake Sis Yuan Yuan and others?

244
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:03,120
They would have woken up by you.

245
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:04,760
Don't be afraid, come on!

246
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,490
Follow my steps.

247
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,490
Sorry.

248
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:58,010
Now I know what the noise was.

249
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:03,360
-I don't want to learn anymore.
-Relax.

250
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,510
It does not work.

251
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,030
Let's change to another method.

252
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,710
Take off your shoes.

253
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,150
Take off your shoes.

254
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:19,280
and step on my feet.

255
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,860
I'll lead you.

256
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,360
Can I?

257
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,540
Take off your shoes.

258
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,120
Don't you want to learn?

259
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:50,950
Be serious.

260
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,920
Come on.

261
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:39,500
Chu Xia

262
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,500
Why do you look so dull?

263
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,810
What's wrong with you?

264
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:52,870
Wait.

265
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:55,560
What happened to you?

266
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,880
Are you okay?

267
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,640
Chu Xia.

268
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,910
Don't disturb me.

269
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:00,670
Let me sleep for a while.

270
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:20,960
An Chu Xia fainted

271
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,430
as she was too stressed
competing with Xiang Man Kui.

272
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:24,580
-Fainted?
-Yeah.

273
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,470
She was even hospitalized.

274
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:30,230
Because Xiang Man Kui is so perfect.

275
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:31,140
That's right.

276
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,400
So pathetic.

277
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,300
By the way, what should

278
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,590
-I wear to the ball?
-It doesn't matter.

279
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:39,340
You aren't the main focus anyway.

280
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,360
Chu Xia.

281
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:48,680
Thank you

282
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:49,920
and Xiao Nan.

283
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,500
You two have worked hard for me.

284
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:56,800
Anyway, let's forget

285
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,140
the welcome party.

286
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,710
Why?

287
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,850
Sir.

288
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,700
We didn't have a good chat
since you studied abroad.

289
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:08,410
Moreover, Sis Yuan Yuan
arranges the party personally.

290
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:09,960
You can't reject her.

291
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:13,850
It's too easy to expose.

292
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:15,580
What did you say?

293
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,970
Nothing.

294
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,930
In that case,

295
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:21,650
-thank you anyway.
-You're welcome.

296
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:29,470
Anything else?

297
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:30,910
Sir.

298
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:34,370
Did you know that Ms. Maria
was very worried about you?

299
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:38,430
Well...

300
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:41,770
I don't know if I'm right.

301
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:45,520
But I think there's something
you shouldn't carry alone.

302
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,990
It might be better

303
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:48,820
to share it with people, right?

304
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:52,520
I know.

305
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,390
Thank you.

306
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:57,840
I did meet some trouble lately.

307
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,610
Give me some time

308
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:00,610
to think about it.

309
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:02,780
I'll tell you when I'm done.

310
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:03,660
Okay?

311
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,370
Okay.

312
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:07,290
I won't be hard on you.

313
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,480
So I'll go back to the classroom first.

314
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,560
See you.
