1
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:13,850
Oh...

2
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,760
They are all my favorites.

3
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:18,390
Having a chef at home is awesome.

4
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,040
Here, try it.

5
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,676
It's been a while since I last cooked.

6
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,640
Don't know if it still tastes the same.

7
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:27,590
Let me try.

8
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,136
It's great.

9
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:33,316
Just like before.

10
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,480
Your skill hasn't gotten worse.

11
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:37,866
Chu Xia.

12
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:38,566
You try it too.

13
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:38,956
Really,

14
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,120
it's really good.

15
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,480
How is it?

16
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:47,470
Yes, it's good.

17
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:50,526
If you like my cooking,

18
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,186
I can come cook for you every day,

19
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:53,536
since no one is here to cook for you.

20
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:54,256
Great.

21
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:55,616
As long as you don't find it annoying.

22
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:56,970
How could we?

23
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,536
I have to thank you.

24
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,760
Listen, I was thinking this morning,

25
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:04,120
if I had to eat Chu Xia's bad
cuisine for a week,

26
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:06,590
I probably have to die young.

27
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:11,330
Oh right, Little Kui.

28
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:12,736
How is your foot?

29
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,020
I could take you to the hospital
after dinner.

30
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:16,716
I'm fine, really.

31
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,136
Didn't we apply some ointment already?

32
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:19,830
Don't make a fuss about it.

33
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:23,746
I'm worried you may not be able
to cook for us

34
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:25,100
if something's wrong with your foot.

35
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:26,410
Stop it.

36
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:30,360
I'm full.

37
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,026
You didn't even eat anything.

38
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:35,540
Do you get full from a piece of
vegetable?

39
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:37,626
I've been on a diet lately.

40
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:38,830
I can't eat too much.

41
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:46,480
You are quite fat.

42
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:50,116
However,

43
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,446
you have to eat more,

44
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:53,230
that way you'll have the strength
to be my maid.

45
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:54,546
Who wants to be your maid?

46
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:55,470
You.

47
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:56,750
You...

48
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,026
Eat.

49
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:03,450
Don't answer the phone.

50
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,800
Hello?

51
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:09,496
Sure, sure.

52
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:10,650
I'll be right over.

53
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:12,556
Ok, ok.

54
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,480
Alright.

55
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,220
Hey,

56
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:29,550
don't you think that Jiang Chen Chuan and
Chu Xia are quite a good match?

57
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:32,350
Are they?

58
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,800
I don't think so.

59
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,580
Chu Xia can't go stay at the Han family's
place tonight, no matter what.

60
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,186
What do we do?

61
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:42,800
Make her drunk.

62
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,760
Cheers!

63
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:51,720
Han Qi Lu, that jerk!

64
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,040
You're right!

65
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,140
That's right!

66
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,060
She was clearly only pretending.

67
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:00,900
But Han Qi Lu just can't see it.

68
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:04,956
The two of them flirting right
before my eyes.

69
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,966
They are too much!

70
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:06,536
Come on,

71
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,656
don't be angry.

72
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,336
-Come, let's drink.
-Let's drink.

73
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,486
-Bottoms up.
-Whatever you say.

74
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:11,820
-Bottoms up!
-Cheers.

75
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:49,176
=Master Devil Don't Kiss Me S2=

76
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,100
=Episode 16=

77
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:00,490
Who's calling me names?

78
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,610
Since when have you
become so superstitious?

79
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,306
It's all An Chu Xia's influence.

80
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:10,320
My IQ has been dropping lately.

81
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:12,800
Does Chu Xia

82
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,100
know that you're going to England?

83
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:21,710
Aren't you gonna tell her?

84
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,980
It's something even I myself can't
sort out,

85
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:31,700
I shouldn't drag her into it, too.

86
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,360
No matter what happens,

87
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:39,640
we'll face it together.

88
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:45,020
Even though I can't solve your problem in
my current situation

89
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:47,550
but I will always be by your side.

90
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:57,730
Qi Lu.

91
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,330
Can we...

92
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:02,910
It's getting late.

93
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,810
Hm... let me take you home.

94
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,220
You have to get up early tomorrow.

95
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:22,640
(Keep it up!)

96
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,130
(What?)

97
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,210
(Make her drunk and then!)

98
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,600
(Make her drunk and then...)

99
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,006
(Get a room!)

100
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:33,240
What the hell are you thinking?

101
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,040
What?

102
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,426
Nothing, nothing.

103
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:38,616
Chu Xia, continue drinking.

104
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:39,900
Continue drinking.

105
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,976
If you dare take advantage of her,

106
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,180
I'll break off all relations.

107
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:46,086
Hey,

108
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:47,046
I'm not that kind of person.

109
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:48,616
I was saying, we'll go with the plan.

110
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,056
Once I've made her drunk

111
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,166
I'll get her a room in a hotel.

112
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,796
Once she's asleep, I'll leave.

113
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,006
What were you thinking?

114
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:55,000
Alright.

115
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:59,110
Anyway, we can't let her and Han Qi
Lu meet alone in the middle of the night.

116
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,576
But, after we handle tonight,

117
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,236
what will we do for the rest of
the days?

118
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,886
Oh, don't worry.

119
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:07,000
I've planned out many different
strategies.

120
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,006
All in all,

121
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:09,566
we can't let them be alone together
at night

122
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:12,560
before his dad comes back.

123
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:14,670
Buddy, good job.

124
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:18,536
Where did you go?

125
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,676
No, no.

126
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,666
Acting all shady.

127
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,060
All men are jerks.

128
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,020
Hello?

129
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,790
Little angel?

130
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,360
I'm drinking.

131
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:29,866
Oh... alright, alright.

132
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:30,456
Ok,

133
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,036
I'll pick you up right away.

134
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,210
Ok.

135
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:34,980
Hey, Feng Shao, you are leaving?

136
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:36,856
Er... Yeah...

137
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:37,496
Er,

138
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:38,716
take care of Chu Xia.

139
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,706
I'm leaving.

140
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:40,630
Oh.

141
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,280
Where is Feng Shao?

142
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,886
Feng Shao left.

143
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,156
Chu Xia, look how drunk you are.

144
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,640
How about we go? Stop drinking.

145
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,120
I'm not going home!

146
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,110
Who's drunk?

147
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,400
This won't do.

148
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:04,580
I have to make her drunker.

149
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,290
I'm sorry, Chu Xia.

150
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,530
This is for your best.

151
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,296
Sir!

152
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,790
Another crate of beer!

153
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,120
Right away!

154
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,980
Don't... don't drink alone...

155
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:30,516
Don't go back yet.

156
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,520
Stop by the road.

157
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:41,580
The number you've dialed is currently
unavailable, please try again later.

158
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,160
Drink.

159
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:50,390
Drink!

160
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,360
You can drink a lot.

161
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:11,680
Luckily I came prepared.

162
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,010
Ready Q.

163
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,220
And you want to make me drunk?

164
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,620
Forget about it!

165
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:20,440
Awesome.

166
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:21,880
You're awesome.

167
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,286
Hello?

168
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:30,700
Jiang Chen Chuan.

169
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,450
Is An Chu Xia with you?

170
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,716
Who are you?

171
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,330
Han Qi Lu.

172
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,320
Huh? Han Qi Lu?

173
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:40,580
-Hello?
-Hello? My phone!

174
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:42,876
An Chu Xia, where are you?

175
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,040
I'll come pick you up.

176
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:45,150
I...

177
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,226
It's none of your business.

178
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:51,540
I'm not telling you where I am.

179
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:54,450
Han Qi Lu.

180
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,960
Don't you have your Little Kui?

181
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,066
Go find your Little Kui.

182
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,500
Han Qi Lu, I'm telling you,

183
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:01,896
you are an idiot,

184
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:02,516
a fool,

185
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,136
a quail egg,

186
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,190
a dinosaur egg!

187
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:06,924
What kind of eggs are there?

188
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,870
Poached egg.

189
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:15,296
Start the car.

190
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,220
I'm going home.

191
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:18,296
Good job insulting him, Chu Xia.

192
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,630
Let's drink.

193
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,396
Stop drinking.

194
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,120
Let's go.

195
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,596
Let's go.

196
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,880
Just one more sip, one more sip!

197
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,020
-What are you doing?
-Let's go.

198
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,266
If we don't go,

199
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:32,676
Han Qi Lu will come and find us here.

200
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,270
Oh, we can't let him find us.

201
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:39,620
Hey! You haven't paid yet!

202
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:40,336
Hey, Little Kui, stop running.

203
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,270
No, two more rounds.

204
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,406
It's just one question you got wrong.

205
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:46,420
Do you have to make it into such
a big deal?

206
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,006
You have to be self-disciplined,

207
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:50,706
or you will become mediocre.

208
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,206
So what if you are mediocre?

209
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:54,690
You'll be my wife sooner or later.

210
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:59,480
Han Qi Lu.

211
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,650
This sounds like it's gonna be
puppy love.

212
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:04,426
So what if it's puppy love, it's
still love.

213
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:05,896
The earlier the better,

214
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:06,820
right?

215
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,200
Who is your wife?

216
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:30,080
Wake up!

217
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:40,096
Is... is it safe here?

218
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,400
Hey, hey.

219
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,226
-Is it safe here?
-It's safe.

220
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:46,326
It's hundred percent safe!

221
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:47,216
Listen,

222
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:50,416
the most dangerous place
is also the safest place.

223
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,256
Han Qi Lu that jerk will never
find us here.

224
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,846
Han Qi Lu is a poached egg!

225
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:56,080
That's right!

226
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:57,260
He is...

227
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,756
He is a poached egg.

228
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,940
Listen,

229
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,540
Han Qi Lu

230
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,800
will regret it.

231
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,560
Han Qi Lu.

232
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:13,980
Poached egg.

233
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,790
Poached egg.

234
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,470
Jiang Chen Chuan, what are you doing?

235
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,140
Nothing.

236
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,420
Hey!

237
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:24,516
Don't go!

238
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,250
I will be responsible for you!

239
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:35,980
Where were you last night?

240
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:38,356
I heard

241
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,106
that An Chu Xia and Jiang Chen Chuan

242
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:42,786
spent last night in the school's lawn.

243
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:44,296
Wow, really?

244
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,960
She is so shameless.

245
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,620
It's such great weather today.

246
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,110
Spent the night?

247
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,336
What did you and Jiang Chen Chuan
do last night?

248
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:56,650
What are you thinking?

249
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,416
It doesn't matter what I think.

250
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,296
It matters what you did!

251
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:01,276
Han Qi Lu.

252
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,116
Don't talk to me in that tone.

253
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,336
As if I did something unfair to you.

254
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,046
You know best whether you did
something or not.

255
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:08,216
What do I know?

256
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,276
I only know that you
and Little Kui were flirting,

257
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,356
taking me for air.

258
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,236
I also know that you two
had a candlelight dinner,

259
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,736
burning me like a candle

260
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:15,976
to add to your atmosphere.

261
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:16,836
Han Qi Lu!

262
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,666
Face your true feelings.

263
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,776
If you like her, then get back
together with her.

264
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,646
Don't be insatiable and greedy!

265
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:25,640
I'm not a buy-one-get-one-free gift in
your world of love.

266
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:27,360
Take this.

267
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:29,850
You're crazy.

268
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:41,970
Hello?

269
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:46,640
Brother Liu.

270
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:50,100
Miss Liu.

271
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:52,900
Call me Meng Meng.

272
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,920
Oh, Meng Meng.

273
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,626
You brought me fruits again?

274
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:59,036
Today's fruits

275
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,076
are even fresher than yesterday's.

276
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:01,816
Here,

277
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:02,740
try it.

278
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,656
Yuan Yuan.

279
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,440
Why are you still here?

280
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:13,100
Aren't you tired from watching him here
all the time?

281
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:16,660
You should go home and rest a few days.

282
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,446
I'm here

283
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:20,240
to take care of Brother Liu.

284
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:21,890
I'm really not tired.

285
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:26,436
But you running here every day to bring
Brother Liu fruit and being attentive,

286
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,816
I feel like you must be tired.

287
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:28,870
I'm not tired!

288
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:37,750
Er,

289
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:39,690
I'm leaving.

290
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,026
Brother Liu.

291
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:42,740
I'll see you tomorrow.

292
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,846
Ok, ok.

293
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:44,940
I'm leaving.

294
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,016
-Bye bye.
-Bye bye.

295
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,360
Bye bye.

296
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,550
-Bye bye.
-Bye bye.

297
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:56,016
Old Han, stop looking!

298
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:56,796
We're leaving!

299
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,980
Leave the hospital!

300
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,366
But...

301
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:01,500
But the doctor didn't say I could
leave yet?

302
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,280
You like it here?

303
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:04,616
No,

304
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,056
didn't you say

305
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:06,766
that I should

306
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:09,176
rest some more days in the hospital?

307
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:11,496
I should only leave when I'm fully
recovered.

308
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:12,436
You're done recovering.

309
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,066
I can't stay here a day longer!

310
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:14,990
We're leaving, Old Han.

311
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,010
Madam.

312
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,580
You really want to get discharged today?

313
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,440
Hey, Brother Liu. Brother Liu.

314
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,506
It was my fault just now.

315
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,090
I shouldn't have been so petty.

316
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,606
Let's stay here a few more days.

317
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:36,680
It's alright.

318
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:39,976
I think I've already pretty much
recovered.

319
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,336
It'll be the same if I rest at home.

320
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,576
That won't do.

321
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,500
The hospital is much better than home.

322
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,266
I'm saying, look,

323
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,396
in the hospital

324
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,866
we eat regularly,

325
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:53,656
and we keep regular hours.

326
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,820
Er,

327
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,476
it's quite noisy at home, too.

328
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,860
Don't you think?

329
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,260
Talking about noisiness...

330
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,680
I miss Qi Lu a bit.

331
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:06,666
What's up with that kid?

332
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:09,060
Why hasn't he visited me lately?

333
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,200
Is he so busy with school?

334
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,730
Yes, that's right.

335
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:14,920
Oh right,

336
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,156
give me the phone.

337
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,576
I want to call Secretary Liu,

338
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:19,486
I'll ask her about the company's
situation.

339
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:21,040
Oh, er,

340
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,226
the doctor said

341
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,076
that cell phones

342
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,086
harm the body with their radiation.

343
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:26,290
He took it away.

344
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:27,780
-He took it?
-Yes.

345
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,720
Then give me your phone.

346
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,566
He took mine, too.

347
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:32,490
Huh?

348
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:34,670
Then yours, Old Han.

349
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,900
I forgot just now.

350
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:39,916
The doctor told me to hand in
my iPad, too.

351
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,640
Go quickly.

352
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,220
Oh, Brother Liu.

353
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,816
Listen,

354
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:47,656
look, we won't be staying long.

355
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:49,426
Just have a good rest here.

356
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:52,570
Be patient for a few days and
we're going home.

357
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:54,656
Let me give you a massage.

358
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:55,660
Alright.

359
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,900
Hi, Sister Yuan Yuan.

360
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,420
Ok, I got it.

361
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,420
Don't worry.

362
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:22,710
I already found a way to deal
with the company's situation.

363
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:24,800
Ok.

364
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,036
Alright.

365
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:26,960
Bye bye.

366
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,246
They say that once the investment program
is accepted,

367
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:36,966
they'll help us with the investment,

368
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,450
and help us overcome the crisis.

369
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:40,680
When will we have news about Le Xi?

370
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,970
One of these days.

371
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:45,276
They read through the investment
program,

372
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,490
but they still haven't given us
a clear attitude.

373
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:50,056
Actually, Le Xi is just a small case,

374
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:50,980
but...

375
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,640
But they want to use Le Xi's case

376
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:58,170
to test our Han's Group's level
and condition in times of failure

377
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:01,976
to give them a reason to invest 100
million and become our new shareholder.

378
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,320
Young Master, you're smart.

379
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,180
What's their background?

380
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,346
I don't know.

381
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:08,936
They only said that you are old
acquaintances.

382
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,650
Old acquaintances?

383
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,090
This way.

384
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:26,650
Hello.

385
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,480
I am Ling Hang Enterprise's
executive director,

386
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:43,240
Ling Han Yu.
