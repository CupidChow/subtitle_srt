1
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:14,530
Are you okay? Chu Xia?

2
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:18,910
A lot of men are protecting you, huh?

3
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:22,140
Mo Xin Wei, I don't think
I'm not as good as you.

4
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:24,800
I suggest you go to the ophthalmologist.

5
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,920
I know a skilled American doctor.
I'll introduce him to you.

6
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,400
None of us can decide the winner.

7
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,040
See you at the Campus Beauty Contest.
Let's see who the Campus Beauty is.

8
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,580
-Chu Xia, thank you for taking part.
-Nothing to do with you.

9
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:39,910
Just because I hate her.

10
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,410
Okay.

11
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,170
Alright, we'll see then.

12
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:47,470
Chu Xia, let's go.

13
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,760
Chu Xia!

14
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:00,990
Big news!

15
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:04,470
Chu Xia officially decided to take
part in the Campus Beauty Contest

16
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,960
and declare war on Mo Xin Wei!

17
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:13,530
Awesome! Chu Xia!

18
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:16,650
Let's fight for it to defeat Mo Xin Wei!

19
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:17,490
That's right!

20
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:20,240
Don't worry, I'll lead the Summer Club

21
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,370
to support and cheer you on.

22
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,920
-Summer Club?
-Yeah.

23
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,350
Your fan club.

24
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:30,900
Wait a moment.

25
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:32,840
But I suddenly found out that

26
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,650
I don't know anything about the contest.

27
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,470
-That's right.
-What do they compete?

28
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,840
It doesn't matter.

29
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,970
I believe we can help Chu Xia to win

30
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:51,140
as long as we work together, right?

31
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,440
That's right!

32
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,710
Sure win!

33
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,320
We believe in Chu Xia!

34
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,400
-Where's Xiao Nan?
-I don't know.

35
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,130
Yes, I've checked it out for you.

36
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:26,890
Yes.

37
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:28,380
I analyzed it for you too.

38
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,550
Okay, I have something to do here.
Let's talk later.

39
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:36,440
What's wrong?

40
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,320
I have something to ask you.

41
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,200
What's that?

42
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,280
Is there any special physical problem

43
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,130
that you need my explanation?

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,580
It's not a physical problem,

45
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:55,930
-but psychological problem.
-A psychological problem?

46
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,410
Are you having a crush?

47
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,520
No, I'm not.

48
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,220
I just signed up for
the Campus Beauty Contest.

49
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,540
That's good.

50
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,360
I believe you can make it.

51
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:13,820
I support you.

52
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,390
Do you really think I can make it?

53
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:19,990
Actually,

54
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:22,390
it's not that hard.

55
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:24,500
At least, signing up for the contest

56
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,960
is the key to success.

57
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,000
Am I right?

58
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:31,770
But, I don't know anything
about the Campus Beauty Contest.

59
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:37,560
I don't even know how to
perform better in the contest.

60
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:41,610
Actually, it's not that hard.

61
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:45,480
You just have to show
the most beautiful side of you.

62
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,720
I'm sure you can win.

63
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,240
Which side?

64
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,500
Which side?

65
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,590
It's a little hard.

66
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,360
Ms. Liu.

67
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,460
You're giving me a hit!

68
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,100
Don't call me Ms. Liu!

69
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,960
Give me some time.

70
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:11,560
I'm sure I'll find it.

71
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,390
Do you really think I have a chance?

72
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,200
Yeah.

73
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:20,390
Chu Xia, you have the
most beautiful heart.

74
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:24,290
Ms. Liu.

75
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:27,880
I will be yours in the future.

76
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,950
You'd better keep it to yourself.

77
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,930
Let me tell you.

78
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:36,450
When you put on the make up, you must...

[Episode 21]

81
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,180
Chu Xia, come here.

82
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,550
These are all prepared
for the Campus Beauty Contest.

83
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,340
Is there one you like?

84
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:22,330
I can't accept such an expensive gift.

85
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:24,150
Of course you can't.

86
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,030
But these are all cheap.

87
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:28,840
So, don't reject.

88
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:33,460
But, none of them fits me.

89
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:41,370
Why don't we go shopping
together this weekend?

90
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:42,930
Sure.

91
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,990
I believe you know
fashion better than I do.

92
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:49,350
But, I will pay for it myself.

93
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,870
Alright then.

94
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,070
Let's go.

95
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:18,510
Little Chu Xia, eat slowly.
No one's going to grab your food.

96
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:20,290
You're going to choke!

97
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:22,900
I'll go shopping with someone
and I have to go now.

98
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,760
I'm going to the mall this afternoon.

99
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:27,800
I can give you a ride, though reluctantly.

100
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:31,310
No need, I have a date with Han Yu.

101
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,360
Slow down

102
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:40,820
Sis Yuan Yuan, I'm leaving.

103
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,570
Wait! I'll give you some money.

104
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:43,600
No, I have money.

105
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,170
Bye, I'm leaving!

106
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:49,600
Han Yu?

107
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:52,340
Han Yu?

108
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:54,870
Still have time to think, huh?

Your bride is running away with
someone else. Chase her back!

Let's go to the mall in the afternoon.

111
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:17,610
His brain is finally open.

112
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:41,310
Mo Xin Wei, I don't like
people touching me.

113
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,450
Qi Lu.

114
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,920
Could you concentrate
when you come out with me?

115
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,200
It's you who come out with me.

116
00:08:58,010 --> 00:08:59,600
Qi Lu, let's take a look.

117
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:04,200
Qi Lu! Does this look good?

118
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,890
What about this?

119
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,680
-Nice?
-Not bad.

120
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,960
What about this?

121
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,870
Not bad.

122
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,330
What's wrong with you?

123
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:25,700
Qi Lu, could you concentrate?

124
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:26,760
Let's go.

125
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,810
This way.

126
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:55,190
Let's go shopping and eat!

127
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,400
Alright.

128
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,430
Let's go shopping!

129
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,630
I'm sorry.

130
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:05,590
Xiao Nan and Jiang Chen Chuan
insisted to be my advisor

131
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:07,140
when they knew about my shopping trip.

132
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,310
Do you mind?

133
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,840
It's alright. The more people the merrier.

134
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,430
Come on.

135
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:14,150
There are much food that
I'm craving for! Let's go eat!

136
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:25,400
Chu Xia seems to be
likeable in Stiland College.

137
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,360
How come a noble person
like you care about me?

00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,620
Aren't you tired?

00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:30,870
Qi Lu.

140
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:33,670
What makes you in the mood
to hang around today?

141
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:37,600
I'm just bored.

Young Master Han.

143
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:42,080
I remember someone
saying that he was busy.

144
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:43,710
Not your concern!

145
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,210
Since we've met here,

146
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:47,450
let's walk together.

147
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:49,700
That's good!

148
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,810
The more the merrier.

149
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:52,960
-Qi Lu, let's go together.
-I'm fine.

150
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:15,060
Let's go.

151
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:16,640
Wait for me.

152
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:20,910
This one.

153
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:26,160
-Xiao Nan, does it look nice?
-So nice.

154
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,040
I like it, give it to me.

155
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:31,160
Chen Chuan.

156
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,120
You look better in this.

157
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,240
Take it.

158
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:53,180
I like this style too.

159
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,370
It looks funny.

160
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:19,420
This is nice, try it.

161
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,700
Qi Lu.

162
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,960
This is not so nice.

163
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,950
I say it looks good.

164
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,300
Let's change a pair of shoes.

165
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:35,260
Wait.

166
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,080
Chen Chuan!

167
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,720
I have changed it.

168
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:45,120
-Does it look good?
-Good.

169
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,800
I knew you liked it.

170
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:51,260
What about this?

171
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,120
Does it look nice?

172
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,280
Nice. It'd be better
to change your face.

173
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,580
You are annoying!

174
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:02,160
Well...

175
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:06,390
-I'll change it and show it to you.
-Go ahead.

176
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:20,900
An Chu Xia.

177
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,170
This dress suits you very well.

178
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,200
Buy it.

179
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:27,330
There are many clothes that fit me.

180
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:29,830
I'm looking for
the clothes that I fit for.

181
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,450
Looking for something
you fit for? At here?

182
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:34,960
You'd better

183
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,870
get it from TBao online shopping.

184
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:38,400
That suits you.

185
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,840
Is the owner of TBao your dad?

186
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:45,050
You seem to work so hard to promote it.

187
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,690
But you both look alike.

188
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:55,340
If it wasn't for Qi Lu,
I'll screw you up.

189
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,390
Let me do it myself.

190
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,220
Qi Lu, please zip it up for me.

191
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:25,830
What are you doing? I feel ashamed.

192
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:27,100
Zip it up for me.

193
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:06,680
Really?

194
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,730
He was so shy.

195
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,260
I'm going to play with this.

196
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,280
-This looks so fun.
-It's fun.

197
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:22,840
I want to see what someone
looks like when he's afraid.

198
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,320
I've never entered
the haunted house before.

199
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:28,040
Qi Lu, let's go.

200
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,670
So lame.

201
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:32,020
You're afraid of ghosts, huh?

202
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,330
The Physicist, Dr. Amit Goswami

203
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:38,600
uses the concepts of
quantum physics to explain

204
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,230
the existence of ghosts in his book,
Physics of the Soul...

205
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:43,400
Cut the crap! Are you coming or not?

206
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:50,340
Let's go.

207
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:57,050
Guys.

208
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:59,540
Our chamber is divided into
many different rooms.

209
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:02,800
We have our staff in every room
who disguised as different ghost.

210
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,480
There's a key hidden
in the corner of the chamber.

211
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:08,380
As long as you find the key,
you can unlock the door.

212
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:10,580
The rules are simple,
but please remember.

213
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,310
Don't beat our staff.

214
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:24,260
Don't pull me!

215
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,180
Chen Chuan, I'm afraid.

216
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,840
Why don't you go out first?

217
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,300
No!

218
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:54,000
I want to be with you, forever.

219
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,680
I'm afraid of what you said.

220
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:01,760
Be careful.

221
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:02,760
Come on.

222
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,300
Didn't you say you weren't afraid?

223
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:18,590
I'm not scared.

224
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,790
Qi Lu.

225
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:25,120
Qi Lu.

226
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:40,360
Chen Chuan.

227
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:43,350
Chen Chuan, where are you?

228
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:45,020
Qi Lu.

229
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,310
Where is Qi Lu?

230
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:51,430
-Chen Chuan
-Where's Chu Xia?

231
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,960
Why do you stop walking?

232
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,300
Didn't you say you weren't afraid?

233
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:07,600
Of course I'm not afraid.

234
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,960
So cute.

235
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,210
Put it down.

236
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:47,100
How can we go out without Qi Lu?

237
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,860
Hurry!

238
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,580
Is Chu Xia with Qi Lu?

239
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,750
Forget it. I'll quit.

240
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:05,820
Xin Wei! Wait for us!

241
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:07,310
Xiao Nan, hurry!

242
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,280
Hurry!

243
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:15,760
Hurry!
