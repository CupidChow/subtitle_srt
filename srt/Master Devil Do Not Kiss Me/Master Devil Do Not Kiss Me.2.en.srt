1
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:14,790
Qi Lu.

2
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,930
I'm scared.

3
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,490
Idiot! You put me in trouble.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,700
Do you know what you did?

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,030
It's all her fault.

6
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:28,020
Kill her alone!

7
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:29,140
Shut up!

8
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,060
-Hello.
-Ma Jian Guo.

9
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:39,080
You promised to return the guns at noon!

10
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:40,960
What's the time now?

11
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,790
Mr. Ma?

12
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,590
Sorry to trouble you.

13
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:46,650
Mr. Ma.

14
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:50,270
Take off the mask!

15
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,110
He's Mr. Ma.

16
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:55,690
-What's wrong?
-Mr. You Tian?

17
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,720
-What's wrong?
-We've been cheated.

18
00:00:59,436 --> 00:01:01,006
-Everybody.
-The principal is here.

19
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:02,240
Principal.

20
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,740
The military training is over.

21
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,820
-Training?
-Training?

22
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,200
What the hell?

23
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:13,350
This is too much.

24
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:16,160
It's you who made Xin Wei suffer.

25
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:17,340
I won't let you go.

26
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:20,620
It creeps me out.

27
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:22,300
Too bad.

28
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,810
Let's go.

29
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,540
It was just a false alarm.

30
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:28,150
Hey, Qi Liu! Wait!

31
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:31,020
Hey, wait a moment.

32
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,520
Here is your mobile phone.

33
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:36,378
What's up?

34
00:01:37,403 --> 00:01:41,160
It was my fault, but you promised
to pay me 500,000 yuan.

35
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:45,220
I'll go and get the money, 5276.

36
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:45,840
Right?

37
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,640
500,000 yuan?

38
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,560
If it was not a training,

39
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:53,350
you'd bring us to death.

40
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,520
I don't care!

41
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,150
You promised to pay
as long as you are safe!

42
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:00,520
You can't get it if I call to the bank.

43
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,160
You broke the promise!

44
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,340
How is it?

45
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:08,000
-Couldn't reach her, she's out of coverage.
-Try again.

46
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,560
She didn't pick up the call.

47
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,600
Try again.

48
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,410
I have tried it.

49
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:15,810
Hurry up.

50
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,360
Is this Mrs. An Shu Ya's ward?

51
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:20,150
Who are you?

52
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,410
She's Mrs. Han,

53
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,520
the wife of Mr. Han Liu Hai
of Han's Group.

54
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:26,930
I've never heard of it.

55
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,580
She has signed a consent
for organ donation before.

56
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,170
The hospital called me today.

57
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:33,830
Her kidney is a match with my husband's.

58
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,350
So I'm here to thank her.

59
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:36,900
What's going on?

60
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,070
She's still alive.

61
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,060
What do you want?

62
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:40,330
I'll tell you what.

63
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,490
She won't die.

64
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,200
Get out of here!

65
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,220
-Get out!
-I didn't mean it.

66
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,570
I just want to thank her.

67
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,080
-Get out!
-Be quiet.

68
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,610
The patient wants to see you guys.

69
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:03,550
-You can't ask for money!
-Yes, Feng Shao.

70
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:04,590
Been caught?

71
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,740
Listen, your mom was hit
by an accident and hurt badly.

72
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:08,840
She's in the hospital.

73
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,280
-Quickly come over.
-Hello.

74
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:12,840
Chu Xia!

75
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,020
-What?
-Chu Xia!

76
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,600
Say something!

77
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:17,740
Chu Xia.

78
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:18,710
Found the kidney?

79
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,490
Okay, I'll be right there.

80
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,720
The last thing is,

81
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:28,860
I always keep my promise.

82
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:32,070
But you have to be sensible
even you're poor.

83
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:43,180
Insane!

84
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:52,800
Hi.

I'm Jiang Yuan Yuan.

My husband is Mr. Han Liu Hai
of Han's Group.

87
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:04,760
Unexpectedly, I have to sign it.

88
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:11,100
Thank you.

89
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,260
Since that's the case,

90
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:17,940
I'd like to add one more condition.

91
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,390
No problem.

92
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,940
How much do you want?

93
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:31,700
Please raise my daughter

94
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:39,310
until she's graduated and married.

95
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,120
I understand.

96
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,730
I understand your intention as a mother.

97
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:50,320
I'll treat your daughter as my own child.

98
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,010
Don't worry.

99
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:57,920
Chu Xia is good at studies.

100
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,640
But her stomach is weak

101
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,970
and can't take cold food.

102
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:05,970
She's allergic to seafood.

103
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:08,740
Okay.

104
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,640
Don't worry.

How is dad doing?

109
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,100
He's in the operation.

110
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:38,210
What's that on your face?

111
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,090
Nothing.

112
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:41,540
I was hit by a mad.

113
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:44,400
Don't cry, let's figure it out.

-There she comes.
-Chu Xia

115
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,440
Sorry.

116
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:53,600
Your mom has signed
a consent of organ donation.

117

-Chu Xia!
-Chu Xia!

You are...

She's An Chu Xia,
the patient's daughter.

120
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,760
Chu Xia, I'm Jiang Yuan Yuan.

121
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,270
Why are you here?

122
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,140
Is that your father?

123
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:29,520
I can't make it to see
my mom because of you!

124
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:32,390
-It's all your fault!
-Calm down!

125
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,900
Mom, I have money now.

00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,560
I have 500,000 yuan.

127
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:07,140
I'm able to go to school now.

128
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,910
You don't have to work so much.

129
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:10,800
Mom.

130
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,770
We wanted to wait for
dad together, didn't we?

131
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,490
Mom, I know it.

Chu Xia.

133
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:33,830
I promised your mom

to take care of you.

135
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:38,540

Nothing else.

My mother is my everything.

00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:43,820
I have nothing else now.

139
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,020
Chu Xia, I'm here.

140
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:47,420
From now on,

141
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,660
I'm your family.

142
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:50,460
You are my daughter.

143
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:23,790
Chu Xia.

144
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,480
The man in the hospital
asked me to pass it to you.

145
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:29,180
He told you not to fold it,
or you can't cash it out.

Chu Xia.

Don't you want to go to Han's mansion?

148
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:49,280
It's not about money.

149
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,330
But my mom wants me to go there.

150
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,280
I have to make my mom relieved.

151

I'm going back to school.

-Yes.

-Did you arrange the funeral?
-Yes.

157
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:03,350
Alright.

158
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,250
Let's get ready to bring Chu Xia home.

159
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,220
Okay.

160
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:10,250
Bring her home? What do you mean?

161
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:13,730
I've promised Chu Xia's mom

162
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,660
to raise her until her graduation.

163

From now on,

You are an ominous person!

00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,740
My house's gone!

173
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:57,630
The iron was burning in the house

174
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:59,450
and it burnt my house.

175
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:00,730
Sorry.

176
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,000
No point.

177
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,500
Give me back the house!

178
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,630
-What a bad luck!
-Says who?

179
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,280
She's an ominous person!

180
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:10,190
I'll pay for it.

181
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,680
But,

182
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,320
my mom just passed away.

183
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,020
Can I pay it later?

184
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,420
Can you afford to pay?

185
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,010
I afford to pay.

186
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:37,120
Go.

187
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:37,810
Okay.

188
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,120
Is this okay?

189
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,000
Okay.

190
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:47,780
She will be staying here.

191
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,060
Chu Xia.

192
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,980
From now on, this is your house.

193
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:55,580
Tell Madam Zhang and Madam Li
about your favourite food.

194
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,370
They are in charge of food.

195
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,790
Tell Da if you want to read magazines.

196
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,000
She'll order for you.

197
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:04,020
If you want to know
the ending of the novels,

198
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,130
ask Da to bring the author to you.

199
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,290
Don't be hesitate.

200
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,400
It's happier getting more people.
I hate to be alone.

201
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,920
My husband went to England
for treatment last night.

202
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,210
I always busy.

203
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,790
Tell Da if you need any books.

204
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,380
Chu Xia!

205
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:37,060
Chu Xia!

206
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,200
Come in.

207
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,110
Do you need anything?

208
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,860
I need to lock the door.

209
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,900
The children of Han's
can't lock the door.

210
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:08,820
I forgot, you are not Han's.

211
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,700
I understand your feeling
about the death of your mom.

212
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,140
Did you receive the check?

213
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:23,800
It was torn off.

214
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:26,620
Let me get straight to the point.

215
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,100
I understand you.

216
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,890
But I don't want to see you in my house.

217
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,970
I can give you another check.

218
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,710
You can put any figure on it.

219
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,870
Cut the crap and get out.

220
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:41,340
Why did you demand for
the 500,000 yuan then?

221
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:44,870
Don't mention it again!

222
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:46,640
I stay here

223
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,050
because of my mom.

224
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,690
So, you don't have to be worried.

225
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,420
I'll leave as soon as possible.

226
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:58,260
Since you have guts,

227
00:14:58,390 --> 00:14:59,760
I won't force you then.

228
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:04,360
If you need it, you may
come to me anytime.

229
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,980
I'll keep my promise.

230
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:15,710
I'm not interested
to live as a parasite!

231
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,160
Is she the exception?

232
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:37,640
Impossible.

233
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,100
It must be kidding me.

234
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:16,710
Ghost!

235
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:19,740
An Chu Xia?

236
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:23,740
What are you doing
in my room at this hour?

237
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,310
Are you...

238
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:35,540
Looks like I have to lock the door.

239
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:41,000
Now I have no allergy
to kiss with a girl.

240
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,100
A girl?

241
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:50,720
Insane!

242
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:08,170
That was how I met the demon
master, Han Qi Lu, because of money.

243
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:11,890
I was sent to Han's family by destiny.

244
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:14,800
I've never wished to be a princess.

245
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:16,340
I know,

246
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:20,500
an ugly duckling only becomes a swan due to
genetic mutation of the same species.

247
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,520
Even if I wear a nice dress,

248
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:26,570
I'm still An Chu Xia
in the Cat Ears Lane.

249
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:28,420
So,

250
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,740
I'll leave

251
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,270
after the breakfast.

252
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:35,000
Have a seat.

253
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,040
Chu Xia.

254
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,790
Did you have a nice sleep?

255
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:51,680
You are going to start your
new life after the breakfast.

256
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,940
What?

257
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:56,460
-Han.
-Yes.

258
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:57,780
Have you contacted the school?

259
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:00,340
I've contacted the school.

260
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:04,000
Miss Chu Xia can go to the school today.

261
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:04,460
Good.

262
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,580
School? What do you mean?

263
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,680
I've promised Chu Xia's mom

264
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:13,030
to let her go back to the school.

265
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:18,060
You could simply get
a private school for her.

266
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:21,600
Moreover, not everyone
can get in Stiland College.

267
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:25,170
Exactly, the identity is very important.

268
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:30,040
I'll let Chu Xia enter the
school as our family member.

269
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,090
How do I explain to my classmates

270
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,570
that I have an elder sister in a night?

271
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,500
Moreover, it will spoil the
reputation of you and father.

272
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,890
So,

273
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:51,250
I'll make Chu Xia your fiancee...

274
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:04,340
No way.

275
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,250
I'm not asking for your opinion.

276
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,950
I'll make the call when
your dad is taking his rest.

277
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:11,060
If you have any objection,...

278
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:11,820
What?

279
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:17,460
I heard you ordered a new astronomical
magnifying lens from abroad.

280
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,420
It's a telescope.

281
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,390
It's a magnifying lens.

282
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:24,060
Han, cancel the order for him.

283
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:26,060
Okay.

284
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,640
Chu Xia.

285
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,240
From today on,

286
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,770
you'll go to school in a car with Qi Lu.

287
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:38,370
If he's rude to you,

288
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,380
-I'll get Han...
-Okay!

289
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,840
Alright, I'm off.

290
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:46,590
Don't be afraid.

291
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,000
As long as I'm here,

292
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:49,610
no body will bully you.

293
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,030
Thank you, auntie.

294
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,260
Call me Sis Yuan Yuan.

295
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:56,070
Don't call me auntie, it sounds old.

296
00:19:57,690 --> 00:19:58,780
Sis Yuan Yuan.

297
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:00,610
Go ahead.

298
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:13,870
Destiny is always full
of twists and turns.

299
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:18,130
My mom and I owed a big debt
because of Stiland College.

300
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,520
Then I lost my beloved mom
because of making money.

301
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:27,140
Eventually, I enter
Stiland College easily.

302
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,600
Life still goes on.

303
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:34,000
I have to face countless challenges.

304
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,700
What am I going to face
after going out of the door?

305
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,800
Everything is still going on.
