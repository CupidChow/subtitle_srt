1
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:27,980
My grandfather has agreed

2
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:29,650
and he wanted to see Chu Xia.

3
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,450
I'll take Chu Xia away

4
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:32,910
when your dad is back.

5
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,940
You can't take her away as you want.

6
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:50,430
Han Qi Lu! What are you doing?

7
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:54,890
An Chu Xia!

8
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,820
Why are you acting like a ghost?

9
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,600
You're so rude.

10
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,860
How can you bully me when I'm sick?

11
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:09,920
Why are you acting like a ghost
in the middle of the night?

12
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:13,640
I'd like to take a glass of water.

13
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,130
And then my foot slipped and fell.

14
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,690
Quickly get up.

15
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:21,440
Don't act like a ghost.

16
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:25,140
I twisted my foot, I can't get up.

17
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,980
Are you sick?

18
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:37,960
Beg me.

19
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:39,300
What?

20
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,530
Beg me.

21
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:44,540
Close the door when you go out.

22
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,970
I'm sure you'll beg me.

23
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,630
It hurts.

24
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:21,230
My foot's going to break.

25
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:23,420
Ouch!

26
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,050
It hurts.

27
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,760
It hurts! Ouch!

28
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:33,920
It hurts! Ouch!

29
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,320
An Chu Xia.

30
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:45,720
You are a girl.
Can't you play the coquette?

31
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:48,940
Why must a girl play the coquette?

32
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:52,600
I can make it even in
another way, stupid.

33
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:57,100
Rascal.

34
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,630
Don't just stand there,
give me a hand.

35
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,810
No way.

36
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:04,950
Now you are here,

37
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:07,770
don't think you can escape.

38
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,970
It's too late. Don't move.

39
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:17,740
What are you doing?

40
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,170
Don't pull my pants!

41
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:21,900
What are you doing?

42
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,670
What are you doing?

43
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:28,050
Don't pull my pants!

44
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,040
What are you doing?

45
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:33,620
What are you doing?

46
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:37,320
Don't pull my pants!

47
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,740
What are you doing?

48
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,910
Take it easy.

49
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:52,700
Don't be afraid, play safe.

50
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:57,370
Qi Lu, you have to be gentle. I'm off.

51
00:04:58,370 --> 00:04:59,520
-No!
-No!

52
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,370
That's not what you think!

[Master Devil Do Not Kiss Me S1]

[Episode 15]

55
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:19,710
Ms. Chu Xia.

56
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,460
Why are you so quiet today?

57
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,430
My feet hurt.

58
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:37,760
Young Master Ling.

59
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:14,030
Han Qi Lu! Bastard! Go to hell!

60
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:20,150
The final exam of the
semester is coming soon.

61
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:25,040
I hope you pay attention to the exam.
The exam will be divided into

62
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:33,490
economic, business, trading
and 7 other subjects.

63
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:36,670
What makes you sigh at such a young age?

64
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:40,330
Ms. Ma, you are young too.
What makes you sad?

65
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:42,840
Maria is my English name.

66
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,800
Don't call me Ms. Ma.

67
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,900
It sounds like Ma Jian Guo.

68
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,310
What's your Chinese name?

69
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:51,360
Liu...It's a secret.

70
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,660
Tell me. What's eating you?

71
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:57,200
Han Qi Lu is crazy.

72
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,420
Yesterday, he suddenly
asked me to be with him.

73
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:03,800
What's so annoying about it?

74
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,660
Accept him if you like him.

75
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:07,730
Say no if you hate him.

76
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,220
But I always thought we were enemies.

77
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,910
I was so embarrassed
when he suddenly told me that.

78
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:15,600
There's no forever enemy in this world.

79
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,000
It's annoying.

80
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,520
What does he like about me?
I will change it then.

81
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:21,230
How do you want to change it?

82
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:26,900
You can't beat Mo Xin Wei's family
background. In terms of beauty...

83
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:34,270
In terms of scheming,
you're far behind her.

84
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:36,320
But he likes you.

85
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:40,860
I guess he's trying
to play a prank on me.

86
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,520
That's right, he wanted to revenge.

87
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,860
When I say yes,

88
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:48,850
he'll tease me that I aim the moon

89
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:50,810
and keep insulting me. That's right.

90
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,080
So that's what you guys think.
Now I get it.

91
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:56,860
You guys?

92
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,890
You like Mr. You Tian.

93
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:04,390
What's wrong? He's good, isn't he?

94
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,990
No, I just think he does not match you.

95
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:14,730
Matching doesn't
count in a relationship.

96
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,010
You are still young,
you don't understand.

97
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:23,990
There's a storm tonight. Let's go home.

98
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:26,580
Okay.

99
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,780
Courier service.
Is Liu Gui Fen here?

100
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,480
Liu Gui Fen, is this your parcel?

101
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,010
No...

102
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:39,990
No such person.

103
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:42,890
It is stated as an infirmary.

104
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,580
No such person.

105
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,360
Aren't you Liu Gui Fen?

106
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,160
Chu Xia, quickly go home.

107
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,380
See you.

108
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,240
Chu Xia.

109
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:00,750
Where should I put this?

110
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:05,370
On the table.

111
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:07,130
Are you Liu Gui Fen?

112
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:09,370
I told you I'm not!

113
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:11,460
Put it on the table.
I'll sign it for her.

114
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,270
I put it here.

115
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,670
Liu Gui Fen.

116
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:23,170
Any important thing
that you want to tell me now?

117
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:24,730
It's very important.

118
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:26,380
Just wait.

119
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:31,400
Why does she come here?

120
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:33,640
I asked her to come.

121
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:36,580
Are you going to forget
the incident in the field?

122
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:41,470
Qi Lu, are you looking for me?

123
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:49,820
Did you forget the incident
in the field that day?

124
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:53,160
You still owe us an explanation.

125
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:57,420
I told you, An Chu Xia is my maid.

126
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:01,870
People who dares to hurt her
is trying to go against me.

127
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:05,380
But she was still being bullied.

128
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,390
Do you have anything to say? Mo Xin Wei.

129
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:13,440
It had nothing to do with me.

130
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,050
It was Ma Jian Guo who asked her
to run. I just supervised her.

131
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,540
I even asked Wan Zi

132
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:23,620
-to count 2 more laps for her.
-Is it?

133
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,780
It's true, I even pleaded for her.

134
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:32,220
But you should know Chu Xia's character.

135
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:36,450
She's so stubborn and
I couldn't stop her running.

136
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,230
Young Master Ling.

137
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:42,280
Do you think Ms. Mo is reliable.

138
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,050
Of course...

139
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:48,010
She is reliable.

140
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,490
Even there was a conflict,

141
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,930
I believe both of them
have turned into friends now.

142
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:01,560
Xin Wei will certainly help
Chu Xia in the school later.

143
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,920
Otherwise, you won't let her go.

144
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:09,860
Mo Xin Wei, listen.

145
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:13,560
If goes wrong with An Chu Xia
in the school after this,

146
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:19,140
whether you do it or not,
I'll still blame you.

147
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:24,180
Qi Lu, what's so good about her?
Why do you stand up for her?

148
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:28,140
Let's go.

149
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:32,080
Sis Yuan Yuan said the cake here
was delicious. Let's take a look.

150
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,520
Qi Lu, I'll go with you.
I know which one is delicious.

151
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:46,000
What's good about An Chu Xia?

152
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:49,640
Why does everybody stand up for her?

153
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,970
"Sis Yuan Yuan - Ugly Mommy"

154
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:34,150
Why didn't he answer the phone?
I don't know where he went.

155
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,160
Little Chu Xia, where are you?

156
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,970
It's going to rain.
I'll send a car to fetch you.

157
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:53,700
Wait for me.

158
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:00,130
It's troublesome when Han is not around.

159
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,560
Qi Lu, Uncle Han can't
come back from his business trip.

160
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:08,840
It's raining now, quickly
fetch Chu Xia at the school.

161
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,960
I'll block your credit card
if she gets wet in the rain.

162
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,490
What?

163
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,600
The flight was delayed
because of the weather?

164
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:44,670
Han, why didn't you fly with our plane?

165
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,900
You make us trouble.

166
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:52,120
Alright, come back quickly.

167
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,620
There are many things
we can't do without you.

168
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,560
Alright, come back quickly.

169
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:00,140
I am back.

170
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:14,480
Where is Little Chu Xia?

171
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:19,830
I bought a lot of
new clothes for her to try.

172
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:22,190
Don't tell me you
didn't come back with her.

173
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:25,460
It's 5 something now.

174
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,050
It's raining today.

175
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:28,940
The school was over at 4:30pm.

176
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,420
By the way, why must I pick her up?

177
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,660
You should have sent someone
to pick her up long ago.

178
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:39,330
What if something
happens to Little Chu Xia?

179
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:42,780
What's going on?

180
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:45,190
Quickly look for her!

181
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:09,970
Mo Xin Wei, why are you here?

182
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,610
I'm here to pick you up from school.

183
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,470
You pick me up from school.

184
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:20,860
Qi Lu asked me to take care of his maid.

185
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,877
And he said, whether I hurt you or not,

186
00:16:23,902 --> 00:16:26,144
he will still blame me if anything
goes wrong with you after this.

187
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,560
Is he crazy? I'm just fine.

188
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:32,270
And why do you hold his car?

189
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:33,600
This is their car.

190
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,560
I can afford to buy a car.

191
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,390
Open your eyes and
take a look at it. Is this his car?

192
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:45,060
Everything is the same
except for you and the driver.

193
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,400
Both of you are really a good match.

194
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,400
I'll take it seriously.

195
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:00,210
-I don't know what he thinks.
-Of course you don't know.

196
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,960
No one in the world
knows him better than I do.

197
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,410
I secretly bought the same car.

198
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:10,540
I have the exact same
in everything he does.

199
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,170
An Chu Xia, listen carefully.

200
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:22,010
Qi Lu and I are a perfect match.

201
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:25,130
Be it family background or interest,

202
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:27,490
we're a perfect match.

203
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:31,480
I'll change even if there's
something does not match.

204
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,300
I focus on him for everything.

205
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:37,670
I'll do whatever he likes.

206
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,680
I'll tell you what.

207
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,390
All the men will only like a woman

208
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:47,600
who is qualified to stand next to him.

209
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,680
I'm qualified. What about you?

210
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,920
Ms. Mo, I have nothing.

211
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:01,080
Don't you just want to marry a rich guy?

212
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,260
I'm warning you.

213
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:07,440
Don't act as Cinderella in front of me.

214
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:11,660
The prince will only end up
with the princess. And you're

215
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:13,740
just a joke.

216
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,270
Mo Xin Wei.

217
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:21,470
I don't know what you think.
But I want to tell you,

218
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:24,100
That's not a true love.

219
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:30,120
Tell me about the love of a maid then.

220
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,730
How does the love
of lower class look like?

221
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:39,270
I must be with a man like Han Qi Lu.
I'm the only one

222
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,220
who deserves to stand by him. You know?

223
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:47,340
But why?

224
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:53,340
I just don't understand
why Qi Lu likes you.

225
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,390
Men

226
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:00,720
always make mistakes when they're young.

227
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,280
It's all Xiang Man Kui's fault.

228
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:07,720
Because you are so much like her.

229
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,690
The more you look like her,
the more Qi Lu can't forget her.

230
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:19,120
Ms. Mo, you really see through
the world of mortals.

231
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:35,130
"Qi Lu, The devil"

232
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:53,910
Hey!

233
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,530
Young Master Han, why do you
come at this hour?

234
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,260
I'm looking for someone.
Open the school gate.

235
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:04,140
We just checked it out at school.
The students are gone.

236
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:07,110
Did you see a girl?

237
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,040
She's not pretty.

238
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:11,020
Basically, she's ugly.

239
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,980
Did you see her
walking out of the college?

240
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,700
That's too many.

241
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:19,380
Do you have any specific clues?
Like a picture.

242
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:21,710
Picture?

243
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,090
This girl.

244
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:27,910
It's her.

245
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:31,820
I saw her getting in a Bentley which
was exactly like yours not long ago.

246
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,030
They just went there.

247
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:34,880
Bentley?

248
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:37,800
Exactly like mine?

249
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:40,910
Mo Xin Wei.

250
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:49,910
That's why I said you don't know love
and don't even understand Qi Lu.

251
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:54,760
If Qi Lu stays with you,
he'll finally understand this is wrong.

252
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:59,710
It's a pity you're not a nun.
You see through the world.

253
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:03,340
People like you will never understand.

254
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:09,320
You should spend your whole life
in that dark alley and never come out.

255
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:12,040
Mo Xin Wei, are you sick?

256
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:13,830
I want to get out.

257
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,520
Even Ling Han Yu helps you too.

258
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,250
How much did he give you?

259
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:22,850
He even found a house for you.

260
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,830
How do you repay him?

261
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:28,040
By your body?

262
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:29,750
Not your concern!

263
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:31,800
Let me get out of the car.

264
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,750
You're a pet.

265
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,790
There's somewhere you should go.

266
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,460
Let me get out of the car.
I want to get out.
