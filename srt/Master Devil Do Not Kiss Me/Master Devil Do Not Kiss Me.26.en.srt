1
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:17,920
I wanted to catch the people
who makes my grandson hurt

2
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,610
and give him a lesson.

3
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,400
Unexpectedly,

4
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:24,050
you are really something.

5
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,140
You are beautiful

6
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,550
and able to stay calm in danger.
You can even figure it out to resist.

7
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,040
I admire you.

8
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,510
Well...

9
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,050
After your graduation,

10
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,680
you can marry Han Yu to be
my granddaughter-in-law.

11
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,580
-What?
-What?

12
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:48,400
Sit down.

13
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,440
No manners! You'd better behave!

14
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,930
Grandpa Ling.

15
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,050
I think you've got it wrong.

16
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:02,200
Ling Han Yu and I are just school mates.

17
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,020
We are just friends.

18
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,120
What do you think

19
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,790
about Han Yu?

20
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:09,750
He's quite handsome.

21
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,330
That's great!

22
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,130
Tony.

23
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,280
Get a master

24
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:17,850
to find a lucky date

25
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:19,660
and arrange the wedding

26
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:21,600
for both of them.

27
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,140
Grandpa, what are you doing?

28
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:25,830
Contact the wedding hotel.

29
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:26,530
Remember.

30
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,950
Only 6 stars and above.

31
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:30,040
-Yes, sir.
-And you...

32
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:32,390
Contact the airline and

33
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,850
charter a flight abroad.

34
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:35,000
-No!
-Yes, sir.

35
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:36,910
Grandpa, what are you doing?

36
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:37,950
Just a moment.

37
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,760
Grandpa Ling.

38
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,190
I have had a better half.

39
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,780
Has Chu Xia gone back?

40
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,850
Didn't she stay with you?

41
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:09,840
No.

42
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:11,700
She didn't answer her phone.

43
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,410
Would she be staying with Jiang Chen Chuan?

44
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:15,560
Don't be afraid.

45
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,900
Jiang Chen Chuan.

46
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,090
What do you want to do?

47
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:19,700
Ah!

48
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,040
No!

49
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:25,950
Not bad.

50
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,420
Qi Lu, where are you going?

51
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,570
-Why are you here?
-You are as tall as the door.

52
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,680
Got yourself Yun Fat Chow's hairstyle.
Trying to be a killer?

53
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,850
Anything happened to Chu Xia?
She didn't answer her phone.

54
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,160
What's going on?

55
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,830
Not your concern!

56
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:45,440
Hey!

57
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,940
That's...

58
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,120
Chu Xia

59
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,070
Master Ling.

60
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:05,030
Master Ling, what brings you here?

61
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:08,100
Mrs. Han, we haven't met up
for a long time.

62
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:10,800
It's good to see you, please come in.

63
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,760
Okay.

64
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,560
-Get out of the way.
-Han Yu.

[Master Devil Do Not Kiss Me S2]

[Episode 3]

67
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:00,110
-This way please.
-Okay.

68
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:04,730
Have a seat.

69
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,060
Mrs. Han.

70
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:16,420
I'm here

71
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:18,960
to discuss something with you.

72
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:20,620
Please say it.

73
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:24,920
I wanted to let Han Yu

74
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,240
get married with Chu Xia
after graduation.

75
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:30,290
-No way!
-No way!

76
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,010
Who are you?

77
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,280
Huh?

78
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:37,190
Don't bother.

79
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,760
I disagree with it.

80
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,090
So do I.

81
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,700
I heard

82
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,340
Chu Xia's mother
entrusted her to Han's family

83
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:47,290
before she passed away.

84
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,210
Now,

85
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,810
I want to bring Chu Xia to my house.

86
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:57,140
Give me a condition.

87
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,350
What are you talking about, geezer?

88
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,040
Mind your word.

89
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,340
Don't be so rude.

90
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,480
Master Ling.

91
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,750
It's off the table.

92
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,170
Chu Xia

93
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,630
must be Qi Lu's future wife.

94
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,820
No matter how, Chu Xia...

95
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:15,850
I'm sorry

96
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:17,440
to have troubled you.

97
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,820
Don't bother with my grandpa.

98
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,210
He is always stubborn.

99
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:24,400
He used to be a leader in his life.
So he does everything by his own will.

100
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,510
It's alright.

101
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:27,770
By the way,

102
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,300
I haven't thanked you
for your help that day.

103
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:32,040
I didn't help much.

104
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,660
Don't say that.

105
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,140
If you hadn't informed them,

106
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:38,450
I would have been
beaten up badly by Gao Gan.

107
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:41,980
But,

108
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:44,150
your hand...

109
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:45,940
Don't worry, no problem.

110
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,310
But,

111
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:49,070
I have to rest at home for a while.

112
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,050
So I can accompany my grandpa

113
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,760
to avoid him from messing up again.

114
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:55,620
But,

115
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,890
I can't meet you at the school.

116
00:06:58,170 --> 00:06:59,890
I'll go visit you.

117
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:00,760
Alright.

118
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:05,390
But make sure your grandpa is not there.

119
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:07,350
Okay!

120
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:09,280
I say she's my wife now.

121
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,800
-Anything's wrong?
-Says who?

122
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,800
I'll tell you what.

123
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,880
I'll never take back my word.

124
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,220
Master Ling.

125
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,720
First come, first serve.

126
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,190
Chu Xia has lived in
our home for so long.

127
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,910
You know that two of them...

128
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:23,920
It's late now.

129
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,830
I guess they would not
end the discussion so soon.

130
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,150
You go back first.

131
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:28,800
Hmm.

132
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:29,650
I'm off.

133
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:30,440
Okay.

134
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:33,590
Chu Xia.

135
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,870
Take care of yourself

136
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:38,170
-when I'm not around.
-Don't worry.

137
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,200
I will.

138
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,270
Hey!

139
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,790
-You creep me out!
-Is that fun to make people worried?

140
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:57,240
-What?
-Why didn't you answer the phone?

141
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,100
It's mute and I didn't hear it.

142
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:09,710
Are you worried about me?

143
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,470
Me?

144
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:14,480
Look at you.

145
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,770
No outstanding body shape

146
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:16,770
and face.

147
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:18,210
And even no temperament.

148
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,520
You are not likeable.

149
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,750
Do you think I like you?

150
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,660
What do you mean?

151
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:27,690
I wonder what happens
to Master Ling's eyes lately.

152
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:29,870
How did he go blind?
Why is he fond of you?

153
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:30,860
Han Qi Lu.

154
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,730
What happened to you?

155
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:35,170
To be honest,

156
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:36,320
I'm studying

157
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,290
the aesthetic sense of everybody.

158
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:40,090
Why did they like you?

159
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:41,670
You have gone too far.

160
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:44,070
You asked me to be
your girlfriend that day.

161
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:47,320
Did I?

162
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,370
I forgot it.

163
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,200
I got it wrong either.

164
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,440
Get lost!

165
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:57,290
Bastard!

166
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:58,620
Nasty girl!

167
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,580
Ms. Chu Xia.

168
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,840
Where are you going?

169
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,050
I don't want to stay
with the cocky man.

170
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:18,460
I'll go to school myself.

171
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,190
Young master.

172
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:22,830
Quickly persuade Ms. Chu Xia.

173
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,920
Just let her go.

174
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,530
Close the door.

175
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:31,760
Qi Lu.

176
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,200
Are you free tomorrow? My dad asked
you to go to my house for dinner

177
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,280
and talk about
the cooperation with Han Group.

178
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:42,540
My dad is resting abroad.

179
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:45,440
You may look for my mom
for the matter of business.

180
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,600
I'm not involved.

181
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:50,150
Don't you care about your family business?

182
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,530
As I said,

183
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:54,440
it has nothing to do with me.

184
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:57,140
Qi Lu.

185
00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:00,570
Why are you always so cold to me?

186
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,700
Can't you see I like you?

187
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,290
I can see it.

188
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,930
But it doesn't mean I must like you.

189
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:12,370
You...

190
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:15,200
Did you ignore me
because of Xiang Man Kui?

191
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,050
Because she came back?

192
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:19,930
You...

193
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,500
Or because of An Chu Xia?

194
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:25,440
Chu Xia.

195
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,440
Slow down your pace.

196
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,320
Wait for me.

197
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:29,690
Chu Xia.

198
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,640
Chu Xia.

199
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,710
If it is because of An Chu Xia,

200
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:41,440
you have to work harder then.

201
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:45,490
Although Jiang Chen Chuan
doesn't have a good taste,

202
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,930
but he has a strong perseverance.

203
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,650
You have to work harder.

204
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,460
You've talked too much.

205
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:12,610
What do you think? Let me see.

206
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,000
It's not so nice.

207
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:17,460
Qi Lu is back.

208
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,740
We have chicken soup, let Madam Zhang...

209
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:23,280
What's wrong with him?

210
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,820
He's always cold to me.

211
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,440
So bad.

212
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,830
Little Chu Xia's back.

213
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:28,690
Come here.

214
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:29,980
Excuse me.

215
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,120
Chu Xia.

216
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,450
How was your school today?

217
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:37,190
Not bad.

218
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:40,780
Did Han Yu's grandfather
look for you again?

219
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,080
No.

220
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,490
That's good.

221
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,350
Madam.

222
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:55,460
Ms. Xiang is here.

223
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,430
Sis Yuan Yuan.

224
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,960
Sis Yuan Yuan.

225
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,250
Call me aunty.

226
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:09,920
Okay.

227
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,380
Aunty.

228
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,280
I'm sorry that

229
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,280
I should have come earlier

230
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,070
as I've been back for so long.

231
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:21,120
Ms. Xiang, you are now a new designer.

232
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,660
I am really happy to know that you
still remember me and

233
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,920
even come to visit me
when you're so busy.

234
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:31,200
Well...

235
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,350
I brought some gifts for everyone.

236
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:35,280
I came back too hasty and

237
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,420
didn't have time to prepare
any good thing for you.

238
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,390
Aunty, this is yours.

239
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:48,400
Chu Xia.

240
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:50,930
Thank you.

241
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,040
Thanks.

242
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,260
-Uncle Han.
-Thank you.

243
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:03,890
Here you are.

244
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,080
Thank you.

245
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,870
Thanks for your gift.

246
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,900
It's still the same as before.

247
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,840
Nothing has changed much.

248
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:15,450
Of course it's different.

249
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,400
Well...

250
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,370
The sofa is new.

251
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,180
The decoration
at the door is newly bought.

252
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:27,530
The most important thing is,
Chu Xia came here.

253
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,920
It's late now.

254
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,660
You worked so hard

255
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,210
and quite busy recently.

256
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:40,080
Han, send Ms. Xiang back.

257
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:43,700
See you, aunty.

258
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:47,770
Let's talk.

259
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,920
Eventually, I found
the air here is good.

260
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:15,470
Are you watching
the stars again tonight?

261
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:24,220
Remember what you taught me?

262
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:28,100
The brightest star which humans
could see with their eyes

263
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,470
called Sirius

264
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:32,210
Probably in that position.

265
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:36,330
Alpha Centauri A and Alpha Centauri B.

266
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:38,330
Sis Yuan Yuan, this is not appropriate.

267
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:40,536
But it's Summer and we can't see it.

268
00:14:40,561 --> 00:14:42,410
Quiet, listen to what they are saying.

269
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:43,440
By the way,

270
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:47,440
what's the name
of the star closest to earth?

271
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,730
Qi Lu.

272
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:57,440
I can't remember it.

273
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,920
Aren't you tired?

274
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:07,290
Don't you understand yet?

275
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,710
It's all over.

276
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,910
Qi Lu.

277
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,000
You taught me to play
the Little Star with piano.

278
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,920
You skipped the class every night

279
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,610
and took me to the top of
the mountain to see the stars.

280
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:29,630
Relax.

281
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:30,820
You said,

282
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:33,230
one day when you hold
an astronomical exhibition

283
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,410
I will be the first person you invite.

284
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:39,080
We have even promised

285
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,000
to see the star orbit at the South Pole.

286
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,200
Have you forgotten?

287
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:58,930
Qi Lu.

288
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,610
Sorry.

289
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:05,150
-I really didn't know...
-If you're here to apologize,

290
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,630
well...

291
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,610
I forgive you.

292
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,530
But,

293
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,930
you are nothing to me now.

294
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,850
If

295
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,670
you have anything else to say

296
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,950
besides apologizing...

297
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:24,790
Sorry.

298
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:26,330
I can't help you.

299
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:37,190
Stop hiding.

300
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:46,600
What a coincidence!

301
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,050
Aunty.

302
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:52,440
Ah.

303
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,420
My wound seems to be cracked again.

304
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,780
Help me.

305
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:04,100
Well...

306
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,020
Ms. Xiang

307
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,190
I'm sorry.

308
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:07,500
We're busy.

309
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,140
Let me ask Mr. Han to send you back.

310
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:11,510
Hmm.

311
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:21,490
In order to improve
everyone's artistic cultivation,

312
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,930
we have specially held

313
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:25,300
a drama class in this semester.

314
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,970
The 8 students here

315
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:30,140
will be in a small group later.

316
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:32,750
Make sure you interact and
communicate with each other.

317
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:36,920
Learn and help each other.

318
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:43,500
What a combination! Just like
the lucky draw of the lottery!

319
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,390
What did you say?

320
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,080
Oh!

321
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:48,370
I mean you're so wise.

322
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:50,450
I like drama the most.

323
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,000
That's great!

324
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:54,090
Good!

325
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,730
As Feng Shao said,
the 8th strategy of the tips,

326
00:17:57,730 --> 00:17:59,400
"A Cool CEO".

327
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,780
Do not give her a smile.

328
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,440
Must let her understand that

329
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,800
you don't care about her.

330
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:07,790
And you hate her very much.

331
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,350
Chill her and provoke her...

332
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:10,190
Today,

333
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:12,980
we'll rehearse a sequence from Pride and Prejudice

334
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:16,010
and learn the lesson through the play.

335
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:17,670
Let's decide today's role

336
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:19,350
by drawing lots.

337
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:36,280
Sir!

338
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:38,340
-What's wrong?
-I'd like to redraw.

339
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:39,850
Why?

340
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:41,650
I'd like to leave the important role

341
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:43,540
to other students.

342
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:44,550
Okay.

343
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:45,870
Very good.

344
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,480
In that case,

345
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:50,100
I'll let you play
the fireplace behind there.

346
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:51,960
Fireplace?

347
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,810
It suits you.

348
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,830
Sir,

349
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:02,700
I'd like to...

350
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,420
The act of the "Fireplace Man"

351
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,000
is selfless,

352
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,840
but,

353
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:12,270
it's a desecration of drama.

354
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:14,550
If anyone asks
for a change of role again,

355
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:16,800
I'll give you a zero

356
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,270
and retake in this semester.

357
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:19,930
Sir.

358
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:21,020
I have a question.

359
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:21,840
Yes.

360
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:25,830
Why am I playing an umbrella?

361
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:27,080
Don't laugh!

362
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:32,520
We have too many students
and the roles are not enough.

363
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,110
You act the umbrella first.

364
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,630
Where should I stand?

365
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:39,290
Just stand next to the fireplace.

366
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,560
Xin Wei.

367
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:54,340
Why don't I exchange my role with you?

368
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:57,240
Although I don't have many dialogues.

369
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,790
Go and get ready.

370
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:03,080
Especially Han Qi Lu and Xiang Man Kui

371
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,810
who play the hero and heroine.

372
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:09,140
Practise more.
We'll start the rehearsal in a minute.

373
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:11,030
Alright, dismiss!

374
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,720
Hey! Stop!
