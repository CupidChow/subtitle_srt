1
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:25,600
Hello.

2
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,060
Hello, Qi Lu.

3
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:29,330
Have you arrived?

4
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,710
Sorry.

5
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:31,970
I can't make it.

6
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,800
No matter how late, I'll wait for you.

7
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:36,270
Sorry.

8
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:37,340
Just go back.

9
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:57,520
Miss.

10
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,620
Are you all right?

11
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:05,760
We were so rushing
and you didn't eat anything.

12
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:07,480
Why don't we eat something first?

13
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:14,650
Qi Lu, I don't want to look for him anymore.

14
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:17,400
What did you say?

15
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:19,670
Forget it.

16
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:20,870
Let's go home.

17
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:22,490
Please stop the car.

18
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,380
Chu Xia.

19
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:34,620
Are you afraid?

20
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:38,070
No, what am I afraid of?

21
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:42,244
I just don't feel like meeting someone
who's been missing for over a decade.

22
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:47,900
You don't know your father.

23
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:51,770
You're afraid that he doesn't remember you

24
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:54,350
and he is different from what you think.

25
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:57,140
And you're more afraid that you
can't find him, right?

26
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,220
No, I'm not.

27
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:05,420
Chu Xia.

28
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:07,250
Don't be afraid.

29
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,620
There's something you have to face.

30
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,280
Moreover, I'll be with you.

31
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:25,660
Hello.

32
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:29,050
I'm calling from Ren Ai Hospital.

33
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,800
Is it Xiang Man Kui's mobile phone?

34
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,630
She had an acute gastritis attack
and fainted in the street.

35
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:37,150
And a passer-by sent her here.

36
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,800
We found that you were
the last person she contacted.

37
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,220
Could you help us contact her family?

38
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,800
Okay.

39
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,160
What's wrong?

40
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,290
Xiang Man Kui fainted on the road
because of acute gastritis.

41
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,660
It was called from the hospital.

42
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,760
How could it be?

43
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,070
Is she all right?

44
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,220
No idea.

45
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,200
I'll call Han and let him
send people to see her.

46
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:08,510
Sir, please go on.

47
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:11,100
Where are we going?

48
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,320
Huiyang.

49
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:15,570
Qi Lu.

50
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,100
Let's go to the hospital.

51
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:19,860
Why?

52
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:24,900
You should know who
she wants to see the most now.

53
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,660
Don't worry about me.

54
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,050
It's been so many years.

55
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:34,410
No rushing.

56
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:38,910
Qi Lu.

57
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:41,290
There's something you have to face.

58
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,420
Don't worry.

59
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,490
I'll be with you.

60
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,790
I'll definitely help you
fulfill your dream.

61
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:54,760
Driver, please go to Ren Ai Hospital.

[Episode 10]

64
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,960
She had just woken up, but still weak.

65
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,740
-Please don't disturb her for too long.
-Okay, I got it.

66
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,690
Chu Xia, Qi Lu.

67
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:03,020
Lie down.

68
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,490
I'm sorry

69
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:05,600
to wake you up.

70
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,730
No.

71
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,560
I feel sorry

72
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,350
to disturb you two at this hour.

73
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,870
Don't say that.

74
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:16,780
Didn't you listen to Ms. Maria that day?

75
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,810
Why didn't you go to the hospital?

76
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:22,340
I forgot it.

77
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:25,690
Hey.

78
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,880
Where are your parents?

79
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,870
They...

80
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,730
They're gone.

81
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,820
Gone? Did they go out to
buy something for you?

82
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:37,640
But,...

83
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,280
I'm sorry.

84
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,520
I didn't know

85
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,900
It's okay.

86
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,610
It's been a long time.

87
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:51,350
After they had a car accident,

88
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:55,120
Qi Lu's parents sent me
to Stilland College.

89
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,820
In fact, I'm very lucky.

90
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:09,330
I just called Han to get
a professional nurse for you.

91
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,860
It's quite late now.

92
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,180
We'll go back.

93
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,280
Take a rest.

94
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,940
Can't you stay for a while?

95
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,560
No.

96
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,010
Let's go.

97
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,040
The doctor said you just woke up
and need more rest.

98
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,720
I'll come again tomorrow, okay?

99
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:26,960
Thank you.

100
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:30,540
See you tomorrow.

101
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,340
Did your mom know
that Man Kui's hospitalized?

102
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:44,530
I didn't want her to be worried.
So I reminded Han not to tell her.

103
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:48,850
I was in a hurry when I came out and
didn't inform Sis Yuan Yuan.

104
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,260
She must be worried about me.
Let me call her.

105
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,440
What's wrong?

106
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,910
I left my phone in the ward.

107
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,010
Where?

108
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:00,200
In the ward.

109
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:04,490
Such a careless girl!

110
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,480
I'm sorry, my mobile phone...

111
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:12,280
What are you doing?

112
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:13,840
Give it back to me.

113
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:17,320
Cut it out!

114
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,440
Stop eating it!

115
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,410
You want to kill yourself?

116
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,410
That's just common Vitamin C.

117
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:25,850
Give it back to me!

118
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:28,750
Xiang Man Kui, you're crazy!

119
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,290
Are you crazy?

120
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:38,410
I really don't want
to live in pain anymore.

121
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:43,360
Can you two go out?

Feng Shao.

Feng Shao.

125

What's up? I'm playing!

126
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:08,120
Do you think Chu Xia keeps rejecting me

127
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,760
-because...
-Your uncle (Damn it)!

128
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,760
Hey!

129
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,040
I'm talking about Han Qi Lu,

130
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,130
not my uncle.

131
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:15,280
Han Qi Lu?

132
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:15,980
Yes.

133
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,760
I think Chu Xia

134
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,400
really likes Han Qi Lu.

135
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:24,600
I've thought about it seriously.

136
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:29,080
Bro, don't be sad.

137
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,570
I feel bad to see you down.

138
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,010
It's okay.

139
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,720
I understand how you feel now.

140
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:41,820
What you are experiencing
is my previous pain day and night.

141
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:46,320
Well...There are girls
at the Chicken Wings stall.

142
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,830
They are pretty.
Let me introduce them to you.

143
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:51,620
I'm serious. I don't need it.

144
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,090
I'm not kidding.

145
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:53,920
I'm serious.

146
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,560
Me too.

147
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,690
I really like Chu Xia.

148
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:58,970
I'm serious.

149
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:07,760
You deserve it.

150
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,310
Carry on your game.

151
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:13,230
What should I do?

152
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:17,710
I'm sorry

153
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,730
to have scared you.

154
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:23,620
When did you start it?

155
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,790
Since the first year I arrived France.

156
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:28,830
Why did you do that?

157
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,690
It was in a foreign country
where I don't know anyone.

158
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,670
I couldn't sleep.

159
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:41,360
Then I asked the doctor to prescribe
some sleeping pills for me.

160
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,890
For the first time I took it,
I quickly fell asleep.

161
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:49,290
Then I slowly feel it's a good thing.

162
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:53,770
How did it develop to this?

163
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,980
Later on, the doctor
refused to give me the pills.

164
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,960
I bought all kinds of health care
products from the supermarket.

165
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,800
Once I took a whole bottle of pills,

166
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:07,170
I got gastrospasm

167
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,570
and was sent to the hospital.

168
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,860
Then my friend found
that I had a drug addiction.

169
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:15,860
I slowly quit the habit.

170
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,580
That's what caused the acute gastritis?

171
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,510
Are you trying

172
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,590
to act in front of me?

173
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:25,690
Han Qi Lu.

174
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:27,570
Answer me.

175
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:32,340
No, I'm just not used to it
after returning from abroad.

176
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:52,420
Here you are.
I didn't have time to return it to you.

177
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,410
What do you mean?

178
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,320
That's what Sis Yuan Yuan gave me

179
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:02,870
for my tuition and living expenses
when I was abroad.

180
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:05,500
I told you I'd live on my own.

181
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,230
So, I didn't spend the money.

182
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:14,940
How did you survive

183
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:17,450
without the money?

184
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,900
I had a scholarship.

185
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:24,130
I could work, I worked as a dishwasher

186
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:26,970
a food deliverer and a car wash attendant.

187
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,710
All kinds of jobs.

188
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,250
You are really...

189
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,510
You are really stubborn!

190
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:38,960
Did you really want to
run away from Han's family?

191
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:42,880
Yes.

192
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:45,910
I'm stubborn.

193
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:49,140
I just want to prove

194
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:52,590
that I can live well

195
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:55,740
even without you and Han's family.

196
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:00,600
I just don't want people
to insult you at your back

197
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,940
and say I'm a useless girl

198
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,910
who's living on you.

199
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:10,570
You don't have to
care about anyone's view.

200
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,220
I have to convince myself anyway.

201
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:16,090
What about now?

202
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,580
Why did you come back?

203
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:23,850
Because...

204
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:27,960
Because I found

205
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,160
in every minute and every second
that I was no longer me

206
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:36,000
after leaving you.

207
00:13:58,730 --> 00:13:59,620
Qi Lu.

208
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:02,210
I'm sorry, it's my fault.

209
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:04,980
I was wrong.

210
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:05,820
It's okay.

211
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,590
Please forgive me.

212
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:14,040
It's okay.

213
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,060
I actually stopped blaming you

214
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,320
long time ago.

215
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:37,870
Because I found

216
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:42,010
in every minute and every second
that I was no longer me

217
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,950
after leaving you.

218
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:06,070
Where is Chu Xia?

219
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,870
Sis Yuan Yuan sent her a text

220
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,880
and asked her go back.

221
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:24,340
It's okay.

222
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,410
Take a good rest.

223
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:28,670
I'm off.

224
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:32,520
Thank you.

225
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:40,190
You've never said thank you before.

226
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,180
I'm sorry.

227
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,170
Sorry, my mobile phone...

228
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,340
What are you doing?

229
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:13,730
What are you doing?

230
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:15,050
Give it back to me!

231
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,260
I'm sorry,  An Chu Xia.

232
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:23,650
I can't lose Qi Lu.
He's the only one I have.

233
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:40,630
The Youth Design Competition
is about to begin.

234
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:44,266
The winner of the competition
will be given the opportunity

235
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:47,714
to study at the Pinkston
Institute of Design in France.

236
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:49,290
Ah!

237
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:50,270
Chu Xia!

238
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:51,510
That's great!

239
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,680
Sign up for it!
It's time to show your real strength.

240
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:56,690
Aren't you talented in designing?

241
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:59,380
If you win, you can go to
Pinkston Institute of Design.

242
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:03,320
And you'll be a famous
designer in the future.

243
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,880
It's not that easy.

244
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,380
It's only unorthodox skill.

245
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,240
That's not true.

246
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,080
That's...

247
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,290
It's good that you know it.

248
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:15,530
The competition is meant
for the design genius.

249
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:18,350
Not everyone can participate.

250
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,750
I know you won't
take part in it. So what?

251
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:21,650
You...

252
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,030
It's not for you to decide
the grade of the artworks.

253
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:27,050
Xin Wei.

254
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:29,730
I think they didn't
read the poster carefully.

255
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:31,580
That's right.

256
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:34,190
I guess you are not clear with it.

257
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,370
Open your eyes and see

258
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,670
who the organizer is.

259
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:40,320
Let's go.

260
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:51,800
Jiang's Group.

261
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:10,710
-Aren't they Han Qi Lu and Xiang Man Kui?
-Yeah.

262
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:12,790
Are they getting back together?

263
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:13,570
It's possible.

264
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:14,940
Gosh!

265
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:20,150
Thank you for picking me up
so early from the hospital.

266
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,650
Otherwise,

267
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:26,050
you'll have to do the discharge
procedure by your own.

268
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:29,260
Where is Chu Xia?

269
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,240
I didn't call her.

270
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:36,580
-Are you afraid she might misunderstand?
-For what?

271
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:44,680
What do you think they will say
when they see us walking together

272
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,010
like we did in the past?

273
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:50,770
I never care what people say.

274
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,190
We were excited for nothing.

275
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:58,730
It turns out
the organizer is Jiang's Group.

276
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:01,390
Chu Xia, you have to be careful.

277
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:06,720
Since they are so rich, why didn't
they directly send her abroad?

278
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,280
Why did they do such things?

279
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:11,050
Pinkston Institute has
always been disciplined.

280
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:15,930
They've never accepted students who
pull the strings, but only design genius.

281
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:17,800
Money can't help.

282
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:21,500
But her dad is really something.
He could even do this for her.

283
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:24,710
In that case,
it's no use for me to take part.

284
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:26,070
Not really.

285
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:30,210
You may tempt Jiang Chen Chuan.

286
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:33,280
Who's going to tempt me?

287
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:35,990
An Chu Xia.

288
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:36,580
Really?

289
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:38,590
Of course not.

290
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:39,610
I understand.

291
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:41,260
It means yes when you say no.

292
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:43,610
You don't have to tempt me.
I'm always yours.

293
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,560
Can you stop being so disgusting?

294
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:50,050
I could be more disgusting
if you like it.

295
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:51,070
Hurry! Take a look.

296
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:53,430
Hurry!

297
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:54,060
Look!

298
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,430
What are you looking at?

299
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:55,980
They are...

300
00:19:58,420 --> 00:19:59,980
Han Qi Lu and Xiang Man Kui.

301
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:03,280
What a perfect match!

302
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:05,890
Aren't they not talking to each other?

303
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:06,570
Why...

304
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:24,180
Qin Shi Huang unified the six countries
and ended the fragmentation of China.

305
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:27,320
The unification

306
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,050
was worth it
in the history of China.

307
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:40,010
A long time ago, people said,
Qin Shi Huang was a tyrant.

308
00:20:40,972 --> 00:20:45,060
"Han Qi Lu and Xiang Man Kui
came to school together today."
