1
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:18,410
Xiao Nan.

2
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:21,660
I know you're good for me,
but please stop running.

3
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:23,340
You heard what Wan Zi said.

4
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,440
I'll be in a trouble
if you keep running.

5
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,850
Believe me, I can do it.

6
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,200
Chu Xia.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,080
I can do it.

8
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:36,450
I can't lose to Mo Xin Wei.

9
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,600
-How many laps she has run?
-I don't know.

10
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:21,010
What's going on?

11
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:22,630
How could they ask her to run alone?

12
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:24,370
Wan Zi provoked Chu Xia first.

13
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:26,370
How could they do this?

14
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:29,020
-The class is over.
-Excuse me.

15
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:31,880
Excuse me.

16
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:38,760
Class B.

17
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,770
The bell rang.
Why didn't you go to class?

18
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:46,360
What are you doing here?
Run with her if you want to stay here!

19
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:48,570
-We're willing to run with her.
-No problem.

20
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:51,390
Copy the book for 10 times
if you still stay here!

21
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:56,200
Go back to your class! Hurry!

22
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,720
Hurry!

23
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,380
Hurry! Go!

24
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,430
I'm so happy.

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,810
It's cooler here, sit down.

26
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,880
Are you hot? I'll give you a flick.

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm so happy to see her running.

28
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:18,120
By the way, it's so hot,
do you want some ice cream?

29
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:20,230
-I'll buy it for you.
-Okay.

30
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,010
Wait for me.

31
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:29,800
I heard you absent because of sickness.
How could you be recovered so fast?

32
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,180
Wow!

33
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,540
It looks so special.

34
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:40,800
Is that funny?

35
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,100
It's not funny.

36
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,000
It's so funny.

37
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,600
I guess she did it on purpose.

38
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,570
I'll show you what I'll do with her.

39
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,100
It's a very special gift.

40
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,640
We have to look at it
in a traditional way.

41
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,400
In traditional words,

42
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,370
it means blessing and long life.

43
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,710
Young Master Ling.

44
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:11,120
I'm looking at it in a traditional way.

45
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,750
I found An Chu Xia
is trying to make a ritual for me.

46
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,930
Good, I have to bow to you then.

47
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,180
Did you see Chu Xia?

48
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:26,400
Say it!

49
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,040
She's in the field.

50
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,860
No...She's in the library!

51
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,900
What a strange woman!

52
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:41,210
-Is that so funny?
-That's wonderful.

53
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,220
-Take it if you like it.
-Sure.

54
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:47,040
I'll make 10 pieces for you and
you have to wear it every day.

55
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,230
Strange.

56
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,130
The library is closed today.

57
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,600
Chu Xia shouldn't be here.

58
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,980
Did she say An Chu Xia was in the field?

59
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:12,320
Let's go to the field.

60
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:09,356
[Master Devil Do Not Kiss Me S1]

61
00:05:09,611 --> 00:05:10,411
[Episode 14]

62
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,710
An Chu Xia!

63
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:25,060
Are you on a race walking?

64
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:29,030
If you don't know the difference
between walking and running,

65
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:31,070
I'll tell Mr. Ma later.

66
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:34,070
What about we let you walk for 20 laps?

67
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,330
Xin Wei.

68
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:39,300
What's up?

69
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,250
Xin Wei, I...

70
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:45,250
It's rare for us to skip the class.
Don't spoil my mood for watching it.

71
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:48,570
Hey...

72
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:55,570
Qi Lu.

73
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:57,990
Why is she here?

74
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:05,490
I'll give you a chance.

75
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,240
Tell me.

76
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:09,090
Why is she here?

77
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,040
Qi Lu.

78
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:13,970
You scared me.

79
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:16,290
Chu Xia.

80
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:33,530
Chu Xia!

81
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,620
How long have you been running?

82
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,670
-Stop it.
-I...

83
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,370
You will collapse.

84
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:41,480
3 more laps.

85
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:43,740
Why are you so serious?

86
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,740
I can't lose to Mo Xin Wei.

87
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,400
I can't lose to Ma Jian Guo.

88
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:51,290
Chu Xia.

89
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:55,340
Chu Xia.

90
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:57,920
Hey!

91
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:00,040
Who asked you to run?

92
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:01,540
Stop it.

93
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:04,840
I told you to stop.

94
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:08,000
-2 more laps.
-Stop it!

95
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,350
Chu Xia.

96
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,550
Chu Xia.

97
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,460
An Chu Xia, stop it!

98
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,760
Stop! Right now!

99
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:21,470
An Chu Xia.

100
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:27,810
Mo Xin Wei

101
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,790
Don't do this again.

102
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:31,570
Understand?

103
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:55,590
Madam.

104
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,420
Why don't you eat first?

105
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:01,540
Maybe they got held up in school.

106
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:04,820
Don't worry.

107
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,700
But my right eyelid
has been twitching today.

108
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:14,460
Something is going to happen.

109
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:18,920
Here they are.

110
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:24,050
Little Chu Xia, what's wrong with you?

111
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:27,040
What's wrong with her? Don't scare me.

112
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:27,940
What happened?

113
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:30,770
I told you, if something
goes wrong with her, I'll...

114
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,080
She just fell asleep.

115
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,080
Have your meal first.

116
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,490
Young Master Ling.

117
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:40,740
Check it out!

118
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,230
I want to know what happened

119
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:46,100
and who brought Chu Xia into this!

120
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:47,960
Han Yu.

121
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:53,650
You guys came back together.
Tell me what actually happened.

122
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,590
Actually, I don't know.

123
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:04,060
She was running when I got to the field.

124
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,610
You don't know?

125
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,190
Madam.

126
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:13,220
Why are you still standing here?
Quickly check it out!

127
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:15,080
Yes, I'll check it right away.

128
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,610
Don't be angry.

129
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:18,790
How could I stop angry?

130
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,800
She is my daughter in law.

131
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,850
They are trying to bully me.

132
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:26,990
Madam.

133
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:30,850
Look at it. Young Master Qi Lu
brought Ms. Chu Xia back.

134
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:33,820
He carried her to her room.

135
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:38,850
It means he has started
to accept Ms. Chu Xia.

136
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,500
You should be happy.

137
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,930
-This way please.
-Uncle Han.

138
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:54,930
What did you mean by accepting Chu Xia?

139
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:56,580
Don't you know?

140
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:59,470
She's the handpicked fiancee

141
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:02,240
for Young Master Qi Lu.

142
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:05,330
Your temper will kill you one day.

143
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:10,680
It's me.

144
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:15,020
I have a friend who is overactive.

145
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,630
She's dying.

146
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,960
Quickly get ready to come and treat her.

147
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,230
I don't care.

148
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:28,020
I'll send you a helicopter.

149
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,480
I want to see you in ten minutes.

150
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:36,610
You're dying.

151
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,210
That's why you gave me a shroud, huh?

152
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,280
Speak!

153
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:47,890
Are you a dumb?

154
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:51,000
I have no strength to fight you now.

155
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,320
Alright, let's call a truce today.

156
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,840
-Actually, I was thinking...
-What are you thinking?

157
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:02,730
If you have something to say,
please say it as soon as possible.

158
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,050
I'm tired.

159
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:14,850
I will say it at anytime as I want to.

160
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:20,240
In fact, I've been thinking

161
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:25,190
that we could have
a better relationship, right?

162
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,740
And through our interaction these days,

163
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:36,340
I found you're not as bad as I thought.

164
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,580
Sis Yuan Yuan likes you very much.

165
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,870
Maybe you don't need to move out.

166
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:47,860
Aren't you afraid
I'll get you into any trouble?

167
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,820
You've brought a lot of trouble so far.

168
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:56,030
But I measured it,
it's actually not hard to handle.

169
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:02,800
Compared with the happiness
of my mom, I think it's worth it.

170
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,380
So let's get along in peace later.

171
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,950
You are not having a fever.

172
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,640
Did you forget to take your
medicine or am I too tired?

173
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:24,950
You want to get along with me, huh?

174
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:32,200
I mean, our relationship

175
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:35,080
can go further

176
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:38,330
for my mom's happiness.

177
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:43,010
Like falling in love.

178
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,280
What do you mean?

179
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:56,190
What's your conspiracy?

180
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,260
You're trying to scare me away?

181
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,230
Is this the fastest way to kick me out?

182
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:05,000
Falling in love is not a big deal.

183
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:08,280
I know.

184
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:12,300
You are playing hard to get with me.
Women's usual tactics.

185
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,530
You want to tantalize me.

186
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,450
Young Master Han.

187
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,510
I'll take it as a joke

188
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:22,360
and you're kidding with a patient.

189
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:26,760
You can rest assured.
I'll forget this joke soon.

190
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:27,960
Joke?

191
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,930
An Chu Xia, I'll tell you what.

192
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:35,860
You need to playing hard to get with a scale,
fly a kite with a limit.

193
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:39,590
You are blessed as I value you.

194
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:44,610
I'll fly away when the thread is broken.
Make sure you don't cry over spilt milk.

195
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,810
Young Master Han.

196
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:48,870
I was angry.

197
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:53,490
But I was happy when I heard your joke.

198
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,080
Don't you like me?

199
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:01,550
No one ever dislikes me.

200
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:04,820
Han Qi Lu.

201
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:06,650
You're in the wrong crew.

202
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:10,240
It's not your character set.

203
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:13,340
An Chu Xia.

204
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:17,340
I'll throw you downstairs
if you laugh again.

205
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,520
That's right.

206
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,440
This is Han Qi Lu.

207
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,540
Young Master Han whom I know is back.

208
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,390
Madam, are you okay?

209
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,980
What are you doing?

210
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,060
Madam.

211
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,650
Lower down your voice.

212
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:43,120
I will give you a "holy time"
if my son hears it.

213
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:45,280
Madam, you're wrong.

214
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,420
Should be hard time
instead of holy time.

215
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:50,780
I said holy time!

216
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:55,020
That's just a phrase! I tell you...

217
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:01,730
Why are you here?

218
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,060
I...

219
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,120
Well.

220
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:12,310
I let Dr. Liu to check
our house building.

221
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:15,810
Don't you think we have
to renovate the house?

222
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:16,710
Right?

223
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:20,760
I was listening to Dr. Liu's advice.

224
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,930
But he's a doctor.

225
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:27,880
When did you change your job?
Why didn't you tell me?

226
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:30,630
Because I asked him to come.

227
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,720
You asked him to change his job?

228
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,730
Young Master Qi Lu, Madam
is here to pick me up.

229
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,640
That's right, I'm here to pick him up.

230
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:41,960
Go in and check her body.

231
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:45,400
Don't let her die. If she's dead,

232
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,710
someone will cancel my order
of the new telescope.

233
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,940
Am I right?

234
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,960
You bought a magnifying
glass again, huh?

235
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,030
How could I don't know?

236
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,390
Han!

237
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:59,340
How could you help
the bastard to bluff me?

238
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,960
What's going on?

239
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:07,720
I think, a brat is nicer than a bastard.

240
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:12,080
You should drive next time,

241
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,050
don't take the helicopter.

242
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:17,270
I should have let you walk here
if I knew it would be so fast.

243
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:18,590
Okay.

244
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,660
You are still here.

245
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:29,500
How's Chu Xia?

246
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,900
Don't worry. She won't die.

247
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,280
Dr. Liu is treating her.

248
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,910
Actually, you don't have to do this.

249
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:41,410
What?

250
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:47,210
You like her,
but pretend not to care of her.

251
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,940
Are you sure you won't split?

252
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:52,900
No, I didn't.

253
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:57,220
You know my mother likes her.

254
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:03,200
Moreover, I can't
give a good explanation

255
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:05,590
if she dies in the school.

256
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,020
Who likes her?

257
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:11,780
You or your mom?

258
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,060
Of course it's my mom.

259
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:18,270
You know, my father is not around now.

260
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,730
I have to cheer up my mom.

261
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:25,170
Else, I can't explain it
when my father comes back.

262
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:29,890
Look at you. So called explanation, huh?

263
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,660
You have never been afraid
to give an explanation.

264
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:38,390
Moreover,

265
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:40,760
what's wrong with Chu Xia?

266
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,030
What's so good about her?

267
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,520
Don't tell me you like her.

268
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:58,160
Maybe when we like someone,

269
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:01,410
her weakness will shine too.

270
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:04,800
Qi Lu.

271
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,410
Thank you for helping Chu Xia today.

272
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,480
I was supposed to do that.

273
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,360
She's my maid.

274
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:16,920
If you really like her, quickly
marry her and come to work for me.

275
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:21,320
I'm off. Take a good rest early.

276
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,270
Don't you want to see her?

277
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:24,550
No.

278
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,870
Let her rest early
after the doctor has done it.

279
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:31,350
By the way,

280
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,300
when will your dad come back?

281
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:35,650
Very soon.

282
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:36,650
Why?

283
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:40,880
My grandfather has agreed
and he wanted to see Chu Xia.

284
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:44,180
I'll take Chu Xia away
when your dad is back.

285
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:46,330
Okay.

286
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:50,960
See you.

287
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,280
I didn't think she was sought-after.

288
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:07,790
-How's An Chu Xia?
-It's because of excessive exercise.

289
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:10,050
She needs to take a rest for a few days.

290
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,690
Don't worry.

291
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,900
I got it, you may leave now.

292
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,180
Young Master Han.

293
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,820
I have acrophobia and airsickness.

294
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,800
I'll drive myself next time.

295
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:27,610
You don't have to come again.
