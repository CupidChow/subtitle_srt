Stop singing!

20
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,080
Come with me.

21
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:04,360
Come on, let's go.

22
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:15,410
I had so much fun singing.
Why did you drag me here?

23
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:17,470
Others sing to earn money.

24
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:18,750
You sing to kill lives.

25
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:21,040
If you want to vent your emotions,
this is the perfect place.

26
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:25,890
You're from Stiland?

27
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,640
I'm form Stiland's class B,

28
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,980
the one who never changes her name,

29
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,120
An Chu Xia.

30
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,560
So even Stiland has students
who are this brainless?

31
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:40,750
Stand up from where you fell down.

32
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:42,290
Jiang Chen Chuan,

33
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:43,150
you can do it!

34
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,540
What do you want to play?

35
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:47,280
Tell me.

36
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,010
But... this is too easy.

37
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:57,540
Give me something more challenging.

38
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:01,600
Actually, as someone
who is invincible at arcades

39
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,320
everything here is too easy.

40
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:04,270
I chose this one

41
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:06,250
carefully on the basis of your
intelligence.

42
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,750
Let me teach you.

43
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,170
First,

44
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:12,180
take two coins.

45
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,530
Then throw them in.

46
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:16,720
Take one ball,

47
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,740
and throw it!

48
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,530
Are you alright?

49
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:22,940
I'm fine!

50
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:23,900
It slipped from my hands.

51
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:24,840
One more.

52
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,610
Why don't you let me?

53
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:30,810
No, thanks! Move!

54
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,720
Invincible?

55
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,240
Stop hurting yourself.

56
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,690
Let's play something else.

57
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:44,610
No!

58
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:45,800
I refuse to believe

59
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,290
that I won't manage to throw in
a single ball today.

60
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:48,220
Hey, but,

61
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:50,210
wasn't it your goal to help me
vent my emotions?

62
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:51,540
Why get angry with a ball?

63
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,330
I hate that ball!

64
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:54,410
You hate it?

65
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:55,130
Yeah.

66
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:59,460
Better now?

67
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,090
Yeah.

68
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,220
Better now?

69
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:04,750
Yeah!

70
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:05,690
You still hate them?

71
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:06,850
I do!

72
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:07,610
Alright.

73
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:45,980
=Master Devil Do Not Kiss Me S2=

74
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:46,820
=Episode 20=

75
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,810
Never thought you could play drums so well.

76
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,750
Are you kidding me?

77
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,580
It's just singing I'm bad at.

78
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:55,790
As for drums,

79
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,920
I went behind my dad's back to learn it
for a couple of years.

80
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,240
Why go behind his back?

81
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:07,700
My dad wants me to study economics,

82
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,120
so I can inherit his business.

83
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:12,610
Since I was little,

84
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,340
he put an end to

85
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:17,290
any hobbies I had aside from

86
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:18,100
business.

87
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:20,650
You poor thing.

88
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,840
Actually,

89
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:26,010
I've always had this dream

90
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:28,280
that when I retire,

91
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,960
I'll start a band.

92
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,150
Others go to live in nursing homes and play
Mahjong when they're old.

93
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:34,300
When I'm old, I'll go to nursing homes

94
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:35,330
to give concerts.

95
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:39,130
When you are old, you won't even be able
to hold the drum sticks,

96
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:40,040
let alone give a concert.

97
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,740
Bullshit.

98
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:47,290
Jiang Chen Chuan.

99
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,680
You should start a band now.

100
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:51,910
I support you.

101
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:57,800
Let's go.

102
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:05,820
Han Qi Lu?

103
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:09,540
Han Qi Lu, are you home?

Happy birthday.

110
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:37,660
Let's go over there.

111
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:57,820
Make a wish.

112
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:58,640
Ok.

113
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,820
Done. I'll go turn on the lights.

114
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:06,760
Oh, wait.

115
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:13,580
This is my present for you.

116
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,800
It's so cute.

117
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,970
Is it a table lamp?

118
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:20,120
It's a wishing light.

119
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,320
A wishing light?

120
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:21,770
Yes.

121
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,760
With this

122
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:27,530
you won't need to blow out candles

123
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,920
on your birthday again,

124
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:31,820
waiting to make a wish.

125
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:33,980
Thank you, Qi Lu.

126
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:37,000
But I don't have that many wishes,

127
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,870
let alone one for every day.

128
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:39,710
You do.

129
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:43,660
For example, you can wish for

130
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:45,420
seeing me every day.

131
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:46,250
Huh?

132
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:47,260
Yes.

133
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,840
And it will come true every time.

134
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:49,600
How great is that?

135
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,320
Alright.

136
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,830
Let's talk seriously.

137
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:00,460
Chu Xia.

138
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,310
Tomorrow is a big day for your competition.

139
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,820
I wish you success.

140
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:07,430
Thanks.

141
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,500
Chu Xia.

142
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,290
It doesn't matter whether I'll see you
every day or not,

143
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:23,280
I hope that every time I see you

144
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,420
you're happy

145
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,040
and content,

146
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:30,960
without any worries,

147
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,680
just like the first time I saw you.

148
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:38,880
Ok.

149
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,200
Hey.

150
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,350
Why didn't you turn on the lights?

151
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:56,800
Sister Yuan.

152
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,960
Why didn't you tell us you were
coming home?

153
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:03,030
Your Sister Yuan knew that it's
Little Chu Xia's birthday today.

154
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,860
She had me leave the hospital sooner

155
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,700
so we can give you a surprise.

156
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:10,850
Are you surprised, Little Chu Xia?

157
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,830
Who bought this cake?

158
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,090
What do you mean, bought?

159
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,330
I made it.

160
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,450
Wow.

161
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,600
No wonder it's so ugly.

162
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,050
My son can bake cakes now?

163
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:22,320
Thank you, Sister Yuan.

164
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,290
Thank you, Brother Liu.
Thank you, Uncle Han.

165
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,420
You remembered my birthday.

166
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,760
Of course,

167
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,780
we are family.

168
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:32,520
Your Sister Yuan not only knows
your birthday,

169
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,250
she also knows that tomorrow is an important
day for you competition.

170
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,580
Little Chu Xia.

171
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:37,360
Here.

172
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:38,880
This is for you.

173
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,710
It's fine, Brother Liu.

174
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:41,620
You are too nice.

175
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,540
Oh, don't treat me like an outsider.

176
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,700
Time was limited.

177
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,100
I didn't have time to prepare a present.

178
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,010
So I

179
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:49,660
had to do with poor taste this time.

180
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,340
Ok.

181
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,170
It is also a little gift of your mother.

182
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:56,820
Please take it.

183
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,360
Thank you, Brother Liu.

184
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,930
It tastes really bad.

185
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:06,670
Old Han...

186
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:09,220
Come!

187
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:11,120
Er, eat the cake I bought.

188
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:11,990
Come on.

189
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:13,120
Old Han, go,

190
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,250
go get your chips

191
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,680
and soft drinks, let everyone
have a taste.

192
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,800
Alright.

193
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,720
This is so pretty.

194
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,320
Actually, my cake is quite pretty, too.

195
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,620
Today

196
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:27,370
we're doing a home party at home.

197
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:29,610
-What do you say?
-Careful.

198
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,890
Oh right.

199
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:33,060
Listen,

200
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,970
er, Brother Liu just got a call.

201
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:37,120
They say that

202
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,480
our company's financing has been
successful.

203
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:43,180
Our company has overcome all obstacles now.

204
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:44,520
Really?

205
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,090
Yes.

206
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,630
Qi Lu,

207
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:49,760
you are free now.

208
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:53,640
Come.

209
00:11:56,150 --> 00:12:01,790
♪Happy Birthday to you♪

210
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:05,850
Hello?

211
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,180
Are you clear on what needs to be done?

212
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,310
Ok, got it.

213
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,300
Xiang Man Kui.

214
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,760
I finally know why you want to
come back.

215
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:29,970
Dad.

216
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,960
Xin Wei, you aren't asleep yet?

217
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,250
Xin Wei.

218
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,380
I want to talk to you.

219
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,840
There's nothing to talk about.

220
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,280
I understand what you're feeling.

221
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:47,630
But I hope you can understand

222
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:50,820
that the result of this competition
isn't important.

223
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,430
What's important

224
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,570
is that you're still my good daughter.

225
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:55,360
Dad!

226
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:57,060
I want to sleep.

227
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,470
Then sleep well.

228
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,980
Alright, dear teachers,

229
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:10,500
dear students and our friends
from the media,

230
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,920
welcome to the finale of the Pinkston Youth
Design Competition!

231
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,490
The final will soon be kicked off.

232
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:21,240
The contestants standing on the stage
right now are our finalists.

233
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:22,760
One of them will

234
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,550
get the chance to study at

235
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:27,080
Pinkston College in France.

236
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:30,340
Next, let us welcome last year's
champion,

237
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:32,390
this year's special judge,

238
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:36,570
and our most highly anticipated
new designer Ms. Xiang

239
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:39,600
to the stage to announce
the rules of the competition!

240
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,500
Welcome.

241
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,850
For the last round,

242
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:50,480
the contestants will be taken to
a special working space

243
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,120
to create a piece that will reflect

244
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:55,160
their skill level in three days.

245
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,370
Alright, thank you. Thank you,
Ms. Xiang.

246
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:00,500
It means that all of our contestants will
complete their work

247
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,660
in a closed environment.

248
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,890
All communication devices,

249
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:04,470
such as mobile phones and computers,

250
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:06,890
are forbidden in this space.

251
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:10,980
This is also the only difference from our
previous competition system.

252
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:14,850
They will complete their work in a closed
environment independently.

253
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:16,630
Of course, as our senior,

254
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,720
I believe that Ms. Xiang must have some

255
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,630
high expectations for this year's
contestants.

256
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:24,360
Is there anything you'd like to
say to them?

257
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:30,180
I believe that every contestant
who comes on to this stage

258
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:32,750
is full of dreams and enthusiasm,

259
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:36,610
so I hope that this competition will be
absolutely fair,

260
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:37,660
professional,

261
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,400
and pure.

262
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:43,920
I believe that every contestant has
their own imagination,

263
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,170
so

264
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:46,630
you can do it!

265
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,250
Alright, thank you.

266
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:50,000
Thank you so much, Ms. Xiang.

267
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,860
That gave us high hopes for the
contestants

268
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,810
and cheered them up.

269
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:54,400
Alright,

270
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,730
now let our contestants enter
the competition area!

271
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:58,610
Please guide the way.

272
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:00,640
Wait.

273
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:04,480
I would like to ask Ms. Xiang
a question.

274
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,800
As a talented young designer,

275
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,080
why haven’t you had anything new released
for half a year?

276
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:12,360
Have you used up your talent and energy,

277
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,050
or is there another reason?

278
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:18,530
Please answer my question.

279
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:20,290
Mo Xin Wei. You're going too far!

280
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:21,670
Am I?

281
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,410
I just wish to learn from my senior

282
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:27,670
from a newcomer's perspective.

283
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,410
As a designer,

284
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:34,160
your work doesn't create itself
overnight.

285
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,350
I haven't released anything new
this half year,

286
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,830
I've let down the people
who have been following me.

287
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:43,160
But I will slowly get myself back into form,

288
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,760
and let my work speak for me
as quickly as possible.

289
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:52,600
Did you find out something?

290
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,720
-What did I find out?
-Stop playing stupid.

291
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:58,660
An Chu Xia, remember this.

292
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:00,800
As long as I'm here,

293
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:04,520
you and your dead mom will never step foot
in the Jiang family's home.

294
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:07,220
I won't hold back

295
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:10,260
when I step on you.

296
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:19,930
Cheer up.

297
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:24,480
It's so hot.

298
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,970
I mean really,

299
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:28,100
how can they just close without giving you
notice in advance?

300
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,880
I haven't prepared anything for you.

301
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:33,250
But I'm sure

302
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,480
that you will win.

303
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,220
Hey,

304
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:37,090
it's just a competition.

305
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:39,250
Why make it seem like a life and
death situation?

306
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,580
You're ruining the mood.

307
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,290
Sister Yuan, don't worry,

308
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:44,000
I will give my best.

309
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:45,960
-Go for it.
-Go for it.

310
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:47,730
Chu Xia!

311
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:49,740
It's time! We need to set out
to the working space now.

312
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,230
We'll be late if we don't go now!

313
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:53,460
Have you seen Mo Xin Wei?

314
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:55,920
She's the only one left.

315
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,440
Call her!

316
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,900
I did, she doesn't pick up!

317
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,120
Call Wan Zi.

318
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,060
They are very close. Maybe they
are together.

319
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:02,850
Ok.

320
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,060
An Chu Xia,

321
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,220
hurry up!

322
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:06,930
I'm coming.

323
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:08,170
I'm off.

324
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,010
Good luck.

325
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:10,450
Good luck.

326
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,830
Hey, Chu Xia.

327
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:21,650
Give your best.

328
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:22,560
Don't be nervous.

329
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:23,350
Ok.

330
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:24,740
Go.

331
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,300
Did you find Xin Wei or not?

332
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,430
Xin Wei?

333
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:54,510
Are you clear on what needs to be done?

334
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:56,860
I asked you a question.

335
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:59,130
Don't talk to me in this tone.

336
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:13,460
Why didn't you go to cheer on Chu Xia?

337
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,660
I'm giving you a chance to shine.

338
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,210
Stop it.

339
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,310
I just think that

340
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,200
Chu Xia needs to stay calm at such a time.

341
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,760
Let her think

342
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,550
what the competition means to her.

343
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:29,560
What does she want?

344
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:34,940
I always have the feeling that
you've changed

345
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:36,690
after you came back.

346
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,260
Really?

347
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,290
How?

348
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:42,060
It's difficult to say.

349
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,840
I just think that you became sharper.

350
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,800
More attractive maybe.

351
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:52,420
I gotta tell you first,

352
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:54,960
I'm not interested in men.

353
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,620
Since when did you become like
Jiang Chen Chuan?

354
00:18:57,730 --> 00:18:59,240
So arrogant and narcissistic.

355
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:01,200
Jiang Chen Chuan...

356
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,240
What a surprise.

357
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,570
He's Chu Xia's cousin.

358
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:10,110
Yeah.

359
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:13,120
This matter...

360
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:16,660
must have affected him a lot.

361
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,000
Yeah.

362
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,570
We are in the same boat now.

363
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:27,670
You gotta understand that
our common enemy is An Chu Xia!

364
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:31,900
Today I will make her fail and unable to
ever recover, no matter how.

365
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,600
I know what you are planning.

366
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:36,560
Oh,

367
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:40,800
the Jiang family has been
flooded with scandals lately.

368
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,190
You...

369
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,310
But,

370
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:45,110
you were right about something.

371
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:46,730
I won't

372
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,170
let An Chu Xia off the hook.

373
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,640
That's why

374
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,930
we can't have Xiang Man Kui appear at the
final round tomorrow.

375
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:57,210
Ok,

376
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,450
I understand.
