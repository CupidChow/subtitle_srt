00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:49,370
I didn't expect that
you like to rummage around.

3
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,190
Anything I can help?

4
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,390
What does the application mean?

5
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:05,050
Does it concern you?

6
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:08,880
You applied for MSF
and will be leaving the college.

7
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,170
Why did you come here?

8
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,550
Liu Gui Fen! Answer me!

9
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:14,590
I told you not to call my name!

10
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:15,710
Don't call me that!

11
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:19,710
Can you listen to me?

12
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:23,480
-Who are you? Why should I listen to you?
-I'm nobody! I just like you!

13
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:28,150
What did you say?

14
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:31,240
Maria.

15
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,030
Don't apply for the MSF.

16
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:36,820
Stay here.

17
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:38,880
Stay with me!

18
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:40,970
Maybe I'm nobody.

19
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:43,710
Maybe I'm not your ideal partner.

20
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,420
But please believe me.

21
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:48,620
I'll work hard

22
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,230
to do better.

23
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:55,880
I wanted to tell you about it.

24
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:58,060
But I dared not.

25
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,090
I was afraid that we couldn't be
friends after I pour my heart out.

26
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:07,050
During the time I studied abroad,
I've figured it out.

27
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:08,950
No matter whom I met

28
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:11,180
and how good her background is,

29
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:16,160
you are the only one I miss.

30
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,640
Promise me.

31
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,190
Don't go.

32
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:35,150
What do you mean?

33
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:38,070
Didn't you say you like me?

34
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,710
Didn't you say
you can't live without me?

35
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,580
And you easily give up now!

36
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:44,540
You...

37
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,100
I'll tell you what.
It's not that simple!

38
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:51,840
What do you mean?

39
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:54,420
Nothing.

40
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,680
3 months.

41
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:01,900
If you can't make me
satisfied in these 3 months,

42
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:03,810
I'll go immediately.

43
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:10,450
Don't do this!

44
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:13,550
What?

45
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,400
What are you doing now?

47
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:19,080
You Tian!

48
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,140
I have never expected you'd do that!

49
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:25,930
No, I wanted to explain
but you didn't give me the chance.

50
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:26,950
You blame me?

51
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,860
My father's right!

52
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,170
All the men are bad!

53
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,060
You disappointed me!

54
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,380
Hey!

55
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:37,000
Stop zoning out!

56
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,920
Chase her back! Don't let anything happen to her.

00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:39,860
Okay.

Are you okay?

Hey.

00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:05,070
I'm talking to you.

61
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,520
How could You Tian leave you alone?

62
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,540
Let me call him.

63
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,640
Mr. Ma.

64
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:18,260
You are so handsome.

Try this.

68
00:05:58,110 --> 00:05:58,750
Eat more.

69
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,780
Are you full?

70
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,510
Would you like to have some desserts?

71
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,940
No, it's alright.

72
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,000
Don't be so polite.

73
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:20,050
Tell me if you'd like to eat anything.

74
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:21,620
I'll let them cook for you.

75
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,910
-Yeah.
-I've had enough.

76
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:24,940
Really, thanks for
your kind hospitality.

77
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,560
What a sweet tongue!

78
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:31,760
Chu Xia.

79
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:35,480
Han Yu said,

80
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:38,150
you like fashion design.

81
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:41,120
That's good!

82
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:45,870
His grandmother used to like fashion
design too when she was young.

83
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,770
And I'm influenced by her.

84
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,380
I have collected some design
manuscripts over the years.

85
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:57,870
Do you want to have a look?

86
00:06:58,490 --> 00:06:59,250
May I?

87
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,720
Sure! No problem!

88
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:01,630
Come on!

89
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,780
Come on!

90
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:20,320
These are all from the young designers.

91
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,410
Although they are not famous,

92
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,560
but I like it.

93
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:28,910
They are different from
the so-called pioneer

94
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:31,170
and conceptual designers.

95
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:32,800
It's simple and unadorned.

96
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,580
From their design, I can feel

97
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:41,870
the unlimited enthusiasm
and exuberant vitality.

98
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,040
Take a look.

99
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,510
Let's see.

100
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:50,100
Grandpa Ling.

101
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:51,630
I can feel it too.

102
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,710
Really?

103
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:55,070
Hey!

104
00:07:55,650 --> 00:08:01,390
We have a telepathy between us.

105

Chu Xia.

106
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:05,410
I would like to know

107
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:09,620
what makes you like fashion design.

108
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,680
Because of my mom.

109
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:15,650
Your mom?

110
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,830
I want to fulfill her unfinished dream!

111
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,670
Oh!

112
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:29,060
Look at these.

113
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:34,750
Grandpa Ling.

114
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:35,710
Yes.

115
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:37,680
Where did you get this picture?

116
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:41,690
You know her?

117
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,870
She's my mother!

118
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:46,880
You...

119
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:51,490
You're Shu Ya's daughter?

120
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:03,520
No wonder I felt familiar
when I first saw you.

121
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:06,510
You two are alike.

122
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,580
Especially your eyes
which are full of wisdom.

123
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:14,720
They're exactly the same as your mother's!

124
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:17,390
Grandpa Ling.

125
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,430
Are you close with my mother?

126
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,090
We're friends.

127
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:32,450
But, I haven't seen her
for more than 20 years.

128
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:36,760
Can you tell me about it?

129
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:53,430
Hello.

00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:55,590
It is me.

132
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:57,590
What's up?

133
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:01,100
There's an astronomical
photography tonight

134
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:04,040
by Mr. Stroff,
your favourite photographer.

135
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:05,650
I have two tickets.

136
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,150
Do you want to go?

137
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,280
Mr. Stroff?

138
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:13,250
He's never held any exhibition in
China before. How could he be here?

139
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:14,150
That's right.

140
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,700
I heard his Chinese students
strongly invited him to come.

141
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:20,210
The exhibition is simple

142
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:21,490
and rare.

143
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:24,320
I got the tickets with my friends' help.

144
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,350
Qi Lu.

145
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:28,550
Qi Lu.

146
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:29,830
I know.

147
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,120
I'll consider it.

148
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,460
Are you saying yes?
I'll wait for you then.

149
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:03,960
Grandpa Ling.

150
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:05,590
Thank you.

151
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,060
Don't mention it.

152
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:11,110
It should have belonged to you.

153
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,590
It's late now.

154
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,880
Let Han Yu send you back!

155
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:21,210
I'll let him send the manuscripts
to you another day.

156
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,580
Chu Xia, let's go.

157
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:28,670
Grandpa Ling.

158
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:30,470
Can I ask a question?

159
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:31,640
Sure.

160
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:34,040
Do you know

161
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,670
who is the man in the picture?

162
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:39,920
I don't know.

163
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,860
But I heard your mom

164
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,810
had a boyfriend at that time.

165
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:47,850
By the way,

166
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,740
the information

167
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,350
was all sent from Huiyang.

168
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,470
Although there's
no specific address,

169
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:55,150
at least it can prove that

170
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:58,210
she once lived there for a while.

171
00:11:58,210 --> 00:11:59,250
Am I right?

172
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:01,600
Okay.

173
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,540
I got it.

174
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:03,250
Thank you.

175
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:07,180
Chu Xia.

176
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,410
I hope you

177
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,260
stick to your dream

178
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:15,560
and never give up easily

179
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,130
as what your mom did.

180
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:17,920
Okay?

181
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:18,980
Okay.

182
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,500
Good girl.

183
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:22,420
Go ahead.

184
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:24,150
-Let's go.
-See you.

185
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,650
Bye.

186
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,230
You can cry it out if you want to.

187
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,900
It's okay.

188
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,260
It's just unbelievable.

189
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:53,720
I've been trying to find
a clue about my father.

190
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,410
And it's right next to me.

191
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,870
-Do you need help?
-Let me think about it.

192
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,680
Call me at any time you need help.

193
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:08,950
Thank you so much.

194
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:13,750
But, can you keep it a secret
for what happened today?

195
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,060
Don't worry.

196
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,880
I won't tell anyone.

197
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:18,830
Okay.

198
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:21,430
I'm off.

199
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:28,050
Chu Xia.

200
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:29,990
What's up?

201
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:33,640
Take a rest and don't think too much.

202
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:57,360
Chu Xia.

203
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,360
Come here.

204
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,740
I can't get it through.
Come and play with me.

205
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:04,760
What's wrong with her?

206
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:06,440
Madam.

207
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:14,070
Don't eat too much junk food.

208
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:21,040
Mom.

209
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,620
I haven't seen you smile
happily for a long time.

210
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:30,940
Hmm.

211
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,510
I miss you very much.

212
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:41,820
Are you alright

213
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:44,290
in heaven?

214
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,850
Who's actually that guy?

215
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:52,450
I must find out.

216
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:58,300
Come in.

217
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:02,300
Who's that?

218
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,310
Why are you here?

219
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:09,680
Are you going out?

220
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,230
I'm going to Mr. Stroff's
astronomy exhibition.

221
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,240
Alone?

222
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,570
With a friend.

223
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,180
What's wrong?

224
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:24,400
Nothing.

225
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,710
Is Mr. Stroff very famous?

226
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:27,840
Yes.

227
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:31,620
He's one of my favorite
astronomical photographers

228
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,710
who's never held
any exhibition in China before,

229
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,250
but, he's here now.

230
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,860
Enjoy yourself.

231
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:20,210
"I'll stay overnight at Xiao Nan's house,
don't worry"

232
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,400
An Chu Xia, let's go eating.

233
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:23,840
An Chu Xia.

234
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:35,840
I'll stay overnight at Xiao Nan's house,
don't worry.

235
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:44,270
A train ticket?

236
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:00,780
Too bad!

237
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,500
Sir, please turn back.

238
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:21,800
Hey!

239
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:23,570
Hey!

240
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,610
-What do you want?
-Are you running away from home?

241
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:27,730
Ah?

242
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:29,170
Answer me!

243
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:30,710
I...

244
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,060
With Jiang Chen Chuan?

245
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,540
What did you say?

246
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:37,460
That's crap!

247
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,280
I'll go to Huiyang.

248
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,200
I got a clue about my father.

249
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:45,660
Insane!

250
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:49,820
What do you want?

251
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:52,110
I'll go with you.

252
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:57,000
Let's go. Get into the car.

253
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:11,620
The astrophotography exhibition
will be closed at 18:00.

254
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:18,340
Hurry!

255
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:21,020
Here!

256
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:21,970
I'm coming.

257
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:22,770
Hurry!

258
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,070
It was a traffic jam.

259
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:25,240
I'm sorry.
