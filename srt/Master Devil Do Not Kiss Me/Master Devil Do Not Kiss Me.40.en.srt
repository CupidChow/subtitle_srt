1
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:21,536
I heard that last night
you and Jiang Chen Chuan...

2
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:22,600
You believe that, too?

3
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,240
I just want the inside story.

4
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:29,320
What's gotten into him?

5
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,556
Who knows?

6
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,990
He's so sensitive.

7
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:35,390
(I will be responsible for you)

8
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,540
I will be responsible for you?

9
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:43,190
And you still say nothing happened?

10
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:46,770
So are you gonna make him take
responsibility?

11
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:49,450
Why are you joining the gossip, too?

12
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,460
Chu Xia.

13
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:55,170
I heard that you didn't go home
last night.

14
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,220
Qi Lu and I were very worried about you.

15
00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:58,336
Where did you go?

16
00:00:58,420 --> 00:00:59,556
My friend's place.

17
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,096
Oh, that's good then.

18
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:03,440
I was so scared I couldn't sleep
well last night.

19
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:05,516
It's almost time for the rematch.

20
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,776
Prepare yourself.

21
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:08,806
If you have any questions, you
can come to me.

22
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:10,196
You can ask me any time.

23
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,120
Ok.

24
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,440
I'm leaving.

25
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:13,550
Bye bye.

26
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:19,430
So fake.

27
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,380
Oh.

28
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:23,996
Han Yu.

29
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:24,920
Hm?

30
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:27,326
Why didn't you stay overseas?

31
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:29,796
Instead you come back and give me such a
big surprise.

32
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,786
Do you want me to fall in love
with you again?

33
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:32,960
Don't flatter yourself.

34
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,536
I was worried your family will
go bankrupt

35
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:36,340
and you'd ask me to lend you money when
I come back.

36
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:39,300
So you brought back 100 million instead.

37
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,460
What a rich guy, Young Master Ling.

38
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:42,886
Don't take this the wrong way.

39
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:43,946
Let me be clear,

40
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:46,300
this 100 million may not be yours.

41
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,800
Ling Hang Enterprise is another business
of our family.

42
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,880
There are a lot of stockholders,

43
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,830
many of whom are invisible millionaires.

44
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,670
If you want them to invest in you,

45
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,970
you'll have to prove to them your worth.

46
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:03,150
The Le Xi bottle design is a test.

47
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,230
Only if the design concept gets accepted

48
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:07,590
will you get the 100 million.

49
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:11,040
I understand.

50
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,286
But no matter the outcome,

51
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:14,210
Han Yu,

52
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,610
I have to thank you.

53
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,520
How are you gonna thank me?

54
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,280
Give Chu Xia up to me?

55
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,280
Look at your stinginess.

56
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:25,810
I was just kidding.

57
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,400
But it seems that your enemy in love
right now isn't me.

58
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,600
Who is it?

59
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,720
You'll know soon enough.

60
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:43,400
Hey, the roast chicken last night
was so good.

61
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,476
Crispy on the outside, tender on the inside.
Adding some sauce to it fresh from the oven,

62
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,830
it's so good.

63
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,310
Chu Xia!

64
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:59,116
Why are you still here?

65
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,176
How can I leave when Chu Xia hasn't
left yet?

66
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,126
Come,

67
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:03,390
Let me show you something.

68
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,760
Huh?

69
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,100
Watch carefully.

70
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:18,816
Wow!

71
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:19,926
Chu Xia, listen,

72
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:22,526
even though I got so drunk I blacked out
last night,

73
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:25,296
I will be responsible for you.

74
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,536
From now on,

75
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,156
An Chu Xia is my girl!

76
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:29,956
Shut up!

77
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,616
You listen to me, Jiang Chen Chuan,

78
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:35,620
we only got drunk and slept in the lawn
last night.

79
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,026
-Nothing happened, understand?
-
Oh, Chu Xia.

80
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:38,896
You don't need to console me.

81
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,036
I will be responsible for you.

82
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,390
I don't need you to be responsible!

83
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,166
I'll be responsible for you!

84
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,836
It's fine. You don't need to be
embarrassed.

85
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,156
You really don't need to be embarrassed.

86
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,076
Chu Xia!

87
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:48,796
Really,

88
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,696
you really don't need to...

89
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:50,620
Let go of her.

90
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,040
Chu Xia.

91
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,276
Why are you back?

92
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,106
Do you miss me?

93
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,440
I miss you so much.

94
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,996
Oh, Ling Han Yu. Why are you back?

95
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,916
If I still didn't come back.

96
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,046
Chu Xia would get seized by you.

97
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:03,956
Of course I had to come back.

98
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,096
Oh, it's too late.

99
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,686
Chu Xia is already mine.

100
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:08,056
What do you mean, yours?

101
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,356
She is my maid!

102
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,650
Mine!

103
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,036
So,

104
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,206
you three are officially fighting
over Chu Xia now?

105
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:16,540
None of your business!

106
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:17,936
You go ahead and talk,

107
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:18,516
I'm

108
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,236
leaving.

109
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:19,776
Let's go.

110
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:20,556
Chu Xia.

111
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,286
I'm organizing a return party tonight.

112
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:23,660
I came to pick you up.

113
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,026
My grandfather isn't home today.

114
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:27,036
He's out traveling.

115
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,366
Xiao Nan, you should come, too.

116
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:30,320
I also invited many other students.

117
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,960
I'm very sincere.

118
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,360
-Ok.
-Let's go.

119
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:36,456
I'm coming, too!

120
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,886
Are you invited?

121
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:39,760
You are too stingy.

122
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,320
-Let's go.
-Let's go!

123
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:43,770
Let's go.

124
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,560
Cheapskate!

125
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:26,416
=Master Devil Do Not Kiss Me S2=

126
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,156
=Episode 17=

127
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,080
Drink.

128
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,440
Bottoms up!

129
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:31,856
In great gulps! Quick!

130
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:32,780
Drink.

131
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,176
Drink more. Drink more.

132
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,316
The glass wasn't even full.

133
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,016
One more glass.

134
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,000
I'll pour you a glass.

135
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:41,860
Meng Xiao Nan!

136
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,696
Don't eat so much.

137
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,276
You are getting fat.

138
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,416
Being a little chubby is the best figure.

139
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,340
Got it?

140
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:52,010
But you are fat.

141
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,906
You are one to talk.

142
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,940
Look how fat your face is.

143
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,130
You are quite fat.

144
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:05,636
However,

145
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,856
you have to eat more

146
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,820
so you will have the strength
to be my maid

147
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:09,986
and work.

148
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,046
Who wants to be your maid?

149
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:11,970
You.

150
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,120
You...

151
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,076
Hey, Xiao Nan.

152
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,140
Say, what kind of girls do guys like?

153
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:20,916
Well...

154
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,960
Different guys have different tastes.

155
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:24,410
Come.

156
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,340
Look, those four.

157
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,456
This one,

158
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,660
he is crazy.

159
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,380
You only have to give him the
cold shoulder,

160
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:33,190
he won't care if you're fat or thin.

161
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:35,856
This one,

162
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,516
it's obvious he likes skinny people,

163
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,360
thin, healthy.

164
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:43,820
As for this one,

165
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,456
he obviously likes girls who are between
thin and fat.

166
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,596
Like streaky pork belly,

167
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,940
and who has a natural sexiness.

168
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,076
Hey, stop looking.

169
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,290
You got the streaky pork belly,

170
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:58,800
as for the natural sexiness... it's her.

171
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:08,500
Come on, let's go over there.

172
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,750
100 million?

173
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:12,936
Yes.

174
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,016
He said

175
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,626
if I give him Chu Xia,

176
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:17,170
he'll give me 100 million

177
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:19,290
and help my family overcome our crisis.

178
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,676
An Chu Xia isn't yours.

179
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,206
What right do you have to give her away?

180
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:24,396
Chu Xia is his maid.

181
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,120
Of course he has the right to
make the transfer.

182
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:27,596
Or...

183
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,070
you could give me 100 million, too?

184
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,880
What 100 million?

185
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:35,490
Han Qi Lu said that he'd give you
to Ling Han Yu for 100 million.

186
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:37,860
You can be sold at 100 million?

187
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,860
No, we were just joking.

188
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,180
I wasn't.

189
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:45,210
What right do you have to sell me?

190
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:47,986
That's right.

191
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:49,410
I don't have the right,

192
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,660
seems like you and Young Master Jiang
are a couple now.

193
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:55,376
That's right.

194
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,816
We are a couple.

195
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:57,920
So what?

196
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,040
Qi Lu.

197
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:03,950
Little Kui, you came.

198
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:05,697
The air is a bit sticky here.

199
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,220
Let's go somewhere else.

200
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:11,166
It is quite noisy.

201
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,096
Chu Xia,

202
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,286
let's go to my room.

203
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:14,106
Come on.

204
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:15,180
Come look at my room.

205
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,240
Let's go.

206
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,556
His room?

207
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,920
Hey! No, I'm coming too!

208
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:20,490
I'm coming, too!

209
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,436
Xin Wei,

210
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,880
what's going on between them?

211
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,900
We'll have a good show to watch tonight.

212
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:31,910
A good show?

213
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,240
Drink.

214
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,090
Are you trying to get drunk?

215
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,880
It wouldn't be because of
An Chu Xia, would it?

216
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:12,390
Four.

217
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:17,490
Six.

218
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:19,686
Pass.

219
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:20,610
Nine.

220
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:24,140
I wanted to have a private chat
with Chu Xia.

221
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,786
I'm here,

222
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:27,600
you won't get a chance to be alone
with her.

223
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:30,330
Will you two die if you don't speak?

224
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:31,620
Two!

225
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,056
You can't top that, can you?

226
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:33,726
Pass.

227
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:35,076
You can't top it.

228
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,396
Three twos.

229
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,216
Huh?

230
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,396
-Won again!
-What's going on?

231
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,586
-I'm not playing anymore!
-I'm not playing anymore.

232
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:42,326
Why do you all want to stop playing?

233
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:44,296
You already won my money
for half a month of food!

234
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,370
Please spare me.

235
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:47,176
I'll pay for Chu Xia's part, too.

236
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,316
You're not the only one with money.

237
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,620
I'll pay for both of them.

238
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:51,516
Deal.

239
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,666
From now on

240
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,436
you will treat me to lunch every day.

241
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,026
For one whole month.

242
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:57,310
You'll get fat.

243
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,166
Huh?

244
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,600
Hey, what's going on?

245
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,186
Hey, what's happening?

246
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:06,256
-It's so dark!
-There's no power.

247
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,540
-Let's go take a look downstairs.
-What's going on?

248
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,240
What's going on?

249
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:11,820
Let's go look downstairs.

250
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,150
Let's go.

251
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,526
It's so dark.

252
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:28,840
Be careful, Chu Xia.

253
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,820
Why is it so dark?

254
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:39,666
What's going on?

255
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,660
Young Master. The switch tripped again.

256
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:45,150
The power in the house has been unstable
for a while.

257
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:47,950
That scared me.

258
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:50,780
I thought it was a ghost.

259
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:54,930
Let's go.

260
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:58,460
Why is everyone gone?

261
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,416
Eh?

262
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,466
Where's Qi Lu?

263
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,550
Where is he?

264
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:05,686
The guests have all left.

265
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:06,950
Hey, Wang Jian Ren.

266
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,110
Do you know where Qi Lu went?

267
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,356
Qi Lu?

268
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,636
Qi Lu got really drunk.

269
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,970
I think Xiang Man Kui took him away.

270
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,270
I'm off!

271
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,840
Little Kui must have sent him home.

272
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,140
Chu Xia.

273
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,720
Let me take you home.

274
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:22,806
No need.

275
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:23,706
You should take Xiao Nan home.

276
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:24,850
I'll take care of Chu Xia.

277
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,096
Hey,

278
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,020
food.

279
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:30,480
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

280
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:32,076
Young Master Ling,

281
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,126
how about you drive me?

282
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,730
In exchange for one month of my
food fee.

283
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:36,860
Let's go.

284
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,040
Bye bye.

285
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,500
Chu Xia. Let's go.

286
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:45,000
Let's go.

287
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,340
Where are you going?

288
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,260
I'm scared I'll regret this.

289
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,280
Chu Xia.

290
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,910
Chu Xia.

291
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,220
Chu Xia.

292
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:11,200
Chu Xia.

293
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:31,400
Where's Han Qi Lu?

294
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,000
Chu Xia!

295
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,730
Chu Xia.

296
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:39,136
Chu Xia.

297
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,060
Han Qi Lu!

298
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,700
Han Qi Lu, wake up!

299
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,560
Chu Xia...

300
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:54,940
He is so drunk and it's the middle
of the night, why come pick him up?

301
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,420
He can just stay here,
don't go to all the trouble!

302
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:02,040
Han Qi Lu has his own home.

303
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,440
Chu Xia, let's go.

304
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,610
Chu Xia...

305
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:32,150
Chu Xia...

306
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:33,950
Chu Xia.

307
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:35,360
Chu Xia...

308
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:37,580
I know you like Han Qi Lu.

309
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,940
But it doesn't matter.

310
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,830
I will always protect you.

311
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,620
No matter what,

312
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,216
I don't want you to be

313
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,060
as unhappy as today.

314
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,840
Take care of him.

315
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:00,370
Jiang Chen Chuan.

316
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,580
Thank you.

317
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,800
Goodnight.

318
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,960
Water...

319
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,340
Water...

320
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,070
Give me water.

321
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:18,600
Water...

322
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,150
Xiao Hua.

323
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,200
Xiao Hua?

324
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:29,390
Is it you, Xiao Hua?

325
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:56,400
So...

326
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,720
it's you.

327
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:08,816
The poached eggs are burnt.

328
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:09,876
Eat the bread.

329
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,340
I'll eat the poached eggs.

330
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,310
Let me, let me.

331
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:28,640
Are you alright?

332
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:30,156
I'm fine.

333
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,080
Dig in.

334
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,630
How can I eat

335
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:35,226
with you staring at me like that?

336
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:36,066
Tell me,

337
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:37,886
did you poison the milk

338
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:39,210
or did you fart into the bread?

339
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:41,736
Hey.

340
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,760
Why think me so evil?

341
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,016
Dig in.

342
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,334
When you're done we can go to school.

343
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:00,780
An Chu Xia.

344
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,476
Don't think that just because
your attitude is a bit better now

345
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:06,850
it will make me forget how you stay out
all night that day.

346
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:09,326
From now on, if you are not
within my range of sight,

347
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:11,060
you'll report back to me at all times.

348
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:13,790
And respect the three big rules:

349
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,816
Firstly,

350
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,766
you can drink with other guys

351
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:18,420
but you mustn't get drunk.

352
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:19,690
Secondly,

353
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:21,686
you can talk to other guys,

354
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:23,370
but you mustn't have heart-to-heart talks.

355
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,540
Thirdly,

356
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:26,586
You can spend the night with other guys,

357
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:28,166
but you can't go too far.

358
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:28,906
Got it?

359
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:29,676
Got it.

360
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,180
You are right in everything.

361
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,340
You don't have a fever.

362
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,570
You don't get it.

363
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:42,190
I'm full. I'm going to school.

364
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,480
Something isn't right.

365
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,260
An Chu Xia.

366
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:02,390
Huh?

367
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:05,876
Did I do something or
say something yesterday?

368
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,800
No.

369
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:11,090
Even though I did get so drunk
I blacked out,

370
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:13,160
but I still remember what happened
during the day.

371
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,636
I remember us fighting,

372
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,960
you yelled at me.

373
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:21,250
And you told me not to touch you.

374
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:22,186
Right?

375
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:23,196
No.

376
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,300
Touch me. Come, come.

377
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,726
Come, come, come, touch me.

378
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:28,690
Stop it, don't touch me.

379
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:35,270
What are you reading? Is it that funny?

380
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,780
An Chu Xia.

381
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:41,236
What's the matter with you?

382
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,470
You're laughing at an English book.

383
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,146
I

384
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:47,220
Found out a secret.

385
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,550
What?

386
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,880
Han Qi Lu is that mystery person
from that wall?

387
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:00,776
Surprised, right?

388
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:01,927
I found it very surprising, too.

389
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,680
Actually, Han Qi Lu

390
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:07,126
likes to act cool,

391
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:09,500
but he is quite the nice guy inside.

392
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:12,190
Nice guy?

393
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:13,870
Han Qi Lu?

394
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,006
Even if he is that mystery guy,

395
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:20,610
it doesn't mean that he is over
Xiang Man Kui.

396
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,420
How is it?

397
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,840
We were cooperating perfectly,
didn't we?

398
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,566
Hm? Xin Wei, where are you going?

399
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:41,050
I'm going to the restroom.

400
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,176
Eh?

401
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,250
What's going on?

402
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,186
I finally understand it now.

403
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:59,656
Me and Han Qi Lu can never be.

404
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:02,576
You and An Chu Xia, one is the ex,
one is the new flame.

405
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,420
There is no place for me.

406
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:08,366
I have only one goal now.

407
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:09,996
Which is to get rid of An Chu Xia

408
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,330
and win the design competition.

409
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,120
I understand.

410
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:18,650
What's the matter?

411
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,570
Yesterday, with Qi Lu...

412
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,500
It's fine.

413
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,060
Prepare yourself for the competition.

414
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,240
An Chu Xia isn't your only competition.

415
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:31,376
If there's nothing else,

416
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,380
I'm leaving.

417
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,860
Let's see how long you can
put up this act for.
