00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:15,150
We're having a gardening class

2
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,510
in the headquarter of
Stiland College today.

3
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:20,100
You guys were born in rich family.

4
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,120
That's why you need to feel and appreciate

5
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,530
the hard work and fun in the labor.

6
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:26,670
Let's start.

7
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:34,730
Why are you wearing such a short skirt?

8
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:38,020
Of course it's for my Master Ling.

9
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:40,350
Your skirt is short too.

10
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,780
Gosh, you're wearing pants.

11
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:45,020
Are you wearing pants?

12
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:46,460
Cut it out.

13
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,860
Help me.

14
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:53,920
Come on.

15
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,920
What are they laughing about?

16
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:02,550
How would I know?

17
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,250
It's actually my question too.

18
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,340
You are a mysophobe.

19
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:11,630
I can't believe you
joined the gardening.

20
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:13,880
Is this even a subject?

21
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,760
I am here for a quick survey

22
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,300
of the life of ordinary people.

23
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:24,380
Like an Emperor did surveys
outside the palace, right?

24
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,070
So cute.

25
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:38,940
When were you blind?

26
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:41,690
I'll tell you what.

27
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:46,340
You're going to lose if you
keep going against her.

28
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:49,450
We'll see.

29
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,640
Shit.

30
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,800
Bullshit.

31
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,440
I can't do it.

32
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,860
-It's too hot.
-It's hot.

33
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:07,010
-We can't do this.
-I can't do it.

34
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:10,550
I'll buy all the lands here
if I get profit from the stock.

35
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:14,420
Frankly, my dad will be heartbroken
if he knows that I'm doing this here.

36
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:17,710
If my dad knows it,
he will fire the principal.

37
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,420
-Lower your voice.
-I've never done it since I was a kid.

38
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,680
Jian Ren, stop.

39
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:25,780
Senior.

40
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,990
Do you know what you're moving?

41
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:32,240
-Cabbages.
-Cabbages.

42
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:36,120
What's its meaning?

43
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:41,920
I'm shallow, I don't know much about it.

44
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,360
A cabbage

45
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:44,930
means fortune.

46
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:49,160
It means collecting money
and making money.

47
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:54,050
I moved the cabbages
for a whole day today.

48
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:56,740
Does it mean I'm going to have
a good fortune today?

49
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,660
Good fortune?

50
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,260
Interesting.

51
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,870
-I'm off.
-Alright, let's go together.

52
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:09,100
Let's go.

53
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:14,590
Hurry!

54
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:22,040
Chu Xia.

55
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,060
Get off.

56
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:30,240
An Chu Xia, what are you doing?
What will you do if I say no?

57
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:34,280
-I'll beat you till you come down!
-It's alright, carry on.

58
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,550
You're crazy! It's not worth it.

59
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:41,660
They're avoiding you because of the
taboos, you don't have to help him.

60
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:44,680
He's our friend, we fought
together at the stall.

61
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,320
I'm pissed off.

62
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:50,860
An Chu Xia.

63
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:54,510
Did anyone tell you the consequences
of hitting someone at school?

64
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,450
If there is a consequence,

65
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:00,170
Gao Gan should have been
punished long time ago.

66
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:03,170
Cut it out and get lost.

67
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:04,950
I have nothing to do with Han Qi Lu.

68
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:08,140
I thought you were his maid.

69
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:09,720
An Chu Xia.

70
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:12,870
Do you really think a maid
can be the master of Class B?

71
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:16,410
You're just a dog of Han's family.

72
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:21,830
Even if your master brings you out
for a walk, you are still a dog.

73
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:24,860
Wang Jian Ren, be brave and knock him down,
I'll take the responsibility.

74
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,350
How can you afford
to take the responsibility?

75
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,890
Jian Ren, look at him.

76
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:33,340
You hit two men last time. Don't be afraid.

77
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:36,730
Just leave me alone.
You go first, I'm fine.

78
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:38,740
Go?

79
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:41,450
I'll turn you into someone like him

80
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:43,750
and be my servant.

81
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,340
Don't you move, I'm coming to you now.

82
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:48,380
Wait.

[Episode 6]

85
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,860
I thought you were great.

86
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:55,370
-What a useless guy!
-How are you?

87
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,400
Quickly shout!

88
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,130
-She is hitting someone!
-Help!

89
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:03,780
-She is hitting someone!
-Principal! Help!

90
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:06,250
She's bullying!

91
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,360
Mr. You Tian, An Chu Xia hit someone.

92
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,410
-What's going on?
-I didn't hit with much force, don't pretend!

93
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:14,360
Mr. You Tian, An Chu Xia hit someone.

94
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:17,780
Who did it?

95
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:23,680
You again, huh?

96
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,630
You hit the teacher in the training,
and now you're hitting the student.

97
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,480
You are incorrigible.

98
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:32,890
I'm going to deal it seriously.

99
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:35,900
No, Gao Gan provoked her first.

100
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:36,900
Is it?

101
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:40,450
-Yes, I can prove it.
-Wang Jian Ren, it's all your fault!

102
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,670
Han Qi Lu.

103
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,060
Your family sent her to our school.

104
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:50,570
I'll leave it to you.

105
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:52,680
I didn't do anything wrong

106
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,690
You can punish me as you want.

107
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,660
Chu Xia, make an apology.

108
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:00,610
Okay, punish her as appropriate.

109
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:01,820
Let's go.

110
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,460
I want you to plant

111
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:09,240
all the seedlings alone before dark.

112
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:12,780
Otherwise, you will be expelled.

113
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,540
Chu Xia.

114
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,560
Damn it.

115
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:56,400
It's all your fault. It's so hot,
how can Chu Xia stand it?

116
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,040
You can't blame Jian Ren alone,
we didn't help her either.

117
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,260
Let me help her.

118
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:02,900
Don't mess with it.

119
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,720
Let me help you.

120
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,470
Wipe your sweat.

121
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:20,280
Put it on my neck.

122
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:24,060
I just went to the infirmary.
Gao Gan didn't faint.

123
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,230
He pretended.
You may pretend to be dizzy.

124
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,620
Pretend to be dizzy.

125
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,460
Principal, Chu Xia's dizzy!

126
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,140
Well, don't...

127
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,950
Principal, I'm fine, I can go on.

128
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,640
So stubborn.

129
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,700
Go away.

130
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:06,390
Don't have to be hard on yourself.
You may beg me now.

131
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:10,120
You should understand, I can
do everything in the school

132
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,170
as long as I want.

133
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:14,030
So,

134
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,020
beg me.

135
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,540
Excuse me.

136
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:45,460
-Hurry!
-Hurry!

137
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:46,740
Chu Xia!

138
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,480
Chu Xia!

139
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:51,520
-Send her to the infirmary!
-Okay.

140
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:08,470
-Hurry!
-Hurry!

What are you looking at?

142
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,300
The bell is ringing.
Go back to your class.

143
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:34,280
Shall I get the principal
to bring you to the class?

144
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,940
-Ms. Maria.
-Ms. Maria.

145
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:39,940
Ms. Maria.

146
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:45,020
The students are getting worse
without Ma Jian Guo here.

147
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,510
Chu Xia, you're finally awake.

148
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:26,370
Why didn't you fall down earlier?

149
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:29,640
Then, you won't have to suffer so much.

150
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:33,930
You are so stubborn.
This is a school, not a guillotine.

151
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:37,640
You wanted to be
a righteous heroine, huh?

152
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,660
Thank you, Ms. Maria.

153
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,630
Are you feeling better?

154
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,390
No big deal, I'm still alive.

155
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:56,000
Han Qi Lu must be very happy.

156
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,380
So weird.

157
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,410
He didn't gloat.

158
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,990
If it wasn't for him,

159
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,390
you'll be suffering.

160
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,270
I have something to do, see you.

161
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:08,890
Okay.

162
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:12,860
He let you be punished

163
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:16,020
just to make Gao's family shut up.

164
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:19,700
Otherwise, both families and school

165
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,480
can't make peace.

166
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,810
How could he be so good?

167
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:27,240
He wanted me to beg him

168
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,670
as he wanted to insult me.

169
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:35,920
He didn't want to see you suffer.

170
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:41,270
That's why he carried
everything on himself.

171
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,730
The Master Devil turned into a nice guy

172
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:48,550
and started to help people.

173
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,330
Is there any motive?

174
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,580
Why are you sneaking around?

175
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:19,300
You peek like immature
students in adolescence.

176
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:23,100
I didn't come for you.

177
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:25,760
Who cares?

178
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:31,200
Actually, I'm here to see you.

179
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,290
You are so busy and don't even have time

180
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:38,740
to visit your student who was injured.
But you come to me, huh?

181
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:40,680
Shame on you.

182
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:43,620
Don't be angry.

183
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,710
Is Chu Xia okay?

184
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:51,120
I am able to save her life

185
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,620
even if she's dying.

186
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:57,080
I knew you're a learned doctor.
It's a waste for you to work here.

187
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:00,630
No, I knew my skill very well.

188
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:02,980
I can only heal a headache, fever

189
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,880
and menstruation issue.

190
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:07,970
The key reason is my beauty.

191
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:11,370
You're beautiful.
You said everything right.

192
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:15,100
But she's quite stubborn.

193
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:18,170
It's good to let her suffer
and learn from the lesson.

194
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,700
Otherwise, she will think

195
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:24,530
she can stand in the society
with a righteous heart.

196
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,910
Actually, it's my fault.

197
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:29,990
I didn't protect them.

198
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:33,290
Don't take it on yourself.

199
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:35,881
I'm not afraid of your
sense of responsibility,

200
00:14:35,906 --> 00:14:37,524
but you have a strong empathy.

201
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:42,300
You get paid as a teacher,
but caring for students as a father.

202
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:46,800
So I am looking for a real savior.

203
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,720
Straight to the point.

204
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:56,170
Can you let Chu Xia
work here after school?

205
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,180
You want me to protect her.

206
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,160
I didn't owe you a favour, did I?

207
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,030
Do you agree?

208
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:05,540
Depends on your performance.

209
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:26,710
My dear classmates.

210
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:28,860
I'm resurrected with blood.

211
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,740
Look! I'm fully recovered.

212
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,400
Chu Xia, thank you.

213
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,780
Sorry as I can't afford
to offend Gao's family.

214
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,020
Don't hate me.

215
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:23,380
Let's stop talking after this.

216
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:26,480
Gao Gan was here just now.
He did it all.

217
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,520
You'd better watch out.

218
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:07,210
Let's share a book
before we get the new book.

219
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:09,240
I bought your favorite snack.

220
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:13,220
Sit down.

221
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:24,870
Do you know what class we're
going to take? I guess this class.

222
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:28,020
But I didn't do revision.

223
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:30,790
I don't want to study. Let's eat.

224
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,400
Come on.

225
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,480
It's delicious.

226
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:42,340
Come on.

227
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,920
It's delicious.

228
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:48,860
If you don't eat,
I'll eat up your snacks.

229
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:51,980
I'll finish it.

230
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,370
Come on.

231
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:01,790
Class, there's a famous tea
ceremony teacher who will give us

232
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,220
a tea ceremony lesson today.

233
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,950
Make sure you learn

234
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,010
the traditional Chinese tea ceremony.

235
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:09,990
Alright?

236
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:16,060
I hope you learn the traditional

237
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:19,410
tea ceremony in Chinese culture.

238
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:20,360
First of all,

239
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,170
the cup positioning.

240
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,300
Excuse me.

241
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:26,950
Come in.

242
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:37,720
Does my new dress look good?

243
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:43,220
It is same as the one
you sewed for me that day.

244
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,980
It's easy to be exposed.

245
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:46,720
You are annoying!

246
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:08,820
Sir.

247
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:13,300
About the bottle.

248
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,500
No, the vase.

249
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,600
I'll return it.

250
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,190
I'll pay for it.

251
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:20,470
What?

252
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:24,300
The blue and white porcelain.

253
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,580
Of course you have to pay.

254
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:29,160
Else I'll have to pay for it myself.

255
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,570
I figured it out. That's the amount.

256
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,090
30,000 yuan?

257
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,760
300,000 yuan?

258
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,040
Okay.

259
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,380
Give me three years.

260
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,960
Give me 30 years.

261
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,280
I'll give it back to you.

262
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,610
30 yuan.

263
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:06,120
30 yuan?

264
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:13,290
That's a fake one.

265
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:18,780
You should learn hard. Or else you
don't even know whether it is real or fake.

266
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:22,850
Fake?

267
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:25,840
It looked like a real one.

268
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:29,300
Of course,

269
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:32,850
I could even get a fake meteorite.

270
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:36,120
This is so easy for me.

271
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,240
It freaked me out.

272
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,120
Chu Xia.

273
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,100
What makes you so happy?

274
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:04,030
Qi Lu, this is new tea from Kyoto this spring.

275
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:04,900
Taste it.

276
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,970
And I made sushi by myself.
