1
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:36,730
Class.

2
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:40,210
The time is running out and
we have less than half a month.

3
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:42,470
Are you ready for the battle?

4
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:49,340
We're going to go for it together.

5
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,280
Believe in yourself.

6
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,910
It's about the honor of our Class B.

7
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,340
But,

8
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,900
you know our basic level.

9
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,970
We can't make it even if we work harder.

10
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,690
That's right.

11
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:04,690
Don't force us.

12
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:07,700
Moreover, we didn't
mean to bet with Mr. Ma.

13
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:11,660
What do you mean?

14
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:14,530
Chu Xia bets for your sake.

15
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:17,380
But it depends on our ability.

16
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:19,060
We can't make it.

17
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:21,660
-Yeah.
-I know.

18
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,270
It's hard to get
the first place in China.

19
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,530
But we're already there.

20
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:28,560
We have to go for it.

21
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,930
I believe in you.

22
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:31,790
You have to believe in yourself too.

23
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:33,750
Are you confident?

24
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:36,070
No.

[Episode 18]

27
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:38,000
My dear Chu Xia.

28
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,280
Why didn't Young Master Han pick you up today?

29
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,690
Uncle Han sent Han Qi Lu
to an astronomical exhibition.

30
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,790
I'm not interested.

31
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,830
Originally, Sis Yuan Yuan said...

32
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,680
I mean Han Qi Lu's mom said she'd
send another car to pick me up.

33
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,820
But I rejected it.

34
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,550
I think it's good to have a walk.

35
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,030
Chu Xia.

36
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:03,290
Cheer up, don't be sad.

37
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,450
Don't worry.

38
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:05,770
We'll work harder.

39
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:07,110
Go for it!

40
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,010
When I looked at them,

41
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:12,320
I really didn't know

42
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,130
how to coax them.

43
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:16,370
Don't put too much pressure on yourself.

44
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:19,330
After all, they're spoilt.

45
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:21,260
They just couldn't get used to it.

46
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,880
Feng Shao.

47
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:26,860
Chu Xia.

48
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:30,450
Didn't you see me?
What's wrong with you?

49
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,850
Where are you going?

50
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,470
I just go for a ride.

51
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,690
Go for a ride?

52
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:37,820
Don't bluff. Are you going
to play computer games?

53
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:40,890
Yes, I'm going to play games.

54
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:42,490
Want to join?

55
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:44,550
Let's go together.

56
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:46,350
I'll pass, I'm not in the mood.

57
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,190
What's wrong with you?

58
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:50,780
She's in a bad mood.
Not in a good shape.

59
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:51,910
Bad mood?

60
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:56,930
-Let's go together.
-Let's go.

61
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:59,610
Let's go.

62
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:30,100
What's wrong?

63
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,050
You seem in deep hatred.

64
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,550
Anyone bullied you?

65
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:35,670
Mind your own business.

66
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:37,620
My business?

67
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,450
-What's that?
-Forget it, I don't want to talk.

68
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,250
Were you tortured by Han's family?

69
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:46,690
I read the magazine yesterday.

70
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:50,500
It was about the tragic life
of an adopted daughter...

71
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,810
It's not about them.

72
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:55,520
It's about my classmates.

73
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:59,390
I really don't know how
to let them study hard with me.

74
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:02,200
Here you are.

75
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:06,610
You're looking for trouble.

76
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,050
Sometimes you should use force.

77
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:14,650
There's only one rule in our world.

78
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:17,320
Try to persuade them, if they are
not convinced, beat them up.

79
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,710
Show them the majesty
of the head of the Huo Ni Hall.

80
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:21,030
No big deal!

81
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:23,060
Let's play.

82
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,990
I'm just getting started, just a minute.

83
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:22,450
Catch the thief!
He snatched my mobile phone!

84
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:08,150
Stop!

85
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,150
Don't run!

86
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,960
How dare you steal?

87
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:23,830
Stop!

88
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:33,970
Run if you can.

89
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:39,730
Give it to me.

90
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:41,730
Go easy!

91
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:44,360
Don't move.

92
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:48,420
You'd better watch out!

93
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,060
Do you want your mobile phone?

94
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,480
Hey.

95
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,250
How dare you bully
my friend in my territory?

96
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,930
Don't you know who I am?

97
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:04,280
Xiao Nan, are you okay?

98
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,450
Go to hell!

99
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,990
Chu Xia.

100
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:13,310
Dear sir.

101
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,140
Does it hurt?

102
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,630
I'll rub it for you.

103
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:24,670
From Stiland College?

104
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:29,190
I'm An Chu Xia from Class B,
Stiland College.

105
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,730
I didn't think there's a fool
like you at Stiland College.

106
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:34,440
I brought your friend's phone back.

107
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:36,460
Don't beat people without asking!

108
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,750
It hurts.

109
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:40,260
What a fat leg!

110
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,390
Hey.

111
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,990
Are you okay?

112
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:47,670
-It's fine.
-Where have you two been?

113
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,480
You two have gone
when I looked back.

114
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,920
-Then I tried to find you...
-Beat him up!

115
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,360
-Who's he?
-Beat him up!

116
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:55,410
He said I had a fat leg!

117
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,650
Fat leg?

118
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:59,060
It's okay. My mom is looking for

119
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:02,650
a woman who has a fat leg
to give birth to a baby for me.

120
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:17,910
Look at there. I heard
he came back from America.

121
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:21,580
He could go to Class A,
but eventually, he came to Class B.

122
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,910
How he looks like?

123
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,100
I don't know.

124
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:28,810
Once you've seen your Mr. Right,

125
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:31,180
you will never be
impressed by anyone else.

126
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:35,330
My heart has gone with
the man in game hall.

127
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:38,820
That's great, one less competitor.

128
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:42,040
You like the new one and
leave the old one, huh?

129
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,640
From now on, I don't want

130
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,220
to see anything that has nothing
to do with learning in the class.

131
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:08,450
Did you hear that?

132
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,750
I can't hear you.

133
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:13,740
I'll ask you again.

134
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,970
Did you hear that?

135
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:17,170
Yes...

136
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:19,450
Very good.

137
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:22,490
Take out the papers of the morning exam.

138
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,060
Let me explain one by one.

139
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:28,930
If anyone of you doesn't
understand after my explanation,

140
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:32,130
you can ask me after
I've finished all the questions.

141
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:35,810
If you still can't do it
in tomorrow's retest,

142
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,050
I'm sorry to inform you

143
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,900
that you have to run for 5 laps
for each wrong answer.

144
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,470
5 laps?

145
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:44,570
How could it be?

146
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:46,650
Did I hear wrongly?

147
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:48,660
I can't run...

148
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:52,330
How many laps shall I run
if I can't answer all the questions?

149
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:57,730
5 laps? Impossible.

150
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:00,190
Be quiet!

151
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,920
Be quiet!

152
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,340
It's too noisy. How do I sleep?

153
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:07,700
I should have gone to another class.

154
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,880
It's you?

155
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,790
You're forcing them to do
something beyond their ability.

156
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,480
It's a waste of effort.

157
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,010
They can't make it.

158
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,270
Even if you try harder,
they still can't make it.

159
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:33,300
I can't do any of these questions.

160
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,130
How?

161
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:35,540
Shall I run now?

162
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,060
Are you a class teacher
or a teacher of PE?

163
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,130
Moreover,

164
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:41,890
everything has its bottom in this world.

165
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,410
Sorry.

166
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:46,140
That's me.

167
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:48,280
Since you're willing to be the bottom,

168
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,910
I can only look down on you.

169
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,600
What did you say?

170
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:54,860
It doesn't matter what I say.
The next is important.

171
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:58,160
Now that you're in Class B,
you have to follow our rules.

172
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,220
If you want to challenge the rules,

173
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,870
show us your ability.

174
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:05,720
You managed to hit me at the game
hall that day because I was careless.

175
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:11,290
-You'll still lose if I hit you again.
-Stop!

176
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:12,980
You want to hit me again?

177
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,890
We're talking about that culture.
Don't use fists.

178
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,240
Go back to your place.

179
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,970
Alright, what do you want?

180
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:29,230
Why did you bring such thick
extracurricular books to school?

181
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,680
Because the table isn't high
enough and I have a bad neck.

182
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,850
But,

183
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,880
this is not the point.

184
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,360
You have to be a model for us.

185
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,500
As long as you can finish
the two books in a day,

186
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,740
we'll believe in you.

187
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:51,260
And we'll work hard

188
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:53,430
and study hard.

189
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:59,960
"Investiture of the Gods".
"A Short History of America".

190
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:03,510
How?

191
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:05,490
Forget it if you can't make it.

192
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:07,640
Stop using so-called
chicken soup to force them

193
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,280
to do something beyond their ability.

194
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:11,710
Don't be too noisy.

195
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,120
You were disturbing me from sleeping.

196
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,730
Who says I can't finish it? Deal!

197
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:20,420
You'll know it after a day.

198
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:28,790
I just want to sleep, I'm fine
if you really want to do it

199
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:52,890
What's that?

200
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,510
A storytelling?

201
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:57,000
"Investiture of the Gods"?

202
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,590
No, she has "A Short History of America"
in her hand.

203
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:19,330
Listen to "Investiture of the Gods"
while reading "A Short History of America"?

204
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,520
Is she a schizophrenic?

205
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,990
Han Qi Lu!

206
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:27,820
Wait.

207
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,420
Why do I run?

208
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:31,260
This is my home.

209
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,990
I can go anywhere as I want to.

210
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:36,740
An Chu Xia.

211
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,810
Please don't call the owner's name.
You should call me Young Master Han.

212
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,920
Young Master Han, please leave.

213
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,080
Why are you so rude...

214
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:48,930
I have something important tonight.

215
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,290
I bet with someone.

216
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:52,000
If I can't finish it tonight,

217
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,630
I'll lose to him.

218
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:54,930
If I lose to him,

219
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:58,100
I can't ask class B
to study hard with me.

220
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,370
If Class B can't study hard with me,

221
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:02,450
they can't get the first place in China.

222
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:04,170
If they can't get the first place,

223
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:07,730
Ma Jian Guo will kick me out.
If he kicks me out...

224
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:09,980
Alright.

225
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:12,030
That's what you wish, right?

226
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,330
Take your time.

227
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:16,550
Thank you.

228
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,970
I've finished reading the two books.

229
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:03,070
Let's start then.

230
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:05,470
Go ahead.

231
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,780
When was the USA War of Independence?

232
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,180
From year 1775 to year 1783.

233
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,350
When was the Independence Day in USA?

234
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,570
4 July.

235
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:20,530
Brief us on the The Boston Tea Party.

236
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:23,810
Who? Where? When? What? How?

237
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:27,540
The Boston Tea Party which happened
on December 16, 1773 was

238
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:31,870
a political and mercantile protest
by the Sons of Liberty in Boston.

239
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:35,600
The demonstrators disguised as
American Indians to sneak into the ship

240
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,860
and threw an entire ship of tea sent by
East India Company into Boston Harbor

241
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:44,210
to against the Tea Act, which had been
passed by the British Parliament in 1773.

242
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:49,430
After the incident, the Parliament
responded in 1774 with the Coercive Acts,

243
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:52,840
also known as the Intolerable Acts.

244
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,480
Do I need to continue it?

245
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:58,370
Give it to me.

246
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:04,680
What's about Chapter 10
of "Investiture of the Gods",?

247
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:07,040
Lei Zhen Zi was adopted by
Ji Chang at Mount Swallow.

248
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:08,980
Wow!

249
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,450
A man who became an Emperor and

250
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:14,650
lived in the world for 800 years.

251
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:16,710
Who was mentioned in the poem?
What happened?

252
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:20,880
It's about Jiang Zi Ya went downhill.

253
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,760
Give it to me.

254
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,330
On which mountain Nezha showed up?

255
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:28,770
All the residents nearby

256
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:30,640
went there to worship him.

257
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,770
And the queue is continuous.

258
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:35,330
This...

259
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:36,930
I know that you can't answer it.

260
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,560
Cuiping Moutain.

261
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:46,810
How did you do that?

262
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:51,320
I listened to a book while
reading a book last night.

263
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,490
That's it.

264
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:58,410
Chu Xia.

265
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:02,530
I'm going to look up to you from now on.

266
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:05,220
No need.

267
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,970
I just hope you stick to the agreement

268
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:09,350
and work hard together

269
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:12,770
to fight for our dignity.

270
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:19,865
Go for it!

271
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,254
Go for it!

272
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:25,540
-Go for it!
-Go for it!

273
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:32,470
Dear God of Exam!

274
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:35,220
Where are you?

275
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,850
East or West?

276
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:38,940
Or South?

277
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:42,340
How to do this? I can't make it.

278
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,900
I don't ask for 100 marks,
but zero mistakes.

279
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,550
I beg the God of Wind.

280
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:53,820
Please give me the power!

281
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:05,830
God of Exam! Help me.

282
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:07,570
I'll send you to the heaven!

283
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:11,660
If you don't study hard,
no fairy can help you.

284
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:24,850
-Get back to the class room.
-Do you want to try it?

285
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:26,750
Get back to the class room!
