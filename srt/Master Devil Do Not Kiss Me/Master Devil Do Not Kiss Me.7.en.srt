1
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:17,100
Qi Lu, let's taste Kyoto's
new tea from this spring.

2
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:19,670
And I the sushi by myself.

3
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:41,180
Xin Wei.

4
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,850
Do you know where he was looking at?

5
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,290
I don't want to know.

6
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:56,050
Chu Xia, slowly.

7
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,330
Are you making tea or washing a pot?

8
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,240
Master Ling, please taste my tea.

9
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:26,650
It sucks. How could you give it to him?

10
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,810
Han Qi Lu, are you picking a fight?

11
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,900
Cultivation of temper
is important in preparing tea.

12
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:37,590
You're so grumpy.

13
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,140
No wonder your tea sucks.

14
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,410
It's terrible.

15
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:57,150
Let's start.

16
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:52,550
Chu Xia, what brings you here?

17
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,590
What are you doing?

18
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,930
Oh, I'm beating rats.

19
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:02,190
The rats bit and spoilt the paintings.

20
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:04,600
Have a seat.

21
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,890
It's alright.

22
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,770
Serve yourself.

23
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,750
What brings you here?

24
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,870
Did you cause trouble again?

25
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:16,310
Sir, look at this.

26
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,750
What's that?

27
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,640
I bought you a new vase.

28
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,980
It is more than 30 yuan.

29
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,540
It cost me 50 yuan.

30
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,420
It's too expensive.

31
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,280
Mr. You Tian.

32
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:35,780
-You painted all these paintings?
-Yeah.

33
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:41,200
I think you should be a real artist

34
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:44,860
instead of being an ordinary teacher.

35
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:48,980
Artists have to make a living too.

36
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:49,810
No choice.

37
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,450
That was my dream.

38
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:57,840
But there's also the realistic and
hungry life of mine.

39
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,310
Chu Xia.

40
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,030
What's your dream?

41
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:04,490
My dream is to be like my parents.

42
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:06,380
To be a real designer.

43
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:09,440
My dear great designer to be,

44
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:11,950
look at the paintings here.

45
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,800
Which one can attract you?

46
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:22,260
The little sun, I love this the most.

47
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,730
The sun represents hope and endeavour.

48
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:29,260
Just like you. No matter
how dark it is before dawn,

49
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,590
as soon as the time comes,

50
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:32,200
you will break it through.

51
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:33,300
Sir.

52
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:36,230
I'm sure you'll break it
through too. Believe me.

53
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:37,290
Really?

54
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:39,900
Hope so.

55
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,410
You like it?

56
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:54,680
Take it.

57
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,560
-Really?
-I'll give it to you.

58
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,260
Thank you.

59
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,930
But you have to take good care of it.

60
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:08,120
It took me a lot
of effort to get it done.

61
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,580
Of course I'll take good care of it.

62
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,000
Then I'll leave.

63
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:14,120
All right, see you.

64
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:18,480
-You can go on with your cleaning.
-Alright.

65
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,610
Bye.

66
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,350
50 yuan?

67
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:47,670
I was supposed to use a vase of 50 yuan.

68
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:08,880
Bastard!

69
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,810
This is definitely not by Qi Lu.

70
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:14,340
I know, although Han Qi Lu is bad,

71
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,050
he's upright.

72
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:18,460
He won't play dirty tricks.

[Episode 7]

75
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:21,080
Boss, give me two bowls
of noodles, extra spicy.

76
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:21,970
Okay.

77
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:37,000
Thank you for saving me today.

78
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:40,100
You must be more careful later.

79
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,980
If I hadn't bumped into it,

80
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:44,430
-you'll...
-my head will get hurt.

81
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:51,610
Sometimes, I am wondering.

82
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:57,400
What would a girl go through

83
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,870
to be calm like you?

84
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,490
Everyone will be afraid.

85
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,830
It just...

86
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,520
What?

87
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,360
It just...

88
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,990
The answer is a little long.

89
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,790
Take your time then.

90
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,980
Here are the noodles.

91
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,540
Here you are.

92
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:24,100
-Thank you, boss.
-You are welcome.

93
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:27,820
Have you heard of it?

94
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,890
Asking people about their secrets

95
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:32,890
is like tearing their wounds open again.

96
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:37,420
Untreated wounds

97
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:40,340
will still get infected
even after healing.

98
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,070
I want to find the
infected wounds with you.

99
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:51,200
No, thanks. You'd better
save these cheesy words for yourself.

100
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,470
Han Yu.

101
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:59,970
Why are you so nice to me?

102
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:08,350
Chu Xia.

103
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:13,620
One day,I'll get used to it and eat it up.

104
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:22,680
Actually, we met on the day
your mother had an accident.

105
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,580
How come Chu Xia
didn't come back with you?

106
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:40,240
How do I know?

107
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:47,330
It's dangerous for a girl
to stay outside alone.

108
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:53,510
Maybe she hangs out with her friend.
Nothing to be worried.

109
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:59,870
It's your attitude that makes
Chu Xia wants to move out.

110
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,140
What?

111
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:06,690
Put down the rice and wait
for her at the door now.

112
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:07,510
No way.

113
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,120
-Are you sure?
-I'm not going.

114
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:13,550
Han! I heard he bought a new
astronomical magnifying glass.

115
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:14,920
Jiang Yuan Yuan!

116
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,290
What?

117
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,600
Your name is

118
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,840
elegant, graceful and nice.

119
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:26,970
Madam, what do you want to do
with the magnifying glass?

120
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:30,050
Just take care of it.

121
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,990
Okay, madam.

122
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:36,910
I'm going to wait for her.

123
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,280
An Chu Xia!

124
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,860
Are you coming back?

125
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,830
If you're not coming back,

126
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:51,250
give me a call!

127
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,140
Don't make me wait.

128
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:54,940
I tell you.

129
00:10:55,770 --> 00:11:00,590
If you come back, I must
punch your big round face!

130
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:05,660
It's much more comfortable after
pouring it out. Now just you wait.

131
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,220
Damn it!

132
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,550
Oops!

133
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:14,500
I'll lose face if I leave now.

134
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,730
What should I do now? They are coming.

135
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:26,140
Excuse me!

136
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:31,750
Maybe he has eaten too much.

137
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,620
Well, don't forget to

138
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:37,370
-buy me dinner next time.
-Alright.

139
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,650
-Bye.
-Bye.

140
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:45,070
Where have you guys been?

141
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:48,890
What are you doing here at this hour?

142
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:51,100
Not your concern, I will keep jogging.

143
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,420
-Something happened to Chu Xia today.
-Stop it!

144
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,590
My cloth is broken. It's expensive!

145
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:00,280
How dare they bully Chu Xia?

146
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:04,620
Han's family is the largest
shareholder of Stiland College .

147
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:07,580
How dare they bully my family?

148
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:09,970
Calm down.

149
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:14,450
How can I calm down?
They bullied my little Chu Xia.

150
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:16,370
Han.

151
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,600
Send five bodyguards tomorrow.

152
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:21,920
No, send ten.
Five men and five women.

153
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,010
Let the men serve as bodyguards.

154
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:28,530
And let the women serve like a besties.

155
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:31,080
Let them surround Chu Xia

156
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:34,300
to make the enemies retreat themselves.

157
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,770
I don't think it's enough.

158
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:39,310
You should hire a maid to accompany
her to study, a cook and so on.

159
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,000
It's perfect if you let
Han go along with them.

160
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:46,630
That's right, you think thoughtfully.

161
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:49,820
Han, do it as what we've said.

162
00:12:57,050 --> 00:13:00,980
Why did you suddenly
concern about Chu Xia today?

163
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,960
-Are you kidding me?
-I dare not.

164
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,800
Think about it.

165
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:09,340
Have you ever thought it would
cause unnecessary trouble

166
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,790
during the listing in
the company's operations

167
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:15,010
if you stir it up in the college?

168
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,510
-I'm not afraid.
-I know.

169
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:21,700
But what about dad?

170
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:25,790
People will say,
Mrs. Han is not sensible.

171
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:30,160
What should I do then?

172
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,390
I can't put up with this.

173
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:34,750
Leave it to me.

174
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:36,470
-You?
-You?

175
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,240
I have my own way.

176
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:43,280
So you can't threaten me with the
astronomical magnifying glass anymore.

177
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:47,460
It's a telescope, no common sense.

178
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:20,010
Master Han.

179
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:28,600
-Master Han.
-Master Han.

180
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:51,220
Ouch! My waist.

181
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:54,300
Han Qi Lu, why are
you coming in? Get out!

182
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:59,410
Han Qi Lu!
-Han Qi Lu!

183
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:05,700
Horrible boy crazy!

184
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,190
Asking for the autograph in the toilet?

185
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:09,700
If it weren't Han Qi Lu,

186
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,670
they would take him
as a pervert and beat him up.

187
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:13,920
Ouch! My waist.

188
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,900
Han Qi Lu! So handsome!

189
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,140
Don't go!

190
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,160
Why did Master Han
always follow you?

191
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:05,390
Are you two in love?

192
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:07,600
Do you think he'd like a maid?

193
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:12,000
So you're used to being a maid now, huh?

194
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,040
Go to hell!

195
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:18,880
I'm going to see the ending of the
"Flirting Master And His Maid" first.

196
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,790
What have you been reading recently?

197
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:24,790
-You'd better watch out.
-So what?

198
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:27,530
I'm a princess of love.

199
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:30,380
You'll become a princess
of fool if you keep reading it.

200
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:36,130
Haven't you heard of it? Senior
and junior are a perfect match.

201
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:40,340
To me, a maid is a good
match for a master.

202
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:44,460
Bullshit! I'd rather match with animals!

203
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,520
Who did you say?

204
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,610
Not your concern!

205
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,640
I'll tell you what.

206
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,120
Listen carefully!

207
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,110
An Chu Xia is my woman.

208
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:02,340
Those rumors are true.

209
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:06,210
I'll not spare you if anyone dares
to mess with her in the future.

210
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:15,180
Not bad.

211
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,840
Hit me and I'll kiss you again.

212
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:37,040
Master Han, are you
talking to everyone here?

213
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:39,980
No!

214
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:53,900
Han Qi Lu.

215
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,300
Bastard!

216
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:58,090
Damn it! You destroyed my reputation.

217
00:17:58,090 --> 00:17:59,980
Bastard!

218
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:04,840
Go to hell!

219
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,170
Han Qi Lu, go to hell!

220
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:28,190
Xiao Xue? What do you want to do?

221
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:29,690
Why?

222
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,870
Who are you?

223
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:37,570
-How could it be?
-What are you talking about?

224
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:42,830
-What makes you better than me?
-Calm down.

225
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:49,090
What if I scratch your face

226
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,430
with the knife?

227
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:55,590
Will he still say you're his woman?

228
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:58,360
You got it wrong. I have
nothing to do with Han Qi Lu.

229
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,810
So you put the blood on the table

230
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:04,200
and threw the flower pot from upstairs.

231
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:15,720
Yes, that's me! Han Qi Lu
can only like me alone!

232
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:27,440
Qi Lu, I didn't mean to hurt you.

233
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,810
I have never meant to hurt you.

234
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:31,380
It's all her fault!

235
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:34,510
None of her relatives and
friends have good ending.

236
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:37,030
Qi Lu, let me avenge your injury.

237
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:42,210
An Chu Xia, you are a devil!

238
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:45,150
Your mother, Mr. You Tian and

239
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:48,160
-Qi Lu were in trouble because of you.
-Shut up!

240
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:51,290
Why are you helping her?

241
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:52,680
What happened to Mr. You Tian?

242
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,690
Do you remember that broken vase?

243
00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:59,130
That's the principal's treasure.

244
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:02,570
You didn't know that
you caused him a trouble.

245
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:05,410
He knew you can't afford to pay it.

246
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,040
So he paid it with his money

247
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,530
which he saved for years
for his exhibition.

248
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:16,260
You spoilt a master of art

249
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,120
who came back from France.

250
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:21,310
You are a devil!

251
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:26,870
Stop it!

252
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:28,470
What do you want to do?

253
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:30,230
Qi Lu.

254
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,190
-What else do you want?
-What do you want?

255
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,400
What do you want?

256
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:37,720
Qi Lu.

257
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,220
Go to the hospital first.

258
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:43,480
Leave it to me.

259
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:50,500
Give me the knife.

260
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,960
An Chu Xia, you are a devil!

261
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,790
Let's go.

262
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:55,950
Qi Lu, I didn't mean it!

263
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:57,370
Qi Lu!
