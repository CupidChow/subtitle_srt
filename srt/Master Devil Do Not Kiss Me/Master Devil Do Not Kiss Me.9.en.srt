Friday, 2 to 5 p.m.

3
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,100
Welcome to the artist,
Mr. You Tian's art exhibition!

4
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:22,330
-Come on!
-Welcome to Mr. You Tian's exhibition!

5
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:25,940
Don't miss it! It has diverse
styles and rich themes!

6
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:27,900
Take a look!

7
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,480
Friday, 2 to 5 p.m! Don't miss it!

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,340
Welcome to the art exhibition!

9
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:41,470
Make sure you don't miss it!

10
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:44,670
Welcome to
Mr. You Tian's art exhibition!

11
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:45,740
Stop!

12
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:48,810
Don't shout like a ten-dollar shop!

13
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,470
Do it yourself then.

14
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,140
Alright, show me yours.

15
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:00,600
Mr. You Tian's art
exhibition is amazing.

16
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,980
It's a baptism of the heart.

17
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:07,380
It's a close-up feeling of art.

18
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,740
It can widen our knowledge, open our
eyes and cultivate our sentiment!

19
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,960
Please come to support him!

20
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:17,180
Mr. You Tian is the acting
class teacher of our class.

21
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:19,040
-This is our first big event.

22
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,730
-Let's take a look.
-Let's help.

23
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:23,670
-I'll help you.
-Come on!

24
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:26,750
Let's go.

25
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,210
Let me see.

26
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,050
I'll tell you what.

27
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,380
An Chu Xia, be smart.

28
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:53,300
The exhibition will be cancelled

29
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,940
if you offend me.

30
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:02,010
Relax. The exhibition will be
cancelled if you offend him.

31
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:16,420
I did pretend to faint that day.

32
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,360
Say something!
Didn't your mother teach you?

33
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:24,500
You have to respond
when someone talks to you.

34
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,450
How dare you stare at us?

35
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:31,010
I should have given
you a lesson that day.

36
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:31,960
Stop it!

37
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:35,860
What's going on?

38
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:40,640
Are you trying to ignore my words?

39
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:42,990
She's my woman.

40
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,940
Who are you to give her a lesson?

41

[Episode 9]

43
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:37,690
Little Chu Xia.

44
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:39,850
The bread will be ready in a minute.

45
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:42,960
Which one you prefer? A little monkey

46
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,600
or a duckling?

47
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:52,450
Little Chu Xia ignored me.

48
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,410
So boring.

49
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:03,950
Let me tell you a joke.

50
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,260
That's great.

51
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,890
You seldom bother to entertain me.

52
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:07,430
Say it.

53
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:09,690
The story goes like this.

54
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:14,550
Someone's going to hold an
exhibition for an unknown artist.

55
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:16,510
She will hold an auction too.

56
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,430
Think about it.

57
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:24,060
The unknown artist isn't influential.

58
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:26,730
How can he sell his paintings?

59
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:32,880
Do you think her idea is funny?

60
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,960
Don't say that to my little Chu Xia.

61
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:38,090
I didn't mention her.

62
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:42,490
Do you agree that
only she can do such a stupid thing?

63
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,380
Look at you.

64
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,660
What are you doing?

65
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:48,090
Little Chu Xia...

66
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:51,070
I don't mean that.

67
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,360
No matter what you do,

68
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,140
Mommy will always support you.

69
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:57,350
Even if other people can't make it,
I'm sure you can make it.

70
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,740
Because you have me.

71
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,820
Thank you, Sis Yuan Yuan.

72
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:03,860
Don't feel ashamed.

73
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:07,320
Tell me, which type of bread you prefer?

74
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,640
A duckling or monkey?

75
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,030
-I'll eat the both.
-That's great.

76
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:15,310
You'll be a potbelly.

77
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,160
Why are you here?

78
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:14,670
Can't I come?

79
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:21,560
Only Han usually knocks my door.

80
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,970
I'm a grateful person.

81
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:26,900
-I'm here to thank you.
-Thank me?

82
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:29,640
Or tease me?

83
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,300
Of course to thank you, I'm not blind.

84
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:36,250
I knew, you told Sis Yuan Yuan
about it in order to help me.

85
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,370
Help you?

86
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:41,070
Get over yourself.

87
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,150
No one helps you.

88
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:44,440
Anyway, I've thanked you.

89
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,520
Don't worry.

90
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,280
Once your dad comes back,
I'll leave as soon as I can.

91
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,630
It's up to you.

92
00:07:55,980 --> 00:08:00,480
Actually, you're not that annoying.

93
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,340
That's not what you think.

94
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:21,670
So wonderful, so warm.

95
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:24,410
You got me wrong. Listen to me.

96
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:25,610
I...

97
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:30,750
Calm down.

98
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,680
I must calm down at this point.

99
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,850
-Don't panic.
-What's up?

100
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,970
Friday 2 pm to 5 pm! Welcome to
Mr. You Tian art exhibition.

101
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:53,990
-Don't miss it!
-You must support it!

102
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:56,310
Don't miss it!

103
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:58,580
-You can't miss it!
-What are you doing?

104
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,010
What are you doing?

105
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:03,130
Why are you sneaking around here?

106
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,560
Don't get me into trouble.

107
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,540
Don't worry, we're a good girl.

108
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,900
What's in your hand?

109
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:26,090
What are you doing?

110
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:28,810
Keep it.

111
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:34,110
You're messing around.
I'm not going to hold the exhibition.

112
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:37,020
Mr. You Tian, listen to me.

113
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:37,920
I just...

114
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,010
Alright, give it to me.

115
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:44,190
Please stop it.

116
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:45,390
Cut it out!

117
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,100
Gosh! The exhibition is cancelled.

118
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,790
Get back to your work.

119
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:53,130
You are messing around!

120
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:25,780
Mr. You Tian

121
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:27,920
Chu Xia.

122
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,030
I'm sorry.

123
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,220
I was rude just now.

124
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:37,460
I know you did it for me.

125
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:42,030
But, it's hard to hold
an art exhibition.

126
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:45,010
There's no precedent
for violating school rules.

127
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:47,240
I'll be in trouble
if the Principal knows it.

128
00:10:47,265 --> 00:10:49,494
And you guys will be implicated too.

129
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:53,740
I should say sorry to you.

130
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,560
I know everything about the vase.

131
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,590
Oh, you don't have to feel guilty.

132
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:03,130
It was my fault
for not taking care of the vase.

133
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:08,300
Let me do something for you.

134
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:10,980
Chu Xia.

135
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:16,430
Actually, you don't have to do anything
and that is the greatest help to me.

136
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,890
The school has its own rules.

137
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:21,780
Don't create any troubles.

138
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:24,710
Thank you for your kindness.

139
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:29,830
But there's something
you will be disappointed for a lifetime

140
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:32,110
if you don't give it a try.

141
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:39,990
I am tired.

142
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:41,630
You go back first.

143
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:42,640
Let's end it here.

144
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:44,430
Don't carry on.

145
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:46,260
If you insist,

146
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:50,240
I'll punish you
before the principal comes to you.

147
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:54,730
I'll listen to you in everything,

148
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:56,150
but not for this.

149
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:59,160
I'll wait for the punishment
at your exhibition.

150
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,650
You must come.

151
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,450
Be careful.

152
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:23,210
Stick it.

153
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:33,840
Give me a chance to mend my fault
for not telling you about it last time.

154
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,120
I've never been angry with you.

155
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,440
Be careful.

156
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,990
Now everything is ready.

157
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:49,230
We only need the wind.

158
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,110
What wind?

159
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:55,100
Only the wind can make it?

160
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,250
Don't interrupt.

161
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:59,240
The art exhibition must have paintings.

162
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:00,550
That's right.

163
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:03,420
That's the most important thing.

164
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,630
What now?

165
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,090
Master Ling.

166
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,750
We're giving the opportunity to you.

167
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,570
Make sure you grab it.

168
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:16,470
Leave it to me.

169
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,220
Okay.

170
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:19,370
-Let's go.
-Come on.

171
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:31,240
Why are you looking for me?

172
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,790
I haven't finished my painting yet.

173
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:34,550
Which one is more important?
Me or painting?

174
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:35,940
Both are important.

175
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:39,310
-Only one choice.
-Drawing you.

176
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,790
You are flirting, huh?

177
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:43,380
What a sweet tongue!

178
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:47,770
So why are you looking for me?

179
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:50,260
Can't I find you for nothing?

180
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,580
-Are you afraid I'm wasting your time?
-No.

181
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,650
Go away! Don't come again!

182
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:59,330
I'm leaving then.

183
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:00,740
Stop!

184
00:14:01,051 --> 00:14:02,451
What do you want?

185
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:08,820
I'm looking for you...

186
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,480
Actually, I...

187
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,840
Hurry, move all these paintings.

188
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,140
Okay.

189
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,620
Be careful.

190
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,670
That one.

191
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:30,360
Are you in trouble?

192
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:32,600
That's right, I'm in a big trouble.

193
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,580
Ms. Maria.

194
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:38,870
Thanks for helping me to mend my fault.

195
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,990
Yeah, that one.

196
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,970
I have something to tell you.

197
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:53,300
Come on! Let's move!

198
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,560
1, 2, 3!

199
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,010
Go for it!

200
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:15,000
Did you hear that? An Chu Xia holds
an art exhibition for Mr. You Tian.

201
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,640
An Chu Xia holds an art
exhibition for Mr. You Tian.

202
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,880
-Really?
-Many celebrities will come on that day.

203
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,760
So, Mr. You Tian can show off

204
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,630
in front of the principal.

205
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,740
Did you hear that? An Chu Xia holds
an art exhibition for Mr. You Tian.

206
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:28,280
Is it?

207
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,060
There's an auction too.

208
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:33,350
Mr. You Tian is going to be famous.

209
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:36,280
He might be able
to be the class teacher.

210
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,510
An Chu Xia holds an art
exhibition for Mr. You Tian

211
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:43,250
to get him on the board.

212
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,220
so that he can replace the principal.

213
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,870
Nothing is impossible.

214
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:49,430
Han's family is going
to back up Chu Xia.

215
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:53,590
Art exhibition?

216
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:56,800
Mr. You Tian?

217
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,040
Celebrities?

218
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:01,430
Chu Xia?

219
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,480
Han's family?

220
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,650
Where are you?

221
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,870
Still playing mah-jong?

222
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,920
I thought you'd support the exhibition
which was held by your Chu Xia?

223
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:24,770
I don't care.

224
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:27,970
I just want to see how your
little Chu Xia being expelled.

225
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:31,970
Okay, bye.

226
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:42,610
You are not reliable at all as usual.

227
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:09,870
Mr. You Tian is awesome.

228
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,950
Look at that painting.

229
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:15,450
That one? What's up?

230
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:16,540
The colour is nice.

231
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:19,300
What a deep meaning!

232
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:21,970
The coordination between light and dark.

233
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:23,860
It's perfect.

234
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,620
Perfect.

235
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:29,520
The broken rag?

236
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,160
Who brought it?

237
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,660
I'm going to take it away.

238
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:36,610
What are you talking about?

239
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:37,650
Nothing.

240
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,840
-Ask him.
-What's wrong?

241
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:42,860
Nothing.

242
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:43,610
Take it.

243
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:45,380
Frame it.

244
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:51,260
An art exhibition on the basketball
court? I've never seen it.

245
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:53,110
We are here to support it.

246
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,190
Xin Wei.

247
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:56,380
Only an artist could
hold an art exhibition.

248
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:59,030
Some people are busy body.

249
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,350
They are messing around.

250
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:02,980
Believe it or not? I'll beat you
if you keep making nonsense.

251
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,520
You want to beat me, huh?

252
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:07,650
-I will beat you first!
-Come on!

253
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:12,030
But I'm a little confused.

254
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:15,770
The exhibition is going to be over.
Where is the artist?

255
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:18,350
Anything happened?

256
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:20,510
What else?

257
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:22,610
He must have run away.

258
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,530
Mo Xin Wei.

259
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:27,840
I welcome you to enjoy the exhibition.

260
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:29,810
If you're here to make trouble,...

261
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:31,030
What will you do?

262
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:32,770
I'll tell the principal.

263
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:36,210
as you defied his decision.
He approved the exhibition.

264
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:41,110
What if the principal knew

265
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:44,880
the famous artist you invited

266
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,350
was Mr. You Tian?

267
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:48,310
An Chu Xia.

268
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:52,030
How dare you deceive the principal
as you're new to the college?

269
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:54,350
Do you know the consequences?

270
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:55,150
You!

271
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:01,160
No matter what,
we must hold the exhibition.

272
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:03,150
Take it easy.

273
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,390
We're here to congratulate you.

274
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:06,530
Right? Gao Gan?

275
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:07,640
Yeah.

276
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,830
Please leave.

277
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,820
You are so bold.

278
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:23,360
How do you want to chase me out of here?

279
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:26,150
Don't regret it.

280
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:27,650
An Chu Xia.

281
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:37,510
Are you going to hit people again?

282
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:46,310
How dare you deceive your teacher?

283
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:49,130
You will regret it.

284
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:51,330
It's strange.

285
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:54,940
What makes you stammer today?

286
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:01,170
Actually, I don't know what to say.

287
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:04,730
But I...

288
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,990
But I do have something to tell you.

289
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:09,710
What makes you stammer?

290
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:11,650
You said you needed me

291
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:13,440
and you had something to tell me.

292
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:15,870
Are you...

293
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:17,190
-No!
-Confessing your feeling?

294
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:18,850
Chu Xia didn't steal your paintings!

295
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:24,380
Outrageous!

296
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:27,150
You're messing with them too, huh?

297
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:31,790
Chu Xia didn't do anything wrong.

298
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:35,120
We don't want you to bury your talent.

299
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,230
I don't like the way you are.

300
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:52,290
Han Yu.

301
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:54,070
I'm in trouble.

302
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:55,790
So am I.
