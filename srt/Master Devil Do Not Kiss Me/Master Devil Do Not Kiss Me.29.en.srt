1
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:22,340
What about this?

2
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,970
It's too ostentatious,
doesn't fit Mr. You Tian.

3
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:29,560
Look at this.

4
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:30,820
What about a tie?

5
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,370
Mr. You Tian doesn't wear a tie.

6
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:37,750
It's so hard to pick a gift.

7
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,740
Anything I can help?

8
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:48,610
Are you picking a gift for Mr. You Tian?

9
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:53,730
We should get something he likes.

10
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:56,210
There are some galleries
around the school.

11
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:59,290
It has a lot of artworks
by new painters and students.

12
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,230
The price is not expensive,

13
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:03,190
but there are many good things.

14
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,600
Let me look for
the official website for you.

15
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:10,540
Xiao Nan, look.

16
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:11,940
This one.

17
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,990
I am sure Mr. You Tian likes it.
Right?

18
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,910
Is this a gift for Mr. You Tian
for his return from abroad?

19
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,770
Sis Yuan Yuan will hold
a welcome party at home for him.

20
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,240
Would you like to join us?

21
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,440
I... Can I join?

22
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:31,420
Will it make Sis Yuan Yuan unhappy?

23
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:32,890
-Of course...
-Chu Xia!

24
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:35,830
Since she has something to do,
let's not force her.

25
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,090
Chu Xia.

26
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:40,640
I will go.

27
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:41,880
Thank you.

28
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:42,930
Okay.

29
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,600
I'll go to the washroom.

30
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:47,920
See you.

31
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,460
Chu Xia.

32
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,150
Why are you so nice to her?

33
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,040
She helped me.

34
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,450
So I have to invite her.

35
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:02,710
Didn't you do that to reconcile
her and Han family?

36
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:06,330
She's suffering too.

37
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,490
Chu Xia.

38
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,640
I grew up with you.

39
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,570
I know that you look strong,

40
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:15,890
but have a soft heart.

41
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,480
Come on.

42
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,750
You don't have to be
so kind this time.

43
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,520
Xiao Nan.

44
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:25,940
I'm not being kind. I know you're
doing it for my own good.

45
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:28,100
But Xiang Man Kui
is different from Mo Xin Wei.

46
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,270
She's not a bad person.

47
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,560
Alright.

48
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:31,480
Look at this.

49
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,360
This way please.

50
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,240
Madam.

51
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,720
-Here they are.
-Aunt.

52
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,320
-Xiao Nan.
-Madam.

53
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,460
-Come in.
-Thanks.

54
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,030
Hi, aunty.

55
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:49,200
This way please.

[Episode 6]

58
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:30,090
Today, Chu Xia

59
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:32,710
specially organizes
a welcome party to welcome

60
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:34,620
Mr. You Tian back to school.

61
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,590
It is rare for us to get together.

62
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:37,970
Please enjoy yourselves.

63
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,230
Yay!

64
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:41,010
Han.

65
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:42,930
Sit down, just relax today.

66
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:43,970
Thank you, madam.

67
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,100
Firstly, I'd like to thank Mrs. Han,

68
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,430
Chu Xia

69
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:48,700
and everybody.

70
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,830
I'm so touched today.

71
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,010
Cheers!

72
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:54,820
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

73
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,190
Mr. You Tian, welcome back!

74
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,520
Sir, this is a gift for you.

75
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:07,640
Wow.

76
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:09,460
Chu Xia.

77
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,040
Thank you.

78
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,090
You are welcome.

79
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:16,000
Xiao Nan and I found the gallery

80
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,350
thanks to Xiang Man Kui.

81
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:19,620
It's because

82
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,910
Chu Xia has a good taste.

83
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,860
Such a good pick!

84
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,520
Here you go.

85
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,570
I believe the old one was broken.

86
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,840
Open it!

87
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:34,060
Hurry!

88
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,680
What's their relationship?

89
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:38,020
How do I know?

90
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,800
Hi, everybody!

91
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,120
I heard this is a welcome party
for Mr. You Tian.

92
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,960
I bet you don't mind that I join you.

93
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,560
It's too late for us to mind it.

94
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:54,000
Excuse me, move.

95
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:57,030
Excuse me.

96
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:58,440
Move there.

97
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,210
Move.

98
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,580
Chu Xia, for you.

99
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,540
Don't mind me. Just go on.

100
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,400
Enjoy yourselves.

101
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:23,840
Thank you.

102
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,040
Han.

103
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,400
Who is Jiang Chen Chuan?

104
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,450
He's the son of Jiang Hai,

105
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,480
the CEO of Jiang's Group.

106
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,630
He's good at flirting with girls.

107
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,200
-Chu Xia, eat the prawn.
-Hey!

108
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,350
Cut the crap.

109
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,100
Here you go.

110
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,660
Look at the prawn.

111
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,800
You didn't even clean the legs.

112
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,300
Chu Xia

113
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:06,180
is allergic to seafood.

114
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:08,600
Open your mouth, eat this.

115
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,200
Eat this.

116
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:14,710
Thank you.

117
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:17,790
Clean the prawn yourself if you like it.

118
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,380
I like to eat the prawn
which was cleaned by you.

119
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:22,800
What's wrong?

120
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:25,200
I can do that too.

121
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,040
That's troublesome.

122
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,230
Young master has an opponent now.

123
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,150
It's okay, I have an idea.

124
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:41,290
Come on.

125
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:44,690
This is mine.

126
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:45,240
Hey.

127
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,170
Come on.

128
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,570
Excuse me!

129
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:53,080
Maria.

130
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,550
Thank you for your gift.

131
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:56,800
You're welcome.

132
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,720
Since you were back from abroad,
you always say "Sorry and

133
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,560
it's okay".

134
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,660
I feel bored with it.

135
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,760
I know you're hiding
something from me.

136
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,330
It's okay if you refuse to tell.

137
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,800
I have figured it out.

138
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,300
Both of us are not close friends anyway.

139
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,300
You don't have to report to me.

140
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:15,980
No...

141
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:16,770
Actually, I...

142
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:18,790
I wanted to tell you that

143
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,160
I had a reason to come back.

144
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,040
I...

145
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,900
Here comes the highlight.

146
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,960
Find your own partner

147
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,010
and dance together!

148
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:40,840
-Sis Yuan Yuan
-Yes.

149
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,880
Are you okay?

150
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,250
What's wrong?

151
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,920
Chu Xia worked so hard to
practise it a few days ago, didn't she?

152
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:50,200
You practised it too, didn't you?

153
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:54,070
It's a good time to see
your performance tonight.

154
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:55,360
Sis Yuan Yuan.

155
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,210
How did you know that?

156
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,260
Don't bother.

157
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,410
Hurry.

158
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,940
-Hurry!
-I go back first.

159
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:07,520
Chu Xia.

160
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,820
May I?

161
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,620
Get lost! Come on.

162
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,030
Han Qi Lu, you're tricky!

163
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:13,140
Did I say I'd pass?

164
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,500
She lives in my house.
She should dance with me!

165
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,380
That's right.

166
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,420
Go away.

167
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,480
Dance with me.

168
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:23,720
Chu Xia.

169
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:37,330
It seems she doesn't need a teacher.

170
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,010
Not bad.

171
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:40,010
Is it?

172
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:42,780
It seems that I teach well.

173
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,820
I knew you were
trying to praise yourself.

174
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,480
I am sincerely praising you.

175
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:02,960
Why don't we go for a dance?

176
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,890
I'm sorry.

177
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:10,460
There's a girl looking for...

178
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:11,470
Honey.

179
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:13,370
I finally found you.

180
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,920
Honey.

181
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,540
I'm so happy!

182
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,920
So happy

183
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,420
that I finally found you.

184
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,300
I'm so happy!

185
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,070
I finally found you.

186
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,210
I'm so happy!

187
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:33,150
Mr. You Tian.

188
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:34,420
This is...

189
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:37,030
Nancy Cumberbatch,
you can call me Crystal.

190
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:38,920
I'm You Tian's fiancee.

191
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:42,230
You can speak Mandarin

192
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:43,290
very well.

193
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:44,680
My mother is Chinese.

194
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,330
Sis Yuan Yuan.

195
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,860
That's not the point.

196
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:50,070
You're his fiancee?

197
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,930
I fell in love with
You Tian at first sight.

198
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:54,350
Are you kidding?

199
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:55,390
That's true.

200
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,330
It was a Sunday and
the weather was gloomy.

201
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:03,720
I had a quarrel with my father

202
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,360
and I was in a bad mood.

203
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:08,970
When I was walking alone on the street,

204
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:13,480
I was robbed by a bad guy.

205
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,320
At that moment,

206
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,920
You Tian rushed towards me

207
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,970
and got my wallet back.

208
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,860
Isn't he awesome?

209
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:23,390
You Tian is the most
righteous man I've ever met.

210
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:26,650
If it weren't for him,
my purse would have been robbed.

211
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:30,950
What's your relationship
with Jerome Cumberbatch?

212
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,250
He's my father.

213
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,500
You know him?

214
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:36,530
I have seen him once.

215
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,400
Who's Jerome?

216
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:44,360
One of the top 10 richest men of Forbes.

217
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,980
-You don't say!
-Congratulations!

218
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,520
Mr. You Tian, you are really awesome!

219
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,200
Congratulations to Mr. You Tian!

220
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,850
It's late now.

221
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:58,940
I should get going.

222
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,980
Honey, let's go.

223
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,680
It's been a long time since we last met.
Do you miss me?

224
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,560
Let's go.

225
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:12,060
Chu Xia.

226
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,210
-I'll be leaving.
-Bye.

227
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:14,630
Go ahead.

228
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,240
Chu Xia, I'm off.

229
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,940
Aunty.

230
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:21,460
Thanks for your hospitality,
See you.

231
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,290
What happened to him?

232
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,310
He looked fine yesterday.

233
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:52,040
What turns him into this?

234
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,180
Last night, he went to Han's mansion.

235
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,770
He saw Han Qi Lu dancing
with An Chu Xia.

236
00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:59,500
It was a blow to him.

237
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,140
Now I understand.

238
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,000
Hey.

239
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:07,680
Did you tell him about last night?

240
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,520
No, I didn't.

241
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,140
I didn't say anything.

242
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:11,690
Really?

243
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:17,110
I gave him a little hint.

244
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:18,540
He guessed it himself.

245
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,220
I am wondering.

246
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:24,920
When did you two get so close?

247
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:28,440
It's men's friendship,
you don't understand.

248
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:29,840
Bullshit.

249
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,110
Feng Shao.

250
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,240
Let me ask you.

251
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,450
What does he mean
by finding a teacher for Chu Xia?

252
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,110
Ah!

253
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:40,080
Chu Xia failed the art subject

254
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,080
and refused to learn it from others.

255
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,940
He was afraid that
she'd be too pressured.

256
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:47,180
So he wanted to get a dancing
teacher secretly to help her.

257
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,520
Don't tell anyone.

258
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:51,260
He wants to give her a surprise.

259
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:54,990
It seems

260
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,830
-he works so hard on Chu Xia.
-You can say that again!

261
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:02,410
Alright, I won't tell anyone.

262
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:10,990
Hello.

263
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:13,500
Okay. I'll be right there.

264
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:17,100
-Mr. Ma is looking for me. I have to go.
-Okay.

265
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:19,960
I'll leave him to you.

266
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,950
Don't worry.

267
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:33,120
Hey!

268
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,050
Bro!

269
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:36,140
Get up!

270
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:41,830
You finally woke up.

271
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:43,640
Chu Xia doesn't want me.

272
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,640
Hey!

273
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,610
Chu Xia doesn't want me.

274
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:50,920
Why are you alone here?

275
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,190
I just want to be quiet.

276
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,050
Come here.

277
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,340
Why didn't you answer it?

278
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,640
I don't know how to deal with her yet.

279
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,800
Isn't Crystal good?

280
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:28,080
She's perfect.

281
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:30,790
So what's your problem?

282
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,770
I don't know what I'm thinking.

283
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,890
I turn a blind eye
to the happiness in front of me

284
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:41,480
but trying to keep a girl who
I dare not confess my feeling to.

285
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:44,840
You mean Ms. Maria?

286
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:46,850
You can tell?

287
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:48,510
It's too obvious.

288
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:52,020
Even an outsider can see it,

289
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,770
why can't she just understand?

290
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:56,450
What about Crystal?

291
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,940
-How do you feel about her?
-I have no feelings towards her.

292
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:04,300
We love or hate a person

293
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:08,590
because she has a position
in our heart, and we can't forget it.

294
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,620
That's why we have those feelings.

295
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:25,460
Why do you suddenly
ask me out for a coffee?

296
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:27,950
You should treat me.

297
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,000
Why?

298
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,440
You have passed the exam.

299
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,170
Shouldn't you thank me?

300
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:35,840
Alright then.

301
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:39,380
Waiter! Give me another
plate of fruit and snacks.

302
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,910
Hey, don't order so much.

303
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:43,830
The foods here are all very expensive.

304
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,180
Why?

305
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:47,030
Not enough pocket money?

306
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:48,650
That's all your money.

307
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:50,420
I'll pay it back later.

308
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:57,870
My family can give you
everything you want.

309
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,700
That belongs to your family, not mine.

310
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:06,430
Don't you ever take it as your home?

311
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,610
That's not true.

312
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:12,810
I have to pay it back to you.

313
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:17,240
What's wrong?

314
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:18,520
Nothing.

315
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,780
Here comes the food. Dig in.

316
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:29,090
Your mood always changes.
Just like the weather.

317
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,700
It's hard to guess.

318
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,800
May I sit here?

319
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,180
Sure.

320
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,300
Have a seat.

321
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:44,940
Tiramisu?

322
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,350
Qi Lu, this is the only cake you like.

323
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:50,490
Your taste hasn't changed.

324
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,170
That's true.

325
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,540
How can people's habits change easily?

326
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:58,820
Qi Lu.

327
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,300
Do you remember...

328
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,400
Han Qi Lu, what's wrong with you?

329
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,130
I've had enough.

330
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,040
Don't bother him.

331
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,560
Don't be sad.

332
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:22,070
It's okay, I really can't stand it.

333
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:31,660
I'm sorry to have
disturbed your tea break.

334
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:32,760
Don't say that.

335
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:38,690
No matter how angry was he,

336
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:41,820
-he won't angry with me...
-He's crazy.

337
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:42,750
Well...

338
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:45,090
He yells at me every day
and I'm used to it.

339
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:45,500
Really.

340
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,880
Don't bother him, he's sick.

341
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:50,320
Don't cry.

342
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,770
I see.

343
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,330
Do you think Chu Xia
really likes Han Qi Lu?

344
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:02,220
Otherwise, why did she learn
from him and reject my help?

345
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:06,590
Not really, he has an advantageous
geographical location after all.

346
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:08,440
I can't do anything.

347
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:11,990
Well, do you remember
the 18 Tips to Get A Girl?

348
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:15,380
-Crap! It doesn't work at all.
-It certainly works.

349
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:15,790
Useless.

350
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:19,960
Think about it. What delayed the
progress between you and Chu Xia?

351
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:24,330
Because you spend
less time with her alone.

352
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:29,930
Date her out to a place
with mountains, sea and WiFi.

353
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,550
Just you two.

354
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,020
It will quicken the progress.

355
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,880
You remind me that

356
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,440
my family has a resort.

357
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,390
Let me inform them.

358
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:39,450
That's it!

359
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:43,000
But, will Chu Xia go with me?

360
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,930
It depends on your own efforts.

361
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,240
I know, but...

362
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,160
As long as you do it,

363
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,940
the success is just around the corner.

364
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:55,930
It is just around the corner.

365
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:58,570
-Go for it!
-Go for it!

366
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,230
Go for it!

367
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:07,600
Chu Xia.

368
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,950
Why are you walking alone so fast?

369
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,280
What's wrong?

370
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,630
You are absent-minded.

371
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:14,460
Nothing.

372
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:17,380
Does it have something to do with Han Qi Lu?

373
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:20,100
Actually,

374
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:23,900
I think,

375
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,180
you may consider Jiang Chen Chuan.

376
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:26,700
Chu Xia.

377
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,880
I finally found you.

378
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:28,900
Anything?

379
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,040
Well...

380
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,710
Straight to the point!

381
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:36,640
-I'd like to invite you to my resort.
-I'll pass.

382
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:39,880
Listen to me. It's near.
Just on the outskirts...

383
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:42,250
I told you I'd pass! You're annoying!

384
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,160
An Chu Xia, you have gone too far.

385
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:52,880
What's wrong?

386
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,510
How could you do that to him?

387
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:59,330
He found a dancing teacher for you
as he was worried about your pressure.

388
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:01,480
But how did you treat him?

389
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,450
I don't know.

390
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,800
I just don't understand you.

391
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:08,000
You are so nice to Xiang Man Kui.

392
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,490
Why can't you see the people
who really treats you well?

393
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,100
Sorry.

394
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:16,440
Don't say sorry to me.
It's not me who you should apologize to.
