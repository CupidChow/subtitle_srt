00:00:00,282 --> 00:00:01,109
Yun Mo!

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:03,520
Yun Mo, are you okay?

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:04,620
- Gege! -that is great!

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,080
Brother, you woke up!

5
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,000
We're all worried, it's been a month.

6
00:00:20,887 --> 00:00:25,831
Could it be that when that day actually comes, I will be even more reluctant to part with you?

7
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:31,710
Yun Mo, there will always be a place for you here with me.

8
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,610
♪You thought I looked brave♪

9
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:56,751
Sir, we found Lu Sheng.

10
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:01,926
He ran-away.

11
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:03,211
Go find him!

12
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:03,910
Yes.

13
00:01:14,853 --> 00:01:16,187
Lu Tian you...

14
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,183
Why are you doing this?

15
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:24,251
I created you and you treat me like this?

16
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,560
Now do you know she's my wife?

17
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:32,060
In your eyes, I'm just a pet you keep.

18
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:35,348
No, a dog.

19
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:46,660
You're just a dog, a stray dog.

20
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:52,798
you were a watchdog at my disposal!

21
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,460
gross!

22
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:03,988
What you did to the Foer family is worse than animals!

23
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,543
Where is Tianyou located?

24
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:19,032
Brother, please wait a little longer, God willing, he will come after finishing his business.

25
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:22,455
Where did he go?

26
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:26,306
he...
