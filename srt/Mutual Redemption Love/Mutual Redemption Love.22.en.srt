1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,170
Get down on your knees!

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:03,460
Get down on your knees!

3
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:05,616
Don't think I don't know that this time you deliberately ruined the wedding,

4
00:00:05,658 --> 00:00:07,680
because of your glorious stepmother!

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,640
I realized a long time ago that you two have been flirting right under my nose!

6
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:17,820
I didn't expect you to dare to flirt with your father's wife!

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,620
Get down on your knees!

8
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:26,080
If I hadn't adopted you, you would have already starved to death on the street!

9
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:29,968
Now that you have become more capable, your wings have become stronger, right?

10
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:32,159
You're against me, right?

11
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:35,832
Yes or no!

12
00:00:41,675 --> 00:00:43,606
Why did you get hurt again?

13
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:47,157
I accidentally did this myself.

14
00:00:47,604 --> 00:00:49,777
Don't look at me, I'm scared.

15
00:00:50,248 --> 00:00:53,840
I feel sad every time I see you. Who made this?

16
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,758
I asked Aman to meet him and it wouldn't come in the way.

17
00:00:57,169 --> 00:00:58,683
(not necessary.)

18
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:02,581
(Tianyou was adopted and he was not his biological father on the road,)

19
00:01:02,714 --> 00:01:04,492
(so he kept torturing Tianyou.)

20
00:01:04,671 --> 00:01:05,304
Speak!

21
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,260
Hard enough!

22
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:11,320
Today we have to see who is tougher, you or your stepmother!

23
00:01:11,748 --> 00:01:12,687
Somebody come!

24
00:01:23,755 --> 00:01:25,533
What do you want to do?

25
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,716
I advise you not to touch her,

26
00:01:28,957 --> 00:01:31,203
if you really do this to your old bones,

27
00:01:31,203 --> 00:01:32,799
you may not be my opponent.

28
00:01:32,828 --> 00:01:33,618
you bastard!

29
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,537
You can give up!

30
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,140
How dare you talk to me like that now!

31
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,140
[TO BE CONTINUED]
