1
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:11,186
You were shot, Yun Mo!

2
00:00:11,799 --> 00:00:13,050
Gege,

3
00:00:13,071 --> 00:00:14,500
You should go first.

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,760
The people of the small town are waiting for you outside, they will save you.

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,000
I'm not going away.

6
00:00:21,789 --> 00:00:24,213
I want to take you with me.

7
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:28,500
Yun Mo, you cannot die.

8
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:32,771
I promised you that I would see you get married and have children,

9
00:00:32,822 --> 00:00:35,220
and be with you for the rest of your life.

10
00:00:37,278 --> 00:00:39,461
I did what I promised.

11
00:00:41,294 --> 00:00:42,576
Geege?

12
00:00:42,707 --> 00:00:46,035
you said "I can always be with you"

13
00:00:46,361 --> 00:00:49,766
When you grow up you will have to get married.

14
00:00:49,766 --> 00:00:51,946
How can we be together?

15
00:00:54,282 --> 00:00:56,361
I am not getting married.

16
00:00:56,365 --> 00:00:58,917
I will stay by Gege's side and take care of her all my life.

17
00:00:58,974 --> 00:01:01,878
Gege climbed into a sedan chair and gave birth to a child,

18
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:03,954
and then turned into an old woman.

19
00:01:04,358 --> 00:01:08,368
Now say this "wait until you actually have someone you like"

20
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:09,987
he is better than anyone else!

21
00:01:10,234 --> 00:01:11,495
it's impossible.

22
00:01:11,495 --> 00:01:13,845
Ge Ge, I just keep my word.

23
00:01:17,029 --> 00:01:19,442
Gege...

24
00:01:20,295 --> 00:01:23,141
It's snowing...

25
00:01:29,698 --> 00:01:32,363
it's so white...

26
00:01:32,576 --> 00:01:37,911
and the world is clean.

27
00:01:47,878 --> 00:01:48,911
Yun Mo?

28
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:51,501
Yun Mo...

29
00:01:55,074 --> 00:01:56,304
Yun Mo.

30
00:01:56,304 --> 00:02:08,304
