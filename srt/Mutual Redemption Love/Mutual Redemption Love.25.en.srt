00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,668
(EPISODE 25)

2
00:00:02,668 --> 00:00:03,658
Yun Mo...

3
00:00:07,047 --> 00:00:08,360
Yun Mo, are you okay?

4
00:00:09,115 --> 00:00:09,996
Yun Mo?

5
00:00:10,704 --> 00:00:11,799
Yun Mo!

6
00:00:12,802 --> 00:00:14,809
Yun Mo, how are you?

7
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:19,185
Ge Ge, are you awake?

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,280
Master, what are you doing?

9
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:29,120
You are the princess of the previous dynasty, the gospel of that country, and the mistress of this house.

10
00:00:29,685 --> 00:00:31,949
Aren't you surprised now?

11
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:33,763
Who do you think told me that?

12
00:00:37,465 --> 00:00:39,415
It was her.

13
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:45,146
Gege, why does such a disloyal ally keep her?

14
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:49,277
Master, what kind of character do I have?

15
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,957
I may still be willing to be your concubine.

16
00:00:51,957 --> 00:00:56,207
So if you can kill her, I will believe you.

17
00:01:01,034 --> 00:01:04,101
I'm not actually Gege...

18
00:01:05,415 --> 00:01:09,420
I'm just a maid next to Gege.

19
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:17,324
I have been with Gege for many years and I know that there is a secret room in this mansion,

20
00:01:17,383 --> 00:01:20,178
which is in this office.

21
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:29,690
So what is the reason why you disguised your identity and got married?

22
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:33,110
Of course it's for the treasure in the secret room.

23
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:37,690
Master, were you also tricked by that wild girl Yu Mo?

24
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:42,280
She was just a swindler, she cooperated with me in acting, took the money and left.

25
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,323
You knew you couldn't get the money anymore,

26
00:01:46,717 --> 00:01:51,603
so you just told the old man that I was "Ge Ge"?

27
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:59,758
You ignored one detail,

28
00:02:00,351 --> 00:02:03,657
she joined the government three years before you!

29
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:09,870
I will kill you for your excuse to rebel for money!

30
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:11,390
no!

31
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:11,890
He speaks!

32
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:13,210
Aren't you protecting her?

33
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,210
Where did you say the secret room is?

34
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:15,070
Where it is?

35
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:15,930
Are you going to say it or not?

36
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:17,630
If you don't tell me, I'll step on it!

37
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,026
You let her go!

38
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:20,130
Let her go!

39
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:21,553
Are you going to say it or not?

40
00:02:23,587 --> 00:02:24,450
Yunmo!

41
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:25,510
Where is the secret room?

42
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:27,392
If you don't tell me, I'll step on it!

43
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:28,230
I will show you!
