00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,420
That day,

7
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,750
nothing happened between us.

8
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,120
I know.

9
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,130
I was just overthinking things.

10
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:14,900
I didn't want it to be hasty

11
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,870
and forgettable.

12
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,680
I hope our first kiss

13
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,150
will linger on

14
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:27,390
in your memory.

15
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,020
Jooha?

16
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,370
I'm sorry.

17
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:06,210
I didn't know you'd have a guest.

18
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,800
Hello.

19
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,930
I'm...

20
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:13,490
He's the person I'm seeing.

21
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:15,680
Oh...

22
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:20,660
I'm Na Aejoon.

23
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,880
I'm Yeon Jooha.

24
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,760
I used to live here.

25
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,730
Sorry?

26
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:30,740
The place was put up for rent,

27
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:34,079
but he moved in
and didn't change the password.

28
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:36,900
He said it's too troublesome.

29
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,770
Oh, I see.

30
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:41,600
He'll be a guest on my radio show
in a few days,

31
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,490
but he isn't even aware
of the script changes.

32
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:47,620
That's why I came to give this to him
on behalf of the manager.

33
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:50,230
Please forgive this intrusion.
It won't happen again.

34
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:52,700
Oh, no, it's okay.

35
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:56,370
After all, you two are much closer.

36
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:02,160
Well, being close and being in love
are different.

37
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:08,090
Alright, enjoy your time together.

38
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:10,340
See you again sometime.

39
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:13,680
And I'll see you at the radio studio,
Mr. Choi Siyeol!

40
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,500
Wow.

41
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,040
I actually saw Yeon Jooha up close.

42
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,000
Sit down.

43
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,460
Let's talk about us again.

44

It's quite late already.

45
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:39,190
Why don't you stay over?

46
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,560
What?

[Episode 7:

49
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:07,650
is my boyfriend?

50
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:11,260
We even spent the entire weekend together.

51
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:14,020
I think I forgot how to breathe.

52
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,570
By the way,

53
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:20,740
I know you're strict with your diet,

54
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,810
but you really only eat salads.

55
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:25,890
Oh... It's okay. I'm used to it.

56
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:29,140
But I think it's really impressive.

57
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:32,270
They say celebrities
all watch what they eat,

58
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:35,540
but it must be tough
to be so disciplined.

59
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,920
Oh, well... I guess.

60
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,850
So impressive.
You're such a professional!

61
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,750
Gosh.

62
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,250
Well, it's no big deal.

63
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,250
Um, by the way,

64
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:53,630
can't you stay over today too?

65
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:56,280
We can go to work together tomorrow.

66
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,810
But don't you have a shoot tomorrow?

67
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:02,900
I don't want to be a hindrance.

00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,840
Being disciplined and only eating salads.

71
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,470
I'm working now too, you know?

72
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:21,650
Please.

73
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:24,580

What are you doing?

76
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,840
This is so embarrassing.

77
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:48,300
Just kill me now.

78
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:58,800
Wait. So you were eating it secretly
because of what I said?

79
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:01,840
Stop laughing at me.

80
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,230
The thought of you

81
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:06,030
sneaking out to buy instant noodles
and eating it secretly

82
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:07,770
is just too funny.

83
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:20,640
You could've just said
you were craving instant noodles.

84
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,100
Eat up.

85
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,970
Are you okay?

86
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:39,480
Water.

87
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,490
So cute.

88
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:54,740
Not that I didn't know...

89
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:59,250
but you really do have a cute side.

90
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,810
Are you okay?

91
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,670
Want more water?

92
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:06,410
Are you okay?

93
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:08,830

Welcome to "Afternoon Melody."

the ever-popular group, A-One!

102
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,820
Hello, everyone.

103
00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:01,410
Hello, I'm Choi Siyeol of A-One.

104
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:04,810
Hello, I'm JJ,
the all-round leader of A-One.

105
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:08,310
Hello, I'm Kyutae, the rapper of A-One.

106
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:11,360
[Ji Kyusung, are you at
the radio studio now?]

107
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:18,350
[Yeah, why?
I didn't see you all weekend.]

108
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:21,430
[I doubt you're asking for autographs.]

109
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:25,670
[I want to get there
by the end of the broadcast.]

110
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:28,690
[You were together all day,
but you already miss him?]

111
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:33,970
[No. I want to come clean to Siyeol
before we take things further.]

112
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:38,040
[Come clean about what?
That you were his longtime fanboy?]

113
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,440
[What? I wasn't a fanboy...]

114
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,850
[I was just... a fan.]

115
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:45,130
[It's stupid that I'm hiding
that we're relatives.]

116
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:47,110
[It's like I'm always lying to him.]

117
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:49,010
[It's about time I be honest with him.]

118
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:52,980
[Dude, it's not a big deal.
Don't get all serious.]

119
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,950
[I'll send you the address.
Call me when you arrive.]

120
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:03,530
Let's check out if
that's the correct answer.

121
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:07,090
Drumroll...

122
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,830
Sorry, that was incorrect.

123
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:13,020
Kyutae's the top scorer so far.

124
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:16,190
Last but not least, Siyeol,
want to give it a go?

125
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:16,900
Of course.

126
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,020
I'm the ace of the group.

127
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,620
Wow, very confident.

128
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:24,470
Alright. Let's have our next caller.

129
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,400
Hello, this is
Yeon Jooha's "Afternoon Melody."

130
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,280
I'm...

131
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,160
Holy crap!

132
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,730
Aren't you Choi Siyeol?

133
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:33,990
Yes, I'm Choi Siyeol.

134
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:34,900
Hello.

135
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,790
It's really Choi Siyeol!

136
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:38,780
It's really him, you idiot!

137
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,670
Give it to me! Hey!

138
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:41,900
-Hello?
-Give it to me!

139
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,570
Um, excuse me.

140
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:45,370
You must be a fan of A-One.

141
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:46,460
Are you on the line?

142
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,530
Hello?

143
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:49,240
Yes, I'm listening.

144
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:53,660
I'm not a fan.
I'm just calling for the gift.

145
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:56,940
Right, so here's the question
you have to answer to get the gift.

146
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:02,930
By the way, are A-One members
still on good terms with Yeon Jooha?

147
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,870
Sorry?

148
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,590
Didn't he betray A-One

149
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:10,540
by suddenly leaving to become an actor?

150
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:11,900
What the hell?

151
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,460
That's why A-One's debut was postponed

152
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:18,300
and their image was totally ruined,
all because of him.

153
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:21,580
Is it even possible to stay friends
with a traitor like that?

154
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,950
-Hey, this is notâ€”
-Hold on.

155
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:25,870
If you wanted to be an actor,
why join the group in the first place?

156
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:26,800
That's so selfish.

157
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,900
Please end the call.

158
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,680
Hang on.

159
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,960
Please end the call now!

160
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,950
Honestly, I'm more objective

161
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:34,580
[Say that the time's up and end the call.]

162
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:34,670
because I'm not a fan.

163
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:36,070
His ankle injury was also

164
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,060
just a fake excuse to stop the backlash,

165
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:39,310
wasn't it?

166
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:42,870
A fake excuse to stop the backlash?

167
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:43,980
Sorry, due to time constraintsâ€”

168
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,030
So, are you saying

169
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:50,640
you'd risk your life
just to cover up something like that?

170
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,100
Have you ever thought about

171
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:55,510
how much consideration and resolve
it takes

172
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:01,880
to make such an important decision?

173
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,040
What? What did you say?

174
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:15,180
This is the first time
I'm mentioning this to the public.

175
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:19,170
Yeon Jooha's leg injury...

176
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:30,370
was because of me.

177
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,640
Should I cut it off?

178
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,230
Wait.

179
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:37,950
At the time of the incident,

180
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:40,220
it was only revealed that

181
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:44,070
Yeon Jooha, a debut-group trainee,
injured his leg.

182
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:47,270
Since he wasn't famous back then,

183
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:51,240
news reports were all
based on our agency's statement.

184
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:55,250
[9 years ago]

185
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:56,260
Guys, I'm here.

186
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,630
It was a road we crossed every day.

187
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:00,350
Hurry up!

188
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:06,560
I was beside Jooha then,
when we were crossing the road.

189
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:24,880
If only the drunk driver
didn't speed toward the crosswalk...

190
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:29,560
If only I shielded Jooha
from the collision...

191
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:34,540
instead of the other way around...

192
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:46,180
Then maybe

193
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:50,840
Yeon Jooha would've debuted with A-One.

194
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,840
What the...

195
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:57,550
So, please don't ever
make such careless judgements again.

196
00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:00,330
If anyone tries to slander Yeon Jooha,

197
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:03,710
I'll take corresponding measures

198
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,810
to rectify the situation.

199
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:08,790
Yeah, yeah, okay.

200
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:11,420
Seriously... So melodramatic.

201
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:21,820
Thank you so much
for joining us today, A-One.

202
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:25,940
Thanks for tuning in.
Until next time.

203
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,440
Hey, Choi Siyeol!

204
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:24,920
Come with me.

205
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,720
Why did you mention that on the show

206
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,170
without approval from the agency?

207
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:53,880
The public should know.

208
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,910
Jooha was insulted because of me.

209
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:58,630
Do you understand
the implications of your words

210
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:00,510
and how many people it affects?

211
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,030
It was an accident.

212
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:09,020
Yes, but Jooha didn't have to
be the one to get hurt.

213
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:09,900
Why?

214
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,800
Since A-One is gaining traction,

215
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:16,170
are you worried that
this will ruin our image?

216
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,910
Hey.

217
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:27,270
I've been meaning to ask you this.

218
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:34,400
Do you like Yeon Jooha?

219
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,390
Yes.

220
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:41,480
At this point,

221
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,240
this is what you're concerned with, huh?

222
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,240
You found a new man
and abandoned Yeon Jooha.

223
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,410
What, now you regret it?

224
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:51,370
Hey, Choi Siyeol!

225
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:54,310
If that's not it,

226
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:57,240
leave Jooha alone.

227
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,720
Stop giving him false hope.

228
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,760
What about Na Aejoon?

229
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,130
Why are you dating him?

230
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:15,030
You... knew about it?

231
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:22,849
You knew your boyfriend was
dating someone else, but you...

232
00:17:24,329 --> 00:17:26,859
you were just condoning it?

233
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:28,480
What?

234
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,480
Boyfriend?

235
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:34,760
What the hell are you doing?

236
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:38,810
Can you make up your mind
and commit to one person?

237
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:42,680
So, are you saying...

238
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:46,420
you hit on Na Aejoon because you think

239
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,850
he and I are dating?

240
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:50,850
Yeah.

241
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:54,400
I hope you'll end up with

242
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,400
no one by your side.

243
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,820
Are you insane?

244
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:09,670
Na Aejoon.

245
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,780
Na Aejoon.

246
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:31,740
Was it your plan all along?

247
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,890
Answer me, Choi Siyeol.

248
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:44,940
[Epilogue]

249
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:48,100
Hey, the trailer of
"Go! School Teacher" is out!

250
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,230
Wow, interesting.

251
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,300
You're right.

252
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,990
Why?

253
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:57,590
Is something wrong?

254
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:59,340
No, well...

255
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:02,330
There are a lot of comments.

256
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:05,900
I don't want you to become famous.

257
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:08,290
I thought it was something serious.

258
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,990
Do you see this?

259
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:14,660
They're already asking for your IG handle.

260
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,820
He's so handsome.

261
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,080
What's your IG handle?

262
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,170
Please check your DMs.

263
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:23,780
Mr. Na Aejoon looks totally like an idol.

264
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:27,290
Even if he switches roles
with Choi Siyeol,

265
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:29,690
he'd fit the role.

266
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:40,990
[Choi Siyeol,
math teacher at Nabit High School]

267
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:43,070
It's really good!

268
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:45,980
Look at how he chews his food.

269
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:49,320
He's so freaking cute!

270
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:53,490
Seriously, how can he be so cute?

271
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:58,030
First, go to the teachers' office
and start streaming his new song.

272
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,930
You saw me getting out!
How could you just open your doorâ€”

[Na Aejoon,
rookie idol]

274
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:13,870
Oh, I'm sorry.

275
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:16,180
Did I hurt you?

276
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:20,080
Is he... angry?

277
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,280
But he's so handsome.

278
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,280
He is...

279
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,400
a million times cuter in person!

280
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,710
It's Na Aejoon!

281
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:37,230
Settle down. Be quiet.

282
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:40,840
From now on, call him Mr. Na Aejoon.

283
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,000
Show some respect.

284
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,030
Sit down.

285
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:45,010
Okay.

286
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:55,670
Are you okay?

287
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:57,500
Yes, thank you.

288
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,690
From now on, if you need anything...

289
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:03,150
just let me know.

290
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:05,320
Okay.

291
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:12,280
This setting has its charm too...

292
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,450
It's appealing too.

293
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,440
[In the next episode]

294
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,290
I should've known that something was off

295
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:22,900
by how interested he was in me.

296
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:25,250
Was anything between us real?

297
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:28,900
I wanted to steal the man
Kyusung was seeing from him.

298
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,220
Are you okay?

299
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,210
Hello, Jooha.

300
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:31,880
Are you a reporter?

301
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,410
Have you broken up with
the person you were seeing?

302
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:35,580
Sorry?

303
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,200
What do you mean you have to drop out

304
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,380
of this project, Mr. Na?

305
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:41,100
I don't mean I'm dropping out right now.

306
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,260
Wait.

307
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,530
Let's talk.

308
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:46,510
What else is there to talk about?
