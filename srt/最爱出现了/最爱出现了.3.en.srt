00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:57,150
Hello.

184
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:59,990
I'm the Korean language teacher,
Choi Siyeol.

185
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:02,250
So handsome.

186
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:05,660
Siyeol's face that I always see
in videos...

187
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:06,990
A familiar face...

188
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,270
Where were we last time?

189
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:12,320
Tell us about your first love!

190
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,370
Well...

191
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:14,500
Hey!

192
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,550
Why are you asking about
first love stories during class time?

193
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:19,480
You're making Mr. Choi uncomfortable.

194
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,210
H-How could you ask that?

195
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:22,940
Seriously.

196
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,870
Would you mind sharing with us, Mr. Choi?

197
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,710
Oh, my first love?

198
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:37,310
I think it was when I was 18.

199
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:43,950
That was when I was
the most anxious, nervous, and tired.

200
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:49,210
There was a group of people
who'd give me one-sided support.

201
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:51,000
It's our...

202
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,520
A Want You.

203
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:59,060
Oh? I mean it.

204
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:01,030
I like them the most.

205
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:03,150
I love them now.

206
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:06,130
-[Want Yous love you more, Siyeol.]
-Shall we start the class?

207
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:07,470
-Yes.
-Yes.

208
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,620
You can start the class from here.

209
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,310
Okay.

210
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:14,900
Mr. Choi will read you some materials.

211
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,980
Listen carefully.

212
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:18,150
-Yes.
-Yes.

213
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:22,170
In a birch forest
filled with nameless flowers,

214
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:25,120
I recalled a memory.

215
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,600
The old woman who lived in the cabin said,

216
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,650
"Even a single gust of wind,

217
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:30,970
a blade of grass,

218
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:32,950
or a drop of dew—

219
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:36,820
everything has a reason
for its existence."

220
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:42,060
The grandmother
would often stop on the path.

221
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:47,020
She would then
quietly stroke a still stone and say,

222
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:50,920
"This stone supports someone's path

223
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:54,030
or helps rainwater flow."

224
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,190
Okay, that's all for today.

225
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:57,960
Let's applaud for today's intern teacher.

226
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:02,430
Don't forget to do your homework.

227
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:03,290
Remember to hand it in.

228
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:04,560
-Yes!
-Yes!

229
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,350
Mr. Choi, come to our class next time too!

230
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:09,970
Let's go.

231
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:12,960
-Good job.
-Siyeol.

232
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,430
You did a really good job.

233
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:15,910
Ah... Yes.

234
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:17,800
Thank you.

235
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,530
Mr. Choi, can we take a photo together?

236
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:20,700
I'm sorry. We're busy.

237
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,870
Let's do it next time.

238
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:24,760
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

239
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,760
Get back to studying.

240
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,550
-Yes.
-Yes.

241
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:30,860
The atmosphere is different.

242
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:33,700
Did something happen?

243
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,340
You said you wanted to try the cafeteria.

244
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:45,220
How is it?

245
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:49,750
It's really good.

246
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:52,370
Especially this. This is my favorite.

247
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:53,770
I know.

248
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:55,350
Eat more, our baby.

249
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:56,950
When I was a kid,

250
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:59,940
-my mum made this for me a lot...
-Hold on.

251
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,680
Let us change the memory card.

252
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:14,050
Is this enough?

253
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:15,990
Take more off.

254
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:19,040
Again?

255
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,640
That unfamiliar face.

256
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,740
Have some.

257
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,760
Okay, let's continue the filming.

258
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:33,110
Choi Siyeol, Mr. Na,
can we start filming now?

259
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:36,930
Okay, action.

260
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:42,050
Do the teachers come and eat
at the cafeteria every day?

261
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:43,550
Huh?

262
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:46,420
Yes, there are days like that,

263
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:49,310
and there are days where we eat out.

264
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:51,330
But...

265
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:54,690
this sausage is the best.

266
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:58,360
It's your first time experiencing
being an intern teacher.

267
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,190
How do you feel?

268
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:02,940
To be honest, I was worried.

269
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:06,510
But thanks to Mr. Na's gentle guidance,

270
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:08,410
it was a really fun experience.

271
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:12,990
But you're so good that it
didn't look like it was your first time.

272
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:14,600
Really?

273
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:19,310
He somehow feels... unfamiliar.

274
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:21,550
The first day of "Go! School Teacher"
has wrapped up successfully.

275
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:23,870
I'll get off work for today.

276
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:26,180
See you next time.

277
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:28,420
-Bye.
-Bye.

278
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,270
Cut. Okay.

279
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:32,400
Good work.

280
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,350
Good work.

281
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,530
Good job.

282
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,050
Good work, Siyeol.

283
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:39,960
Yes.

284
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,780
Good work.

285
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:47,200
Mr. Choi, this is for you.

286
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,910
Mr. Choi, you're so handsome.

287
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:50,720
Thank you.

288
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,820
Mr. Na, hold on.

289
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,620
Yes.

290
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:58,270
Let me show you the schedule.

291
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:04,310
We need to match the dates.

292
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:05,660
Yes.

293
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:15,530
No matter what,
that was a gift from the students...

294
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:17,390
Oh, right. The clothes!

295
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,840
Things that only happen in dreams
keep happening,

296
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,090
making me confused.

297
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:29,180
We'll be together for a few more weeks.

298
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:31,530
Let's get closer.

299
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:35,330
I got his number, worried all night,
and was so dramatic about it.

300
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:36,640
I want to contact him...

301
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,660
I want to hear his voice...

302
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,990
How embarrassing, Na Aejoon.

303
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:44,900
These are all things
you don't have to worry about.

304
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,450
Ah. Yes.

305
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:47,760
Thank you.

306
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,470
Good work.

307
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,210
I knew it.

308
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:02,330
Fantasies should stay as fantasies.

[Stabilizer]

310
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:24,069
Good work, Siyeol.

311
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:25,630
Mm.

312
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:30,130
Brother, I need to talk to Ms. Han.

313
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:32,740
I'm afraid it'll take a long time.

314
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,500
Get in the car first.

315
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,920
-Got it.
-Okay.

316
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:41,810
[Na Aejoon]

317
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:53,650
Hello?

318
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:56,590
This is Na Aejoon.

319
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:58,350
I know.

320
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:00,010
Go ahead.

321
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:03,130
I haven't returned the clothes I borrowed.

322
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:05,650
Where are you now?

323
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:20,890
Your clothes.

324
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,400
You could've returned it to me
during the next recording.

325
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,350
Even so...

326
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,580
Also...

327
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,510
Here.

328
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:36,820
I saw this in your pocket.

329
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:40,740
I was worried that by acting
I didn't see it might upset you.

330
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:45,500
Ah...

331
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,200
Yes.

332
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:52,910
Well. See you during the next recording!

333
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,590
Well...

334
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,360
I thought about not saying this
since it could be

335
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,690
crossing the line.

336
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:11,140
But you seemed tired during the recording.

337
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:14,630
During times like that,
you could give me a signal.

338
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:20,180
What do you mean?

339
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,230
Well...

340
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,690
For example, the fact that you don't eat–

341
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:27,380
but maybe this is just how you always are.

342
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:31,310
I saw there were times your face
turned gloomy during the recording...

343
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:33,620
If I got it wrong,

344
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,850
I'm really sorry.

345
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,450
I said something wrong.

346
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:40,420
Who are you to say that?

347
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:42,170
That's right.

348
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:44,140
I have neurogenic gastritis.

349
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:46,990
I'm not quite able to eat
during recordings.

350
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:49,320
After drinking a spiked drink
three years ago,

351
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:52,160
the company has set a rule
for me to avoid any outside food.

352
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,080
-Oh, that's why...
-But...

353
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:58,350
My face turned gloomy
at times during the filming

354
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:01,870
was not because of my physical condition.

355
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:03,140
Huh?

356
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,450
Well, then it's because...

357
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:07,860
It's because of

358
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,500
Mr. Na Aejoon.

359
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:12,820
Huh?

360
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:19,990
Did I do something wrong...

361
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:25,900
We exchanged numbers and I even
took the initiative to text you.

362
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,340
Yet you didn't reply.

363
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,980
Are you

364
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:33,660
drawing a line with me?

365
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,580
Me?

for today's recording too.]

00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:41,120
Please take care of me
for today's recording too.

368
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:45,260
How could I ignore my bias's text...

369
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:48,530
I didn't mean to ignore it.

370
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:51,140
I might have seen it while I was working
and forgot to reply...

371
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,050
Really!

372
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:54,600
How could I not reply to your messages...

373
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,740
So...

374
00:20:55,740 --> 00:21:00,240
It didn't go as I thought,
so I felt really upset and stiffled.

375
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,530
I couldn't even look at your face all day.

376
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:06,570
I mean...

377
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:10,450
Why would someone like you
b-be upset because of

378
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:11,980
someone like me?

379
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,840
This is really...

380
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,480
How should I put it?

381
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,590
I-I don't understand.

382
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:20,260
I'm already making it so clear.

383
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:22,660
Do you still not understand?

384
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:36,160
You don't seem to hate it though...

385
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:43,160
I'm flirting...

386
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:48,410
with you, Mr. Na Aejoon.

387
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:54,220
Since the first time I met you,

388
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:57,330
I've been interested

389
00:21:57,330 --> 00:21:59,410
in you.

390
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:10,980
[In the next episode]

391
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,980
Kyusung wants to break up.

392
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:16,200
I don't know what to do.

393
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,890
You can't do this to Jooha.

394
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:21,030
We can't do this to Jooha.

395
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:23,830
I think he's seeing someone else.

396
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:26,550
Do you want to meet today?

397
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:28,270
I'm very interested

398
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:31,030
in you.

399
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:35,640
Are you... seeing someone?
