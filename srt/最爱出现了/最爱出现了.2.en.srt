Congratulations on your comeback, A-One!

8
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:14,820
As far as I know, Siyeol and Jooha are
famous for being very close friends,

9
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:15,560
right?

10
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,080
Yes.

11
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,340
Siyeol and I met
when we were in middle school.

12
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:20,180
I think we've known
each other for the longest time.

13
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,660
Right. Before Jooha became an actor,

14
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:25,050
we practiced together all day.

15
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:27,960
We were roommates when we were trainees.

16
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,190
We are the closest.

17
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:30,890
That's right.

18
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:32,680
Very close.

19
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:37,060
I see. That's why you volunteered
to wake Choi Siyeol up today.

20
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:40,820
Oh... You volunteered to do that?

21
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:45,320
It's your first comeback in 3 years.
I have to be here.

22
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,400

Yes, Siyeol.

36
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:44,610
I'll do it.

37
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:46,090

38
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:47,540

[Episode 2: Can you like me?]

40
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:04,270
Of course, I know we are the same age,

41
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:08,240
and would be better suited to
go on the show with you.

42
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,680
But if there could be someone else
who's better at being on a show...

43
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,640
I said you're my type.

44
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,580
Huh?

45
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:18,650
I'm not talking about the image I want to
portray on the show.

46
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:20,820

47

How do I respond...

51
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:47,070
I was really looking forward to today.

52
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:50,829

I'm not doing it.

119

Haven't you always
wanted to act in movies?

123
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,730
What's wrong?

124
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:13,470
You have to make things clear–

125
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:15,350
What about you?

126
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:17,870
Did you make things clear?

127
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:21,520
When you broke up with me
on your own accord.

128
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,930
Ji Kyusung.

129
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:26,280
Did you make things clear?

130
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:32,480
You have a... new boyfriend, right?

131
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,350
Yeah.

132
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:45,890
You should have told me earlier.

133
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:49,250
Now that I'm hearing it myself,

134
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,720
I'm finally understanding it.

135
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,090

138
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:12,200
All the way at the end of the first floor
is the nurse's office.

139
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,490
There'll be a snack shop
outside the teaching building.

140
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:18,220
Do the teachers go to the snack shop
often too?

141
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,460
Of course.

142
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:24,150
When we don't have classes,
we'd go there to get a drink.

143
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:26,670
My training period was very long

144
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:28,530
so I've always wanted something like this–

145
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:30,270
to eat bread or instant noodles
with my friends

146
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:32,480
at the snack shop.

147
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:36,780
You like instant noodles so much
but you can only eat salad.

148
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,080
How did you know?

149
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:42,799
I was just talking about myself.

150
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:46,260
I may not look like it,
I am quite mindful of what I eat.

151
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:52,960
Do you want to
eat instant noodles with me?

152
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,330
Huh?

153
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,420
A day where there's no set lunch menu–

154
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:01,510
let's go eat instant noodles
at the snack shop together, Mr. Na.

155
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,650
Stop, Na Aejoon!

156
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:08,460
He's just asking you to eat together
at the snack shop!

157
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,620
Enough. Stop imagining.

158
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,240
Shall we then?

159
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,110
Next, it's this way.

160
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:25,860
That building is the secondary building.

161
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:28,040
If you go through that building,

162
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,310
you'll see the back gate of the school.

163
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:31,450
We're heading towards the gym right now.

164
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:33,000
I like it.

165
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:36,080
What?

166
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:38,670
Seeing snow.

167
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:39,790
It's pretty. I like it.

168
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:41,470
Oh, yeah.

169
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:44,540
I love snow.

170
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:47,770
Can you be clearer with the
subject matter next time?

171
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:48,240
Huh?

172
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,580
After all, I'm a Korean language teacher.

173
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,720
I'm quite sensitive to that.

174
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,980
Ah... I'm sorry.

175
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,270
No, no.

176
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:57,560
Let's go somewhere else.

177
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,970
On days like this
where it's cold and snowing,

178
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:04,430
we'd hold our PE lessons indoors.

179
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,850
Siyeol is so handsome!

180
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:20,740
Siyeol, you're amazing!

00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:34,990

like playing basketball.

184
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:57,390
Mr. Na Aejoon?

185
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:00,390
Are you okay?

186
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:01,200
What?

187
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,180
Yes.

188
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,490
I-I'm fine.

189
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,020
Can we take a break?

190
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,430
Cut.

191
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:15,590
I'm sweating, so I'm going to get changed.

192
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:18,360
-Shall we go eat first then?
-Okay.

193
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,080
Let's have lunch first.

194
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,060
Let's meet back here at the gym at 2 p.m.

195
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,620
-Okay, got it.
-Okay.

196
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,900
Let's go.

197
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,040
I almost got into trouble.

198
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,690
I finally made it.

199
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:49,430
If this continues,
I'm afraid my heart will be gone.

200
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:53,310
Was coming to school such a happy thing?

201
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,810
Ah, it's time for A-One's concert's ticketing.

203

Mr. Na.

204
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,060
How was it?

205
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,230
Did it go well?

206
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:06,590
Well, I guess so.

207
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:07,170
Oh.

208
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:09,270
It's my first time,
so it's kind of awkward.

209
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,590
Right?

210
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:13,080
The students seem
to be having a lot of fun.

211
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,910
They keep looking out
of the window during class.

212
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,570
I didn't know them previously.

213
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,210
A-One, was it?

214
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:19,640
Is this boy group that famous?

215
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,110
They're really famous.

216
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,840
They sang that song.

217
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:26,370
You'll know when you hear it.

218
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,890
Are there 5 people in their group?

219
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:30,640
No, it's 4.

220
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,720
There were 5 predebut.

221
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,590
But one of them quit
because of an injury–so it's 4 now.

222
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:36,170
I'm not sure.

223
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:37,300
Isn't it 6?

224
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:40,140
No, it's 4...

225
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,680
How many of them are there?

226
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,860
Mr. Na, you're young, so you should know.

227
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,840
Well... I'm not sure.

228
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,410
I don't watch TV often.

229
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:49,830
I don't think he's eating with us.

230
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:51,220
I didn't see him.

231
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,230
He's a celebrity.

232
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,120
This is his job.

233
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,070
I'm sure he wants to
go home as soon as possible.

00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:59,990
I want to go home.

235
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:00,890
You're right.

236
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:04,210
If everyone goes up to him saying
they're his fan, it could be tiring.

237
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:05,530
Of course.

238
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:06,560
I won't be able to do it.

239
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,760
I'm quite envious, though.

240
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,230

Speaking of, that teacher in-charge of you,

253

Mr. Na Aejoon,

254
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:47,030
he's so bad in front of the camera.

255
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:49,920
Are you sure it's okay?

If I want to make you feel comfortable,

257
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,910
should I ask them to replace him?

258
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:59,250
No. Just leave it.

259
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,140

269
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:36,540

270
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,420
No, not really.

271
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,020
It's just to tell you
I got the allowance you sent over.

272
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:42,800
It's not much.

273
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,740

they're his fan, it could be tiring.

Of course.

294
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:31,220

for a split second.

295
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,650
It's ridiculous.

296
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:37,350

312
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:41,660

316
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,460

317
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,680

318
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,770
Yeah, in this weather...

319
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,010
I knew it.

00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:04,440
Do you feel burdened

321
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,920

322
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:12,900

when I first came to

326
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,290

327
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:38,250
the determination I made right here

328
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:42,940
has disappeared just with

329
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,760
a word of his.

331
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,500
You're so cool in everyone's eyes.

332
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,990
You're good at shows too.

333

so there are many bad shots.

338

caused trouble to everyone.

339

I'm sorry.

340
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:44,570
What are you sorry for?

341
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:45,970
It's my first time too.

342
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:49,090
I'm really nervous too.

343
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:53,800
Would a professional
like you be nervous too?

344
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:57,610
That's interesting.

00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:03,460

346

00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:15,510
W-Wish?

349
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:19,270
Is there anything you want me to do?

00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,860
has disappeared completely

356
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:42,080
have one.

00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:14,670
I forgot to put stickers inside.

364
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:16,000
I'll do it.

365
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,140
-Will you do that?
-Yes.

366
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:19,920
Thank you.

367
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,440
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

368
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,290
Gosh.

369
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,180
[In the next episode]

370
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,230
Nice to meet you.

371
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:45,320
I'm the Korean language teacher,
Choi Siyeol.

372
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,900
Siyeol's face that I always see
in videos...

373
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,160
You really did a good job.

374
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,210
Ah... Yes.

375
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:52,560
-Good work.
-Good work.

376
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,300
Yes.

377
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,140
This face is so...

378
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,920
unfamiliar.

379
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,300
The atmosphere is different.

380
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,500
Did something happen?

381
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:04,170
It's better not to see it now, right...

382
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:06,470
Did I do something wrong...

383
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:07,470
Yes.

384
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:08,920
Mr. Na Aejoon,

385
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,020
it's all because of you.

386
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,510
Huh?
