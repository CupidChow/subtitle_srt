00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,430
   

4
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:23,170
   

5
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:25,990
   

6
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:27,770
   

7
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:32,010
   

8
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:34,730
   

9
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:49,030
   

10
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,390
   

11
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,200
   

12
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:06,420
 Are you crazy? 

13
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,360
 How am I supposed to trust you? 

14
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,420
 Aren't you leaving? You were in a hurry. 

15
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:14,900
Damn.

16
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,640
Dragon.

17
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,080
You...

18
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,650
Huh?

19
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,050
You...

20
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:37,530
  ­ 

21
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:50,220
How unlucky.

22
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:53,260
You psycho pervert!

23
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:54,930
You're the pervert.

24
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:56,340
You peeped at me...

25
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,160
and I was a victim.

26
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:05,830
Is barging in your hobby, Team Leader Baek?

27
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:08,450
How did you know my...

28
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:10,940
I don't even like your name.

29
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,790
   

30
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:17,550
So...

31
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,480
you are...

32
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,510
the director?

33
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:25,030
Yes, I'm not a psycho pervert. I'm the director.

34
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:27,330
This time, we clearly...

35
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:29,340
have met before. 
    

36
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,330
How can this...

37
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:34,760
How can this be a coincidence?

38
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,250
It's an unfortunate one.

39
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,360
Not a good one.

40
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:44,660
Well, Director,

41
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:47,140
what I said before I knew you were the director

42
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,570
is quite simply what I said before I knew.

43
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,500
- So, you— 
 - I'll forget about it.

44
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,030
Yes, I'd appreciate it if you did...

45
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,400
So easily?

46
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,760
- Don't like it? 
 - Sounds good.

47
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,710
But you should forget, too.

48
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:03,750
You and I never met outside the office.

49
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,680
You didn't see anything just now either.

50
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,090
Would that be possible?

51
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:10,060
- Yes. 
 - I'll keep an eye on you.

52
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,860
You can leave.

53
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,780
Baek Su Jeong is on danger level one.

54
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,850
Be on alert.

55
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:40,320
I'll never forget it. It was too powerful.

56
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,510
 Looks like a junk car, but I'll pay for the repair. 

57
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:44,320
 Call my lawyer. 

58
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,100
 He's not only a player and a psycho, 

59
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,460
 he even had a dragon tattoo. 

60
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,230
And he's my director?

61
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,790
I know they're all bad,

62
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:52,310
but how does this make sense?

63
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:54,170
That happens often in internet novels.

64
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:56,490
Right, I saw it in a webtoon recently, too.

65
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:59,420
That's why it's a novel and a cartoon.

66
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:01,510
I really wanted to do well this time.

67
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:04,290
He wanted to start fresh. Maybe he's professional.

68
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:05,560
I have a bad feeling.

69
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,190
He wanted us to move on,

70
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,890
but it didn't feel like that'd happen.

71
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:11,480
I'm sure that asshole holds grudges.

72
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,310
You'll find out eventually.

73
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:15,030
Don't worry in advance.

74
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:17,030
Eat this first.

75
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:19,980
I made it spicy, just the way you like it.

76
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,330
Looks tasty.

77
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:30,250
It's spicy. It's a perfect stress relief.

78
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:32,950
I should forget.

79
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:35,800
I'm off work. Why think about the director?

80
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,660
Right. What about my car repair fee?

81
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,370
Can you even see the scratch?

82
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:42,680
You might as well get a new car.

83
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,400
You work for a department store, but you're so frugal.

84
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,220
No.

85
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,520
I still have debt and Dad needs a retirement fund.

86
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,770
I need to save more. A long way to go.

87
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:51,920
Seriously, what a filial daughter.

88
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,270
You are, too.

89
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:55,150
I'm not anymore. I got divorced.

90
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:58,870
Let's kill him for making you an unfilial daughter.

91
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:02,640
It's so tasty. Why are there no customers?

92
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,430
Is it the location?

93
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:06,280
Do you want to promote it on Storygram?

94
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,010
Storygram?

95
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:09,680
 Geez. 
   

96
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,660
Now, I get how painful it is to be creative.

97
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:23,280
 A visit you'd never forget. 

98
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,500
 Sulo means love. 

99
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,480
 I haven't had a chance to introduce myself. 

100
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,740
I'm Ban Ju Yeon.

101
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:34,560
My goal as the strategy director is clear.

102
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,480
The Yongsung Department store's sales

103
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:40,160
will be doubled. I'll make that happen.

104
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,680
You don't have to worry too much.

105
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,160
I'll create the big picture...

106
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,570
and you just need to paint by numbers.

107
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:47,360
And...

108
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:52,790
I hear Team Leader Baek is very competent.

109
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:54,720
Thank you.

110
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,460
But you had an interesting nickname.

111
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,230
Was it "Director Killer"?

112
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:00,660
Let me make things clear.

113
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,670
I'm not like the former directors.

114
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,390
If we fought, I'd be the winner.

115
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:05,510
You'd be the loser.

116
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:08,980
You'd be leaving the company, too.

117
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:16,510
Yes.

118
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,850
That was a powerful introduction.

119
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:21,800
It had to, so they don't get distracted.

120
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,120
Doubling the sales.

121
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,240
You want them to think only about the goal.

122
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,190
Yes, that's correct.

123
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:31,100
Here's the espresso you drink every day.

124
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,580
- Thank you— 
 - It's a triple shot one.

125
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:37,230
Pardon?

126
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,330
I thought you'd be tired from commuting.

127
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:41,210
So, I prepared a special one.

128
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:43,330
Try it.

129
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:50,190
It's perfect.

130
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,550
You can leave.

131
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:05,520
There should be a law against drinks like this.

132
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:11,180
Everyone seems to know you're the Director Killer.

133
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,020
He's hostile toward you already.

134
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,070
I know.

135
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:19,810
Did it go well when you said hello yesterday?

136
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:22,330
- Pardon? 
 - You went to say hi to him yesterday.

137
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:25,070
Did things seem okay then?

138
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,230
Yes, I suppose...

139
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:31,020
 You psycho pervert! 

140
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,310
It's okay.

141
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:34,230
It must be because of the rumor.

142
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:35,920
You can do better from now on.

143
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,310
Right?

144
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:42,670
I think you should try sucking up to people.

145
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,210
- Sucking up to people? 
 - Huh?

146
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:47,370
Isn't that the director?

147
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:51,890
I'll meet you in the office. Sorry.

148
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:56,040
   

149
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,980
   

150
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,190
Did you want to get that?

151
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,970
Looks like you love sweets. I do, too.

152
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:06,970
Do I seem like that?

153
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:08,080
Pardon?

154
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,750
I'll have a triple shot of espresso.

155
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,000
I only drink espresso.

156
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,780
I wanted to pay for it.

157
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,430
Why would you pay for mine?

158
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,870
I have a discount coupon. It's your first time here.

159
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:21,040
No need to suck up to me.

160
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:27,850
That jerk.

161
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:40,080
   

162
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,030
   

163
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,830
Let go. I had it first.

164
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,220
Adults should concede to children.

165
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,340
Children should be respectful to adults.

166
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:04,520
I really want this one.

167
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,380
I'm sure. You can't even get it outside of Korea

168
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:09,020
no matter how much you pay. It's the space edition.

169
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:12,110
But it was out on the streets. Of course, you want it.

170
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:13,580
I admit you have good taste.

171
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:16,410
But I need to have it, too.

172
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,660
Huh? Not bad.

173
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:24,530
Mom, this man is weird!

174
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,980
Where did Mom go?

175
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:32,250
Director.

176
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:34,320
What are you doing here—

177
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,900
How about you, Ms. Baek?

178
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,340
Are you following me or something?

179
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,520
No.

180
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,360
I needed to pick up something.

181
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,070
Are you buying that one?

182
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:46,620
You must like toys.

183
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:49,570
This isn't just a toy—

184
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:58,280
This child wanted it so badly.

185
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,100
It's precious stuff.

186
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,750
I'm getting it for him since he wants it so badly.

187
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:05,200
You're much sweeter than I thought.

188
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,130
You must be happy to receive the gift.

189
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:08,290
But this man—

190
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:09,290
Go on your way now.

191
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:13,210
I don't want any unwanted interest.

192
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:15,020
Okay.

193
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,400
Goodbye.

194
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:51,130
 No way. 

195
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:54,100
 I've been hiding my true self perfectly, 

196
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:57,220
 but someone almost caught me three times? 

197
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,710
 She's dangerous. 

198
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:02,370
 This might damage my public persona. 

199
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:09,960
Baek Su Jeong's danger level went up by two.

200
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,820
Very dangerous.

201
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,690
She must be...

202
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:15,710
eliminated.

203
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,860
 Eliminate? 

204
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:21,500
Team Leader Baek Su Jeong?

205
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,980
Yes.

206
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,000
You mentioned her nickname

207
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,720
just to keep her on alert.

208
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,740
She caused trouble by getting the directors fired,

209
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,280
but it wasn't her fault.

210
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,590
- Right. 
 - But why—

211
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:34,840
Based on my observation.

212
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:39,010
Team Leader Baek is too dangerous.

213
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:40,300
How strange.

214
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,870
She seemed like a talent you'd appreciate.

215
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:45,930
Not at all.

216
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:51,280
Are you questioning my judgment?

217
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,070
Do you think I want to fire her because

218
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:55,710
of my personal reasons or feelings?

219
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:56,950
That can't be.

220
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,400
You have no personal life because

221
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,740
you always prioritize the company and results.

222
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,620
I know that better than anyone.

223
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:05,570
Yes, it seems that way.

224
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:07,250
Of course. If so,

225
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,600
how will you eliminate her?

226
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,340
If you just fired her, it'd be an unjust dismissal.

227
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:14,200
She won't just let it happen either.

228
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,260
That never happens at Yongsung.

229
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:20,070
I'll make her leave on her own.

230
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:22,630
   

231
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:24,600
   

232
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,690
   

233
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:28,810
How's the South American market advancement going?

234
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,050
The on-site survey was finished.

235
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:32,470
We're choosing the right brands for the market.

236
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:36,030
Did you carry out the field research correctly?

237
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:41,780
Didn't you say one cannot carry it out without perfectly knowing the language?

238
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:44,850
Because language is culture.

239
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,220
There's a saying that goes like...

240
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:58,810
Anyone who doesn't dare jump into the sea wouldn't be able to cross it.

241
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:02,870
I'm certain we're ready to jump in.

242
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:07,200
What will the market share be in South America?

243
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,150
It's 8.74573%.

244
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:10,380
Our goal is 14%.

245
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,790
Is it a plausible goal?

246
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:15,130
It will be in three years if we work aggressively.

247
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:16,310
That's easy to say.

248
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:17,510
It's not hard at all.

249
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:18,730
You're too confident.

250
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:20,960
Are you an arrogant type?

251
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,570
Anyone can talk.

252
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:27,700
I'll prove it with the results.

253
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:37,620
Team Leader Baek is very good.

254
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,480
She was well prepared, too.

255
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,950
Does that matter now?

256
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:45,330
She's nothing but my target.

257
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,650
You know how to give answers, Su Jeong.

258
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:56,900
That's a compliment, right?

259
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,900
Thank you.

260
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,600
He obviously wanted to defeat you.

261
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,150
But you had to one-up him.

262
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:06,030
Meetings aren't kids' fights.

263
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:08,530
I was just answering his questions.

264
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:10,580
But I'm happy you think I won.

265
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,360
I hate losing.

266
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,790
Right.

267
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:16,740
You fight like a dog, no matter who it is.

268
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:19,290
I acknowledge that, at least.

269
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:21,020
Like a what?

270
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,150
Can you call yourself

271
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:24,690
a person when you're so relentless?

272
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:26,750
Stop staring so intensely.

273
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,080
Don't your eyes hurt?

274
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,840
Why is she so tough and aggressive?

275
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,940
Women get criticized because of ones like you.

276
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,570
Senior,

277
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:37,830
don't dump shit because we're in the bathroom.

278
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:40,110
Please watch what you say.

279
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,780
- What? 
 - You're my senior at work,

280
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,870
but you're nothing outside.

281
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:49,420
I said something so you don't get fired. What the—

282
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,210
We worked hard to come this far.

283
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:52,660
You gave up on getting married

284
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:55,520
and I acted like a dog to come this far.

285
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:59,440
So, can't we all just get along?

286
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,300
We can fight the ones who are after us.

287
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:07,770
I'm grateful if you were genuinely concerned,

288
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:09,800
but I'd rather walk out on my own.

289
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,840
I won't get fired or anything like that.

290
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,240
Because my pride won't allow that.

291
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,990
Okay.

292
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:19,950
Invite me to your send-off party regardless.

293
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:29,530
Why is all this happening today?

294
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:34,810
Hello.

295
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,010
Excuse me, Na Na,

296
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:40,630
we haven't met since the welcome party.

297
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:43,450
Are you finding things okay here?

298
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:45,260
W-Well, yes.

299
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,930
That's good to hear.

300
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:50,780
By the way, how did you know my name?

301
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:53,040
Because it's pretty.

302
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,860
- Pardon? 
 - Your name is pretty.

303
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:58,010
How could I have forgotten it?

304
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:04,390
Are you free now, by chance?

305
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:06,290
I'd like to grab coffee with you if it's okay.

306
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:08,350
I have some questions, too.

307
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,370
F-For me?

308
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:11,890
Yes.

309
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,320
Okay, sounds good.

310
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,520
I have plenty of time.

311
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:21,290
How's the research I requested going?

312
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:24,440
I've been asking people, but

313
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,750
there isn't much.

314
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,730
Do I have to keep doing this?

315
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:30,540
It just feels wrong. I don't feel good.

316
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:33,390
It's still work. Keep at it.

317
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:35,650
Why do you ask me this instead of Chief Kwon?

318
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:37,900
Do you need my help, too?

319
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,510
Right now,

320
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:42,630
I have no time to be so careful.

321
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,600
I'm sorry. A-Are you okay? I'm sorry.

322
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,290
What? Did something happen?

323
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:58,330
Why are you sorry?

324
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:01,670
Thank you.

325
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:07,240
Well, by chance,

326
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:10,940
do you have a girlfriend?

327
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,870
Yes.

328
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:17,950
She'll be here soon.

329
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:19,990
I'm sorry.

330
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:22,900
- Enjoy, then. 
 - Okay.

331
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:35,980
What? What did you talk about with her?

332
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:38,570
You came. You must be hungry. What should we eat?

333
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:40,930
I asked what you talked about.

334
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:46,250
- Well— 
 - She asked your number, huh?

335
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,080
Of course, I said no.

336
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,200
I said I was waiting for my girlfriend.

337
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,320
Did you smile again?

338
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,310
Were you friendly?

339
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:55,230
I was just being polite.

340
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:57,990
You're way too polite.

341
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,720
This is annoying. I won't come back here.

342
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,080
Okay, we won't.

343
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,720
I'll take you somewhere better next time, miss.

344
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,150
So, what would you like?

345
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:15,030
We have a new director.

346
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:16,360
Let's have a fresh start.

347
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:19,360
- Cheers. 
  - Cheers. 

348
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:25,090
This isn't a send-off party, right?

349
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:26,350
What are you talking about?

350
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:27,610
I heard the director...

351
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:29,840
openly attacked you during the meeting today.

352
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,540
But you fired back every chance you got.

353
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:36,110
Everyone already says he hates you.

354
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,290
I know.

355
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:40,500
I knew he'd hold grudges.

356
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,690
It's okay. I've been hated before.

357
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:43,690
Don't worry so much.

358
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,650
But things are different this time.

359
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:47,290
How are they different?

360
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:48,750
Don't you know?

361
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:51,000
Well, haven't you heard the rumor?

362
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,590
What? W-What rumor?

363
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:23,980
You don't have to welcome me like this.

364
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:25,690
How did you find us here—

365
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:26,860
I heard you were having a team dinner.

366
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,490
Wasn't it to welcome me?

367
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:31,270
You said it won't be necessary—

368
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,650
Yes, this is your welcome dinner.

369
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:36,060
This was that dinner.

370
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,600
Yes.

371
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,710
Surprise.

372
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:41,370
I'll join you to be polite.

373
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,550
Why are you all standing?

374
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:47,740
You're making me feel uncomfortable.

375
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,950
There's too much fat.

376
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:13,520
Would you like a glass?

377
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,000
I'll pour it myself.

378
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:24,080
Aren't you drinking, Ms. Baek?

379
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,790
I should drink, too, of course.

380
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,160
A bottle of soju, please!

381
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,410
Two bottles, please!

382
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:29,170
Why are they drinking so much?

383
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:31,510
Even I feel sick.

384
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:34,370
This will take long. I should leave now.

385
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:36,230
Hold on. You're just leaving?

386
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:37,340
What about the director?

387
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:38,340
Why would you worry?

388
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:42,360
I've never seen him drunk.

389
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:45,560
He takes perfect care of himself.

390
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,790
So, we can leave if we want to.

391
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:51,790
I've never seen the Team Leader drunk either—

392
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,060
Should we leave, then?

393
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:57,460
Really? Can we?

394
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:08,490
What? What? Are you struggling?

395
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:09,720
Do you want to stop?

396
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,910
I'm totally fine right now.

397
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:14,660
Aren't you the one who's struggling?

398
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:16,780
Do you want to give up right now?

399
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:19,900
Give up? Me, Ban Ju Yeon?

400
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:22,570
We're just getting started.

401
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:25,830
Aren't you going too far?

402
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:28,410
You wanted to forget about the accident and stuff.

403
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:30,790
It wasn't all my fault either.

404
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:32,060
What accident?

405
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,780
I...

406
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:36,480
have no memory. I already forgot.

407
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,270
Why are you doing this, then?

408
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:40,670
What did I do, exactly?

409
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:43,010
You're treating me like a thorn.

410
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:45,440
A thorn in your side.

411
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:51,380
I'm an earthworm

412
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:53,580
that twists the more you crush and

413
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,770
a weed that grows stronger

414
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:57,580
when you try to pull it.

415
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,940
I've been like that my whole life.

416
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:03,020
I attacked when people tried to break me.

417
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:05,490
So, no matter what you do,

418
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:07,880
I'll just continue working hard.

419
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,210
I'll do everything I can.

420
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:14,270
But I'm sure you don't like that.

421
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:17,760
I don't dislike it.

422
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:23,340
No boss dislikes a hardworking person.

423
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,150
They do.

424
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:26,780
They say I'm dogged.

425
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:29,780
Weak people don't like the strong ones.

426
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:32,200
Incompetent people don't like the competent ones.

427
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,810
Of course,

428
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:37,640
I'm not like that at all.

429
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,680
And...

430
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:44,180
to be exact, I don't dislike you.

431
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,280
You're dangerous.

432
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:58,380
So, I want to eliminate you.

433
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:01,590
Pardon? Eliminate?

434
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:03,220
Poof.

435
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:13,260
You're like a ticking time bomb.

436
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:16,450
Did you call me a bomb just now?

437
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:25,560
Ma'am, two more bottles of soju, please!

438
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,650
 Coming! 

439
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:31,300
Can we do it?

440
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:44,800
Gosh, how nice.

441
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,600
   

442
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:49,950
   

443
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:53,070
   

444
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:54,240
   

445
00:24:56,770 --> 00:25:00,120
 I want to be born in the ocean like a clam 

446
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,160
 and swim in alcohol. 

447
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,090
What an interesting restaurant.

448
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:14,860
What?

449
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:16,650
He's dead.

450
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,240
Director,

451
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,160
wake up, please?

452
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,150
Director...

453
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:32,580
Go home and sleep.

454
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:34,420
Ahjussi.

455
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:36,300
Chocolate...

456
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:40,800
What did you say?

457
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,310
Chocolate milk.

458
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:46,810
Chocolate milk.

459
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:51,000
He said he only drinks espresso.

460
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,870
Drink chocolate milk at home.

461
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:56,360
What's your address, Director?

462
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,150
Address.

463
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:05,200
Please take him to Yongsang Palace, sir.

464
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,200
Okay.

465
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,690
   

466
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:28,150
Dad.

467
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:29,770
Daughter!

468
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:31,210
Are you getting off work now?

469
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:32,730
Did you work late again?

470
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:35,090
A team dinner. Why are you leaving now?

471
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:37,000
Huh? I haven't left yet.

472
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,350
A bathroom is leaking in Complex 8. I need to go.

473
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:41,400
At this hour?

474
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,460
The owner said it has to be now.

475
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:46,190
What? How dare they exploit you like this?

476
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:48,040
No one's exploiting me.

477
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,590
I said I'd come.

478
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:52,170
I need to work while I can.

479
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:55,360
What if I can't afford my hospital bill later?

480
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:58,420
I was young when Mom was sick.

481
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:00,950
I make good money now. Don't worry.

482
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:03,490
Don't work too hard. Think of your age.

483
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:07,020
Hey, I'm still young. I'm spry.

484
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:11,380
I smell the salonpas.

485
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:14,230
How about you? Is that alcohol?

486
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:16,730
How much did you drink?

487
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:19,920
It happens when you're a professional.

488
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,780
It's not easy making money.

489
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:25,350
You're right.

490
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:27,570
I should've gotten you one, too.

491
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:30,370
It's okay. I'd love some cold beer.

492
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:33,010
Cancel the appointment, then.

493
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:34,860
All right.

494
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:09,460
 Chocolate milk. 

495
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:13,190
 Chocolate milk. 

496
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,850
No way.

497
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:28,430
I...

498
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,650
I lost?

499
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,200
Baek Su Jeong.

500
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:45,880
She ended up destroying my public persona.

501
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:52,280
I'll never forgive her.

502
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:09,630
I hear you're pursuing the renewal project.

503
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:13,190
Yes, the reason the sales have been stalled

504
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:15,400
is because there have been no new customers.

505
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,400
To the customers who like new things,

506
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,810
our current old image is a deal breaker.

507
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:23,570
The renewal will attract new customers.

508
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,240
It'd be a pretty big project.

509
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,780
It'd cost a lot, too.

510
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:30,760
A large investment is sometimes needed for growth.

511
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,510
It'd be good for the future, too.

512
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:41,010
I hope I don't get disappointed.

513
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:42,960
Like I was before.

514
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,810
 Grandma! Don't do it, Grandma! 

515
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:49,740
 Grandma! Grandma! 

516
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:54,520
I'll...

517
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:57,370
never disappoint you again.

518
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,870
You got home safely last night, right?

519
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:08,480
Yes, of course.

520
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,770
I knew it.

521
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:11,890
You never get drunk anywhere.

522
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:14,330
No mistakes mean no need to fix anything.

523
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:17,980
You're exactly like the chairwoman that way.

524
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:21,150
If you keep at it, she'll acknowledge the fact

525
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:24,180
that there's no better successor than you.

526
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:26,890
And I think so, too.

527
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,260
 I want to eliminate you. 

528
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:37,160
 Eliminate? 

529
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:46,630
 You're like a ticking time bomb. 

530
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,960
Hello.

531
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,660
How are you not hungover at all?

532
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:59,420
You drank a lot more after we left, right?

533
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:01,570
Wow, I'm so jealous.

534
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:03,410
You digest alcohol like no one else.

535
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:06,230
How do you think I was able to come this far?

536
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:07,880
It's all thanks to my liver.

537
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,480
Being smart goes without saying.

538
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,290
So, you've used that power

539
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:13,680
to destroy your bosses in every gathering?

540
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,760
It's not my fault that they got defeated.

541
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:20,770
Did you destroy Director Ban last night, too?

542
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:24,180
Gosh, please!

543
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:26,320
You should've let him win this time.

544
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,160
I don't know how to lose.

545
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,830
You're so cool.

546
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:31,680
You're so impressive.

547
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,910
It's crazy.

548
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:34,540
Did the new director

549
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:37,620
act drunk in front of you, too?

550
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:39,290
He just fell asleep.

551
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:40,450
Right.

552
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:44,140
He asked for chocolate milk when he got drunk—

553
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:46,230
Aren't you guys working?

554
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:50,740
It's work hour right now.

555
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:52,890
Did you finish analyzing the portfolio?

556
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:54,970
How about the project plans?

557
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:57,980
Yesterday, you said...

558
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,840
I'll finish it as soon as possible.

559
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:06,360
Do you know how earthworms and weeds survive?

560
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:10,360
Because humans spare them.

561
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,170
Earthworms die when you step on them

562
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:14,460
and weeds die once you pull them.

563
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:17,160
I spared you because I didn't want to bother.

564
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,640
You think you're still here because you're good?

565
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:22,120
You need to know your place.

566
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:25,760
If you don't want to be discarded.

567
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:37,270
Team Leader.

568
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:48,880
But...

569
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,590
Team Leader?

570
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:55,460
Hey!

571
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:57,780
So what if you're a director?

572
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:59,180
Are you crazy?

573
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:01,180
- How dare you barge in here— 
 - How dare I?

574
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:04,150
How dare you look down on me and insult me?

575
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:07,850
We're both just humans outside of work, okay?

576
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:09,790
Team Leader Baek Su Jeong.

577
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:11,350
What, Mr. Ban Ju Yeon?

578
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:13,880
Let's fight outside without the titles, okay?

579
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,280
Bring me the resignation letter first.

580
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:18,940
You wanted to remove the titles.

581
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:21,140
Weren't you prepared to do that?

582
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:23,280
Do you want to get fired?

583
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:29,740
Fine, fire me! Fire me!

584
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:31,710
- Is that so hard? 
 - I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

585
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:34,580
Come, come. She's drunk. She's drunk.

586
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:37,240
- I'll resign! 
 - Let's get out of here. Let's go!

587
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:40,820
- I can resign right now. 
 - Let's go. Let's go.

588
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:50,830
She'll have to walk out on her own after all this.

589
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:52,170
If you continue,

590
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:53,500
you might be reported

591
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,180
for bullying or power-tripping—

592
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:56,920
I know.

593
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,050
I went too far.

594
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,290
Here.

595
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:16,750
I understand he made you angry.

596
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:18,780
I feel angry, too, but—

597
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:20,430
I went too far, right?

598
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:22,380
I did act like a crazy person.

599
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:25,290
I should've held back, no matter what he said.

600
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:27,490
But I couldn't help it. What was I to do?

601
00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:30,330
Can he say or do whatever because he's a boss?

602
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:32,560
Can a rank and file not say anything?

603
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,740
Of course not.

604
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:36,280
We're all employees who try to make a living.

605
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,350
That's not true.

606
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:40,290
He's not just an employee like us.

607
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:41,730
What is he, then?

608
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:44,300
Does he get paid by the hour instead?

609
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:47,320
How can you joke right now?

610
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:51,360
You really don't know?

611
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,460
The rumor spread since his first day.

612
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:56,590
That rumor is true.

613
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:57,940
Rumor?

614
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:00,660
That he's the chairwoman's only grandson.

615
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:03,360
He's not a salaryman. A third-generation chaebol.

616
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:06,700
Director Ban is the heir to Yongsung.

617
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:10,210
- Are you sure? 
 - Yes.

618
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:11,970
Chief Kwon In Gyeong, who's always with him

619
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:13,750
was the chairwoman's direct secretary.

620
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:16,490
I knew you had some idea.

621
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:18,460
No wonder.

622
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:21,690
He was bratty on a chaebol level.

623
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:24,040
I thought he became a director early

624
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:26,300
because he's competent like me.

625
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:29,160
Will I really get fired, then?

626
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,520
Okay, okay. Listen.

627
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,870
Beg for forgiveness now.

628
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:34,980
He'd forgive you if you begged. Okay?

629
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:39,020
I really want to continue working with you.

630
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:43,580
Team Leader. Team Leader.

631
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:45,230
What are you thinking right now?

632
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:47,440
A way to prevent him from firing me.

633
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,030
Pardon?

634
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:54,300
I've never seen a chaebol who's flawless.

635
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:01,460
I collected all opinions on Team Leader Baek.

636
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:03,970
 She's always been scary as a competitor 

637
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:06,000
 but a dependable partner. 

638
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,730
 Anyway, she's a bit tiring. 

639
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:10,350
 The Team Leader? She's my role model. 

640
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:12,870
 She's a bit difficult. 

641
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:14,370
 I find her difficult. 

642
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:17,500
 But she's a cool person. Really. 

643
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,940
She sounded like a hard worker.

644
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:22,110
If I had to criticize her,

645
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:24,520
she's too intense, work-obsessed, and dogged.

646
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:27,610
That makes her a good match for you. That's all.

647
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:29,310
- What? 
 - Why?

648
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:30,900
Didn't you want me to look into her

649
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:32,280
because you're interested?

650
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,220
I'm all for it for now.

651
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:35,670
You haven't dated since

652
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:37,140
you got dumped by your first love.

653
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:38,770
It can't go on like this.

654
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:42,540
I'm glad you decided. Let's overcome this now.

655
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:47,470
I said I'd cut ties with you if you bring that up again.

656
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,140
Was I wrong?

657
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,900
Anyway, why are you curious about her?

658
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,810
Never mind. I don't need to know anymore.

659
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:56,100
It's all over now.

660
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:59,130
 ­  

661
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:04,980
 ­   

662
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:07,300
Let me find one thing. One thing.

663
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:11,090
Is he pretending to be a commoner or what?

664
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:41,480
When will he come out?

665
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:00,020
Look at that outfit.

666
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:04,280
Geez, where's he going, exactly?

667
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:14,740
   

668
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:51,110
Be careful.

669
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:35,960
♫  Follow, follow  ♫

670
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:38,570
Everyone, jump!

671
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:01,200
♫  I've been watching you for a long time  ♫

672
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,930
♫  I've been watching you for a long time  ♫

673
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:08,540
♫  It's okay to be awkward  ♫

674
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:13,500
♫  Let's give ourselves to the music  ♫

675
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:17,870
♫  Everything cools down when the morning comes  ♫

676
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:21,870
♫  The Green Light that illuminates us  ♫

677
00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:25,910
♫  Let everything be in my hands, in the rhythm  ♫

678
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:29,660
♫  Like this, it's so hot tonight, it's party time!  ♫

685
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:49,610
He's totally different than he is at work.

686
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:52,730
I really don't recognize him.

687
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:00,430
This is totally...

688
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:02,590
 Instead, you should forget, too. 

689
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:06,750
 You and I never met outside the office. 

690
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,620
A double life?

691
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:11,400
Yes.

692
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:15,000
He wanted me to forget because he's guilty.

693
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,580
I don't care anymore.

694
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:19,370
   

695
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:24,650
   

696
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:33,370
Who's here at this hour?

697
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:36,940
- Who is it? 
 - I don't know.

698
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,400
Who are you?

699
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,830
 Ms. Baek Su Jeong? 

700
00:42:43,830 --> 00:42:45,950
 Let's talk for a moment. 

701
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:48,120
Do you have a boyfriend?

702
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,540
You should've told me.

703
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:51,910
Don't let him in!

704
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:01,120
We need to talk.

705
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:16,800
What did you want at this hour?

706
00:43:19,290 --> 00:43:20,510
Why did we come to a place like this?

707
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:22,160
You said you wanted to talk.

708
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,440
Shouldn't we eat and talk?

709
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:27,180
I picked a comfortable, tasty, and clean one nearby.

710
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:28,660
What's this about?

711
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:32,020
I decided to change my plan for you.

712
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:34,170
You'll no longer be eliminated.

713
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:37,120
You'll be watched closely and protected.

714
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,480
Pardon?

715
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:45,210
What's this...

716
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:50,280
"Baek must delete the photos of Ban immediately."

717
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:52,710
 Everything about Ban Ju Yeon's personal life 

718
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:54,810
 cannot be revealed to the public. 

719
00:43:54,810 --> 00:43:58,270
 Baek must respond to Ban immediately. 

720
00:43:58,270 --> 00:44:00,270
 As long as Baek follows the agreement, 

721
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:03,990
 Ban guarantees Baek's job safety. 

722
00:44:03,990 --> 00:44:05,030
Do you mean it?

723
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:07,160
Our needs are clear. Let's not waste time.

724
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:09,060
Sign it.

725
00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:24,760
 I don't like your name, even. 

726
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:27,190
   

727
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:35,140
I think I have an ordinary name.

728
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:36,150
What do you mean?

729
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:37,890
You said you didn't like my name.

730
00:44:37,890 --> 00:44:39,790
What's wrong with it?

731
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:42,840
Just delete the photos.

732
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:45,670
You really can't fire me anymore.

733
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:53,290
Why is he so into dragons?

734
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:55,160
   

735
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:59,480
Didn't it hurt when you got the dragon tattoo?

736
00:45:00,530 --> 00:45:03,620
It's henna, not a tattoo.

737
00:45:15,310 --> 00:45:18,150
   

738
00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:21,640
Hello, good morning.

739
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:23,630
Good morning!

740
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:25,800
Good morning, guys.

741
00:45:27,090 --> 00:45:29,720
Team Leader, you're in a good mood today.

742
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:31,520
Is it obvious?

743
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,770
Do you know what's

744
00:45:33,770 --> 00:45:35,700
the most important to office workers?

745
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:37,780
Vacation. Salary.

746
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:39,160
They're correct answers,

747
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:42,650
but job security is crucial.

748
00:45:46,070 --> 00:45:48,990
Good morning, Director.

749
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:55,260
Yes, good morning.

750
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:04,260
He greeted you back.

751
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:11,260
- Enjoy your meal. 
 - Enjoy your meal.

752
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:15,650
   

753
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:20,460
Put this away for me. Sorry.

754
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:25,240
   

755
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,550
   

756
00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:30,830
Shit.

757
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:35,980
   

758
00:46:37,190 --> 00:46:38,600
 Come to the director's office. 

759
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,860
Geez.

760
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,070
You want me to read all this—

761
00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:46,550
Don't read it. Destroy it.

762
00:46:46,550 --> 00:46:48,030
Right there.

763
00:46:48,030 --> 00:46:48,980
Why?

764
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:51,580
Don't you want to work after securing your job?

765
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:54,960
You said you'd work hard, no matter what.

766
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:07,350
Isn't this too noisy?

767
00:47:07,350 --> 00:47:09,120
Why does it have to be here...

768
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:11,590
There are paper shredders outside, too.

769
00:47:11,590 --> 00:47:14,280
Can I do this outside?

770
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:16,120
Please?

771
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:22,560
Did you say something?

772
00:47:23,950 --> 00:47:26,460
I suppose it wasn't noisy.

773
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:31,890
Are you taking revenge on me by chance?

774
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:33,230
I'm watching you.

775
00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:35,580
You discovered a top secret and threatened me.

776
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:37,640
You should've expected this much.

777
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:42,620
But why are the photos top secret?

778
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:45,040
I sent them to you because you wanted to hide it.

779
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,720
I didn't think it'd work.

780
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:50,330
Did you forget who I am?

781
00:47:50,330 --> 00:47:52,850
Because he's Yongsung's successor?

782
00:47:52,850 --> 00:47:55,120
Is a successor not a human?

783
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:57,790
Your fashion sense is a bit lame

784
00:47:57,790 --> 00:48:00,310
and the way you enjoy concerts

785
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:02,530
is a little too intense, but—

786
00:48:02,530 --> 00:48:04,890
Are you insulting me or defending me?

787
00:48:04,890 --> 00:48:06,310
Anyway,

788
00:48:06,310 --> 00:48:09,040
it's nothing compared to what other chaebols appear on the news for.

789
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,180
Why are you hiding it so much?

790
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:12,110
It's unnecessary to reveal for

791
00:48:12,110 --> 00:48:14,690
the successor who needs to be perfect.

792
00:48:18,210 --> 00:48:22,210
People often ask you why you try so hard, right?

793
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:26,040
Why do you try so hard?

794
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:31,700
Because that's how I've lived.

795
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:33,970
This is the way I've lived.

796
00:48:33,970 --> 00:48:35,640
My answer is the same.

797
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:38,320
This is my way. So,

798
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:41,170
let's stop wasting time and finish work.

799
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:53,860
I'm finally going home.

800
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:03,520
   

801
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,460
 Su Jeong, could you send me 

802
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:07,320
 the photo you mentioned? 

803
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:09,610
The photo?

804
00:49:09,610 --> 00:49:11,920
Why are you looking at my phone?

805
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:14,060
Did you forget you were to be watched closely?

806
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:16,590
But still, it's my phone.

807
00:49:16,590 --> 00:49:18,320
She means the food photo. The food photo.

808
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:19,870
She runs a restaurant.

809
00:49:19,870 --> 00:49:23,670
She didn't mean your photo. Don't worry.

810
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:27,310
I'm telling you the truth.

811
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:29,890
Anyway, I finished the task. I'll go home now.

812
00:49:29,890 --> 00:49:31,370
You can't.

813
00:49:31,370 --> 00:49:33,060
How am I supposed to trust you?

814
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:35,520
Will you watch me all day, then?

815
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,100
- Yes. 
 - Pardon?

816
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:38,930
Follow me.

817
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:54,730
I choose this one.

818
00:49:54,730 --> 00:49:56,490
Why are you shopping for yourself?

819
00:49:56,490 --> 00:49:58,730
The drama, "Lovers in Paris."

820
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:01,310
I thought you were going for that vibe.

821
00:50:01,310 --> 00:50:03,670
I'm here to buy clothes for myself.

822
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:05,010
We're going this way, not that way.

823
00:50:05,010 --> 00:50:07,730
Why did you bring me here, then?

824
00:50:07,730 --> 00:50:09,330
Huh?

825
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:24,470
I don't like it.

826
00:50:24,470 --> 00:50:27,510

00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:02,880
♫  Keep falling to love, oh, tonight  ♫

841
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:05,550
♫  Shine a light on my heart  ♫

842
00:51:05,550 --> 00:51:09,350
♫  One more time, fire up  ♫

843
00:51:09,350 --> 00:51:11,650
♫  My love  ♫

844
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,340
Go and get changed.

845
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:18,520
You can't go like that.

846
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:20,810
Where are we going now?

847
00:51:20,810 --> 00:51:23,090
And this isn't even my style.

848
00:51:23,090 --> 00:51:24,910
I'm not interested in your style.

849
00:51:24,910 --> 00:51:26,750
Get changed.

850
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:49,620
♫  The moment I hold your hand  ♫

851
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:52,160
♫  It's all right, it's so high  ♫

852
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:54,270
♫  I can't hide my feelings  ♫

853
00:51:54,270 --> 00:51:56,430
♫  I'll work up my courage and tell you  ♫

854
00:51:56,430 --> 00:51:58,370
♫  My first love is calling me  ♫

855
00:51:58,370 --> 00:51:59,680
♫  I've been waiting  ♫

856
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:02,340
♫  It feels like I'm flying  ♫

857
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:04,760
♫  It's nice to see you again  ♫

858
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:06,830
♫  Be my first love  ♫

859
00:52:06,830 --> 00:52:10,000
I told you. It's not my style.

860
00:52:10,790 --> 00:52:12,870
It doesn't suit me, right?

861
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:18,860
I guess it doesn't.

862
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:21,440
You're lending it. Return it by tomorrow.

863
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,740
I'll return it now. Let me go home.

864
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:25,500
It's a no.

865
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,120
Shit.

866
00:52:35,870 --> 00:52:37,260
   

867
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:43,050
I think this is it.

868
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:45,580
   

869
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:46,890
Are you a customer?

870
00:52:46,890 --> 00:52:48,470
Are you here for the restaurant?

871
00:52:48,470 --> 00:52:50,780
Are you the owner? Are you open?

872
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:52,700
Of course. Come on in.

873
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:54,560
Okay.

874
00:53:17,380 --> 00:53:20,400
   

875
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:25,260
Are you okay?

876
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:29,180
Sir?

877
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:38,470
So muscular.

878
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:41,870
Well, a-are you okay?

879
00:53:41,870 --> 00:53:45,180
I'm fine, as you can see.

880
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:47,370
Anyway, what's wrong with him?

881
00:53:47,370 --> 00:53:50,280
Go inside. I'll put this away and join you.

882
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:51,710
Let me help you.

883
00:53:51,710 --> 00:53:52,900
No, it's okay.

884
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:54,960
I don't mind it.

885
00:53:56,190 --> 00:53:57,870
Oppa.

886
00:53:58,710 --> 00:54:00,360
What are you doing?

887
00:54:02,610 --> 00:54:04,460
Here's your order.

888
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:06,540
Thank you.

889
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:09,450
Oppa.

890
00:54:09,450 --> 00:54:11,670
You must be hungry. Let's eat.

891
00:54:11,670 --> 00:54:13,180
I've been thinking.

892
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:14,940
Yes, what have you been thinking?

893
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:17,650
I'm not sure if you really like me.

894
00:54:17,650 --> 00:54:19,080
How do you not know?

895
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:21,200
I adore and love you.

896
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:23,270
But you do this to anyone.

897
00:54:23,270 --> 00:54:24,770
You're nice and sweet.

898
00:54:24,770 --> 00:54:26,220
And you smile.

899
00:54:26,950 --> 00:54:29,680
But you're my only girlfriend.

900
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:31,380
So, what?

901
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:33,850
You're the same before or after we started dating.

902
00:54:33,850 --> 00:54:36,030
You think so?

903
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:42,980
Let's break up.

904
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:51,090
- Eun Hee. 
 - I was happier before we dated.

905
00:54:51,090 --> 00:54:55,530
I feel too nervous and pathetic now.

906
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:03,540
Okay, then.

907
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:05,110
Let's break up.

908
00:55:05,710 --> 00:55:06,960
What?

909
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:09,240
Just like that?

910
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:13,290
I prefer you to be happy than feel pathetic.

911
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:19,330
Wow.

912
00:55:21,730 --> 00:55:24,780
You really are a jerk.

913
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:36,990
Do you want this?

914
00:55:38,090 --> 00:55:41,500
Do you want to feed a jerk like me?

915
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:42,790
Did you cheat?

916
00:55:42,790 --> 00:55:44,010
No, of course not.

917
00:55:44,010 --> 00:55:45,980
You're not much of a jerk, then.

918
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:49,240
You were just nice to everyone.

919
00:55:49,870 --> 00:55:53,000
But people call that cheating.

920
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,730
You have to cheat to be a cheater.

921
00:55:55,730 --> 00:55:57,550
I know.

922
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:00,150
Here you go.

923
00:56:00,150 --> 00:56:02,840
Wow, the sashimi aged well.

924
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:04,840
Good sizes, too.

925
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:06,190
That's good to hear.

926
00:56:06,190 --> 00:56:09,660
Could you give me a bottle of soju?

927
00:56:14,690 --> 00:56:18,730
♫  Oh, money and love  ♫

928
00:56:18,730 --> 00:56:22,570
♫  ­Winners of the game, money and love  ♫

929
00:56:22,570 --> 00:56:26,330
♫  ­Winners of the game, money and love  ♫

930
00:56:26,330 --> 00:56:30,340
♫  ­Winners of the game, money and love  ♫

931
00:56:30,340 --> 00:56:32,620
♫  ­Winners of the game, money and love  ♫

932
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:36,630
♫  Drops of champagne as I raise the bottle­  ♫

933
00:56:36,630 --> 00:56:40,550
♫  Millions, millions, millions, babe on the table­  ♫

934
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:42,750
How cheap.

935
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:45,740
Why are we here, anyway?

936
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:48,390
I'm here to meet an important client.

937
00:56:48,390 --> 00:56:51,780
I came for your peace of mind,

938
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:54,540
but don't introduce me as your girlfriend.

939
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:57,860
I don't want to get involved with a chaebol.

940
00:56:57,860 --> 00:56:59,630
Ms. Baek?

941
00:56:59,630 --> 00:57:00,870
Yes?

942
00:57:00,870 --> 00:57:03,250
Do you think I want to get involved with you?

943
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:05,140
Isn't the Cinderella story getting too old?

944
00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:07,490
Stop making it obvious that you're old.

945
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:09,920
Okay. It must be nice being young.

946
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:13,020
I actually don't like it.

947
00:57:14,430 --> 00:57:16,510
Hey, isn't that Ban Ju Yeon?

948
00:57:16,510 --> 00:57:18,700
Ban Ju Yeon of Yongsung?

949
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:21,180
It's him.

950
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:22,890
What's he doing here?

951
00:57:22,890 --> 00:57:24,170
Those losers.

952
00:57:24,170 --> 00:57:26,090
 - What? 
 - You were still alive. 

953
00:57:26,090 --> 00:57:28,440
Wait here. Don't go anywhere.

954
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:29,850
Pardon? Wait?

955
00:57:29,850 --> 00:57:31,990
How long should I wait—

956
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:34,220
Geez, that psycho.

957
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:36,390
I should run away.

958
00:57:38,530 --> 00:57:40,930
I'm hungry.

959
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:43,750
Hey, Ban Ju Yeon.

960
00:57:43,750 --> 00:57:45,510
I thought you were in the US.

961
00:57:45,510 --> 00:57:47,040
When did you come to Korea?

962
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:49,520
You must really be working at the department store.

963
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:50,610
Impressive.

964
00:57:50,610 --> 00:57:53,320
Hey, I thought your grandma abandoned you

965
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:55,440
because she didn't get you a position.

966
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,060
Hey, don't say that.

967
00:57:57,060 --> 00:57:59,110
He hasn't received a stock yet.

968
00:57:59,110 --> 00:58:03,010
He'd be left high and dry at this rate.

969
00:58:03,010 --> 00:58:05,460
You guys are as fun as ever.

970
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:07,690
We do have a lot of fun.

971
00:58:07,690 --> 00:58:10,990
Hey, you should enjoy your life, too.

972
00:58:10,990 --> 00:58:13,500
You can't do anything because of your grandma.

973
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:16,190
I'm not sure. I think I enjoy life, too.

974
00:58:16,190 --> 00:58:17,350
What are you saying?

975
00:58:17,350 --> 00:58:19,680
You didn't drink or gamble in the US.

976
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:21,200
You had zero fun there.

977
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:22,590
You came here alone, didn't you?

978
00:58:22,590 --> 00:58:26,030
Go and get him a nice-looking one.

979
00:58:26,030 --> 00:58:27,840
A nice looking one?

980
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:29,150
Should I?

981
00:58:29,150 --> 00:58:31,920
- No thanks. 
 - You're no fun. Saying no again?

982
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,510
Alcohol, women, and gambling.

983
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:36,420
Your idea of fun is so obvious. It's pathetic.

984
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:38,270
It's so trashy.

985
00:58:38,270 --> 00:58:39,760
What?

986
00:58:43,430 --> 00:58:44,590
What did you say just now?

987
00:58:44,590 --> 00:58:46,290
Trashy, I said.

988
00:58:46,290 --> 00:58:48,570
But it's funny how you always provoke me.

989
00:58:48,570 --> 00:58:50,260
I should probably let you win.

990
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:54,050
You don't even know the expression "high and dry."

991
00:59:07,170 --> 00:59:08,910
I haven't seen you before.

992
00:59:08,910 --> 00:59:10,560
You know me, right?

993
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:12,440
What? Are you a chaebol, too?

994
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:14,920
Yes, I am a chaebol.

995
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:17,150
Want to hang out with me if you're alone?

996
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:20,510
I must be a customer of your company, then.

997
00:59:20,510 --> 00:59:22,240
Why do you talk to me casually?

998
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:24,600
Shouldn't you be polite to your customer

999
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:26,670
if you're a chaebol?

1000
00:59:28,030 --> 00:59:29,900
This bitch is funny.

1001
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:31,240
When I first saw you,

1002
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:35,240
I knew you weren't one of us.

1003
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:38,290
You were a customer, huh?

1004
00:59:38,290 --> 00:59:39,640
Okay.

1005
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:42,270
I'll treat you like a queen.

1006
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:44,630
In bed.

1007
00:59:44,630 --> 00:59:46,230
Let go. Let go, I said!

1008
00:59:46,230 --> 00:59:47,920
I liked your feisty mode.

1009
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:49,400
I know your kind well.

1010
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:51,680
Stop playing hard to get. Come.

1011
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:58,540
 What's going on? 

1012
00:59:59,650 --> 01:00:01,960
Are you out of your mind?

1013
01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:05,670
 What's wrong with them? 

1014
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:50,660
Babe, let's go.

1015
01:00:52,250 --> 01:01:00,680

1029
01:01:50,150 --> 01:01:52,260
 Baek Su Jeong, on the watch. 

1030
01:01:52,260 --> 01:01:53,350
 Keep the dress. 

1031
01:01:53,350 --> 01:01:55,860
 I don't need it and it was pretty on you. 

1032
01:01:55,860 --> 01:01:58,740
 I thought you disliked the director. 

1033
01:01:58,740 --> 01:02:00,340
 There's nothing to like or dislike. 

1034
01:02:00,340 --> 01:02:01,570
 He just needs to be good at his job. 

1035
01:02:01,570 --> 01:02:04,550
 Do you think destiny is a real thing? 

1036
01:02:04,550 --> 01:02:08,000
 So, like me all you want. 

1037
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,840
 I'll like you more freely now. 

1038
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:11,120
 In front of you. 

1039
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:12,800
 I got it as an opening gift. 

1040
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:14,490
 Who sent you a gift like this? 

1041
01:02:14,490 --> 01:02:15,350
   

1042
01:02:15,850 --> 01:02:17,600
 Black Dragon? 

1043
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:19,360
♫  I'll shine bright  ♫

1044
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:23,240
♫  Brighter, shine a light  ♫

1045
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:27,610
