00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:54,320
I did my duty as an executive. Don't worry.

188
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,770
Just focus on your recovery.

189
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:58,490
Yes, of course.

190
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:02,290
Also, I'm sorry I came by late at night.

191
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:03,520
I was feeling impatient.

192
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,780
Team Leader Baek is a crucial member.

193
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:10,210
It's my fault for having a talented daughter.

194
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,960
I admire you.

195
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,760
Rest well, then. I'll leave.

196
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:21,230
Just one moment, Dad.

197
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:31,720
You must be close to your father.

198
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,320
You could say that.

199
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,680
Thank you.

200
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,010
I would've been flustered if I were alone.

201
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:41,720
We get to enjoy the VIP ward, thanks to you.

202
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,890
It's so nice.

203
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:50,870
What?

204
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:53,200
You've been smiling a lot.

205
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,460
You don't usually smile.

206
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,150
Let's not overdo it.

207
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:02,440
You don't have to see me off.

208
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:34,870
<i>This is the Director's phone number, right?</i>

209
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:36,650
<i>Thank you so much for today.</i>

210
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:38,720
<i>Get home safely.</i>

211
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:54,800
Dad!

212
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,870
Dad.

213
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:01,790
You haven't met your future daughter-in-law.

214
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:03,430
You can't leave yet.

215
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:05,020
I'll be good to you.

216
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,630
I said I'd pass the exam at once.

217
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:09,620
Dad.

218
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:12,230
Don't die, Dad.

219
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:13,600
You heard him, Dad.

220
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,040
What?

221
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:17,780
You mean that, son?

222
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:20,350
Noona, are you crazy?

223
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:21,700
You're stupid, more like.

224
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:24,010
Go ahead and help Dad.

225
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,420
What's with the VIP ward, by the way?

226
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,770
You didn't win the lottery while I was gone, right?

227
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:35,680
Did you secretly move, too?

228
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,500
Is our place still there?

229
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,460
Dad. Noona.

230
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:40,690
You'd better be honest.

231
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:42,330
Gosh, how noisy.

232
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:44,080
Since when was he so talkative?

233
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,010
Try studying for the government exam.

234
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:47,470
You don't ever get to talk.

235
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:49,510
I eat, sleep, and poop alone every day.

236
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:52,160
I talk to the lecturer in the videos now.

237
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,370
I see.

238
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:55,330
So, what's with the ward?

239
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:56,780
Did you really win the lottery?

240
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,560
Is it stock? Crypto?

241
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,630
My friends all lost money.

242
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:03,910
Su Jeong's director got me this room.

243
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:05,430
Director?

244
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:07,530
- Is it a man?
- Yes.

245
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:08,900
Are you two dating?

246
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,590
- Are you crazy?
- How old is he?

247
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:14,100
He looked very young. How old is he?

248
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,430
Probably the same age as him.

249
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:17,410
Geez. He's the same age?

250
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:20,180
He can't be dating you, then.

251
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:23,010
Why do you say that? I don't like it.

252
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:25,610
Someone my age won't find you attractive.

253
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:26,920
You're too old.

254
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,410
What?

255
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:51,090
<i>I left a gift for your father at the front desk.</i>

256
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:52,830
<i>Pick it up.</i>

257
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:02,640
Thank you.

258
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:10,900
<i>They're giving out stuffed animals.</i>

259
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,440
<i>Why would you want a stuffed animal?</i>

260
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:15,330
<i>It's cute and free.</i>

261
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:18,800
<i>Cute? That stuff?</i>

262
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:22,570
Seriously. He's funny.

263
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:25,780
How cute.

264
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,800
I've never seen Team Leader using her vacation.

265
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:37,210
I know. It's her first time since I came here.

266
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:38,960
Everything is okay with her, right?

267
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,780
Should we give her a call?

268
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,230
Hello.

269
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:45,150
Deputy Yun from the legal team.

270
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:46,540
What brings you here?

271
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,350
I saw the post on the company bulletin board.

272
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:50,160
I'm here to pick my stuff up.

273
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:53,660
Oh, the...

274
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:55,210
The capsule...

275
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:57,920
Yes, the capsule toy.

276
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:01,730
That's yours, Deputy Yun? Really?

277
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:03,200
Yes.

278
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,250
It's my hobby to collect these.

279
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:09,590
Are there any issues?

280
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:11,320
- No, no.
- No.

281
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,260
It's so unexpected.

282
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,280
Carry on, then.

283
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,520
- Yes, see you.
- Take care.

284
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,900
<i>You left the toolbox at home.</i>

285
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,670
<i>Do you need it?</i>

286
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,250
Dad!

287
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,910
What? Why are you here?

288
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:55,500
Why? You were here alone all weekend.

289
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,980
I'll be here starting today. Go home.

290
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:01,520
You're studying for the exam. You don't have time.

291
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,730
You don't have time for this, either.

292
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:05,510
I can study here.

293
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:06,920
It's nicer than my tiny dorm.

294
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:10,070
Don't be silly and go study.

295
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:13,400
You aren't his only child.

296
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,530
- What?
- I'm his son, too.

297
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:20,750
And how will we survive if you get sick, too?

298
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:24,360
You pay for my tuition and rent.

299
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:28,020
I'll care for him. Go rest.

300
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,340
Stay just for today, then.

301
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:39,720
I was going to get a caretaker starting tomorrow.

302
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,020
Okay.

303
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,240
Don't leave him alone.

304
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,070
Make sure he eats a lot, too.

305
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,390
Okay.

306
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:48,760
Don't get lazy and call me if anything happens.

307
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,100
Okay, just leave-

308
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,010
Be quiet.

309
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:55,330
Sorry.

310
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:57,610
Don't eat Dad's food.

311
00:23:57,610 --> 00:23:59,930
I just ate. I'm fine.

312
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:11,400
- Here.
- Sorry for bothering you.

313
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:15,300
By the way, why didn't you call the lawyer?

314
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,900
It was my fault. I was going to

315
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:19,160
compensate you if you had called.

316
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:22,100
I ripped that business card.

317
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,210
You ripped the business card?

318
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:24,510
I was so pissed.

319
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:27,020
You know I'm kind of passionate.

320
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:29,680
I'll compensate you now.

321
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,820
It's okay.

322
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:33,030
I sold the dress, not knowing it was a gift.

323
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:35,040
I have conscience, too.

324
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,340
Okay, then.

325
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:39,240
I'll go now, then.

326
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:10,320
The window won't roll down.

327
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,230
Does anything work? Can you drive it?

328
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:13,890
Of course. I drove it here.

329
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:16,450
It sometimes stops, but it's fine.

330
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:18,260
You call this fine?

331
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:20,350
As the future leader of Yongsung Motors,

332
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:22,390
I can't tolerate this.

333
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:24,300
Let's go to the service center immediately.

334
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,550
I'll just get it fixed later.

335
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,580
What if you get into an accident?

336
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:32,120
Who will care for you then?

337
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,240
Get off now unless

338
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,390
you want to get hospitalized, too.

339
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,620
How's your father doing?

340
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:50,230
He just needs to rest and recover.

341
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:53,560
You won't be crying again, then?

342
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:56,130
Who cried? Me?

343
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:57,560
You cried that day.

344
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,420
- Did you peep at me?
- I was watching.

345
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:00,900
No need to feel embarrassed.

346
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,540
Humans are weak anyway.

347
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:05,370
- I'm not, okay?
- Let's say you aren't.

348
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:09,660
It wasn't because of my dad.

349
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:11,170
I just...

350
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:14,720
I just thought of my childhood.

351
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:19,380
My mom was very sick when I was a kid.

352
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:22,490
She was stuck in the ward until she died.

353
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:25,520
I can't help thinking of her

354
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,790
when I'm at the hospital.

355
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:29,200
Even though a lot of time has passed.

356
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:34,410
Time can't be a cure for all.

357
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:38,690
You need other comforts to heal and forget.

358
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,180
For example?

359
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:45,440
There's music, cartoons, and...

360
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,690
video games.

361
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:50,240
Video games. You're right.

362
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,940
Video games do suck you in.

363
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,530
I used to play a bit.

364
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:55,960
It's fun.

365
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,780
Although I was hurt by it.

366
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:04,060
- Hurt?
- You could say I was a scam victim.

367
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,930
It happens all the time.

368
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:14,250
Is there a serious problem?

Do you want to go out with me?

I had to know your name to ask you out.

You're more formal than I thought.

571
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:05,400
That means my feelings for you are serious.

did you get divorced recently?

To be honest, I find it to be a bother.

583
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:39,420
Would it be better to blame it on a painful divorce?

758
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:52,610
What is it all of a sudden?

759
00:48:52,610 --> 00:48:55,440
The shop list from the business team.

760
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,170
Is it the final version?

761
00:48:57,170 --> 00:48:59,790
There are too many absurd brands.

762
00:48:59,790 --> 00:49:02,690
Gangnam store's sales will go down at this rate.

763
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:05,650
Those absurd brands were all

764
00:49:05,650 --> 00:49:07,030
recommended by the Director.

765
00:49:07,030 --> 00:49:09,450
That's why no one can say anything.

766

Don't blame an innocent person.

769
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:19,290
Is that true?

770
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:20,930

Is it true you chose them?

775
00:49:38,090 --> 00:49:40,680
Yes. Is there an issue?

776
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:42,750
Yes, there are so many issues.

777
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:45,420
Even you can't make decisions like that.

Being the perfect successor...

780
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:58,180
you had mentioned was something like this, Director?

781
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,670
That's it for today.

782
00:50:13,670 --> 00:50:18,050
Any more concerns about the Gangnam store shops?

783
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:26,670
Let's proceed, then.

784
00:50:26,670 --> 00:50:28,320
No, hold on.

785
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:31,010
Three of the new brands are lesser-known

786
00:50:31,010 --> 00:50:33,230
and their sales rate is low, too.

787
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:36,760
They don't fit the target customers, either.

788
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:38,300
I don't think they belong in

789
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:40,520
Yongsung Department Store.

790
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:43,810
I'm curious why you want them, Director.

791
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:47,930
Are you the only one

792
00:50:47,930 --> 00:50:50,390
who's curious about that?

793
00:50:53,970 --> 00:50:56,710
Everyone must've found it problematic.

794
00:50:56,710 --> 00:50:59,080
You should've complained.

795
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:01,400
But everyone kept quiet.

796
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:03,810
I see how you've been performing.

797
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:05,550
You've been so laid back

798
00:51:05,550 --> 00:51:07,410
that you fell for a trap like this.

799
00:51:07,410 --> 00:51:09,580
You were just following my decision?

800
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:11,270
I don't need an excuse like that.

801
00:51:11,270 --> 00:51:14,620
The company's gain is more important to me.

802
00:51:15,430 --> 00:51:18,460
I hope you learned what the priority is

803
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:20,720
going forward.

804
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:26,470
Individual reviews will start tomorrow

805
00:51:26,470 --> 00:51:28,870

00:51:28,870 --> 00:51:30,940
That's it for today's meeting.

807
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:47,080
Did Team Leader Baek leave?

808
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:49,560
No, she was getting some fresh air.

809
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:52,340
Thanks for the good info.

810
00:52:04,690 --> 00:52:06,160

811
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:08,270
Is there still an issue?

812

Could you stand away from me?

813
00:52:11,350 --> 00:52:14,040
I don't want to grab a director's collar again.

Have you done that?

815
00:52:18,230 --> 00:52:20,560
I don't think I've done anything that bad.

816
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:24,500
I don't like it when someone tests me.

817
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:26,100
I only did what was necessary.

818
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:29,250
I know, but I'm offended by it.

819

825
00:53:13,970 --> 00:53:16,330
You said you used to like to play games.

826
00:53:16,330 --> 00:53:19,560
I said I don't because I've been scammed.

827
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:21,740
That's an online game. We're at an arcade.

828
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:23,660
You won't get scammed.

829
00:53:24,450 --> 00:53:28,060

840
