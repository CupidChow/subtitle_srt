1
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:12,020


2
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,770
   

3
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:20,410
   

4
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,080
   

5
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,970
   

6
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:27,800
   

7
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:32,010
   

8
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,740
   

9
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:49,130
   

10
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,890
What's the name of the business?

11
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:54,030
It might be a place I know.

12
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:55,970
You probably don't.

13
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:57,310
I wonder if it's because it's out of the way.

14
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:58,910
For some reason, they don't get customers.

15
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:00,030
But the food is good.

16
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,860
Are you sure?

17
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:03,950
I have a very high standard.

18
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:07,510
Eat at home, then. I'll go alone.

19
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:10,910
Let's give it a shot.

20
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,240
I can do it myself.

21
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,600
How hard did you try to defeat me?

22
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:45,320
I can say the same to you.

23
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,260
All done.

24
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,590
Oh, my gosh. Oh, no...

25
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,920
Hurry, hurry.

26
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:21,310
- Unni, I'm in the front— 
 - Don't come.

27
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:24,060
- What? 
 - Don't come.

28
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,690
Black Dragon is here.

29
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,580
What are you doing?

30
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:51,180
Well...

31
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,330
At the shop, there is...

32
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:54,820
Black...

33
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,540
Black?

34
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,280
My dark history.

35
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,700
The one who scammed me in a video game.

36
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,630
He's created the darkest history of my life.

37
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,620
I can't visit him myself.

38
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,250
That's why you ran?

39
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,510
You're acting like a scammer yourself.

40
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:11,170
Use this opportunity to teach him a lesson.

41
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:12,230
Let's go.

42
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:14,960
I can't. My first love—

43
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:20,310
He's my first love.

44
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:22,140
He's not just a scammer.

45
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,610
I don't ever want to see him again.

46
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:25,820
I'd hate to see him.

47
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:29,860
I understand the sentiment.

48
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,140
I do, but...

49
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:34,150
this pose is a bit...

50
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,190
Sorry.

51
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:42,170
I didn't mean to do that.

52
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:45,170
I thought it was a wall. Why is your chest so...

53
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:47,200
solid?

54
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,920
Did you work out instead of working?

55
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,330
I do both, of course.

56
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:54,790
Go ahead and compare me to the wall.

57
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:56,750
- Enough is enough. 
 - Enough?

58
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:59,220
That word isn't in my vocabulary.

59
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,860
Will you keep hiding, then?

60
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,920
What if I went there and ran into him?

61
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,150
- What does he look like? 
 - Pardon?

62
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:09,320
We need to know what he looks like to avoid him.

63
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,480
I don't know.

64
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,890
I saw him briefly when he was young.

65
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:15,000
His face must've changed a lot.

66
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,860
Maybe you won't recognize him, then.

67
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,330
You're right.

68
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,880
Someone was walking by earlier.

69
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,400
Did he leave?

70
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,680
So, Black Dragon is Su Jeong's director?

71
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,860
Oh, my goodness...

72
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,620
Wow!

73
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,100
   

74
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,940
I can take a bus from here.

75
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:46,200
I'll get going, then.

76
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,340
I thought you were going to the office.

77
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:15,480
Which bus are you taking?

78
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:19,380
No. 770.

79
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,440
Will you wait with me?

80
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,290
I'm sure it'll be here soon.

81
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,760
I won it at the arcade.

82
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,130
I know you like this character.

83
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,690
What? Is it too touching?

84
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:11,420
I suppose. Who else would give you a gift but me?

85
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:13,890
You don't have to be so thankful.

86
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,550
It's not that.

87
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:26,860
Can't you just tell?

88
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,970
It's obviously fake.

89
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,900
You people just don't get it.

90
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,420
And this isn't just any character. It's Toggaengyi.

91
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,480
Toggaengyi. Toggaengyi.

92
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,690
He has a name.

93
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:39,250
Forget it if you don't like it.

94
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:42,370
I'll accept it out of politeness.

95
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:07,380
Get home safely.

96
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,730
Bye.

97
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:43,350
   

98
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:49,170
   

99
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:51,560
I heard the meeting yesterday was intense.

100
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,690
I heard you're the only one who survived.

101
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,100
Is that true?

102
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,120
Well, I suppose...

103
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,420
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

104
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,910
As you can see, the food section currently

105
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:18,220
focuses strongly on edible items.

106
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:21,130
They say it lacks diversity and approachability.

107
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:22,840
To attract new customers,

108
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,670
we need popular brands from social media.

109
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,650
They can't just be popular.

110
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:30,750
They shouldn't overlap with our competitors.

111
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,960
Here is a list of businesses I came up with that fit the criteria.

112
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,730
   

113
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,700
Nice.

114
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,690
Let's proceed with these.

115
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:43,430
Okay.

116
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:47,120
The food section is important for the customers and our profit.

117
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,950
It's the highlight of the renewal project.

118
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:50,740
Take extra care.

119
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:54,300
This is where you prove your ability.

120
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,720
Don't disappoint me this time.

121
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,220
It was such an intense morning.

122
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,730
So,

123
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:17,020
why did that bastard suddenly come to the shop?

124
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,720
- The thing is— 
 - You said you don't see him.

125
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,690
You said you only talk once in a while.

126
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:23,960
It's true. But he suddenly showed up.

127
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,100
Gosh, I don't know what to do either.

128
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,530
What am I supposed to do?

129
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:29,760
I didn't know what to do either.

130
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,560
I brought the director there, but we couldn't eat.

131
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,620
I know.

132
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,510
When did you get so close to him?

133
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:36,860
You said he was a psycho.

134
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:39,180
I suppose he isn't anymore.

135
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,850
Well,

136
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:43,860
as I got to know him,

137
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:47,270
he's not so bad, actually.

138
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,150
Not so bad?

139
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:52,350
Listen.

140
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,300
Let's say Black Dragon...

141
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,030
became a decent person like that director.

142
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,360
What would you think, then?

143
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,330
What? They have nothing to do with each other.

144
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:05,200
- But what if? 
 - I know.

145
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,900
How could he become a decent person?

146
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,490
He was never good.

147
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:11,140
Even if he won the Nobel Prize, he's still a scammer to me.

148
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,770
Nothing changes.

149
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:14,540
Do you want to switch jobs?

150
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,120
Why do you keep changing the subject?

151
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,980
Because you want him to keep coming to the shop?

152
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,970
I said I didn't make him come.

153
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:22,200
Who did, then?

154
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,610
Huh?

155
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,890
How strange.

156
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:29,110
Why won't you answer me? Huh?

157
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:33,350
Yes, Director.

158
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:36,310
You haven't changed the password yet?

159
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:38,840
I told you to change it quickly.

160
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,030
Okay, got it.

161
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:44,010
Something urgent came up at work. I need to go.

162
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:47,470
We'll talk later, okay?

163
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:54,880
What's the big hurry?

164
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:58,090
   

165
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:02,010
 I dropped off your bag. 

166
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,330
Director, wait for me. Please?

167
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,920
- Are you two close? 
 - Ha Jin.

168
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,270
What are you doing here?

169
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,620
I'm at work.

170
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,500
D-Did you come to see me?

171
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,850
Answer me first. Are you two close?

172
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:42,880
Pardon? Well, yes.

173
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,130
How close?

174
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:45,420
V-Very close.

175
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,760
Do you know his first love, too?

176
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,920
Of course, I know.

177
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,020
To Ju Yeon, his first love was

178
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:55,680
a loathsome curse.

179
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,980
And she still is.

180
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:01,120
 I know you want to play, Ju Yeon. 

181
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,990
 The grade is what matters, right? 

182
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:06,360
 You should relieve your stress on a day like today to maintain your grades. 

183
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,240
 Let's play together. 

184
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,030
 What should we play? Kart? 

185
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:12,250
 League? Star? 
   

186
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:16,310
 I want to play that. 

187
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:21,650
   

188
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:24,900
   

189
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,900
 Wow, you came all this way to visit me? 

190
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:31,850
 You're the best, Bbanjju. 

191
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:36,200
 Did you bring what I asked? 

192
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,360
 Fried chicken? Plain or spicy? 

193
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,650
 - Thank you. Have some. 
 - Wow! 

194
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:43,580
 Let's go. Let's go. 

195
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,390
 By the way, Hyung. 

196
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:51,950
 Yes? 

197
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:55,150
 I'll... 

198
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,510
 confess my love to Strawberry. 

199
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,080
 Oh my god. 

200
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:03,690
 How will you tell her? 

201
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:06,860
 How did you do it yourself? 

202
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:11,430
 I've always received it. I've never done it. 

203
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:12,930
 Just do it casually. 

204
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:15,250
 The sincerity is more important than the method. 

205
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:18,850
 And you're the handsome successor of Yongsung. 

206
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:20,420
 Who would say no to you? 

207
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:21,860
 Geez. 

208
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,760
 Geez, you're so shallow. 

209
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,000
 Strawberry doesn't know who I am. 

210
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,870
 She likes me for who I am. 

211
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,170
 You need to tell me if you start going out. 

212
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:37,500
 I'll give you 200 won if you've dated for 22 days. 

213
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,470
 22 days? 

214
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,230
 Okay, let's do this.­ 

215
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,730
 This is a collect call. 

216
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:58,060
 Please check the caller. 

217
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:00,570
 Bbanjju, it's Hyung. Don't hang up. Don't hang up. 

218
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:02,820
 - What is it? 
 - What do you think? 

219
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,920
 You haven't called me in a while. 

220
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,190
 Did you... 

221
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:07,930
 forget about me because you're busy 

222
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,680
 dating Strawberry? 

223
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,880
 Don't ever... 

224
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,270
 What? 

225
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:15,600
 Don't ever say that name again. 

226
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,740
 What? Why? 

227
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:19,180
 Did you get dumped by chance? 

228
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:22,630
 But why? You're not lacking in any way. 

229
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:23,820
 What's the problem? 

230
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,180
 My existence itself. 

231
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:28,550
 My existence itself disgusts her. 

232
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:31,570
 How could she be so cruel? 

233
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,340
 You shouldn't call me anymore either. 

234
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,810
 I won't do anything silly anymore. 

235
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:39,740
 Hey, hey, Bbanjju. Don't hang up. Don't. 

236
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:43,660
 That's probably when it started. 

237
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:47,090
He was acting his age briefly, but

238
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:51,260
he started only focusing on becoming the perfect successor.

239
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:53,590
A chaebol successor?

240
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:56,220
I'm glad he wasn't an alien or a thug. 
    

241
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,710
Excuse me?

242
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:59,240
Anyway,

243
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,020
that's how hurt he was by his first love.

244
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,830
Then why did he lie about his age?

245
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:06,080
I was shocked to see him at the meeting.

246
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,500
I know he lied about his age,

247
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,150
but saying his existence itself is disgusting?

248
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:11,760
That's too harsh.

249
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,640
I would've gotten hurt, too.

250
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:16,190
That's how upset she was, okay?

251
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:19,190
What she did was still bad.

252
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:22,160
Gosh.

253
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:26,110
Who's the actual bad person?

254
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:27,550
Do you mean Ju Yeon is?

255
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:29,930
You think it's Su Jeong, then?

256
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,750
Whatever.

257
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:35,110
They won't see each other again, anyway.

258
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:37,480
Of course, if they do,

259
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,280
I'm sure he wouldn't forgive someone

260
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,440
who left a blemish on his life.

261
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,910
He'll try to ruin her future, no matter what.

262
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:49,060
For one, she won't be able to live in this country.

263
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,990
No.

264
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:54,480
Will he kick her out of the company first?

265
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,930
He's so cutthroat and scary.

266
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:59,240
She won't be able to handle it.

267
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:02,830
Why are you so shocked?

268
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,120
Was that too scary?

269
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,970
Su Jeong is the scary one.

270
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:09,000
As far as I understand, she'll try to

271
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,090
repay him for the shame and humiliation.

272
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:13,830
"Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth"

273
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:15,970
is her life's motto.

274
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:18,770
Will Su Jeong have to leave the country?

275
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:23,000
Ju Yeon might have to leave the planet.

276
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,420
If so,

277
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,510
are you saying...

278
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:31,400
Su Jeong is as intense as Ju Yeon?

279
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,160
The Su Jeong I know?

280
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,930
Yes.

281
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:40,710
I'm so glad they'll never see each other.

282
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:43,010
What if they do?

283
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:43,710
Pardon?

284
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:46,860
What if they already see each other every day?

285
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:29,830
Let's see...

286
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:48,860
Wait! You've been talking about Team Leader Baek?

287
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,480
The Director Killer?

288
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:53,650
Why are they so quiet, then?

289
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,930
- By chance— 
 - Yes.

290
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:59,330
They don't recognize each other.

291
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:01,940
Wow. That's a relief.

292
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:04,680
I suppose it did happen so long ago.

293
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,960
They only met briefly, too.

294
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,800
It's too soon to feel relieved.

295
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:11,010
They grew close and something is up between them.

296
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:14,420
What if they grow closer and develop feelings for each other?

297
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:17,790
And if they find out the truth later...

298
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:22,330
   

299
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:24,860
   

300
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,240
- How awful! 
 - How awful!

301
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,900
We need to tear them apart.

302
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,930
We need to make sure they never recognize each other. Never.

303
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:32,500
Yes.

304
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,880
What are you doing right now?

305
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,720
What? We need to go up fast.

306
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,200
You can't even waste a second.

307
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,310
 ­  

308
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,370
By the way, you know Ms. Baek?

309
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:09,050
I looked into her a bit further.

310
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:10,940
Why do something so useless?

311
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:13,090
I said you can stop.

312
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:15,820
I thought I wasn't thorough enough then.

313
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,160
So, I looked into her further.

314
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,640
She seems more dogged and intense than I thought.

315
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,570
Wouldn't it be difficult to work with her?

316
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:25,650
That's why you said she'd be a good match for me.

317
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:28,000
There was another issue.

318
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,730
Looks like she's interested in someone at work.

319
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,960
She's interested in someone?

320
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,560
Yes, she is, apparently.

321
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,800
I know you despise office romance.

322
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:42,190
You warned me not to date anyone at work.

323
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:45,290
I'm asking if that'd still be okay.

324
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,030
I'm not sure.

325
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:04,320
She's interested in someone?

326
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:10,690
Could it be me?

327
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,350
That makes things difficult.

328
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,590
   

329
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,940
Unni.

330
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:43,030
You came. Where would you like to sit?

331
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,410
Su Jeong.

332
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,930
   

333
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:57,910
   

334
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:08,910
Gosh, I guess you can't sit here.

335
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:11,060
I'll move if someone comes.

336
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:15,560
So, what did you want to tell me?

337
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,540
You aren't introducing me to those men, right?

338
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:24,000
Nah!

339
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:33,140
 What are you doing after work today? 

340
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:35,050
 You'll go straight home, right? 

341
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:37,430
 Don't work late. Work alone if you need to. 

342
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:39,390
 Work late alone. 

343
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:41,210
What's her problem?

344
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:43,690
Is she bored because she gets no customers?

345
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:45,710
I thought it wasn't too bad.

346
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:49,870
I printed the sample logo.

347
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:53,220
Whoa, I love this one.

348
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:55,900
This is exactly how we imagined it.

349
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,380
You're right.

350
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:59,450
It's just the first draft, but it's pretty good.

351
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:01,340
We won't have to change it too much.

352
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:03,150
Whoa...

353
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,080
Chief Kim really is the best.

354
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,760
How is he always so perfect?

355
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,830
I can't believe it.

356
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,660
Na Na?

357
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,590
You're about to join his fan club, too.

358
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:21,280
- Fan club? 
 - I mean...

359
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,300
there's a fan club for Chief Kim at work.

360
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:27,480
I think the design team's Ms. Jeong is the leader.

361
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,900
Is he that popular?

362
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,150
Of course.

363
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:33,960
He's really cool, you know.

364
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,270
He's sweet, he smiles often,

365
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:38,720
friendly, and polite.

366
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,430
How do you know so well? You never worked with him.

367
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:45,090
We had coffee together once.

368
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:47,290
He wanted to ask me something.

369
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:48,510
Just the two of you?

370
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:50,720
That's too obvious of a move.

371
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,820
He could've asked me instead.

372
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,470
He's crazy. You're way younger.

373
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:57,280
No, it was nothing like that.

374
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,390
What did he ask you about?

375
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:01,730
The thing is...

376
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:06,290
he asked me about you, Team Leader.

377
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:08,520
- Me? 
 - Yes.

378
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:24,440
 Team Leader Baek Su Jeong, 

379
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,080
 there's a good opportunity somewhere else. 

380
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,880
 Are you interested in switching jobs? 

381
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:57,100
Shit, that scared me.

382
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,060
Get back to work.

383
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:02,640
Crazy, whoa...

384
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,430
 Are you free, Chief Kim? 

385
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,860
   

386
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,060
 Yes. 

387
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:15,980
Where is Team Leader Baek...

388
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:18,740
Oh, she left earlier.

389
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:23,370
- Good night. 
 - Good night.

390
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:26,840
Maybe the Team Leader was interested in the chief, too.

391
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,400
No way.

392
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,130
Why should she see him after work?

393
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:38,140
What did you just say?

394
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:40,520
W-Which part?

395
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,930
Who is Team Leader Baek interested in...

396
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:45,270
Who is she meeting with again?

397
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:49,020
Chief Kim Shin Won from the design team.

398
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,120
Deputy Yang Jun Su!

399
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:56,270
Yes.

400
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:59,060
Your top button is loose.

401
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:03,090
Please straighten up and dress properly.

402
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:10,310
Thank you!

403
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:12,480
- Thank you! 
 - Thank you.

404
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:24,120
We could've talked at the office.

405
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:27,830
Why did you invite me to a cafe? What a waste of time.

406
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:30,100
Well, the thing is...

407
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:33,570
I don't know where to start.

408
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:35,660
Do you mind if I start, then?

409
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:38,650
Of course not. Go ahead.

410
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:40,950
Chief Kim,

411
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:44,110
are you interested in me?

412
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:47,720
Right.

413
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:51,290
I can't let my employee be a victim of a rumor.

414
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:54,310
That's why I'm going. That's why.

415
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:13,150
It wasn't...

416
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:17,140
me.

417
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:27,080
I'm asking you.

418
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,480
Are you interested in me?

419
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,850
I'd be lying...

420
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:38,830
if I said no.

421
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:42,280
But I'm not interested in you romantically.

422
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,450
What are you saying? Of course not.

423
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:48,040
Aren't you angry at me because you were close to the former director?

424
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:52,220
Was it the one before? Or the one before him?

425
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,750
- Pardon? 
 - If not,

426
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:56,850
why would you ask around about me?

427
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:59,970
Well, I think you're very mistaken—

428
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:01,350
No need for an excuse.

429
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:03,220
Don't be sneaky behind my back.

430
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:05,210
Talk to me if you have a complaint.

431
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:06,570
Instead of poking around.

432
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:08,210
Well, then...

433
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:09,730
Hold on. I have something to say, too.

434
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:10,800
What is it?

435
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,810
W-Well, the thing is...

436
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:16,550
w-will you keep working for Director Ban?

437
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:18,350
Why would you ask that?

438
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:19,530
Will you get me fired?

439
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:22,120
No, there's no way.

440
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:25,200
Well, what I'm saying is...

441
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,280
So... w-what was I going to say?

442
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:32,090
Take care.

443
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,800
   

444
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:42,240
   

445
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:54,630
No.

446
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:57,480
She must have better taste than that.

447
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:01,780
   

448
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:06,960
   

449
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:17,240
No!

450
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:29,900
Who's here at this hour?

451
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:32,400
Don't get up, Dad.

452
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,960
I'm not signing another contract, right?

453
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,870
It's not like that.

454
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,790
Have some food first.

455
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:50,120
The eggs look so tasty today, too.

456
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,450
I haven't had dinner yet.

457
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,720
I'm here to give you important life advice.

458
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:01,360
Life advice?

459
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,880
It's important to keep your professional and personal lives separate.

460
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:07,310
But watching my employee's life get ruined

461
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:10,270
isn't what a boss should do.

462
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:12,800
Pardon?

463
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:17,900
Read this.

464
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:22,650
You came to recommend a cartoon?

465
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:23,930
   

466
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:27,040
I know you have no one else to talk about this—

467
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,040
Right there. Read that part.

468
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:32,090
They explain why you shouldn't fall for a player.

469
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:34,240
You said your first love was a scammer, too.

470
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,120
You can't be victimized by a player again.

471
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:39,100
What are you suddenly talking about...

472
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:43,820
I know you're romantically interested in Chief Kim.

473
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,530
Me?

474
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,740
- Aren't you? 
 - No.

475
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:55,330
Then, why did you meet him at a cafe after work?

476
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,230
How did you know?

477
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:02,070
I happened to see you while passing by.

478
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:03,530
I'm disappointed.

479
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:07,760
I didn't think you'd fall for his charm, too.

480
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:10,240
He smiles a lot,

481
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,500
he's friendly and polite. That kind of charm?

482
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:17,050
Do you also like...

483
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,690
stuff like that?

484
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:23,630
No, I don't like that.

485
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:28,020
A man should only be like that with me even if he's a bit awkward.

486
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:34,060
I have to agree. Love is sacred.

487
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,640
So, you aren't interested in Chief Kim—

488
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,670
I said I'm not interested.

489
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:41,200
I asked him why he was asking around about me.

490
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,680
Asking around?

491
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:45,930
I think he's trying to find my weakness.

492
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,430
Oishii*. I mean, 
  ("Tasty" in Japanese) 

493
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,920
it's tasty.

494
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:19,050
Amazing.

495
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,320
Let's eat.

496
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:40,960
Anyway, I'll enjoy it.

497
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,390
Although I won't get tricked by a player.

498
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:45,080
I'm sorry for bothering you so late.

499
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,980
Tell your father I'm sorry.

500
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,660
Okay.

501
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,770
By the way,

502
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:58,430
if I were actually interested in Chief Kim, what were you going to do?

503
00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:01,120
What if I didn't care if he was a player?

504
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:05,450
Stop you until you lose that interest.

505
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:08,640
Why?

506
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,620
Because of your duty as a boss?

507
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:13,330
I just...

508
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:16,200
don't like it.

509
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:30,870
I'll get going, then.

510
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:47,560
Sis,

511
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,800
who was that just now?

512
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:52,920
It's none of your business.

513
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,070
Isn't 6,000 won cheap? 
    

514
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:03,020
Do you sell cartoons at the department store now?

515
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:05,210
It's not that.

516
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:07,410
Hey, hey.

517
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:09,210
W-What is it, then?

518
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:11,650
Why did he come to our house again?

519
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:13,710
I know you're an important employee, but still.

520
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:15,930
Not only did he pay for my hospital fee,

521
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:19,990
he keeps visiting late at night. I think...

522
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:26,080
The director must be interested in you, right?

523
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:31,640
Dad, that's the funniest joke I heard recently.

524
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:34,250
Dad, seriously. Are you a doting father?

525
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:36,550
What man would like her?

526
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:37,660
Hey, Baek Su Bin.

527
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:40,360
He's young, tall, and has a nice car.

528
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,700
Why would he like her?

529
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:46,560
- I mean... 
 - Geez!

530
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:49,470
Stop being annoying.

531
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:52,250
Unless you want a crack in your skull.

532
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,470
Put the cup away.

533
00:33:57,970 --> 00:33:59,580
See?

534
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,830
How could he be interested in her, Dad?

535
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:03,000
Hey.

536
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,820
Maybe she acts differently outside. Do you think?

537
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:08,970
I don't think so.

538
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,540
The director has an appointment today.

539
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:14,710
So, I'll be his proxy.

540
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:18,270
On the food section business list,

541
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:22,140
Happy Milk replaced Ganghan Farm.

542
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:24,220
Did the business team make the change?

543
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:25,170
Yes.

544
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:27,340
I thought it'd be impossible to work with Ganghan Farm.

545
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,650
So, I changed them out.

546
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:30,540
They can't be replaced.

547
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:32,610
They're very popular these days

548
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:35,640
and they don't work with any other department stores.

549
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,380
If we want our food department to stand out from our competitors, we need them.

550
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:40,330
You think I don't know that?

551
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:42,820
I tried convincing them.

552
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:43,970
Even if we offered 10 billion,

553
00:34:43,970 --> 00:34:46,010
they won't join a department store.

554
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:48,550
That's their company policy or something.

555
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:49,770
But we should try to convince—

556
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:51,340
It's easier said than done.

557
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:53,560
You think the business team does nothing?

558
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,370
They won't even negotiate.

559
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:57,330
How will we convince them?

560
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:01,080
You should try it if you can.

561
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:09,890
Happy Milk is a competitive brand, too.

562
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,120
Got it.

563
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,450
It's important to be realistic, too.

564
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:17,880
I'll report to the director with this list.

565
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,030
Let's move on, then.

566
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:31,140
   

567
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:33,250
   

568
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,130
Are you thinking of going there?

569
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:40,920
You never know. Tomorrow's the weekend, too.

570
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,470
All right. Good luck.

571
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:45,160
Okay.

572
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:01,960
 Bravo! 

573
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,700
 That was great. 

574
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:07,210
 Nice job. 

575
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:21,690
Thank you.

576
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:23,280
Well done.

577
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,010
I don't know why they love golf.

578
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:28,250
I wouldn't have come if it wasn't for the chairwoman.

579
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:30,560
Despite what you say...

580
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:34,150
Congratulations on hitting a hole-in-one.

581
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:36,470
What can I say? I'm Ban Ju Yeon.

582
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:39,010
I'm good at everything.

583
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:43,560
Why was Ganghan Farm removed from the list?

584
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,550
The business team made the decision.

585
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:48,510
Ganghan Farm won't join a department store.

586
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:51,630
That's why it'd be impactful if they joined us.

587
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:53,540
Tell them to convince them somehow.

588
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:55,010
There's still time.

589
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:59,320
Team Leader Baek left to convince them today.

590
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,770
By herself?

591
00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:03,730
Granted, no results are guaranteed.

592
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:06,960
I'm sure it'll get taken care of soon.

593
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:32,720
 ­  

594
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,260
 ­  

595
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:36,880
  ­ 

596
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,320
I'll help carry it to your destination.

597
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,460
No, no. It's heavy.

598
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:11,470
I'm going all the way to the farm.

599
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:14,500
I'll carry it for you because it's heavy.

600
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:18,040
What a nice young lady. Thank you.

601
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:21,480
What brings you all this way alone?

602
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:25,600
Well, I'm visiting the farm. The Ganghan Farm.

603
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:28,320
I hear their ice cream is amazing.

604
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,020
But they only sell it here.

605
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:32,440
I wanted to try it and check out the farm, too.

606
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,960
Gosh. You must have a lot of free time.

607
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,930
Why come this far for just ice cream?

608
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:39,520
I know.

609
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:44,170
I wish they joined a department store so people could try it easily.

610
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:48,090
Tasty food is tastier when you share, they say.

611
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:55,080
W-What's wrong?

612
00:38:57,290 --> 00:38:58,790
Give me that.

613
00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:01,160
G-Give me that.

614
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:04,620
You got me, CEO An.

615
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:06,530
   

616
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,580
Which corporation are you from?

617
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:16,000
KEO or Yongsung?

618
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,680
I'm from Yongsung's strategy team.

619
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:21,080
My name is Baek Su Jeong. Nice to meet you.

620
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,830
No need to greet me.

621
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:26,040
You think I'd sell my product through Yongsung?

622
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:29,690
I hate nothing more than a greedy chaebol.

623
00:39:29,690 --> 00:39:31,220
Chaebol.

624
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:34,870
Is that why you declined our...

625
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:59,930
This way, CEO An.

626
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:02,850
What's this now?

627
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:07,870
Seeing how you present yourself, you don't look like a regular employee.

628
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:09,490
Of course not. I'm Yongsung's successor—

629
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:12,310
He's my little brother who was...

630
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:17,350
sponsored by Yongsung.

631
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,160
This fancy young man is?

632
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,240
You're mistaken because of his car and outfit.

633
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,320
He's a driver.

634
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:29,640
He doesn't own the car or outfit.

635
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,210
You said you were nearby.

636
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:33,990
You came to see your sister here.

637
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:35,900
This is great, CEO An.

638
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,760
We'll drive you to the farm. Get in.

639
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,750
No. Give me that. Give me.

640
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:41,030
N-No...

641
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:42,500
The bag is already in there.

642
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,190
Get in, CEO An.

643
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:46,870
Careful. Careful.

644
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:51,100
What are you doing? Drive us.

645
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,770
What the heck?

646
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,400
 Why did you come all the way here? 

647
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,390
Leave. I can manage it myself.

648
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:07,520
Are you that upset that I came?

649
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:11,610
CEO An hates chaebols like you.

650
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:15,230
Let's see how good you are on your own.

651
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:17,940
I came to help you.

652
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:22,050
You came to help me?

653
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:25,450
No need to find it touching.

654
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:28,880
You came because you doubted my ability?

655
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,160
You didn't trust I could do it on my own?

656
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,570
I trust you.

657
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:34,370
You'll do a good job.

658
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:37,170
Then why?

659
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:40,280
It's difficult to work alone.

660
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,110
It's lonely, too.

661
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:47,280
It's okay if you don't need me.

662
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,450
Okay. Let's convince her together.

663
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:55,100
But keep pretending to be my brother.

664
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:56,440
Don't let her know you're a chaebol.

665
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,470
Why a little brother?

666
00:41:58,470 --> 00:41:59,850
What should I have said, then?

667
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:02,160
A friend sounds weird. A boyfriend is even worse.

668
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,190
Why is that weird?

669
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:04,290
It is.

670
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:06,650
I'm obviously much older.

671
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:08,290
A boyfriend could be younger.

672
00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:12,370
If that's the case, isn't it weirder that your boss is younger?

673
00:42:12,370 --> 00:42:15,980
Stop talking nonsense and look for CEO An.

674
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:19,570
She... She just went that way earlier.

675
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:22,360
Why does he keep confusing me?

676
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:27,520
What's nonsense?

677
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:36,570
♫  To be honest, I don't know, oh, no  ♫

678
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:38,840
♫  I think I'm losing my mind  ♫

679
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,330
♫  Oh, my gosh  ♫

680
00:42:40,330 --> 00:42:41,580
♫  Like this  ♫

681
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:43,070
♫  What to do?  ♫

682
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:44,090
♫  I don't know  ♫

683
00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:47,340
♫  Something made me cry  ♫

684
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:49,170
♫  Destiny is playing tricks  ♫

685
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:52,720
♫  It's like magic  ♫

686
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,870
♫  Maybe we are  ♫

687
00:42:54,870 --> 00:42:56,760
What's this now?

688
00:42:58,690 --> 00:43:00,740
CEO An!

689
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:03,810
♫  Shine a light on my heart  ♫

690
00:43:03,810 --> 00:43:05,790
Sweetie.

691
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,890
CEO An.

692
00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:11,560
What's this?

693
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:16,280
Wait for us!

694
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:26,470
It's not easy.

695
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:27,890
Let's give up.

696
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:30,750
We're only making us look foolish.

697
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:32,750
No.

698
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:33,880
We're already foolish.

699
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,960
She's refusing because we're chaebols?

700
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:39,180
Her business mindset is poor.

701
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:41,640
Just once...

702
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:44,820
Let's convince her just once more, please?

703
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:51,230
This is our last time.

704
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:54,840
Yes.

705
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:57,800
CEO An.

706
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,960
Gosh, you scared me.

707
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:03,500
Are you determined to give me a heart attack?

708
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:05,830
Get out of my face.

709
00:44:05,830 --> 00:44:08,440
I can't do that, CEO An.

710
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,910
I can't give up now that I've seen the farm, too.

711
00:44:10,910 --> 00:44:14,080
I want many people to learn about your products.

712
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:15,330
I don't care.

713
00:44:15,330 --> 00:44:16,850
Leave, I said. Leave now.

714
00:44:16,850 --> 00:44:19,410
CEO An, I mean it. Let's talk for a moment—

715
00:44:19,410 --> 00:44:21,940
I have nothing to say. Get lost.

716
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:23,410
Get out of my face.

717
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:24,810
- Get out. 
 - We should talk—

718
00:44:24,810 --> 00:44:26,500
Oh, hey!

719
00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:32,470
Gosh, I can't believe this.

720
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:35,810
They're putting on a show at my farm.

721
00:44:35,810 --> 00:44:38,290
What a show this is.

722
00:44:45,590 --> 00:44:48,330
We aren't open yet.

723
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,100
What brings you here at this hour?

724
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:52,830
I'm here to see you.

725
00:44:52,830 --> 00:44:55,880
- Me? 
 - The thing is...

726
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:57,770
I don't think I can tear them apart.

727
00:44:57,770 --> 00:45:00,960
I think we need a plan.

728
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,760
You should've called first.

729
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,260
I was just about to go to the market.

730
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:10,100
Really? Then, we can talk on the way. Right?

731
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:11,800
Shall we?

732
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:22,250
You're into internet novels.

733
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:23,910
I knew it.

734
00:45:23,910 --> 00:45:26,580
I love your writing on Instagram.

735
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:29,360
I used to read internet novels in the military, too.

736
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:30,780
In the military?

737
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:35,140
Yes. Everything is fun there except the training.

738
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:37,010
Do you still game these days?

739
00:45:37,010 --> 00:45:39,090
Sometimes.

740
00:45:39,090 --> 00:45:40,930
I played often before I opened the shop.

741
00:45:40,930 --> 00:45:43,270
But I'm too busy these days.

742
00:45:43,270 --> 00:45:46,320
I let someone else become the team leader, too.

743
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:47,960
Why do you keep asking about me?

744
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:50,710
You came to talk about Ju Yeon and Su Jeong.

745
00:45:50,710 --> 00:45:53,060
W-Well, yes. I did.

746
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:55,460
That's why I'm here.

747
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:59,090
What do we do with those two?

748
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:02,120
They ended up in the same company.

749
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:03,960
But I'm relieved that

750
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:06,560
they don't see each other on weekends.

751
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,960
Don't you have weekend plans, by the way?

752
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,750
Is it okay to be here?

753
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:13,180
A lot of people must want to see you.

754
00:46:16,090 --> 00:46:16,990
   

755
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:20,530
I'm not meeting anyone. No.

756
00:46:36,310 --> 00:46:40,240
Do you always bring the same clothes?

757
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:41,430
Of course.

758
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:44,010
I come prepared. Better than some people.

759
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:46,030
But this place is too—

760
00:46:46,030 --> 00:46:49,280
You're all changed. Why don't you sit?

761
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:53,040
CEO An, is this really your home?

762
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,340
I'm worried about Ganghan Farm's finances.

763
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:58,770
Why? What are you worried about?

764
00:46:58,770 --> 00:47:02,700
Hey, Ban Ju Yeon. Do you want to be spanked?

765
00:47:03,850 --> 00:47:06,380
- Spanked? 
 - She donated all of her assets

766
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:09,780
and she's been leading a frugal life. How rude.

767
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:11,760
Go ahead and apologize.

768
00:47:12,450 --> 00:47:14,210
Rude?

769
00:47:15,930 --> 00:47:19,600
But shouldn't you live somewhere nicer?

770
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:20,990
You've worked hard.

771
00:47:20,990 --> 00:47:23,440
Why? What's wrong with my house?

772
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:26,330
It's enough for just me.

773
00:47:26,330 --> 00:47:28,080
Stop being silly.

774
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:30,650
Let's sit and eat.

775
00:47:32,410 --> 00:47:34,630
You'd spank me?

776
00:47:35,570 --> 00:47:37,870
It's my butt...

777
00:47:37,870 --> 00:47:41,000
It's so much rice.

778
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,480
It's not that much.

779
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,610
That's why you're so skinny.

780
00:47:44,610 --> 00:47:47,000
Have some more afterward.

781
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,010
- Okay. 
 - Try this, too. It's godeulbbaegi.

782
00:47:50,010 --> 00:47:52,470
It's a little bitter but tasty.

783
00:47:52,470 --> 00:47:55,670
I harvested it from the garden.

784
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,140
Okay.

785
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:05,070
What? You don't want it?

786
00:48:06,870 --> 00:48:08,540
Sis.

787
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:12,170
Huh? D-Did you call me?

788
00:48:12,170 --> 00:48:14,810
CEO An harvested this godeulbbaegi.

789
00:48:14,810 --> 00:48:16,660
You aren't refusing to eat it, right?

790
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:18,460
That'd be rude.

791
00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:23,250
Of course not.

792
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:24,980
That's good, then.

793
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:29,240
Enjoy, Sis.

794
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:33,570
You should enjoy it, too, little brother.

795
00:48:33,570 --> 00:48:36,620
You love bitter food.

796
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:39,620
Thank you, Sis.

797
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:42,350
You're so caring toward each other.

798
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:55,750
Yes, yes. Gosh, my baby.

799
00:48:55,750 --> 00:48:59,860
Yes. Of course, I'm okay. I'm fine.

800
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:02,330
Have you eaten?

801
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:05,350
Okay, okay. Bye.

802
00:49:05,350 --> 00:49:08,750
Okay. Talk to you later.

803
00:49:14,350 --> 00:49:16,400
That must've been your grandson.

804
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,020
Yes.

805
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:22,520
He really loves me.

806
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:25,950
He just passed the bar exam and he's working.

807
00:49:25,950 --> 00:49:28,980
He called on his way home.

808
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:31,860
I don't know who he resembles, but he's smart.

809
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:34,390
He must resemble you.

810
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:38,580
Does he?

811
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:40,950
You must be so proud of him.

812
00:49:40,950 --> 00:49:43,310
Of course I am.

813
00:49:44,310 --> 00:49:48,290
He was born prematurely. He used to be sick.

814
00:49:48,290 --> 00:49:51,030
Growing up healthy was enough for me,

815
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:54,130
but he's all grown up already.

816
00:49:54,130 --> 00:49:59,100
People call me pathetic living like this.

817
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:03,570
They think I work just to give money away, but I don't do that for no reason.

818
00:50:03,570 --> 00:50:07,310
A good world for the children to live in.

819
00:50:07,310 --> 00:50:09,980
I wanted to create a society like that.

820
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:13,020
I don't want to be a rich grandma.

821
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:16,840
I want to be a grandma they're proud of.

822
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:22,780
Your grandson must be happy.

823
00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:27,020
He's so loved by his grandmother.

824
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:34,480
That's why you should work with Yongsung.

825
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:37,620
Geez, you won't give up.

826
00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:40,220
I thought you were just an employee.

827
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:43,510
How much do they pay you, anyway?

828
00:50:43,510 --> 00:50:45,620
It's not that.

829
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:48,330
If not you, another business will take that spot.

830
00:50:48,330 --> 00:50:53,530
I want you to make a lot of money, not anyone else.

831
00:50:53,530 --> 00:50:56,470
It'd be nice if you became more influential.

832
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:59,040
I want to help you, too.

833
00:51:00,570 --> 00:51:02,890
How tenacious. Seriously.

834
00:51:02,890 --> 00:51:05,570
Just eat first. Let's talk later.

835
00:51:05,570 --> 00:51:07,830
You'll hear me out if I finish this, okay?

836
00:51:07,830 --> 00:51:09,300
Okay.

837
00:51:23,430 --> 00:51:25,940
Mix it in, little brother.

838
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:43,260
This is...

839
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:48,300
Is this a new product you're working on?

840
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:49,390
Can I try it?

841
00:51:49,390 --> 00:51:52,360
Yes, go ahead.

842
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:05,000
What's this?

843
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,340
Is this yogurt?

844
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:08,680
This would be a huge hit.

845
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:10,810
Do you want to try some?

846
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:13,860
Here.

847
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:15,920
Drink it up. Drink it up.

848
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:18,080
You're trying Ganghan Farm's new product.

849
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:20,960
You should be honored.

850
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:26,730
- This is alcohol. 
 - Yeah.

851
00:52:26,730 --> 00:52:29,220
That's the makgeolli I made.

852
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:33,030
I used the water from the spring up there.

853
00:52:33,030 --> 00:52:35,160
It should taste quite good.

854
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:39,580
How foolish.

855
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:42,850
Foolish? How rude to talk to me that way.

856
00:52:42,850 --> 00:52:44,090
Don't yell at me.

857
00:52:44,090 --> 00:52:47,400
How will you go home, Sis?

858
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:52,210
Well, I can take the bus back.

859
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:54,390
You should've left already.

860
00:52:54,390 --> 00:52:56,600
The buses have stopped running already.

861
00:52:57,580 --> 00:52:59,730
We'll have to call a driver.

862
00:53:00,390 --> 00:53:04,170
Driver? I thought you were a driver.

863
00:53:04,170 --> 00:53:06,620
Oh, I mean, a driving service.

864
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:10,450
You'll pay for a ride from here to Seoul?

865
00:53:11,010 --> 00:53:13,000
Couldn't I?

866
00:53:15,090 --> 00:53:18,440
Gosh, your dad runs a hardware store

867
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:22,150
and paying off debt from your mom's illness.

868
00:53:22,150 --> 00:53:25,970
You said you're trying to pay off the mortgage now.

869
00:53:25,970 --> 00:53:30,660
But I guess your brother hasn't suffered enough.

870
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:34,780
I thought you weren't listening.

871
00:53:36,470 --> 00:53:39,270
It's because he's still immature. He is.

872
00:53:39,270 --> 00:53:41,090
He's five years younger than me.

873
00:53:41,090 --> 00:53:44,200
He's a kid compared to me.

874
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:46,080
A kid?

875
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:48,060
How much will it cost to drive to Seoul?

876
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:50,120
Why don't you just throw money away?

877
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:51,930
What will you do, then,

878
00:53:51,930 --> 00:53:53,710
Sis?

879
00:53:55,350 --> 00:53:56,560
What do we do?

880
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:58,820
What do you mean what will you do?

881
00:53:58,820 --> 00:54:01,030
You're sleeping over.

882
00:54:12,940 --> 00:54:16,520
The potato cooked nicely, Director.

883
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:19,180
Am I no longer the little brother?

884
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:22,270
Why? Do you want to call me Sis again?

885
00:54:22,270 --> 00:54:25,790
You sounded so convincing that I almost believed you.

886
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:30,720
I'm sorry this happened.

887
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:33,260
You should've just left.

888
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:36,700
You call that an apology?

889
00:54:37,810 --> 00:54:41,530
It's sweet. I'm sure you'll love it.

890
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:47,240
Just think of it as a vacation.

891
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:50,860
The air is nice and the stars are pretty.

892
00:54:57,380 --> 00:54:59,990
I was just saying that.

893
00:54:59,990 --> 00:55:03,470
But this really feels like a vacation.

894
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:07,790
I haven't been on one this year because of work.

895
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:11,410
Why do you work so hard

896
00:55:11,410 --> 00:55:13,320
on everything?

897
00:55:16,350 --> 00:55:18,960
When I was a kid,

898
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:21,690
I used to dangle upside down on pull-up bars.

899
00:55:21,690 --> 00:55:26,000
But a passerby said girls shouldn't play so roughly.

900
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,000
I was so annoyed by it, even as a child.

901
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,910
So, I played even harder.

902
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:34,770
One day, I went to school and

903
00:55:34,770 --> 00:55:37,350
the teacher said to give up on becoming the class president.

904
00:55:37,350 --> 00:55:39,960
He said I can't because my mom can't care for me.

905
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:41,770
That's nonsense.

906
00:55:41,770 --> 00:55:43,460
You'd be the president, not her.

907
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:45,310
I know.

908
00:55:45,310 --> 00:55:47,920
People set limits for me on their own

909
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,420
and judged me. I hated it.

910
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:55,710
So, I worked even harder when I was told no.

911
00:55:55,710 --> 00:55:57,810
I was so determined.

912
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:02,540
I wanted to prove that I could do things.

913
00:56:02,540 --> 00:56:04,590
Do you know how that feels?

914
00:56:07,070 --> 00:56:08,950
Of course.

915
00:56:08,950 --> 00:56:12,510
You don't need others' approval,

916
00:56:13,630 --> 00:56:16,370
but I guess that's my personality.

917
00:56:16,370 --> 00:56:18,700
I want to do everything well

918
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:21,660
and I can't stand being looked down on.

919
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:23,800
I'm like that.

920
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:36,560
I am, too.

921
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:40,130
I want to be acknowledged

922
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:42,720
and do well.

923
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:46,240
I can't stand being looked down on.

924
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,740
Why are you smiling?

925
00:56:55,330 --> 00:57:00,610
I was thinking you and I are similar.

926
00:57:00,610 --> 00:57:03,490
It's funny. It makes no sense.

927
00:57:06,650 --> 00:57:09,050
Why should it not make sense?

928
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:11,690
We have another thing in common.

929
00:57:12,710 --> 00:57:14,570
Our first loves.

930
00:57:18,910 --> 00:57:24,030
I don't ever want to run into mine either.

931
00:57:24,850 --> 00:57:26,990
I thought...

932
00:57:27,830 --> 00:57:31,340
she'd accept me as I was.

933
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:34,650
But it was the worst.

934
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,140
We both have the worst first loves.

935
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:43,250
Should we say cheers?

936
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:47,180
Cheers.

937
00:58:52,620 --> 00:58:53,680
   

938
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:56,800
Excuse me.

939
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:02,540
Yes, Unni.

940
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:05,750
I'm on a business trip in Gangwon with the director.

941
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:09,040
He's not a man. He's the same age as Su Bin.

942
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:11,780
How could I think of him as a man?

943
00:59:20,310 --> 00:59:21,500
 But still. 

944
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:24,070
Aren't you too close with the director?

945
00:59:24,070 --> 00:59:25,360
Should I not be?

946
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:27,130
It's better than being the Director Killer.

947
00:59:27,130 --> 00:59:31,930
I don't want you to learn the uncomfortable truth.

948
00:59:31,930 --> 00:59:33,870
Uncomfortable truth?

949
00:59:33,870 --> 00:59:37,480
Well, you said he's a chaebol.

950
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:39,170
 What if he's corrupt? 

951
00:59:39,170 --> 00:59:40,440
 I know you can't tolerate that. 

952
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:43,430
It'd become a serious problem, then.

953
00:59:43,430 --> 00:59:45,000
Unni, are you bored?

954
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,640
Why are you suddenly so worried?

955
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:48,860
Whatever.

956
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:50,180
You definitely said

957
00:59:50,180 --> 00:59:52,180
you don't think of the director as a man.

958
00:59:52,180 --> 00:59:53,760
What?

959
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,620
Yes.

960
00:59:56,620 --> 00:59:59,690
Okay. Carry on.

961
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:04,330
What's her problem?

962
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:06,980
How strange.

963
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:29,360
Are you sleeping?

964
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:33,860
He falls asleep whenever he drinks.

965
01:00:33,860 --> 01:00:36,670
Director, go inside to sleep.

966
01:00:36,670 --> 01:00:38,090
Okay?

967
01:00:38,790 --> 01:00:40,790
Director.

968
01:00:50,590 --> 01:00:52,840
How annoying.

969
01:00:53,710 --> 01:00:57,450
Well, I wanted to wake you up.

970
01:00:59,250 --> 01:01:02,000
Why do you keep looking down on me?

971
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:04,870
When did I do that?

972
01:01:40,260 --> 01:01:42,120
Do you still...

973
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:51,800
not see me as a man?

974
01:02:39,710 --> 01:02:48,520


975
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:55,650
   

976
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:59,200
   

977
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:10,150
♫  The moment I hold your hand  ♫

978
01:03:10,150 --> 01:03:12,840
♫  It's all right, it's so high  ♫

979
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:14,790
♫  I can't hide my feelings  ♫

980
01:03:14,790 --> 01:03:17,120
♫  I'll work up my courage and tell you  ♫

981
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:19,200
♫  My first love is calling me  ♫

982
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:20,380
♫  I've been waiting  ♫

983
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:23,360
♫  It feels like I'm flying  ♫

984
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:26,060
 I don't understand what that guy is thinking. 

985
01:03:26,060 --> 01:03:29,480
 We're in it together. Should we say cheers? 

986
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:32,610
 Will you just ignore what happened last night? 

987
01:03:32,610 --> 01:03:34,430
 Why make a big deal out of nothing? 

988
01:03:34,430 --> 01:03:37,330
 Crazy. Nothing? A big deal? 

989
01:03:37,330 --> 01:03:38,880
 Are you going on a blind date? 

990
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:41,190
 - Is that true? 
 - Why do you care? 

991
01:03:41,190 --> 01:03:42,420
 Su Jeong! 

992
01:03:42,420 --> 01:03:44,680
 You're concerned about my blind date. 

993
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:46,540
 I'm not concerned. 

994
01:03:46,540 --> 01:03:48,070
 What's wrong with me? 

995
01:03:48,070 --> 01:03:50,910
 Why doesn't she think of me as a man? 

996
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:55,690
♫  My heart leans toward you  ♫

997
01:03:55,690 --> 01:03:58,290
♫  I'll tell you as many times it takes  ♫

998
01:03:58,290 --> 01:04:00,210
♫  I like you...  ♫
