- Okay.

17

Thank you.

35
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:23,540
It's an unjust recruitment.

Park Ji Cheol recommended him to Hana City's aide.

It's not a bad proposal for you, either.

52

We should definitely make it a success, then.

103
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:19,940

satisfy the families with kids

105
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:25,650
and people in their 20s and 30s.

106
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:28,060

107
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:30,800
Here's the list of the finalists.

108
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,480
The first candidate is "Star Bear's Travel."

109
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,850
It's the most popular mobile game

110
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:37,800
character among teenagers.

111
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,830
And the second candidate is "Smile Cat."

112
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:43,760
It's popular among women in their 20s.

113
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,340
And the last candidate is

114
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,440
"Pirate King," the animated series.

115
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:53,710
It'd attract customers and boost sales the most.

116
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:56,150
It's owned by an international company,

117
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:58,870
but the creator's father is Korean.

118
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:01,100
It's very popular in Korea, too.

119
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,210
The mother, not the father.

120
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,490
Oh, I see.

121
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:06,860
Got it.

122
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:09,410
And if they had a pop-up with us,

123
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:13,200
it'd be their first event in Korea in a while.

124
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,860
It'd claim a lot of attention.

125
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:17,330
It hasn't been just a while. It's been seven years.

126
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,190
Yes, right. You know very well.

127
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:26,710
I did a thorough research, too.

128
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:29,230
You must know it very well, then.

129
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:31,930
Not only kids like shows like this these days,

130
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:35,050
there are also adult fans, and they sell very well.

131
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:37,640
"Pirate King" has a nice message, too.

132
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,360
I think it'd be more meaningful.

133
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,760
Yes, I read it while doing the research.

134
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,000
The story is pretty great.

135
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,950
I got sucked into it, too.

136
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:49,190
If so,

137
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:52,120
the first renewal project pop-up

138
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,610
will be with "Pirate King."

139
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:56,870
Okay.

00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:11,610

141
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:13,050
Why do you ask?

142
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:16,140
I couldn't even tell at all just now.

143
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,810
Why would we let it show at work?

144
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:20,680
But still.

145

00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,870
Where do you normally go on dates?

151
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:33,270
And does he pay... Do you go Dutch?

My role model is dating.

156
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,340
Of course, I'm curious. Don't you think?

157
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,020
I can't picture it, first of all.

158
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:48,730
You're dating the director, even.

159
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:52,850
Stop talking nonsense. Let's go get lunch.

160
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,170

161
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:02,370
I don't like "Pirate King."

162
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:11,290
I thought you should join us for lunch.

163
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,970
Why aren't you eating?

164
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:42,950
We will. We will.

165
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:48,050
By the way,

166
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:51,530
did you get us lobster at the buffet

167
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:53,670
because of the Team Leader?

168
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:57,640
Well, I did.

169
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:05,190
There's no reason to hide it.

170
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:06,920
Right.

171
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:10,800
You can't hide true love, they say.

172
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,960

00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:24,810
- It's tasty.
- It is.

187
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:26,830
Should we eat quickly and go?

188
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,400
Yes.

189
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:35,840
<i>You didn't get it.</i>

190
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,150
<i>Then, we can't do this.</i>

191
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,620
I know.

192
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:45,240
Chief, you didn't go out for lunch?

193
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,870
Well, no. I-I'm on a diet.

194
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:51,640
You have no weight to lose.

195
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,300
He's all about self-care.

196
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:01,020
[Ha Jin...]

197
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:10,870
- The rumor was true?
- Yes.

198
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:12,760
They got fired together and came back?

199
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,060
Yes, I'm telling you.

200
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:17,010
Wow, what's it like dating a chaebol?

201
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:18,520
You don't have to worry about money

202
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,610
and you'd never get fired, either.

203
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:23,140
You don't even have to work.

204
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:26,710
I would've quit immediately if I were her.

205
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,350
Why should I quit my job?

206
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:34,290
Well, because you're with the director.

207
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:36,560
It's because we're jealous. That's all.

208
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,660
Yes, he's right. We're jealous.

209
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:43,520
But we have a point, don't we?

210
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,820
It's like winning a lottery.

211
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:48,210
Why should you keep working?

212
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:49,400
The youngest team leader,

213
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,780
and got promoted the fastest.

214
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:53,810
I won the Best Employee award countless times.

215
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:57,180
It'd be the company's loss if I quit.

216
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:01,140
And...

217
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:04,770
even the lottery winners work these days.

218
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:06,860
- I see.
- Yes.

219
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,710
Go, go.

220
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,960
Seriously. I was shocked.

221
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:36,210
So tired.

222
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,400
What? What are you doing here?

223
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,700
Your team left. Why are you still here?

224
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,800
How about you? Why haven't you left?

225
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,160
Because you haven't left.

226
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,590
Move. I have more work to do.

227
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,380
The pop-up store...

228
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:05,050
You chose "Pirate King" from the beginning, right?

229
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:07,740
It really was the best candidate.

230
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,500
We have to make it a success.

231
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:15,050
Of course, I wanted you to have fun, too.

232
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:16,830
Thank you.

233
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:20,380
To be honest,

234
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:25,340
"Pirate King" is the most special cartoon to me.

235
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,430
Before my parents passed away,

236
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:31,370
the last friend I had left

237
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,560
was Toggangyi.

238
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,660
The plushie I gave you as a gift.

239
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,480
What if they find out I'm a "Pirate King" fan?

240
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,820
Is it because of the Chairwoman?

241
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,250
It's not that.

242
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:51,500
I've had to keep it a secret and...

243
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,470
it's kind of embarrassing, too.

244
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:56,550
You don't find this embarrassing?

245
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:58,250
What if someone sees us?

246
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:01,350
Who'd see us? There's no one here.

247
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:03,360
Move now.

248
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,800
Okay...

249
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,590
<i>It was the tastiest seafood jjambbong</i>

250
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:21,790
<i>I've ever had.</i>

251
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:24,710
<i>If you haven't tried this, it's your loss.</i>

252
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:29,120
<i>The food is good, but the owner is amazing, too.</i>

253
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,360
<i>It was love indeed.</i>

254
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:54,690
Boosting the younger customer rate from 24% to 45%

255
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:57,060
will be the key goal of this project.

256
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:00,210
We successfully acquired their favored brands...

257
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:03,080
The Christmas season concept is red.

258
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,100
So, we don't need to...

259
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,600
[Botanical Garden renewal notice]

260
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:31,250
<i>"Pirate King" team is very motivated, too.</i>

261
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:34,520
They'll produce three versions of goods, too.

262
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,040
I should be on the list now.

263
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,780
And the creator will be staying in Korea.

264
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:42,230
He can come to the pop-up, too.

265
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,420
- Really?
- Yes.

266
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:48,380
You won't make me get you an autograph again, right?

267
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:51,590
It's a special chance to get one yourself.

268
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:54,660
You can take a photo, too.

269
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:57,460
Gosh, a photo, too?

270
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:58,960
Like this.

271
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:03,790
Of course, I'll take a nice one with you.

272
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:04,900
That was...

273
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,030
Just think about it.

274
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:10,140
Okay. I will think about it.

275
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,500
Everyone is talking about you two at work.

276
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,120
He's probably fine, but are you okay, Su Jeong?

277
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,620
What do you mean?

278
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:22,020
People are talking a lot

279
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,680
since they heard about you dating.

280
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:28,380
It's better than being called a "Director Killer."

281
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,780
Let's start the meeting, Chief Kim.

282
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:33,280
I can't even talk?

283
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:38,450
I checked the design edits for the pop-up.

284
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,780
- Yes.
- Hyung.

285
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,260
What? What is it?

286
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,480
Are you in pain?

287
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,110
You don't look so well.

288
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:47,240
Bbanjju.

289
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,470
Are you finally worrying about me?

290
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:51,870
I'm asking because you look uglier than usual,

291
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:53,360
Chief Kim Sin Won.

292
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,330
I knew it. Bastard.

293
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:59,390
Why does it throb so much?

294
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:01,870
The opening date is coming up soon.

295
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:04,250
You must feel the pressure.

296
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,400
I'm okay.

297
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,020
Everything will be fine if it's a success.

298
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,270
I'll rely on you until the end.

299
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:13,680
Okay.

300
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,630
Su Jeong.

301
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,970
Director,

302
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:28,840
you look way happier than when you're with me.

303
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,390
Can't be the same, of course.

304
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:31,970
Are you openly discriminating?

305
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:33,030
What do you mean?

306
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:35,640
You're Chief Kwon and

307
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,300
Su Jeong is Su Jeong.

308
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:42,040
This is no good.

309
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,760
I'll get you an espresso with triple shots

310
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,000
starting tomorrow.

311
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,750
Will you accept my apology?

312
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,090
No, I can't.

313
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:52,980
Because I was joking.

314
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,950
Enjoy your date.

315
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:58,370
I have more free time, thanks to you.

316
00:19:58,370 --> 00:19:59,720
Thank you.

317
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,120
Of course.

318
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:06,610
Chief Kwon is a humorous person.

319
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:08,800
I just learned that, too.

320
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,770
I'm grateful to her.

321
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,750
This is for Black Dragon.

322
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:17,340
This is for Strawberry.

323
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,980
Unni.

324
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:21,490
It's nice to see you sitting together.

325
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:24,390
Is Chief Kim feeling better now?

326
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:27,100
Huh? Is he sick?

327
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:29,550
What? Didn't you know?

328
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:32,680
Well, the thing is...

329
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,670
Did you have a fight?

330
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,350
Of course not.

331
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,290
It's just...

332
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:44,300
Did he upset you by smiling at everyone?

333
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,800
No, he didn't.

334
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:50,280
I'm the one who's upsetting him.

335
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:53,660
I'm the one who couldn't love him as much as

336
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:56,620
he wanted or let him love me.

337
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,870
I thought I was fine after the divorce,

338
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:03,700
but I guess not enough to trust someone fully.

339
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:06,180
Of course, you're afraid.

340
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:09,040
Someone you trusted the most changed.

341
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:14,240
But if you want to trust him,

342
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,330
it means you love him that much, don't you think?

343
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,010
Even though you're afraid,

344
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:24,510
you want to believe in love.

345
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,170
Thank you for driving me home.

346
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:39,800
You're going straight home, right?

347
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,420
I'll stop by work.

348
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:42,920
What for?

349
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:46,500
I'm having a video meeting with Arteta HQ.

350
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,940
I thought you finished talking to them.

351
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,570
I just wanted to confirm things.

352
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:52,340
I can't allow even a slight mistake

353
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:55,250
for the project's success.

354
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,580
Don't feel too pressured.

355
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,540
We're working hard together.

356
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,200
Okay?

357
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:05,730
Get going now.

358
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:07,860
I'll see you go in first.

359
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,470
No, I want to see you leave.

360
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,420
You came in early.

361
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:15,540
Yes. A higher-up nagged me to update

362
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:19,550
the design instead of feeling depressed.

363
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,320
He said he worked all night at the office.

364
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,910
So, I couldn't really complain.

365
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:26,920
He worked all night at the office?

366
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,290
Yes.

367
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:31,770
Is he in his office now?

368
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:33,330
He left for a meeting with a business.

369
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:35,060
He's checking the site while there, too.

370
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:36,440
He's checking the site, too?

371
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,550
We finished checking together recently.

372
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:40,000
We'll check the day before again.

373
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,390
You know how thorough he is.

374
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:42,990
Well, then...

375
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,910
<i>Didn't you go home last night?</i>

376
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:02,680
<i>I lost track of time while working.</i>

377
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,470
<i>When are you returning to the office?</i>

378
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:07,050
<i>I'll pick you up when you leave.</i>

379
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:10,910
<i>The renewal project must be a success.</i>

380
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:14,120
<i>If it fails, we'll have to leave the company.</i>

381
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:24,150
Chief Kwon.

382
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:30,110
I can't help but find it strange.

383
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:32,270
We're almost ready for the opening.

384
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:35,270
He shouldn't have so much work to do.

385
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:37,370
But he's been overworking.

386
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:39,520
He must be anxious.

387
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:44,150
Because he'd lose everything if it failed.

388
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:47,590
What do you mean by that?

389
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,090
Director.

390
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:02,050
Su Jeong, what brings you here...

391
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:06,980
Is everything okay?

392
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,960
I heard if this fails,

393
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:13,010
you won't just be quitting your job.

394
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:15,440
You agreed to give up on your assets and name

395
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,450
and leave the country.

396
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:20,490
Why did you agree to such an unreasonable term?

397
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:22,050
I...

398
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:27,730
wanted to let you make the decision.

399
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:30,330
Whether you stay at the company or not,

400
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:32,520
I wanted you to choose.

401
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:36,050
I wasn't trying to secure my job.

402
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:37,000
Why do this for me-

403
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,360
I know. You did it for me.

404
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,840
You wanted my grandmother to acknowledge me

405
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,650
and not let my life's work go to waste.

406
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:49,010
You made that decision knowing that?

407
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:51,910
Because I can give up on everything.

408
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:57,430
If I can be greedy for myself for once,

409
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:01,120
it has to be Baek Su Jeong.

410
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,470
The only thing I cared about was

411
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:08,570
for your efforts to be acknowledged.

412
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,230
Because I know

413
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:15,520
how desperately you want that.

414
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:21,790
Because I also know

415
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:25,620
how it feels to want acknowledgment.

416
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:28,940
And the person I truly want to be acknowledged by

417
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:33,490
is in front of me right now.

418
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,780
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

419
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:47,740
Could you come here for a moment?

420
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:57,690
You wanted to learn how to play the piano.

421
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,750
Don't you remember?

422
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:03,250
When did I want to learn...

423
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,720
<i>I have a piano lesson in the afternoon.</i>

424
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,990
<i>I'm free after five.</i>

425
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:09,740
<i>Geez, amazing.</i>

426
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:10,910
<i>You take a piano lesson?</i>

427
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:13,070
<i>I've always wanted to learn.</i>

428
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:15,700
<i>You can learn from me later.</i>

429
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:23,100
To be honest, I still can't believe it.

430
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,620
That we met again like this

431
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:28,550
and we came to like each other.

432
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:31,560
So, I couldn't think about anything else.

433
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:37,140
Don't try to do everything by yourself.

434
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,990
I'll never do that again.

435
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:47,120
I'm not done being angry yet.

436
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,330
I think you are.

437
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:09,630
[Sulo]

438
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:18,760
<i>But if you want to trust him,</i>

439
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,720
<i>it means you love him that much, don't you think?</i>

440
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:27,490
You know, that handsome employee.

441
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:29,210
I don't see him these days.

442
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:31,070
Did he quit?

443
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:35,460
He wasn't an employee. He was just helping briefly.

444
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:38,050
Why? Are you sad?

445
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:39,460
No, I'm not.

446
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:42,730
He was nicer to the owner than to the customers.

447
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:45,970
He's your boyfriend, isn't he?

448
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:48,160
Why would you ask that?

449
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,840
What? I'm curious.

450
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,440
Don't ask. You're being rude.

451
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:10,870
Team Leader, it's lunchtime.

452
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,190
Okay.

453
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:15,300
You haven't changed at all.

454
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:18,600
The Director is your boyfriend. Why work so hard?

455
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:22,130
Can't we have steak today, too?

456
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:23,820
The Director is at a shop.

457
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,860
And I'm meeting someone.

458
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:28,920
You're meeting up with Chief Kim Hee Jeong.

459
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,080
I thought she was working in the US now.

460
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,840
She is. She's at Big Forest.

461
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,580
She's in Korea briefly.

462
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:38,140
Isn't Big Forest the biggest mall in the US?

463
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:39,460
It is.

464
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:40,880
But I didn't think

465
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,900
you were that close to get together.

466
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:46,220
Is she scouting you by chance?

467
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:48,760
Come on. No way.

468
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:51,480
You're right.

469
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,290
I'm scouting you.

470
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:58,370
We only worked together briefly,

471
00:29:58,370 --> 00:30:01,280
but you stood out so much when you were new.

472
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:05,830
I've been following the news in Korea, but...

473
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:09,840
I can see why you got promoted so quickly.

474
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,260
Thank you for thinking so highly of me.

475
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:14,400
I heard about the scandal,

476
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:17,600
and how you got transferred briefly, too.

477
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:21,570
If you stay at Yongsung,

478
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:24,720
you'll keep being mistreated like that.

479
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,550
You'll be nothing but Ban Ju Yeon's girlfriend.

480
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:32,660
You won't give up on your career for love, right?

481
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:34,220
It'd be a shame.

482
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:37,570
It'd be a waste of all that hard work.

483
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:40,210
So,

484
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:43,000
come to the US.

485
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:49,270
I really appreciate your offer,

486
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:52,400
but there's a project I'm working on right now.

487
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,780
I even value your sense of responsibility, too.

488
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,680
Okay.

489
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,900
Take your time thinking about it

490
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,640
and we'll talk again after the project.

491
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:40,960
Mom!

492
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,560
Su Hyeok!

493
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,610
Are you crazy?

494
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:48,790
How could you push a child?

495
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:50,480
I didn't push him. I held him.

496
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,520
He almost ran into someone while running.

497
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:56,070
<i>Ban Ju Yeon?</i>

498
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:06,420
Yes, I've seen you on the news.

499
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:08,190
You could've just talked to him.

500
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:12,090
Can you touch my precious child if you're rich?

501
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,550
I'm sorry I startled him.

502
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:17,360
But it was an urgent situation.

503
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:20,640
You can check the CCTV if you'd like.

504
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:26,710
Team Leader,

505
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:28,720
you need to see this.

506
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,950
<i>The successor of Yongsung</i>

507
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:32,830
<i>who's famously young and handsome.</i>

508
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:34,660
<i>At a food court in a department store,</i>

509
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:37,270
<i>he pushed a young boy and knocked him over.</i>

510
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:41,340
<i>Just because he was apparently in his way. Whoa.</i>

511
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:43,310
- No way.
<i>- Apparently,</i>

512
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:46,760
<i>with the renewal, Yongsung is planning to</i>

513
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:51,400
<i>turn the luxury wing into a no-kids zone.</i>

514
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,590
How could a department store not allow kids?

515
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:55,770
We have to report this bastard.

516
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:57,470
Send me the link right now.

517
00:32:57,470 --> 00:32:58,850
Okay.

518
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:03,100
<i>He edited the social media posts by the customers</i>

519
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,960
with a malicious intention.

520
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,040
They're speculating that you were fired

521
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,910
due to poor character.

522
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:12,130
The public opinion is very negative.

523
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:15,020
They're even mentioning boycotting.

524
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:17,100
Things will quiet down over time.

525
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:20,340
Say that we'll take firm action against fake news.

526
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:22,500
Okay, but...

527
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,130
timing wise,

528
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:28,600
it worries me that this will affect the reopening.

529
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,860
Find the person who posted the video first.

530
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:33,070
There's something...

531
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:35,320
suspicious about it.

532
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:38,160
[Yongsung facing scrutiny before reopening]

533
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:42,350

00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:50,560
Geez, you've got to be kidding me.

537
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:53,030

This is a misunderstanding.

549
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,840
I can send you the evidence to prove it.

550
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:32,750
<i>I'll email you regarding the contract cancellation.</i>

551
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:34,310
The opening is three days away.

552
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:36,330
This isn't right, Team Leader.

553
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:38,480
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

554
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:48,170
<i>"Pirate King" is the most special cartoon to me.</i>

555
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:15,570
Yes, it's me.

556
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,150
Black Dragon.

557
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:45,530
We can finally meet him.

558
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:50,100
We only communicated by the nickname Black Dragon.

559
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:54,290
So, I didn't have a chance to meet him.

560
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:58,450
But he really wanted to meet you this time.

561
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:01,140
Actually, I was curious, too.

562
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,420
He helped show the animation to the children

563
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:08,830
who would've had no access to it otherwise.

564
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:11,590
He's been supporting my work sincerely.

565
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:15,850
He's very private, but he's a powerful person.

566
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:18,430
Excuse me.

567
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:37,820
Nice to meet you.

568
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:42,280
I'm Ban, and I'm supposed to meet you today.

569
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:46,810
You've been supporting the children

570
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:49,300
who are fans of my work.

571
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,340
I've been wanting to talk to you.

572
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:56,510
"Pirate King" is enormously meaningful to me.

573
00:36:56,510 --> 00:37:00,190
Watching "Pirate King," I looked forward to

574
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:02,430
the characters' next adventure

575
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:04,580
and the new friends they'd make.

576
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:08,980
Telling my parents about it made me happy.

577
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:10,920
That's why watching "Pirate King"

578
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,790
made me feel like they were

579
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:17,220
still with me even after they passed away.

580
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:22,990
Hearing that makes me truly happy.

581
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:27,400
I've always wanted to know who the sponsor was

582
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:32,360
but I only knew you by your nickname.

583
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,820
Thank you so much for your help.

584
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:44,240
I've actually had to keep the things I liked a secret.

585
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:48,840
So, I had to give up on everything I liked,

586
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,930
but I couldn't bring myself to.

587
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:55,860
So, I tried to give up on everything else.

588
00:37:57,470 --> 00:38:00,680
I've been living in anxiety every day,

589
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:05,110
but I've looked forward to the next adventure.

590
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:07,070
Were you...

591
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:12,820
Were you able to look forward to tomorrow?

592
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,510
Yes.

593
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:18,620
You must be Ban Ju Yeon.

594
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:22,170
How did you know...

595
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:25,320
You really were.

596
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:28,750
I heard Mr. Ban Ju Yeon was my fan.

597
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:32,420
<i>Sir,</i>

598
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:34,920
I need to talk to you. Do you have a moment?

599
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:38,890
I'm sorry. Email me if you need to say something.

600
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:41,780
I just need a moment, sir.

601
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:44,270
I know you're a fan, but you're going too far.

602
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:47,440
I'll call someone if you keep following me.

603
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,280
I'm actually not your fan.

604
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:56,220
I'm not someone who likes

605
00:38:56,220 --> 00:39:00,470
something purely and passionately.

606
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:02,750
Why are you here, then...

607
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,940
I know someone like that.

608
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:13,330
It's Director Ban of Yongsung Department Store.

609
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:16,070
Because he loves your work so much,

610
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:18,830
he couldn't hide it even when he had to.

611
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:20,650
Even though he was so lonely,

612
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:24,660
he looked forward to a new day for "Pirate King."

613
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:26,930
Are you Japanese?

614
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:29,490
Please leave now.

615
00:39:29,490 --> 00:39:33,280
Didn't you want to do the pop-up for fans like him?

616
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:38,320
As a long-time "Pirate King" fan, Director Ban

617
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,450
wants the kids who visit the pop-up

618
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:43,800
to be comforted and be happy like he was.

619
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:51,430
Sir.

620
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:55,430
<i>She said...</i>

621
00:39:55,430 --> 00:40:00,870
she can't like something purely and passionately,

622
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:07,860
but she likes you very much.

623
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:09,930
I see.

624
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:32,200
You told me to wait at home.

625
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,890
Where have you been?

626
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:38,100
The "Pirate King" pop-up is still happening.

627
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:40,380
So you don't have to worry.

628
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:43,080
Did you convince the creator?

629
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:45,950
Yes, I just met with him.

630
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:49,800
But he said someone visited him before I did.

631
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:54,740
I wasn't helpful that much, was I?

632
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:56,470
No.

633
00:40:56,470 --> 00:40:58,860
You helped tremendously.

634
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:00,600
Thank you.

635
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:07,440
Why do you look unhappy, then?

636
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,350
I want to be someone you can rely on,

637
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:11,320
but I don't think I am.

638
00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:19,040
You went through a lot because of me.

639
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:22,990
When I went to the farm alone,

640
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:25,650
do you remember why you came?

641
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:27,440
Because being alone

642
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,940
makes you feel lonely?

643
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:31,400
Yes.

644
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,350
We agreed to lean on each other.

645
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:35,280
So we don't feel lonely.

646
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:40,890
Did you forget our promise?

647
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,730
<i>Let's do this.</i>

648
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:48,590
<i>I'll rely on you and...</i>

649
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:51,180
<i>you'll rely on me.</i>

650
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:55,110
<i>So we don't feel lonely.</i>

651
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:56,920
<i>So we don't...</i>

652
00:41:58,330 --> 00:42:00,300
<i>feel lonely.</i>

653
00:42:01,330 --> 00:42:03,410
Everyone around me

654
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:07,350
didn't understand my way.

655
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:10,350
But someone understands me entirely.

656
00:42:10,350 --> 00:42:12,970
He's happy because of me

657
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:16,180
and he's grateful for my love.

658
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:20,380
I don't feel lonely, thanks to that fact alone.

659
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,900
But that must not be enough for you.

Team Leader.

674
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:37,750
What magic spell did you cast yesterday?

675
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:40,120
Is this about the pop-up moving forward?

676
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:43,400
Yes, the creator even posted this.

677
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:44,850
Here.

678
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:50,130
Also, the person who created the post

679
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:51,710
posted an apology, too.

680
00:44:51,710 --> 00:44:53,600
There's also a post about

681
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:57,000
Director forgiving someone's son's mistake.

682
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,940
The public opinion was changing already,

683
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:01,540
but this will definitely quiet things down.

684
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:03,190
I thought it'd take some time,

685
00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:05,960
but I don't think the opening will be affected.

686
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:08,560
Here comes the person who worked his magic.

687
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,080
Hello, sir.

688
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:13,050
I didn't get to tell you something yesterday.

689
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:15,350
The "Pirate King" creator decided to do

690
00:45:15,350 --> 00:45:17,770
a signing event during the pop-up.

691
00:45:17,770 --> 00:45:19,440
Daebak.

692
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,120
Daebak.

693
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,480
Isn't that incredible?

694
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,330
This has never happened in Korea before.

695
00:45:26,330 --> 00:45:28,800
Well, I suppose.

696
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,630
Hold on. We need to start preparing now.

697
00:45:31,630 --> 00:45:33,690
- Hurry.
- Okay.

698
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,120
You have a wisdom tooth.

699
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:46,480
W-Wisdom tooth? At this point?

700
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:49,190
Yes, you got one very late,

701
00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:51,450
but it depends on the person.

702
00:45:51,450 --> 00:45:55,460
Would you like me to pull it out now?

703
00:45:56,530 --> 00:45:58,390
Will it hurt a lot?

704
00:45:58,390 --> 00:46:01,480
The location doesn't seem too bad.

705
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:04,410
I'd be lying if I said it won't hurt.

706
00:46:04,410 --> 00:46:06,390
Oh, okay.

707
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:08,200
I...

708
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:10,390
I'm not ready for it yet.

709
00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:14,080
Okay. Get ready and come back.

710
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:17,200
Adults are more afraid than kids.

711
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,770
I see.

Ha Jin.

714
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:33,400
Are you feeling better?

715
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:35,990
Yes.

716
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:43,730
I know I can call you to see you,

717
00:46:43,730 --> 00:46:46,350
but I wanted to wait for you here.

718
00:46:46,350 --> 00:46:49,990
If I suddenly showed up, I thought you'd be

719
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:52,740
happy to see me out of surprise.

720
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:54,420
Ha Jin.

721
00:46:55,410 --> 00:46:59,480
Even I think I'm all over the place.

722
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,740
I'm sorry.

723
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:10,890
I went too far that day.

724
00:47:10,890 --> 00:47:14,660
You didn't suggest doing anything right away.

725
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:18,130
You were being sweet as a boyfriend

726
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:20,470
and you were showing concern.

727
00:47:22,350 --> 00:47:24,560
But I was afraid.

728
00:47:25,810 --> 00:47:27,740
That's why I did that.

729
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:33,350
