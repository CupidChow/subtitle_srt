1
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:14,090


2
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,730
   

3
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,390
   

4
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,140
   

5
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:25,850
   

6
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:27,650
   

7
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,900
   

8
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:34,720
   

9
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:49,110
   

10
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,200
   

11
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:54,840
I got so scared that the reporters were ruining it.

12
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,250
I'm glad there was no accident.

13
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,930
Team Leader looked very shocked.

14
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:00,490
I would've passed out if I were her.

15
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:02,410
It's not easy dating a successor.

16
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:07,690
But the shop employees think she benefits off him a lot.

17
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:09,350
They have no clue.

18
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:12,030
I know. That's what all the articles say.

19
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,250
Wouldn't it be better if she joined Big Forest?

20
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,940
The conditions sound much better.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,270
   

22
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:28,980
I don't want to say bye to her,

23
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,230
but that'd be better for her sake.

24
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:34,810
She can't move to the US without her boyfriend.

25
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:37,050
Let's put everything away.

26
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:45,710
   

27
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:55,710
I made sure Ms. Baek's personal info wouldn't be released.

28
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:58,950
But it's hard to remove the posts

29
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:01,280
that are already on social media.

30
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,000
We can't help it, then.

31
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:06,080
Thank you for everything. You can go home.

32
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:09,490
You should go home, too. It's late.

33
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:10,980
Okay.

34
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,400
Su Jeong.

35
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,320
Leave if you want to.

36
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:43,200
As early as tomorrow.

37
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:49,960
What are you talking about?

38
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:53,950
Big Forest offered you a job, right?

39
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,260
I know it's in the US,

40
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,430
but it'd be a good opportunity for you.

41
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:08,610
It's hard to be acknowledged by staying here.

42
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,940
 If you stay at Yongsung, 

43
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,950
 you'll keep being mistreated like that. 

44
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:18,480
 You'll be nothing but Ban Ju Yeon's girlfriend. 

45
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,380
I want you to use your talents freely.

46
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:28,990
So,

47
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:31,370
you're saying I can leave even if it's tomorrow?

48
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:35,130
Yes, anytime you want.

49
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:38,950
If I leave, I don't know when I'll return to Korea.

50
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:41,520
It doesn't matter.

51
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,730
How about you—

52
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:46,080
Well, no need to worry about me.

53
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,370
Okay.

54
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:58,930
I'll think about it in a positive direction.

55
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:00,900
You have worked a lot lately.

56
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,960
Take a few days off and think about it.

57
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,900
That's great.

58
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,550
I have a ton of paid leave left.

59
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,750
Should I go home?

60
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:16,590
You're leaving already?

61
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:20,780
Yes. I'll start thinking about it now.

62
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,120
Leave as early as tomorrow?

63
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,030
 I don't know when I'll be back, but he doesn't care? 

64
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:40,110
Can he live without me or what?

65
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:42,890
I think I'd tell you to leave, too.

66
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:45,540
 Considering what happened today, too. 

67
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:48,520
So, what will you do?

68
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,340
Have you thought about it?

69
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,920
Have I?

70
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,460
I got to think a lot, thanks to him.

71
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,300
If I should be leaving,

72
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,360
what would I be leaving for?

73
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,100
 If I'm staying, why should I? 

74
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,780
I thought about it and

75
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:07,970
I reached the conclusion sooner than I thought.

76
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:09,430
 Really? 

77
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,110
Yes.

78
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:21,300
 Su Jeong, are you thinking about it? 

79
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,530
 Should we go to Han River tomorrow evening? 

80
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,960
 I'm sorry, but I can't go to Han River tomorrow. 

81
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,920
 I have stuff to do. 

82
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,790
 What stuff? 

83
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,560
 You did a lot today. 

84
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,340
 Good night. 

85
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:43,710
 You, too, Su Jeong. 

86
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,920
Chief Kim Shin Won?

87
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,330
You're sighing first thing in the morning.

88
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:13,680
Is this "The Last Leaf," or what?

89
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,190
You've been distracting the employees by smiling here and there.

90
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:19,860
Are you discouraging them like this now?

91
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,250
What are you talking about now?

92
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,940
You don't eat or smile much these days.

93
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,950
I heard you don't greet people properly, either.

94
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:28,840
Why should I hear their worries about you?

95
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:32,080
So, are you worried about me, too?

96
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,340
Yes.

97
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:36,350
I'm worried you'll end up losing Ha Jin.

98
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,370
You must've heard.

99
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:43,650
Life sure is unexpected.

100
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:45,670
I've known you for so long,

101
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:48,630
but I just learned that you're a coward.

102
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:50,900
Because I've had nothing to be afraid of.

103
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,280
How do you think she feels?

104
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:59,000
Everyone is afraid before jumping into the ocean.

105
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,530
Even so...

106
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:03,790
she came to see you.

107
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,330
By working up her courage.

108
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,540
Ban Ju Yeon.

109
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,740
He's all grown up now.

110
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,620
 Did you sleep well? 

111
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,880
 Call me when you wake up. 

112
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,850
 - Su Jeong?  
 - Is she still asleep?

113
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,420
 Yes, Team Leader. 

114
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:35,120
I'll do that, then.

115
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,260
Don't worry about work and rest. Okay.

116
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,290
You scared the crap out of me!

117
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:43,810
Was that Team Leader Baek just now?

118
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:48,770
Yes, of course. She's the only team leader to us.

119
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:55,730
She didn't even check your messages.

120
00:07:58,030 --> 00:07:59,960
You treated her badly, didn't you?

121
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,130
That can't be.

122
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:02,460
She was probably moved, actually.

123
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,940
Why won't she read them if she was?

124
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:08,420
Do you want to... shred documents again?

125
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,940
No.

126
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,640
I was mistaken...

127
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,190
She probably hasn't checked

128
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:14,730
since she was on the phone with me.

129
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:16,570
Check again. Let's see.

130
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:18,010
Yes, Team Leader.

131
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:20,240
Yes, I saw the message you just sent.

132
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,380
Hello.

133
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,880
What are you doing on your days off?

134
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,570
 Don't worry and enjoy yourself. 

135
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,090
That was Team Leader Hye Ju, right?

136
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:38,190
It was Team Leader Su Jeong.

137
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:40,580
Really? Gosh.

138
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:45,950
I need to save energy for the exam.

139
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:47,450
Do you have to make me do this?

140
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:51,060
And tell him to move his stuff himself.

141
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,490
Here.

142
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:57,050
Is there more load to carry?

143
00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:01,120
You're the load to carry. Seriously.

144
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,080
But why are you suddenly removing stuff?

145
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,250
Did you have another fight, by chance?

146
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,670
Not at all.

147
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:11,090
I'm trying to clean while I can.

148
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:13,650
It only gets dusty in the attic.

149
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:17,160
Yes, are you here?

150
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,330
Yes, just one moment.

151
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:19,780
Carry them downstairs.

152
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:22,250
I'll be right there.

153
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,780
 The customer is currently on another call. 

154
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:27,510
 You'll be connected to the voicemail... 

155
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:37,790
I hurt her feelings?

156
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:40,990
There's no way.

157
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,630
Director?

158
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,840
Chief?

159
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,310
It's an emergency.

160
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,980
So, what you told her last was,

161
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,240
"Leave"?

162
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,040
- "As early as tomorrow"? 
 - That's right.

163
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,440
You said you don't care when she returns.

164
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,500
That's also true.

165
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,380
Of course, you can't reach her.

166
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,680
She must be angry.

167
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,930
She's angry?

168
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:24,500
I was helping her make the decision easily.

169
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,960
Being too considerate can hurt someone, too.

170
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,100
Her boyfriend told her to leave alone so easily.

171
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,550
If she didn't feel hurt,

172
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:35,550
that'd be more strange, don't you think?

173
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,960
What do you mean?

174
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,210
I'd be going with her.

175
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:43,420
Sure, it'd be hard to leave together immediately.

176
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,350
I don't have a job there.

177
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:47,180
I need a job offer and

178
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,800
I need a place to live, too.

179
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:54,280
Is that how you said it?

180
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,640
That you'd be going together?

181
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:59,000
We're basically one now. Isn't that obvious...

182
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:08,270
 Sis is getting rid of all of your stuff. 

183
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:10,570
 Did you know? 

184
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:11,810
She must be furious.

185
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:13,600
I need to resolve this immediately.

186
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:19,090
I think... you had better talk in person.

187
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:23,650
You sure are experienced.

188
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:31,380
Su Jeong, why are you so hard to reach?

189
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,330
I'm in front of your house now.

190
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:35,100
 Huh? You should be at work— 

191
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,630
I need to talk to you urgently.

192
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,150
Can you come out for a moment?

193
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:42,590
 I'm sorry. I'm not at home right now. 

194
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:45,590
Where are you? I'll meet you there.

195
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:49,220
 Well, I'm at your place. 

196
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,280
 I'll meet you here, then. 

197
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,590
She already got rid of all of my stuff?

198
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,450
Su Jeong.

199
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:07,870
Su Jeong.

200
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,200
You made it.

201
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:21,420
I wasn't going to make you leave alone.

202
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,890
When I told you to go to the US,

203
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:25,290
I was thinking of going with you.

204
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:28,920
Of course. I see.

205
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,530
Did you know?

206
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:35,900
When I first heard you,

207
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,960
I thought you didn't mind being apart.

208
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,730
So, I felt sad and disappointed.

209
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:42,750
But I realized that couldn't have been the case.

210
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,200
So, I wanted to talk to you more.

211
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,400
Why did you ignore me and move my stuff, then?

212
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,420
I couldn't tell you.

213
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,700
I wanted to surprise you.

214
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,710
Surprise me?

215
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:56,410
Because I'm grateful.

216
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:59,310
That someone cares about me so much.

217
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:01,090
Whether you want to leave together or not,

218
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:03,010
you made the decision for me.

219
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:06,140
So, I decorated the house with the stuff you like

220
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:09,630
and I wanted to cook something tasty while waiting for you.

221
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,640
Come here for a moment.

222
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,880
Ta-da.

223
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,230
Su Jeong, this is...

224
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:22,020
Yes, it's the ship meal from "Pirate King."

225
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,400
It's so perfect.

226
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,900
The number of sausage and broccoli placement, too.

227
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,210
But I couldn't make the stew.

228
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:30,220
Hurry up and try it.

229
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:40,390
What do you think? Isn't it tasty?

230
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:42,330
I don't have a certificate like you,

231
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:45,190
but I know I can cook.

232
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:48,710
It's delicious. It's just the way I like it.

233
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:55,240
And I won't leave.

234
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,730
I'll stay at Yongsung.

235
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:00,320
Why? Because of your family?

236
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,750
I have no reason to leave.

237
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,660
You wanted us to leave because

238
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:09,990
I might not be acknowledged since we're dating.

239
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:14,960
I've worked so hard to be acknowledged by others

240
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,210
because I didn't want to be looked down on

241
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:21,060
and it was to prove that I'm not weak.

242
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,130
But I already have the people who trust me

243
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:29,980
and the ones who cherish and love me.

244
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:32,100
I even have someone

245
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:35,410
who loves me just the way I am, too.

246
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:39,650
I don't want to leave because of what

247
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:42,030
strangers might think of me.

248
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:45,900
Of course, if Yongsung doesn't give me the opportunity I deserve,

249
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,200
I'll go somewhere else.

250
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,310
But not now.

251
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:55,050
Okay. Do as you like.

252
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:58,720
Let's finish it before it cools.

253
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:11,900
D-Did you call this delicious?

254
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,080
What...

255
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,780
What's wrong with it?

256
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:29,960
What are you doing, Su Jeong?

257
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:34,170
I'll become a nerd starting today.

258
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:37,670
That's not something you can just become.

259
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,500
Your blood is hot even if you try to avoid it

260
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,560
and you need to have flames in your heart.

261
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,910
Anything is possible.

262
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,960
She's too normal.

263
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,430
But why do you suddenly want to—

264
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:51,590
Instead of worrying about other people,

265
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:54,000
I'll do what truly makes me happy.

266
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,890
I realized I didn't have a proper hobby.

267
00:15:56,890 --> 00:16:00,300
This isn't just a hobby. It's a lifestyle.

268
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,910
What did you say?

269
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:04,800
That's a good idea.

270
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,390
Anyway, it's nice to enjoy things together.

271
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:09,150
I'll start with comic books.

272
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,210
I guess comic books won't do.

273
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:43,030
   

274
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,580
 Ha Jin, 

275
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,090
 it's me. Kim Shin Won. 

276
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,910
Shin Won, don't talk for a moment.

277
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:54,280
Do you not want to hear my voice any more?

278
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,770
No, no, no. It's not like that.

279
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:00,640
 I'm sorry, Ha Jin. 

280
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,050
 I didn't know I was... 

281
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:03,450
My gosh.

282
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:06,520
 such a little coward, either. 

283
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:09,290
Are you drunk, by chance?

284
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:11,920
 You extended yourself to me, 

285
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:15,080
but I walked backward out of fear.

286
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,340
 It's because I like you so much. 

287
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:19,340
Because I've never met

288
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:22,030
 a woman like you in my life. 

289
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:23,980
 I... 

290
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,360
This is it.

291
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,590
 hope... 

292
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:29,340
 I'm not too late. 

293
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,020
You're not too late.

294
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,430
Let's hang up for now and—

295
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:34,010
I love you,

296
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:36,300
 Ha Jin. 

297
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,020
 If you don't want to answer me... 

298
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,470
Me, too!

299
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:41,020
I love you, too!

300
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:44,420
So, hang up for now. Okay?

301
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,450
She says she loves me.

302
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:50,260
Good night.

303
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,200
 Congratulations, ma'am! 

304
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,560
 Bravo! 

305
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,700
 - Congrats! 
 - Congrats! 

306
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:15,440
 Congrats! 

307
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,620
 Congrats! 

308
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,530
 Congrats! 

309
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:35,050
 Me, too! I love you, too! 

310
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,400
 Are you up? 

311
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,680
 If you remembered something just now, 

312
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,810
 it wasn't a dream. Don't worry. 

313
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:46,910
 See you later. 

314
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:48,010
 I'll go to sleep now. 

315
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:49,840
 I love you. 

316
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:59,930
I'm visiting Mom since I'm free.

317
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,020
It's her birthday today.

318
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:03,480
 I remember it was around this time. 

319
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,490
 - Have a nice trip.  
 - Okay. Talk to you later.

320
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:11,900
You probably need to charge the car first.

321
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,270
What? Did you use my car without asking me?

322
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:17,910
We couldn't go on a drive with

323
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:20,510
my girlfriend's police car.

324
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,850
Geez, seriously.

325
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:30,020
Find an EV charger nearby.

326
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:33,050
 I found the EV chargers nearby. 

327
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:35,550
 Which one would you like to go to? 

328
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:56,200
I'm here, Honey. 
    

329
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,300
I brought the kids with me this time.

330
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:02,240
Dad, were you here without us again?

331
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,560
Seriously.

332
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,330
Happy birthday, Mom.

333
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:09,220
Happy birthday, Mom.

334
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:12,290
I haven't visited you since I was busy.

335
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:14,140
Is that why you didn't visit my dreams?

336
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:16,080
I miss you.

337
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,180
Mom, she's dating these days.

338
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:20,470
She isn't actually busy with work.

339
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:21,700
Hey, be quiet.

340
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,050
He's the same age as me, too.

341
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:25,490
Isn't that crazy, Mom?

342
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:28,510
It's been too long since I beat you, right?

343
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:29,930
Happy birthday, Honey.

344
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:32,570
We're all doing well. Don't worry.

345
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:34,870
I know you worry about Su Jeong a lot,

346
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:37,090
but I'll let her...

347
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:38,830
live freely from now on.

348
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:41,560
I'm free now, Dad.

349
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,420
No, Su Jeong.

350
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:47,390
I've been waiting to say this.

351
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:51,050
You don't have to worry about us so much anymore.

352
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:56,590
I want you to finally stop feeling burdened

353
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:58,300
and do whatever you want to do.

354
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,550
I don't need your pocket money anymore.

355
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,560
Eat everything you want to eat

356
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,110
and wear everything you want to wear.

357
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:06,900
I've done my best because of you guys.

358
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:10,170
You were my motivation, not a burden. So—

359
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:11,980
Dad is rich now.

360
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:14,690
He really doesn't need the pocket money.

361
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:18,170
- What? 
 - This is all thanks to you.

362
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:20,570
What did I do?

363
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,320
Really?

364
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,250
Yes.

365
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,050
Wow. That's amazing, Dad.

366
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:30,870
How could that happen?

367
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:34,270
Wow, he looks just like Ju Yeon.

368
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:36,760
Director.

369
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,390
Hello, Father.

370
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:44,240
What brings you here?

371
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,670
You said you were visiting your mother.

372
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:49,650
That reminded me of my parents.

373
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:52,350
Are your parents here?

374
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:53,830
Yes.

375
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,450
   

376
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:13,680
We had the offline meeting that day.

377
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,000
That's right.

378
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,140
That's why I was happy to meet you.

379
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:22,090
It felt like a gift from my parents.

380
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:26,280
And you actually became a gift.

381
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:29,890
This is my first time

382
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,160
coming here with someone else.

383
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:36,120
I didn't get to come here that often.

384
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:39,940
I always had to come alone secretly.

385
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:42,850
I was worried my grandmother would find out...

386
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:46,010
and everything felt like my fault.

387
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:51,080
This is my first time feeling at ease.

388
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,600
I got to bring them flowers, too.

389
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:59,880
Let's come here together from now on.

390
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,500
Whenever you'd like.

391
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,630
The project was a huge success.

392
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:12,170
The stock price went up, too.

393
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:14,210
Things are going very well.

394
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:17,920
The board members trust Director Ban, too.

395
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,970
He really is the best candidate.

396
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:22,520
In the next board meeting,

397
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,410
we'll discuss who your successor will be.

398
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:25,990
Later.

399
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:28,000
Let's talk again later.

400
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,810
Okay.

401
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,260
Ban Ju Yeon said he's no longer

402
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:36,370
interested in becoming the successor.

403
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:38,950
I knew he wouldn't be.

404
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,940
I don't understand.

405
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:45,270
Didn't you betray me because you thought

406
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:48,020
he'd be the new owner of the company?

407
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,760
No.

408
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,670
I helped him

409
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:54,220
because of my feelings on a humane level.

410
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:56,850
He wasn't even trying to be the successor.

411
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:59,560
He merely worked hard to be loved by me.

412
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,940
You helped a foolish person like him?

413
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:08,130
Do you know what makes a person weak?

414
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:09,270
Love.

415
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:11,490
It ruins you instantly.

416
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:13,610
That's why I was tough on him.

417
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:14,950
To make him stronger.

418
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:19,490
But he was able to endure that

419
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:22,270
because of love, too.

420
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:24,390
He didn't want to disappoint you

421
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:27,350
and wanted to be acknowledged by you.

422
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:29,040
That desire.

423
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:31,380
He was able to give up

424
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:33,220
on the position he wanted all his life

425
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:37,270
because of his feelings for Ms. Baek, too.

426
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:43,180
Love made Director Ban stronger.

427
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:48,080
That's why I don't find him foolish.

428
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,860
He's stronger than anyone else.

429
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:55,530
He's been treated harshly.

430
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,940
 Who's your grandmother? 

431
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:02,530
 I don't have a grandson like you. 

432
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:04,650
 He was forced to 

433
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:07,260
 be strong and not crumble. 

434
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,010
 I'll be better from now on. 

435
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:13,320
 I'll work harder as your grandson. 

436
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:19,590
The one who helped you endure sadness

437
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:22,130
was also Director Ban.

438
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,860
If you can...

439
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:28,380
finally see his love for you

440
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:30,610
clearly,

441
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:34,850
I hope you can apologize before it's too late.

442
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:37,270
For your own sake.

443
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:40,220
 After blaming your misfortunes on your grandson, 

444
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:41,840
 does that make you feel at ease? 

445
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,200
 And what I'm hoping to get back 

446
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:47,060
 isn't the successor position, 

447
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:49,560
 it's the director's family. 

448
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,830
I'll go home now.

449
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:01,660
Chief, have you seen this?

450
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,410
Someone posted this last night.

451
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:04,640
It's hilarious.

452
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,560
 If you don't want to answer me... 

453
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,010
 Me, too! 

454
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:09,600
 I love you, too! 

455
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,500
 So, hang up for now. Okay? 

456
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,750
Oh, yes. I saw it earlier.

457
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:16,640
But that voice...

458
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,370
sounds just like yours.

459
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:23,350
A nice voice like that is rare.

460
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:24,670
Yes.

461
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:26,600
It's me.

462
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,270
Pardon?

463
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:30,470
Please promote the shop.

464
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:31,620
The food is good.

465
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,240
Well, then...

466
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:36,700
Whoa.

467
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,000
Ha Jin.

468
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:49,060
Thank you...

469
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:51,100
for taking me back.

470
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,630
I should be thanking you.

471
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,810
It was a love confession I'd never forget.

472
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:01,770
But there's a problem.

473
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,810
The customer video went viral.

474
00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:06,680
Are you in trouble?

475
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,360
Yes.

476
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:15,160
It's a problem that I have too many customers.

477
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:40,650
   

478
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,310
What brings you all the way here?

479
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:08,030
I...

480
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:11,420
am sorry.

481
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:14,990
To be honest,

482
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:18,230
I wished I were dead.

483
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,590
It shouldn't have been my son.

484
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:25,020
I should've died instead of him.

485
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:27,660
If I died instead,

486
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:31,060
I wouldn't have been in this much pain.

487
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:34,430
But I couldn't do that.

488
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:37,470
So, I blamed myself.

489
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:40,580
That's why...

490
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:44,860
I blamed you, too.

491
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:49,990
You did nothing wrong.

492
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:52,180
You lost your parents

493
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:56,250
and you needed love more than anyone.

494
00:29:57,150 --> 00:30:01,240
But I couldn't love you.

495
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:06,390
I was your only family.

496
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:13,100
I know...

497
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:16,640
this is of no use now...

498
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:19,070
but I thought...

499
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:22,830
I should tell you this.

500
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,960
Thank...

501
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:29,260
Thank you...

502
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:32,480
for protecting me.

503
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,390
Grandmother.

504
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:10,820
That's wonderful. I'm so glad.

505
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:15,950
For that reason,

506
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:18,670
we need to cancel the contract.

507
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:20,020
The contract?

508
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:23,300
The confidentiality agreement we made.

509
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:27,410
I have no secrets to keep anymore

510
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:31,390
and you don't need me to secure your job.

511
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,860
You're right.

512
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:36,880
Do you agree to cancel the contract?

513
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:45,420
Yes, I agree.

514
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:59,850
Where's Na Na?

515
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,960
I was wondering where you went. You were changing.

516
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,580
Yes. I thought I should try it myself.

517
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:09,790
What do you think?

518
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:11,100
It's pretty.

519
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,930
Right? It's really comfortable.

520
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:17,110
I like how the traditional patterns are mixed in.

521
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:20,110
The foreign tourists would like it, right?

522
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:21,810
Yes, I think so.

523
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:25,480
You remember we're having a team dinner, right?

524
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,840
Yes, of course.

525
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,770
We just need to choose a place now.

526
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:33,240
What kind of meat should we get, then?

527
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,980
Beef.

528
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:40,690
Let's get the top-quality Korean beef.

529
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:44,480
Nice. Gosh.

530
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:53,240
Thank you all for doing so great.

531
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,370
I'm in your care going forward as well.

532
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:57,310
- Yes. 
 - Yes.

533
00:32:58,170 --> 00:33:00,140
I'm fine with water.

534
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:03,030
It's a special occasion. Not even one glass?

535
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:04,680
That's exactly why.

536
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:08,310
I want my hardworking girlfriend to drink freely.

537
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:11,220
Don't worry about later.

538
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:13,280
You don't have to do this.

539
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,720
It's a bit cringe.

540
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,170
I prefer it when they do a drinking competition.

541
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:19,880
- Cheers! 
 - Cheers.

542
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:27,300
Thanks for the meal, Director.

543
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,800
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

544
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,340
Where should we go for the second round?

545
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:33,590
I don't know. Any suggestions?

546
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:34,950
How's a karaoke?

547
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:36,450
Karaoke sounds good.

548
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:37,760
Karaoke?

549
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,850
- Let's go to a karaoke. 
 - Okay!

550
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:41,430
Let's go.

551
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:50,480
♫  Dancing little Catallena  ♫

552
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,030
♫  I get sucked in without realizing  ♫

553
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:57,270
♫  The proud Catallena  ♫

554
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:02,350
♫  I'm melting. I'm melting  ♫

555
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:04,040
♫  I'm melting. I'm melting  ♫

556
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,950
Nice!

557
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,680
 Fantastic singing skills. 

558
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:15,260
Good thing we came to a karaoke.

559
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,790
You think so?

560
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:22,450
Let's keep this going. The next song is...

561
00:34:22,450 --> 00:34:24,370
   

562
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:30,140
Who's singing this at a team gathering?

563
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:32,750
It's "Confession."

564
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:00,400
That was my song.

565
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,300
I was skipping the intro.

566
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:08,080
That's what I was trying to do.

567
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,210
Was it yours, Deputy?

568
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:12,730
It's okay. Just play it again.

569
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:14,390
Will you really sing that?

570
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:15,920
- Why not? 
 - But still...

571
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,200
Let's just move on to the next.

572
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,740
Yes, we lifted the mood.

573
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:22,470
A song is in a queue. Whose is it?

574
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:23,960
Why? I wanted to sing...

575
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:26,410
The song is already playing.

576
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:28,260
   

577
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:29,920
After this.

578
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:48,520
♫  When I was a kid  ♫

579
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:55,560
♫  I heard something I couldn't believe  ♫

580
00:35:55,560 --> 00:36:01,860
♫  Someone said they'll give me the world  ♫

581
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:06,540
♫  It gave me a dream  ♫

582
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:09,550
 Ban Ju Yeon! 

583
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:12,240
♫  I shake my head in disbelief  ♫

584
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,280
♫  Shake, shake, shake  ♫

585
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,150
♫  It's whispering to me  ♫

586
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:18,560
So cool!

587
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,800
♫  It's me. It's me. It's me  ♫

588
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,540
♫  The world belongs to the one who dreams  ♫

589
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:26,100
So cool!

590
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:28,840
♫  Be brave  ♫

591
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:31,460
♫  You can do it  ♫

592
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:39,250
You said you wouldn't drink.

593
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:41,030
I drank because I was upset.

594
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:43,200
Did you hate me singing

595
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,180
"Confession" again that much?

596
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:48,640
I thought you'd just let it go.

597
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,850
I'm a man who can hold grudges.

598
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:55,570
That's not something to brag about.

599
00:36:55,570 --> 00:36:58,730
I noticed when they brought up the karaoke.

600
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:01,170
You were sweating and

601
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:03,810
you turned off the song.

602
00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:07,250
We still had fun today.

603
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:11,110
I know, too.

604
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:13,980
That I looked terrible that day.

605
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,140
Thinking now, you were cute then, too.

606
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:20,310
You were really cute.

607
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,870
I'm not cute.

608
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:24,870
I'm cool.

609
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:30,650
Drink this. It's chocolate milk.

610
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,180
You try to make me feel better this way.

611
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:37,330
I'm not a child.

612
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:43,290
This won't work.

613
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:45,610
What should I do, then?

614
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:09,110
He sleeps when he's drunk.

615
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:13,270
Why does he keep recording, anyway?

616
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:15,510
 Baek Su Jeong is on danger level one. 

617
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:16,730
 Be on alert. 

618
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:19,320
 Baek Su Jeong's danger level went up by two. 

619
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,650
 Very dangerous. 

620
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:23,790
 She must be eliminated. 

621
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:26,990
I really didn't like him at first.

622
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:30,830
 But why do I find Baek Su Jeong pretty? 

623
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:34,300
 She looked pretty even at that moment. 

624
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:36,160
 Baek Su Jeong. 

625
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:40,470
Come on. How cringe.

626
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:09,480
 Check the audio recording. 

627
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:17,690
 You're drunk and acting like a fool. 

628
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:20,310
 But you're cute even now... 

629
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:23,900
 How could he be so cool? 

630
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:25,820
 You heard that, right? 

631
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:29,350
 You aren't cute. You're cool. 

632
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:31,710
 You're cool, Ban Ju Yeon. 

633
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:43,950
Gosh, I'm so stressed.

634
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:48,380
Su Jeong?

635
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,480
You're looking for a hobby. Why try so hard?

636
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:54,010
You're getting stressed, too.

637
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:56,810
Wanting to be good at everything is a flaw.

638
00:40:56,810 --> 00:40:59,430
I'm not trying to show off or anything.

639
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:02,510
You like something when you enjoy it.

640
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:07,650
Instead of doing something with a result,

641
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:10,540
should we step out to get fresh air?

642
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:18,610
I love it.

643
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:20,620
I'm finally taking a break!

644
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:22,280
You're glad we came, right?

645
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,460
Yes.

646
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:26,520
Working is good, but you need to rest, too.

647
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:29,820
It's nice how empty it is here.

648
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:32,460
Is it normally this empty?

649
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:34,490
I rented the whole place.

650
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:35,450
What?

651
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:37,800
You rented this whole place?

652
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,370
Why are you shocked?

653
00:41:39,370 --> 00:41:41,040
Hasn't it been obvious all this time?

654
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,860
Don't you know who I am?

655
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:45,980
So cute.

656
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:49,470
Take it easy, everyone.

657
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,980
Okay. I'll cook for you.

658
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:57,010
You want to cook here, too?

659
00:41:57,010 --> 00:41:58,550
Let me do it. You should rest.

660
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:00,700
- Would you like to? 
 - Yes.

661
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:02,900
I'll do it.

662
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,460
Why? I'll do it.

663
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:05,900
I won't mix up sugar and salt this time.

664
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:08,070
No, let me do it.

665
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:09,900
But I'm good at housework.

666
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,770
Yes, let's just watch the fire.

667
00:42:11,770 --> 00:42:13,370
Let Black Dragon do it.

668
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:15,060
Let's go.

669
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:35,320
You're better than I thought.

670
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:48,480
I don't think it'll work.

671
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,510
It's shaking.

672
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:53,820
I won!

673
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:54,830
That doesn't count.

674
00:42:54,830 --> 00:42:56,910
It fell because you blew on it.

675
00:42:56,910 --> 00:42:59,200
You knocked it down yourself.

676
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,400
Accept the result.

677
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:03,080
Let's do it again.

678
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,370
Fine, let's. Do it—

679
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:08,480
When did they leave?

680
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:13,190
The competition must've blinded us.

681
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:14,250
I know.

682
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:16,680
We've always been like this.

683
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:19,850
Should we stop playing games?

684
00:43:19,850 --> 00:43:21,660
Yes.

685
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:23,450
You aren't cold, right?

686
00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:25,700
I'm okay. I'm dressed properly.

687
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:29,310
Oh, right. Just one second.

688
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,520
This is for you.

689
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:50,760
I had to see the result since I started.

690
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:00,370
It looks nice on you.

691
00:44:00,370 --> 00:44:01,740
What do you think? Do I look nice?

692
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:02,990
Yes, you do.

693
00:44:02,990 --> 00:44:04,070
It's warm, right?

694
00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:05,250
Yes.

695
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:07,980
Thank you.

696
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:14,190
It's the first snow.

697
00:44:15,490 --> 00:44:17,440
How pretty.

698
00:44:18,290 --> 00:44:20,000
I know.

699
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,290
The snow is...

700
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:24,760
and so are you.

701
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:29,550
How nice.

702
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:32,220
Watching the first snow

703
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:33,910
with my first love.

704
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:39,080
It's the first snow.

705
00:44:39,830 --> 00:44:42,470
I'm glad I get to enjoy it.

706
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:44,750
I've been so busy lately.

707
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:46,110
I know.

708
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:49,370
I'll enjoy it all I want.

709
00:44:49,370 --> 00:44:53,790
♫  That one day we met  ♫

710
00:44:53,790 --> 00:44:55,660
Ha Jin.

711
00:44:56,870 --> 00:44:58,340
Yes?

712
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:02,050
If...

713
00:45:02,050 --> 00:45:05,420
If you find it hard to trust me,

714
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:09,590
just keep being suspicious of me.

715
00:45:10,630 --> 00:45:12,970
I'll continue to...

716
00:45:12,970 --> 00:45:14,930
prove myself, then.

717
00:45:14,930 --> 00:45:19,730
That I'm someone you can trust.

718
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:25,430
As for anxious and unsettling feelings like that...

719
00:45:26,570 --> 00:45:29,440
let's erase them and stay together.

720
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,120
For the rest of our lives.

721
00:45:31,910 --> 00:45:34,960
♫  I'll tell you how I feel  ♫

722
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,840
♫  Falling down  ♫

723
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:38,600
Could you do that?

724
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:42,600
♫  The showering stars and the round moon  ♫

725
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:44,940
♫  I whisper in the river  ♫

726
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:46,740
Thank you.

727
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:50,900
♫  We glow under the moonlight  ♫

728
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:53,260
♫  The moon goes down  ♫

729
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:58,800
♫  Even on dark nights, winter days  ♫

730
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,510
♫  It's shining on you  ♫

731
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:03,850
♫  Tell me now  ♫

732
00:46:03,850 --> 00:46:06,870
♫  Our bright night  ♫

733
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:09,450
♫  We stay bright  ♫

734
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:15,290
♫  Stay bright all around  ♫

735
00:46:22,850 --> 00:46:24,470
I'm...

736
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,960
too busy.

737
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,770
You should've said so sooner.

738
00:46:28,770 --> 00:46:31,360
I'll hire more people for you.

739
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:32,930
No.

740
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:35,690
To be honest,

741
00:46:35,690 --> 00:46:37,370
it's Ha Jin's shop that's busy.

742
00:46:37,370 --> 00:46:40,550
So, I'll be her business partner.

743
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:42,870
- Business partner? 
 - I noticed that

744
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:45,080
I'm good at dealing with customers.

745
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:49,060
It's fun to develop new dishes with Ha Jin, too.

746
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:53,040
You know how I love finding new restaurants.

747
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:56,160
All of your recommendations have been good.

748
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:59,450
So, since we're on the topic...

749
00:47:02,830 --> 00:47:04,140
Here.

750
00:47:04,910 --> 00:47:06,630
Please hand this to 
    

751
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:08,360
your grandmother for me.

752
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:09,930
Okay?

753
00:47:10,830 --> 00:47:12,490
I'm leaving.

754
00:47:15,930 --> 00:47:17,800
Adios.

755
00:47:18,790 --> 00:47:20,280
Wait...

756
00:47:22,970 --> 00:47:24,560
What the heck?

757
00:47:26,350 --> 00:47:30,890
   

758
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:47,320
What brings you here, Father?

759
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:48,650
I'm a shareholder, too.

760
00:47:48,650 --> 00:47:49,610
   

761
00:47:50,290 --> 00:47:52,430
I learned recently, too.

762
00:47:52,430 --> 00:47:54,900
Since I started working here, he bought the stock

763
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:56,600
whenever he had extra money.

764
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:58,570
To show his support.

765
00:47:58,570 --> 00:48:02,760
And the stock value went up because of the renewal.

766
00:48:03,090 --> 00:48:03,930
Wow...

767
00:48:03,930 --> 00:48:08,270
Thanks to you two and the employees' hard work.

768
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:25,620
You can go ahead.

769
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:42,330
Team Leader Baek's father?

770
00:48:42,330 --> 00:48:45,050
Yes. Nice to meet you.

771
00:48:45,050 --> 00:48:48,510
I was wondering if I'd get to see you here.

772
00:48:48,510 --> 00:48:50,380
I need to tell you something.

773
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:51,940
Dad.

774
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:55,170
I know you don't think Su Jeong is

775
00:48:55,170 --> 00:48:58,200
good enough for Ju Yeon.

776
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:01,100
- But Su Jeong is— 
 - No.

777
00:49:02,270 --> 00:49:04,870
She's more than we deserve.

778
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:09,740
Because she gave him the things

779
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:13,040
I couldn't provide for my grandson.

780
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:23,460
I apologize for everything.

781
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:27,130
I was wrong about too many things.

782
00:49:27,710 --> 00:49:30,220
But don't expect anything else.

783
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:35,010
I'll judge you based on your performance at work.

784
00:49:35,810 --> 00:49:37,280
Of course.

785
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,720
I prefer that, too.

786
00:49:45,030 --> 00:49:45,970
Let's go.

787
00:49:45,970 --> 00:49:47,430
Yes.

788
00:49:48,290 --> 00:49:50,130
See you later.

789
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:58,410
Wow, she's so charismatic.

790
00:49:58,410 --> 00:50:00,010
I felt a bit nervous.

791
00:50:00,010 --> 00:50:02,660
I didn't know you were planning to meet her.

792
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:04,570
You became so gutsy.

793
00:50:04,570 --> 00:50:07,620
Don't you know who I am?

794
00:50:07,620 --> 00:50:10,440
I'm a shareholder of Yongsung Department Store.

795
00:50:15,590 --> 00:50:20,240
 ­  

796
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:24,430
   

797
00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:27,310
I'm the new board member,

798
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:29,840
Ban Ju Yeon.

799
00:50:30,550 --> 00:50:34,220
 Director Ban Ju Yeon, who led a successful renewal, 

800
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:37,870
 was elected as a new board member of Yongsung. 

801
00:50:37,870 --> 00:50:40,720
 This secures his position as the 

802
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:42,210
 successor of Yongsung Group. 

803
00:50:42,210 --> 00:50:46,300
 Yongsung's next move is at the center of attention. 

804
00:50:57,940 --> 00:51:00,450
We can go in, right?

805
00:51:00,450 --> 00:51:02,110
You know me, right?

806
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:05,560
Yes, go in.

807
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:10,300
Here they are! Here they are!

808
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:25,470
Crackshot!

809
00:51:26,170 --> 00:51:29,500
Before we start the show,

810
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:34,360
we'd like to share this great news first.

811
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:37,940
We were sponsored by an anonymous fan.

812
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:41,340
So, we'll be touring in the UK.

813
00:51:42,310 --> 00:51:44,190
That's right.

814
00:51:45,210 --> 00:51:48,030
We'd like to thank him using this opportunity.

815
00:51:48,030 --> 00:51:51,110
The anonymous fan, Black Dragon.

816
00:51:51,110 --> 00:51:53,370
Thank you so much!

817
00:51:53,370 --> 00:51:55,660
This is the best part of being a fan.

818
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:01,340
Should we have fun, then?

819
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:04,590
Please welcome the bad boys of rock and roll.

820
00:52:04,590 --> 00:52:05,870
We are...

821
00:52:05,870 --> 00:52:09,960
Crackshot!

822
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:23,540
Put your hands up!

823
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:37,140
♫  With the green-hued wind  ♫

824
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:40,440
♫  I've always walked on this path  ♫

825
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:44,420
♫  I run back to that moment  ♫

826
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:51,810
♫  Under this blue sky that we used to walk together  ♫

827
00:52:51,810 --> 00:52:54,610
♫  You used to smile at me  ♫

828
00:52:54,610 --> 00:52:56,460
♫  I picture that image again  ♫

829
00:52:56,500 --> 00:53:01,670
♫  I wanted to be brave and hold your hand  ♫

830
00:53:01,670 --> 00:53:06,430
♫  As I let you go, hiding my beating heart  ♫

831
00:53:06,430 --> 00:53:09,380
♫  I confessed to myself  ♫

832
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:11,720
♫  Oh, baby  ♫

833
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:18,470
♫  I couldn't express or tell you  ♫

834
00:53:18,470 --> 00:53:20,690
♫  You and I back then  ♫

835
00:53:20,690 --> 00:53:22,700
Put your hands up!

836
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:29,990
♫  I miss you. I like you  ♫

837
00:53:29,990 --> 00:53:31,990
♫  I wanted to scream out loud  ♫

838
00:53:31,990 --> 00:53:36,810
♫  In that moment  ♫

839
00:53:36,810 --> 00:53:39,590
Me, me, me!

840
00:53:49,150 --> 00:53:53,070
Wow, you're all so energetic.

841
00:53:53,070 --> 00:53:55,860
You can't be a fan if you're weak.

842
00:53:55,860 --> 00:53:58,140
I still had fun today.

843
00:53:58,140 --> 00:53:59,840
I'm glad.

844
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:02,890
I've been thinking.

845
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:07,280
I don't think I need to find a specific hobby.

846
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:11,470
I'm enjoying this moment right now.

847
00:54:11,470 --> 00:54:14,880
I'm happy in every moment we share.

848
00:54:17,770 --> 00:54:21,450
I want to try something since we're matching.

849
00:54:21,450 --> 00:54:23,220
What is it?

850
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:39,820
♫  This time, I swear I'll get back to you  ♫

851
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:41,740
♫  I can't get over you  ♫

852
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:44,540
♫  So, here I am  ♫

853
00:54:44,540 --> 00:54:46,950
♫  I'm going out of control  ♫

854
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:50,340
♫  I won't lie, lie, lie, lie to you  ♫

855
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:52,400
♫  I can't get over you  ♫

856
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:55,450
♫  So, here I am  ♫

857
00:54:55,450 --> 00:55:00,080
♫  Not gonna lose you this time  ♫

858
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:12,690
♫  All I wanted is you  ♫

859
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:27,020
Team Leader.

860
00:55:27,650 --> 00:55:30,540
Yes? W-What's wrong?

861
00:55:46,090 --> 00:55:48,380
   

862
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:51,750
   

863
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:57,000
Congratulations, Team Leader!

864
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,930
I mean, Chief!

865
00:55:58,930 --> 00:56:01,160
Congrats!

866
00:56:06,810 --> 00:56:08,150
Did you see it?

867
00:56:08,150 --> 00:56:10,450
Baek Su Jeong got promoted.

868
00:56:11,450 --> 00:56:14,200
What's happening to this company?

869
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:15,690
It's easy being a woman.

870
00:56:15,690 --> 00:56:19,160
You just need to seduce a successful man.

871
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:20,940
I don't find it easy.

872
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:22,910
If it were easy for women to be successful,

873
00:56:22,910 --> 00:56:27,110
you wouldn't be talking trash about her right now.

874
00:56:27,110 --> 00:56:30,080
- What? 
 - She achieved so much.

875
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:32,470
She obviously got herself promoted.

876
00:56:32,470 --> 00:56:34,730
But you say she seduced a man.

877
00:56:34,730 --> 00:56:37,670
Team Leader Im, what's wrong with you?

878
00:56:37,670 --> 00:56:40,890
I think you're the one who's wrong.

879
00:56:40,890 --> 00:56:44,980
I think you insulted me just now.

880
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:57,350
I'll tell HR if he talks like that again.

881
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,560
I apologize.

882
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:06,840
I accused you of sleeping with Director Ban

883
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:09,690
and seducing him because he's a successor.

884
00:57:09,690 --> 00:57:10,910
As I said,

885
00:57:10,910 --> 00:57:14,350
I didn't like that you were different than me.

886
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:17,900
But I think you were right.

887
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:22,220
I should've fought instead of holding it in.

888
00:57:22,810 --> 00:57:25,580
Regardless of how I was treated,

889
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:29,780
I only cared about securing my spot and moving up.

890
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:32,390
We each did our best.

891
00:57:33,290 --> 00:57:37,510
I came this far thanks to people like you.

892
00:57:37,510 --> 00:57:41,110
I wanted to be on the same level as you

893
00:57:41,110 --> 00:57:45,420
and I decided not to play dirty like you.

894
00:57:46,370 --> 00:57:48,460
Are you praising me or insulting me?

895
00:57:48,460 --> 00:57:50,570
Just focus on one.

896
00:57:54,870 --> 00:57:56,450
I heard you got promoted.

897
00:57:56,450 --> 00:57:57,840
Congratulations.

898
00:57:57,840 --> 00:57:59,140
Thank you.

899
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:01,170
Are you going to the conference room?

900
00:58:01,170 --> 00:58:02,880
Get in.

901
00:58:05,290 --> 00:58:07,790
   

902
00:58:07,790 --> 00:58:10,410
Wow. Since Chief Kim is in charge,

903
00:58:10,410 --> 00:58:12,250
the photos look amazing.

904
00:58:12,250 --> 00:58:13,910
Right?

905
00:58:13,910 --> 00:58:16,800
Here's ramen to celebrate your promotion.

906
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:19,070
I made it extra spicy for that reason.

907
00:58:19,070 --> 00:58:21,140
Thank you.

908
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,850
Looks tasty.

909
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:29,770
Don't work too much because you got promoted.

910
00:58:29,770 --> 00:58:32,230
So, did you find a hobby?

911
00:58:32,230 --> 00:58:33,590
No.

912
00:58:33,590 --> 00:58:35,750
I might get one later,

913
00:58:35,750 --> 00:58:38,910
but I don't think I should force one.

914
00:58:38,910 --> 00:58:41,700
Eating your delicious ramen

915
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:43,870
and laughing with you is my joy in life.

916
00:58:43,870 --> 00:58:46,890
Yes, life doesn't have to be so grand.

917
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:50,070
You just need to enjoy every moment.

918
00:58:50,070 --> 00:58:54,320
I was so lucky to meet you on the video game.

919
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:56,220
I would've been lonely without you.

920
00:58:56,220 --> 00:58:57,520
You cutie.

921
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:59,540
I was lucky to meet you, too.

922
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:01,370
It's very touching,

923
00:59:01,370 --> 00:59:03,480
but don't you smell something burning?

924
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:05,940
Gosh, the jjambbong!

925
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:16,530
I'm home.

926
00:59:16,530 --> 00:59:18,700
Sis! Sis, Sis!

927
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:20,540
Gosh, stop being so gross.

928
00:59:20,540 --> 00:59:21,680
I got in.

929
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:24,310
I'm a firefighter who saves lives!

930
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:26,230
What? R-Really?

931
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:27,180
Yes.

932
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:30,610
Hey! Good job! Good job!

933
00:59:30,610 --> 00:59:32,530
You did an amazing job.

934
00:59:32,530 --> 00:59:33,440
Go easy. Easy.

935
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:35,660
I guess he's not a dummy, Dad.

936
00:59:35,660 --> 00:59:37,250
Go easy. Go easy.

937
00:59:37,250 --> 00:59:40,140
- Congrats! 
 - Spare me.

938
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:43,490
I should've celebrated with you yesterday.

939
00:59:43,490 --> 00:59:45,050
But the chairwoman wanted to see me.

940
00:59:45,050 --> 00:59:47,160
You can congratulate him today.

941
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:48,910
Buy us something tasty instead.

942
00:59:48,910 --> 00:59:51,700
Of course. I made a reservation, too.

943
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:54,540
 Say yes! Say yes! 

944
00:59:54,540 --> 00:59:57,280
 Say yes! Say yes! 

945
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:01,910
 Say yes! Say yes! Say yes! 

946
01:00:01,910 --> 01:00:04,700
Come on. Let's watch a little longer.

947
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:09,640
 Say yes! Say yes! Say yes! 

948
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:12,000
 Say yes! 

949
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,670
She accepted it.

950
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:30,710
Thinking now,

951
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:33,560
I freed the Black Dragon in the end. Right?

952
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:34,960
Yes.

953
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:38,060
Only you could've done it, Su Jeong.

954
01:00:38,060 --> 01:00:39,340
Because we're meant to be?

955
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:41,220
Because we're meant to be.

956
01:00:46,630 --> 01:00:48,240
Well...

957
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:54,080
I was going to give it to you later, but...

It's pretty.

969
01:03:10,780 --> 01:03:12,600
 Su Jeong! 

970
01:03:13,930 --> 01:03:15,950
♫  Stay  ♫

971
01:03:15,950 --> 01:03:18,060
 I once... 

972
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:20,000
 thought of you as a dark past that 

973
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,250
 I didn't want to face again. 

974
01:03:23,010 --> 01:03:25,190
 As much as I was comforted by you, 

975
01:03:25,190 --> 01:03:27,850
 I was disappointed as much. 

976
01:03:27,850 --> 01:03:31,900
♫  Wait just a moment  ♫

977
01:03:35,150 --> 01:03:37,220
♫  Stay  ♫

978
01:03:38,140 --> 01:03:40,290
 But fate... 

979
01:03:40,290 --> 01:03:43,340
 made it so we can't be without each other. 

980
01:03:43,340 --> 01:03:49,230
♫  Until I let you go, stay  ♫

981
01:03:49,230 --> 01:03:54,640
♫  Even in my memories  ♫

982
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:57,180
 I know now. 

983
01:03:57,180 --> 01:04:01,530
 That fate is all about how I think of it. 

984
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:08,530
♫  Let me (let me) cherish that, at least  ♫

985
01:04:08,530 --> 01:04:12,070
 Just like despair's other name is hope, 

986
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:16,370
 you, whom I thought of as a dark past, 

987
01:04:17,170 --> 01:04:21,010
 are now my love. 

988
