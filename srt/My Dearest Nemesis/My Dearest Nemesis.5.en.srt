00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,240
Let's play together.

188
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,030
What should we play? Kart?

189
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:27,050
League? Star?
[The Legend of Fever]

190
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:31,010
I want to play that.

191
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:36,650
[The Legend of Fever]

192
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:39,600
[Black Dragon]

193
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,900
Wow, you visited me.

194
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,350
You're the best, Bbanjju.

195
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:51,100
Do I have what I asked?

196
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,360
Fried chicken? Plain or spicy?

197
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,550
- Thank you. Have some.
- Wow!

198
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:58,280
Let's go. Let's go.

199
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,390
By the way, Hyung.

200
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:06,750
Yes?

201
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,150
I'll...

202
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:12,310
confess my love to Strawberry.

203
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,780
Daebak.

204
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:18,690
How will you tell her?

205
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:21,860
How did you do it yourself?

206
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:26,430
I've always received it. I've never done it.

207
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,930
Just do it casually.

208
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:30,250
The sincerity is more important than the method.

209
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:33,850
And you're the handsome successor of Yongsung.

210
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:35,420
Who would say no to you?

211
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,860
Geez.

212
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,760
Geez, you're so shallow.

213
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,000
Strawberry doesn't know who I am.

214
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,570
She likes me for who I am.

215
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,170
You need to tell me if you start going out.

216
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:52,500
I'll give you 200 won if you've dated for 22 days.

217
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,070
22 days?

218
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,630
<i>This is a collect call.</i>

219
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:13,060
<i>Please check the caller.</i>

220
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,570
<i>Bbanjju, it's Hyung. Don't hang up. Don't hang up.</i>

221
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:17,820
- What is it?
<i>- What do you think?</i>

222
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,920
You haven't called me in a while.

223
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,190
Did you...

224
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:22,930
<i>forget about me because you're busy</i>

225
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:24,680
dating Strawberry?

226
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,880
Don't ever...

227
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,270
<i>What?</i>

228
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:30,600
Don't ever say that name again.

229
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,740
What? Why?

230
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,180
Did you get dumped by chance?

231
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:37,630
<i>But why? You don't lack in any way.</i>

232
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:38,820
<i>What's the problem?</i>

233
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,180
My existence itself.

234
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,550
My existence itself disgusts her.

235
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:46,570
How could she be so cruel?

236
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:48,340
You shouldn't call me anymore, either.

237
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:50,610
I won't do anything silly anymore.

238
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:54,540
Hey, hey, Bbanjju. Don't hang up. Don't.

239
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:58,560
<i>That's probably when it started.</i>

240
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:02,090
He was acting his age briefly, but

241
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:03,760
he started only focusing on

242
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,220
becoming the perfect successor.

243
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:08,590
A chaebol successor?

244
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:11,220
[Sulo]
I'm glad he wasn't an alien or a thug.

245
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,710
Excuse me?

246
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:14,240
Anyway,

247
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,020
that's how hurt he was by his first love.

248
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,830
So, why did he lie about his age?

249
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:21,080
I was shocked to see him at the meeting.

250
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,400
I know he lied about his age,

251
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,150
but his existence itself is disgusting?

252
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:26,660
That's too harsh.

253
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,640
I would've gotten hurt, too.

254
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,090
That's how upset she was, okay?

255
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:33,990
What she did was still bad.

256
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:36,960
Gosh.

257
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:41,110
Who's the actual bad person?

258
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:42,450
Do you mean Ju Yeon is?

259
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:44,730
You think it's Su Jeong, then?

260
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,750
Whatever.

261
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,110
They won't see each other again, anyway.

262
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:52,480
Of course, if they do,

263
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,180
I'm sure he wouldn't forgive someone

264
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:57,440
who left a blemish on his life.

265
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,910
He'll try to ruin her future, no matter what.

266
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:04,060
For one, she won't be able to live in this country.

267
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,190
No.

268
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:09,380
Will he kick her out of the company first?

269
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:11,930
He's so cutthroat and scary.

270
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:14,040
She won't be able to handle it.

271
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:17,630
Why are you so shocked?

272
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:20,120
Was that too scary?

273
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,970
Su Jeong is the scary one.

274
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:23,900
As far as I understand, she'll try to

275
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:27,090
repay him for the shame and humiliation.

276
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:28,830
"Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth"

277
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,970
is her life's motto.

278
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:33,770
Will Su Jeong have to leave the country?

279
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:38,000
Ju Yeon might have to leave the planet.

280
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,620
If so,

281
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,510
are you saying...

282
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:46,400
Su Jeong is as intense as Ju Yeon?

283
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,060
As far as I understand her,

284
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,630
yes.

285
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:55,700
I'm so glad they'd never see each other.

286
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:58,010
What if they do?

287
00:16:58,010 --> 00:16:58,710
Pardon?

288
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:01,660
What if they already see each other every day?

289
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:44,530

The Director Killer?

292
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:08,350
Why are they so quiet, then?

293
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,930
- By chance-
- Yes.

294
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:14,330
They don't recognize each other.

295
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:16,940
Wow. That's a relief.

296
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:19,680
I suppose it did happen so long ago.

297
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,960
They only met briefly, too.

298
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,730
It's too soon to feel relieved.

299
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,000
They grew close, and something is up between them.

300
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:27,320
What if they grow closer and

301
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,400
develop feelings for each other?

302
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,290

They can never recognize each other. Never.

308
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,300
Yes.

309
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,880
What are you doing right now?

310
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,720
What? We need to go up fast.

You can't even waste a second.

312
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,370
By the way, you know Ms. Baek?

313
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:23,950
I looked into her a bit further.

314
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:25,940
Why do something so useless?

315
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:28,090
I said you can stop.

316
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:30,720
I thought I wasn't thorough enough then.

317
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,160
So, I looked into her further.

318
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,640
She seems more dogged and intense than I thought.

319
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,470
Wouldn't it be difficult to work with her?

320
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:40,650
That's why you said she'd be a good match for me.

321
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:43,000
There was another issue.

322
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,530
Looks like she's interested in someone at work.

00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,960
She's interested in someone?

324
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,560
Yes, she is, apparently.

I know you despise office romance.

326
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:57,190
You warned me not to date anyone at work.

327
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:59,990
I'm asking if that'd still be okay.

328
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,830
I'm not sure.

friendly, and polite.

370

How do you know so well? You never worked with him.

371
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:59,990
We had coffee together once.

372
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:02,290
He wanted to ask me something.

373
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:03,410
Just the two of you?

374
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:05,720
That's too obvious of a move.

375
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,720
He could've asked me instead.

376
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,370
He's crazy. You're way younger.

377
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:12,280
No, it was nothing like that.

378
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,290
What did he ask you about?

379
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:16,630
The thing is...

380
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:21,090

No way.

I can't let my employee be a victim of a rumor.

Are you interested in me?

424
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,850
I'd be lying...

if I said no.

426
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:57,280
But I'm not interested in you romantically.

427

What are you saying? Of course not.

- Pardon?
- If not,

432

why would you ask around about me?

Did the business team make the change?

551
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:40,170
Yes.

552
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:42,240
I thought it'd be impossible to work with Ganghan Farm.

553
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,750
So, I changed them out.

554
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:45,540
They can't be replaced.

555
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:47,510
They're very popular these days

556
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:50,640
and he doesn't work with any department stores.

557
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:53,380
We should have them to set our food section apart.

558
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:55,330
You think I don't know that?

559
00:34:55,330 --> 00:34:57,820
I tried convincing them.

560
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:58,970
Even if we offered 10 billion,

561
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:01,010
they won't join a department store.

562
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:03,550
That's their company policy or something.

563
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:04,670
But we should try to convince-

564
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:06,340
It's easier said than done.

565
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:08,560
You think the business team does nothing?

566
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,270
They won't even negotiate.

567
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:12,130
How will we convince them?

568
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,880
You should try it if you can.

569
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:24,790
Happy Milk is a competitive brand, too.

570
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,120
Got it.

571
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,450
It's important to be realistic, too.

572
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:32,880
I'll report to the Director with this list.

573
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,830
Let's move on, then.

574
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:46,040
[Ganghan Farm]

575
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,050
[5 hours 34 minutes]

576
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,130
Are you thinking of going there?

577
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:55,920
You never know. Tomorrow's the weekend, too.

578
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,370
All right. Good luck.

579
00:35:58,370 --> 00:35:59,860
Okay.

580
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,760
Bravo!

581
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:19,500
That was great.

582
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,010
Nice job.

583
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:36,590
Thank you.

584
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:38,280
Well done.

585
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:41,010
I don't know why they love golf.

586
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:43,250
I wouldn't have come if it wasn't for the Chairwoman.

587
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:45,360
But considering...

588
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,150
Congratulations on hitting a hole-in-one.

589
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:51,470
What can I say? I'm Ban Ju Yeon.

590
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:53,710
I'm good at everything.

591
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:58,560
Why was Ganghan Farm removed from the list?

592
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,550
The business team made the decision.

593
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:03,510
Ganghan Farm won't join a department store.

594
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:06,630
That's why it'd be impactful if they joined us.

595
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:08,540
Tell them to convince them somehow.

596
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:10,010
There's still time.

597
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:14,320
Team Leader Baek left to convince them today.

598
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,770
By herself?

599
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:18,430
Although the result isn't guaranteed.

600
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:21,760
I guess it'd get resolved soon.

601
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,320
I'll carry it to your destination.

602
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,460
No, no. It's heavy.

603
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:26,470
I'm going all the way to the farm.

604
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:29,500
I'll carry it for you because it's heavy.

605
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:33,040
What a nice young lady. Thank you.

606
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:36,480
By the way, why did you come this far alone?

607
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,600
Well, I'm visiting the farm. The Ganghan Farm.

608
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,320
I hear their ice cream is amazing.

609
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,920
But they only sell it here.

610
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,440
I wanted to try it and check out the farm, too.

611
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,860
Gosh. You must have a lot of free time.

612
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:52,930
Why come this far for just ice cream?

613
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:54,520
I know.

614
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,070
I wish they joined

615
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:59,250
a department store so people could try it easily.

616
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:02,890
Tasty food is tastier when you share, they say.

617
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,880
W-What's wrong?

618
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:13,690
Give me that.

619
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:15,960
G-Give me that.

620
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:19,220
You got me, CEO An.

621
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:21,430
[CEO An Jae Suk]

622
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,480
Which corporation are you from?

623
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,000
KEO or Yongsung?

624
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,680
I'm from Yongsung's strategy team.

625
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,080
My name is Baek Su Jeong. Nice to meet you.

626
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,830
No need to greet me.

627
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:41,040
You think I'd sell my product through Yongsung?

628
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:44,690
I hate nothing more than greedy chaebol.

629
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:46,220
Chaebol.

630
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:49,270
So, will you reject...

631
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,730
This way, CEO An.

632
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:17,650
What's this now?

633
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:19,970
Seeing how you present yourself,

634
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:22,790
you don't look like a regular employee.

635
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:24,490
Of course not. I'm Yongsung's successor-

636
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:27,110
He's my little brother who was...

637
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:32,150
sponsored by Yongsung.

638
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:34,960
This fancy young man is?

639
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:39,140
You're mistaken because of his car and outfit.

640
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:41,220
He's a driver.

641
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:44,540
He doesn't own the car or outfit.

642
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:46,210
You said you were nearby.

643
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:48,990
You came to see your sister here.

644
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:50,900
This is great, CEO An.

645
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:52,760
We'll drive you to the farm. Get in.

646
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,650
No. Give me that. Give me.

647
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:55,930
N-No...

648
00:40:55,930 --> 00:40:57,400
The bag is already in there.

649
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,090
Get in, CEO An.

650
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:01,470
Careful. Careful.

651
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,900
What are you doing? Drive us.

652
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:12,570
What the heck?

653
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:17,400
<i>Why did you come all the way here?</i>

654
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,690
Leave. I can manage it myself.

655
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:22,420
Are you that upset that I came?

656
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:26,510
Ms. Ah hates chaebols like you.

657
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:30,130
Let's see how good you are on your own.

658
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:32,840
I came to help you.

659
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:37,050
You came to help me?

660
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:40,250
No need to find it touching.

661
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:43,780
You came because you doubted my ability?

662
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:46,060
You didn't think I could do it on my own?

663
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:47,570
I think you can.

664
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:49,170
You'll do a good job.

665
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:51,370
But?

666
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:55,180
But it's hard to work alone.

667
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,910
It's lonely, too.

668
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:02,080
It's okay if you don't need me.

669
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:08,450
Okay. Let's convince her together.

670
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:10,100
But keep pretending to be my brother.

671
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,340
Don't let her know you're a chaebol.

672
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:13,470
Why a little brother?

673
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:14,850
What should I have said, then?

674
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:17,060
A friend sounds weird. A boyfriend is even worse.

675
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:18,190
Why is that weird?

676
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:19,290
It is.

677
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:21,550
I'm obviously much older.

678
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:23,190
A boyfriend could be younger.

679
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:24,370
If that's the case,

680
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,750
isn't it weirder that your boss is younger?

681
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:30,980
Stop talking nonsense and look for CEO An.

682
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:33,670
She... she just went that way earlier.

683
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:37,260
Why does he keep confusing me?

684
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:42,420

Let's give up.

704
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:45,750
We're only making us look foolish.

705
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:47,650
No.

00:43:47,650 --> 00:43:48,880
We're already foolish.

707
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,960
She's refusing because we're chaebols?

708
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,380
Her business mindset is poor.

709
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:55,840
Just once...

710
00:43:56,590 --> 00:43:59,720
Let's convince her just once more, please?

711
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:06,130
This is our last time.

712
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:09,740
Yes.

713
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:12,800
CEO An.

714
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,960
Gosh, you scared me.

715
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:18,500
Are you determined to give me a heart attack?

716
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:20,730
Get out of my face.

717
00:44:20,730 --> 00:44:23,340
I can't do that, CEO An.

718
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:25,910
I can't give up now that I've seen the farm, too.

719
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:28,980
I want many people to learn about your products.

720
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:30,330
I don't care.

721
00:44:30,330 --> 00:44:31,850
Leave, I said. Leave now.

722
00:44:31,850 --> 00:44:34,310
CEO An, I mean it. Let's talk for a moment-

723
00:44:34,310 --> 00:44:36,940
I have nothing to say. Get lost.

724
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:38,310
Get out of my face.

725
00:44:38,310 --> 00:44:39,810
- Get out.
- We should talk-

726
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:41,600
Oh, hey!

727
00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:47,470
Gosh, I can't believe this.

728
00:44:47,470 --> 00:44:50,810
They're putting on a show at my farm.

729
00:44:50,810 --> 00:44:53,090
What a show this is.

730
00:45:00,490 --> 00:45:03,230
We aren't open yet.

731
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:06,000
What brings you here at this hour?

732
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:07,730
I'm here to see you.

733
00:45:07,730 --> 00:45:10,780
- Me?
- The thing is...

734
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:12,770
I don't think I could tear them apart.

735
00:45:12,770 --> 00:45:15,860
I think we need a plan.

736
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:18,660
You should've called first.

737
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:21,260
I was just about to go to the market.

738
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:25,100
Really? Then, we can talk on the way, right?

739
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:26,700
Shall we?

740
00:45:33,770 --> 00:45:37,250
You're into internet novels.

741
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:38,810
I knew it.

742
00:45:38,810 --> 00:45:41,480
I love your writing on Instagram.

743
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:44,360
I used to read some in the army, too.

744
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:45,680
In the army?

745
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:49,340
Yes. Everything is fun there except the training.

746
00:45:50,110 --> 00:45:52,010
Do you still game these days?

747
00:45:52,010 --> 00:45:53,990
Sometimes.

748
00:45:53,990 --> 00:45:55,830
I played often before I opened the shop.

749
00:45:55,830 --> 00:45:58,170
But I'm too busy these days.

750
00:45:58,170 --> 00:46:01,220
I let someone else become the team leader, too.

751
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:02,960
Why do you keep asking about me?

752
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:05,710
You came to talk about Ju Yeon and Su Jeong.

753
00:46:05,710 --> 00:46:08,060
W-Well, yes. I did.

754
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:10,360
That's why I'm here.

755
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:13,990
What do we do with those two?

756
00:46:13,990 --> 00:46:17,120
They ended up in the same company.

757
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:18,960
But I'm relieved that

758
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,560
they don't see each other on weekends.

759
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:23,960
Don't you have weekend plans, by the way?

760
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:25,650
Is it okay to be here?

761
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:27,980
A lot of people must want to see you.

762
00:46:30,990 --> 00:46:31,890
[Gyu Myeong]

763
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,430
I'm not meeting anyone. No.

764
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:55,140
Do you always bring the same clothes?

765
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:56,430
Of course.

766
00:46:56,430 --> 00:46:58,810
I come prepared. Better than some people.

767
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:00,930
But this place is too-

768
00:47:00,930 --> 00:47:04,180
You're all changed. Why don't you sit?

769
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:07,940
CEO An, is this really your home?

770
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:10,340
I'm worried about Ganghan Farm's finances.

771
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:13,670
Why? What are you worried about?

772
00:47:13,670 --> 00:47:17,500
Hey, Ban Ju Yeon. Do you want to be spanked?

773
00:47:18,850 --> 00:47:21,380
- Spanked?
- She donated all of her assets

774
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:24,780
and she's been leading a frugal life. How rude.

775
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:26,560
Go ahead and apologize.

776
00:47:27,350 --> 00:47:29,110
Rude?

777
00:47:30,830 --> 00:47:34,500
But shouldn't you live somewhere nicer?

778
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:35,890
You've worked hard.

779
00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:38,340
Why? What's wrong with my house?

780
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:41,230
It's enough for just me.

781
00:47:41,230 --> 00:47:42,980
Stop being silly.

782
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:45,650
Let's sit and eat.

783
00:47:47,310 --> 00:47:49,630
You'd spank me?

784
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:52,070
It's my butt...

785
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:55,900
It's so much rice.

786
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:57,480
It's not that much.

787
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:59,510
That's why you're so skinny.

788
00:47:59,510 --> 00:48:02,000
Have some more afterward.

789
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,010
- Okay.
- Try this, too. It's godeulbbaegi.

790
00:48:05,010 --> 00:48:07,370
It's a little bitter but tasty.

791
00:48:07,370 --> 00:48:10,470
I harvested it from the garden.

792
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:14,040
Okay.

793
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,970
What? You don't want it?

794
00:48:21,770 --> 00:48:23,540
Noona.

795
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:27,170
Huh? D-Did you call me?

796
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:29,810
CEO An harvested this godeulbbaegi.

797
00:48:29,810 --> 00:48:31,560
You aren't refusing to eat it, right?

798
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:33,360
That'd be rude.

799
00:48:36,030 --> 00:48:38,150
Of course not.

800
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:39,880
That's good, then.

801
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:44,140
Enjoy, Noona.

802
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:48,570
You should enjoy it, too, little brother.

803
00:48:48,570 --> 00:48:51,620
You love bitter food.

804
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:54,620
Thank you, Noona.

805
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:57,150
You're so caring toward each other.

806
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:10,650
Yes, yes. Aigoo, my baby.

807
00:49:10,650 --> 00:49:14,760
Yes. Of course, I'm okay. I'm fine.

808
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:17,130
Have you eaten?

809
00:49:18,010 --> 00:49:20,350
Okay, okay. Bye.

810
00:49:20,350 --> 00:49:23,350
Okay. Talk to you later.

811
00:49:29,350 --> 00:49:31,400
That must've been your grandson.

812
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:32,720
Yes.

813
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:37,420
He really loves me.

814
00:49:37,420 --> 00:49:40,950
He just passed the bar exam, and he's working.

815
00:49:40,950 --> 00:49:43,880
He called on his way home.

816
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:46,760
I don't know who he resembles, but he's smart.

817
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:49,190
He must resemble you.

818
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:53,480
Does he?

819
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:55,850
You must be so proud of him.

820
00:49:55,850 --> 00:49:58,210
Of course I am.

821
00:49:59,210 --> 00:50:03,190
He was born prematurely. He used to be sick.

822
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:06,030
Growing up healthy was enough for me,

823
00:50:06,030 --> 00:50:09,030
but he's all grown up already.

824
00:50:09,030 --> 00:50:14,100
People call me pathetic living like this.

825
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:16,470
They think I work just to give money away,

826
00:50:16,470 --> 00:50:18,550
but I don't do that for no reason.

827
00:50:18,550 --> 00:50:22,310
A good world for the children to live in.

828
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:24,980
I wanted to create a society like that.

829
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:28,020
I don't want to be a rich grandma.

830
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:31,640
I want to be a grandma they're proud of.

831
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:37,580
Your grandson must be happy.

832
00:50:39,070 --> 00:50:41,920
He's so loved by his grandmother.

833
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:49,480
That's why you should work with Yongsung.

834
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:52,620
Geez, you won't give up.

835
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:55,220
I thought you were just an employee.

836
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:58,510
How much do they pay you, anyway?

837
00:50:58,510 --> 00:51:00,620
It's not that.

838
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:03,330
Another business will take your spot, anyway.

839
00:51:03,330 --> 00:51:08,530
I want you to make a lot of money, not anyone else.

840
00:51:08,530 --> 00:51:11,470
It'd be nice if you became more influential.

841
00:51:11,470 --> 00:51:13,740
I want to help you, too.

842
00:51:15,570 --> 00:51:17,890
How tenacious. Seriously.

843
00:51:17,890 --> 00:51:20,570
Just eat first. Let's talk later.

844
00:51:20,570 --> 00:51:22,830
You'll hear me out if I finish this, okay?

845
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:23,900
Okay.

846
00:51:38,430 --> 00:51:40,740
Mix it in, little brother.

847
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:57,960
This is...

848
00:52:00,970 --> 00:52:03,300
Is this a new product you're working on?

849
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:04,390
Can I try it?

850
00:52:04,390 --> 00:52:07,060
Yes, go ahead.

851
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:20,000
What's this?

852
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,240
Is this yogurt?

853
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:23,680
This would be a huge hit.

854
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:25,610
Do you want to try some?

855
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,860
Here.

856
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:30,920
Drink it up. Drink it up.

857
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:32,980
You're trying Ganghan Farm's new product.

858
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:35,760
You should be honored.

859
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:41,700
- This is alcohol.
- Yeah.

860
00:52:41,730 --> 00:52:44,220
That's the makgeolli I made.

861
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:48,030
I used the water from the spring up there.

862
00:52:48,030 --> 00:52:49,860
It must taste good.

863
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:54,380
How foolish.

864
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:57,750
Foolish? How rude to talk to me that way.

865
00:52:57,750 --> 00:52:59,090
Don't yell at me.

866
00:52:59,090 --> 00:53:02,200
How will you go home, Noona?

867
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:07,210
Well, I can take the bus back.

868
00:53:07,210 --> 00:53:09,290
You should've left already.

869
00:53:09,290 --> 00:53:11,400
The buses had stopped running already.

870
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:14,530
We'll have to call a driver.

871
00:53:15,290 --> 00:53:19,170
Driver? I thought you were a driver.

872
00:53:19,170 --> 00:53:21,620
Oh, I mean, a driving service.

873
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:25,150
You'll pay for a ride from here to Seoul?

874
00:53:25,910 --> 00:53:27,700
Couldn't I?

875
00:53:29,990 --> 00:53:33,440
Aigoo, your dad runs a hardware store

876
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:37,150
and paying off debt from your mom's illness.

877
00:53:37,150 --> 00:53:40,970
You said you're trying to pay off the mortgage now.

878
00:53:40,970 --> 00:53:45,360
But I guess your brother hasn't suffered enough.

879
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:49,580
I thought you weren't listening.

880
00:53:51,470 --> 00:53:54,270
It's because he's still immature. He is.

881
00:53:54,270 --> 00:53:56,090
He's five years younger than me.

882
00:53:56,090 --> 00:53:59,200
He's a kid compared to me.

883
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:01,080
A kid?

884
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:03,060
How much will it cost to drive to Seoul?

885
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:05,020
Why don't you just throw money away?

886
00:54:05,020 --> 00:54:06,930
What will you do, then?

887
00:54:06,930 --> 00:54:08,510
Noona.

888
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:11,560
What do we do?

889
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:13,820
What do you mean what will you do?

890
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:15,930
You're sleeping over.

891
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:31,120
The potato cooked nicely, Director.

892
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:34,180
Am I no longer the little brother?

893
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:37,270
Why? Do you want to call me Noona again?

894
00:54:37,270 --> 00:54:40,390
You sounded so convincing that I almost believed you.

895
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:45,720
I'm sorry this happened.

896
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:48,060
You should've just left.

897
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:51,500
You call that an apology?

898
00:54:52,810 --> 00:54:56,330
It's sweet. You must love this.

899
00:54:58,540 --> 00:55:02,240
Just think of it as a vacation.

900
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:05,560
The air is nice, and the stars are pretty.

901
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:14,890
I was just saying that.

902
00:55:14,890 --> 00:55:18,270
But this really feels like a vacation.

903
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:22,590
I haven't been on one this year because of work.

904
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:26,410
Why do you work so hard

905
00:55:26,410 --> 00:55:28,120
on everything?

906
00:55:31,250 --> 00:55:33,960
When I was a kid,

907
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:36,690
I used to dangle upside down on pull-up bars.

908
00:55:36,690 --> 00:55:41,000
But a passerby said girls shouldn't play so roughly.

909
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,000
I was so annoyed by it, even as a child.

910
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,710
So, I played even harder.

911
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:49,770
One day, I went to school and

912
00:55:49,770 --> 00:55:51,150
the teacher said to give up on becoming

913
00:55:51,150 --> 00:55:52,340
the class president.

914
00:55:52,340 --> 00:55:54,860
He said I can't because my mom can't care for me.

915
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:56,670
That's nonsense.

916
00:55:56,670 --> 00:55:58,360
You'd be the president, not her.

917
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:00,210
I know.

918
00:56:00,210 --> 00:56:02,820
People set limits for me on their own

919
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:06,300
and judged me. I hated it.

920
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:10,610
So, I worked even harder when I was told no.

921
00:56:10,610 --> 00:56:12,610
I was so determined.

922
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:17,440
I wanted to prove that I could do things.

923
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,390
Do you know how that feels?

924
00:56:22,070 --> 00:56:23,950
Of course.

925
00:56:23,950 --> 00:56:27,310
You don't need others' approval,

926
00:56:28,630 --> 00:56:31,370
but I guess that's my personality.

927
00:56:31,370 --> 00:56:33,700
I want to do everything well

928
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:36,560
and I can't stand being looked down on.

929
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:38,500
I'm like that.

930
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:51,360
I am, too.

931
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:55,030
I want to be acknowledged

932
00:56:55,030 --> 00:56:57,620
and do well.

933
00:56:57,620 --> 00:57:01,040
I can't stand being looked down on.

934
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:07,540
Why are you smiling?

935
00:57:10,330 --> 00:57:15,610
I was thinking you and I are similar.

936
00:57:15,610 --> 00:57:18,290
It's funny. It makes no sense.

937
00:57:21,650 --> 00:57:24,050
Why should it not make sense?

938
00:57:24,050 --> 00:57:26,490
We have another thing in common.

939
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:29,370
Our first loves.

940
00:57:33,910 --> 00:57:38,830
I don't ever want to run into mine, either.

941
00:57:39,850 --> 00:57:41,790
I thought...

942
00:57:42,830 --> 00:57:46,140
she'd accept me as I was.

943
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:49,450
But it was the worst.

944
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:56,140
We both have the worst first loves.

945
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:58,050
Should we say cheers?

946
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:02,080
Cheers.

947
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:08,480
[Jin unni]

948
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:11,600
Excuse me.

949
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:17,540
Yes, Unni.

950
00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:20,550
I'm on a business trip in Gangwon with the director.

951
00:59:21,250 --> 00:59:23,940
He's not a man. He's the same age as Su Bin.

952
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:26,480
How could I think of him as a man?

953
00:59:35,310 --> 00:59:36,500
<i>But still.</i>

954
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:39,070
Aren't you too close with the director?

955
00:59:39,070 --> 00:59:40,460
Should I not be?

956
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:42,130
It's better than being the Director Killer.

957
00:59:42,130 --> 00:59:46,930
<i>I don't want you to learn the uncomfortable truth.</i>

958
00:59:46,930 --> 00:59:48,870
Uncomfortable truth?

959
00:59:48,870 --> 00:59:52,480
Well, you said he's a chaebol.

960
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:54,070
<i>What if he's corrupt?</i>

961
00:59:54,070 --> 00:59:55,440
<i>I know you can't tolerate that.</i>

962
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:58,430
It'd become a serious problem, then.

963
00:59:58,430 --> 00:59:59,900
Unni, are you bored?

964
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:02,640
Why are you suddenly so worried?

965
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:03,860
Whatever.

966
01:00:03,860 --> 01:00:05,180
You definitely said

967
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:07,180
you don't think of the director as a man.

968
01:00:07,180 --> 01:00:08,560
What?

969
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:11,620
Yes.

970
01:00:11,620 --> 01:00:14,390
Okay. Carry on.

971
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:19,130
What's her problem?

972
01:00:20,180 --> 01:00:21,880
How strange.

973
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:44,160
Are you sleeping?

974
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:48,860
He falls asleep whenever he drinks.

975
01:00:48,860 --> 01:00:51,670
Director, sleep inside.

976
01:00:51,670 --> 01:00:52,990
Okay?

977
01:00:53,790 --> 01:00:55,590
Director.

978
01:01:05,590 --> 01:01:07,640
How annoying.

979
01:01:08,710 --> 01:01:12,250
Well, I wanted to wake you up.

980
01:01:14,150 --> 01:01:16,800
Why do you keep looking down on me?

981
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:19,570
When did I do that?

982
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:56,920
Do you still...

983
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:06,600
not see me as a man?

984
01:03:07,060 --> 01:03:10,550
