1
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:14,500


2
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:17,690
   

3
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:20,420
   

4
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:23,120
   

5
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,970
   

6
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:27,810
   

7
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:31,940
   

8
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,780
   

9
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,970
   

10
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,370
I haven't seen you before.

11
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:03,080
You know me, right?

12
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,910
What? Are you a chaebol, too?

13
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:07,270
Yes, I am a chaebol.

14
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:09,560
Want to hang out with me if you're alone?

15
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:13,020
I must be a customer of your company, then.

16
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,860
Why do you talk to me casually?

17
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:17,130
Shouldn't you be polite to your customer

18
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:18,840
if you're a chaebol?

19
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:22,350
This bitch is funny.

20
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:23,710
When I first saw you,

21
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:27,840
I knew you weren't one of us.

22
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,710
You were a customer, huh?

23
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:32,110
Okay.

24
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:34,730
I'll treat you like a queen.

25
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:36,920
In bed.

26
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,700
Let go. Let go, I said!

27
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,420
I liked your feisty mode.

28
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:41,950
I know your kind well.

29
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:44,410
Stop playing hard to get. Come.

30
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:47,740
 What's going on? 

31
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,530
 Did she really kick him? 

32
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,380
 How embarrassing. 

33
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:54,530
Are you out of your mind?

34
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,660
 What's wrong with them? 

35
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,550
 Whatever. 

36
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,830
Babe, let's go.

37
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,420
 What's going on? 

38
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,080
 What? 

39
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:47,360
Pardon?

40
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:49,900
What did you say?

41
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,040
Am I a baby?

42
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,350
I didn't say that to you.

43
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:58,460
It was like, "Let's go, baby.

44
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:01,030
Let's go in the water, baby." Something like that.

45
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:04,840
He's always been known for being sensitive to the heat.

46
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,290
How do you feel? Did you cool down?

47
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:09,290
Are you crazy?

48
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:10,570
Who's that bitch?

49
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:13,450
Who's she that you'd do this to me?

50
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:15,170
My employee.

51
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:19,990
She's actually a crucial employee in the company.

52
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:20,990
Let's go, Team Leader Baek.

53
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:23,020
It'll start raining soon.

54
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,940
It's a heavy shower. 
    

55
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,660
How did you know it'd rain?

56
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,700
I was told.

57
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,270
By whom?

58
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,730
It tells me the weather every morning.

59
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,210
It's a handy little thing.

60
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:55,850
Sometimes, it's better than humans.

61
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:00,610
Did you meet the important client?

62
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,440
I don't think they were here.

63
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:07,060
Though, had I known it would be a party, I wouldn't have come, either.

64
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,910
Well, I'm free to go home now. Right?

65
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,320
Not yet.

66
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,240
Geez, are you kidding me?

67
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,150
So what if you gave me job security?

68
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:18,750
You aren't respecting my basic rights.

69
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,530
If you won't let me go, feed me, at least.

70
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:24,130
I didn't even have lunch.

71
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,290
I'm hungry!

72
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:28,750
I have no energy.

73
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:32,580
You seem full of energy.

74
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,610
See? I told you.

75
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:43,800
Why do you speak to me so casually...

76
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,450
What?

77
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:48,970
 ­  

78
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:51,290
Does this count as a meal?

79
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:53,950
Why not? It has all the main food groups.

80
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,220
You don't like what I ordered?

81
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:57,270
You're asking me now, after you ordered what you wanted?

82
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,840
You're the one who followed me.

83
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,060
Don't eat if you don't want to.

84
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,530
I should since you ordered it.

85
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:05,280
Since we're in public, I guess no chocolate drinks for you.

86
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,010
You only drink espresso.

87
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:12,360
I'm so thirsty.

88
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,650
What will you do after this?

89
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:17,870
It's late now. How will you watch me?

90
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:19,060
Will you stay up?

91
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,850
Or will you sleep with me?

92
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:22,660
I signed the contract.

93
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,190
I can't reveal your personal life

94
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,290
even if I wanted to.

95
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:27,440
I can't pay you if you sue me.

96
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,460
I have nothing but debt.

97
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,010
Why would I try to

98
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:34,350
get fired from the highest-paying company?

99
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:36,650
 Yay! 

100
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:40,350
 So cute. Do you like it? 

101
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,600
What a shame.

102
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,950
They're giving out stuffed animals.

103
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:45,430
 Your favorite? 
   

104
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,430
Why would you want a stuffed animal?

105
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:53,360
It's cute and free.

106
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,990
Cute? That stuff?

107
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:58,570
Yes. Isn't it?

108
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:00,620
Go home.

109
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,790
- Pardon? 
 - Finish this

110
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,670
and go home, I said.

111
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:06,430
You can't take it back.

112
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:08,590
I'll get this to go.

113
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:12,350
Baek Su Jeong's danger level went down.

114
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:16,050
She has better taste than I thought.

115
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:30,750
How much is this, anyway?

116
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:34,540
I could sell it for at least three million.

117
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:38,410
I should still return it.

118
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,960
Why won't this work? Geez.

119
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,150
So what if it's expensive?

120
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:51,490
It's not mine and it won't come off.

121
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,920
It worked!

122
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,160
Geez, seriously.

123
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,810
I'm tired enough already.

124
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:06,310
What? Did the light go off?

125
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,780
Yes.

126
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,440
You should've waited for me.

127
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,850
I could've done it.

128
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:13,760
I can do this alone easily.

129
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:16,110
Here.

130
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:18,420
Wow, you can take over the business now.

131
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:20,450
That's why I learned all this.

132
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:22,250
I got an electrician's license, too.

133
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,460
You know I studied

134
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,340
after work every day for it, right?

135
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,890
I know you're my daughter, but—

136
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:29,200
You're proud of me, right?

137
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,370
Easy peasy.

138
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:39,140
It's too empty for a bar, isn't it?

139
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:41,680
It should be crowded and noisy.

140
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,610
I like how quiet it is.

141
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:46,570
I promoted it on Instagram, but it didn't work.

142
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:49,340
But it did.

143
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,660
I'm here now.

144
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,260
I even liked the post.

145
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,970
You came after you saw my posts?

146
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:58,110
They're fun and you have a clear concept.

147
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,740
By chance,

148
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,800
did you write the captions yourself?

149
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,470
I can't imagine you writing them.

150
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:06,110
I did write them myself.

151
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,540
I used to be into internet novels.

152
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:10,600
I see.

153
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:13,180
If I may,

154
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:15,540
the photos could've been better.

155
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:18,580
The food needs to look tasty.

156
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,360
Doesn't this look more impressive?

157
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,340
Whoa...

158
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,090
Compositions are important in photos.

159
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:34,150
You either highlight the whole spread

160
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:36,400
or take a close-up.

161
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,880
Like this?

162
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,700
You can't show other stuff next to it.

163
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,700
Like this.

164
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,530
- Like this? 
 - Do something like this.

165
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,200
I'm sorry.

166
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,930
Do you want to sleep with me?

167
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,540
Shall we?

168
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:51,300
   

169
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:55,450
   

170
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:58,900
   

171
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,020
   

172
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:15,860
I feel alive now.

173
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:36,350
What time is it now?

174
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:40,090
It's only 5:00. Go back to sleep.

175
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,370
Where are you going at 5:00 in the morning?

176
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:45,610
Fishing.

177
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:50,460
Thank you.

178
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,370
You didn't have to bring me here.

179
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:54,910
I have time before work. Can't I watch you?

180
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:56,170
I've never been here before.

181
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:59,000
I'll go to my parents' shop. Can you handle it?

182
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,450
Why couldn't I? Older folks love me.

183
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:02,920
That's worse.

184
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:06,800
They want me to remarry any man.

185
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,920
- Are you divorced? 
 - Why?

186
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,990
Does that excite you more?

187
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:15,390
I think I'd better stop.

188
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:17,890
I have to go to work.

189
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:19,180
Get going.

190
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:22,020
I had fun last night, thanks to you.

191
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,810
See you.

192
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:31,510
Mom!

193
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:32,880
What took you so long?

194
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,600
Huh? I'm not late. I came just in time.

195
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,050
That's late.

196
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:39,000
If you want the stuff at the original prices,

197
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,200
you'd better come early and help us.

198
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,430
Have you seen a conscientious thief?

199
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:45,010
Seriously. Don't be so proud.

200
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:47,170
Right, how about your shop?

201
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:49,700
Ha Jeong says you have no customers.

202
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,150
I can't help it if it fails.

203
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,540
Seriously.

204
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:55,350
I told you to save the alimony and get a job.

205
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:58,070
Why did you start a business?

206
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:01,310
You quit your job to get married,

207
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:03,100
but you got divorced within a year.

208
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:07,460
You're about to close the shop within a year.

209
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:10,570
Why can't you stick with anything?

210
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:12,630
Why are you such a troublemaker?

211
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:15,010
I dated one man for 10 years

212
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:17,590
and married him. Did you forget?

213
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,710
Dad, what's the good stuff today?

214
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:22,810
Snapper.

215
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:25,750
Snapper. Okay.

216
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:28,500
Director.

217
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:31,660
Here's the dress from last night.

218
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,340
Did you dry-clean it?

219
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,190
I don't think you had time.

220
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:39,160
Well, I only wore it for a moment last night.

221
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,600
Clothes you've worn should be cleaned.

222
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,100
Isn't that a given?

223
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,900
It rained last night, too.

224
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,590
I didn't even want to wear it.

225
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:47,130
I thought this was just common sense,

226
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:49,480
but I suppose my expectations were too high.

227
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,220
I think the staff could use an etiquette training.

228
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,870
Someone talked loudly in the elevator, too.

229
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:58,250
Are you saying I have such poor manners?

230
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:01,090
It might've been your voice.

231
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,470
Fine, I'll do it.

232
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:05,850
You'd better reimburse me.

233
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:14,460
What was that little nod?

234
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:35,570
 I told you. It's not my style. 

235
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,310
 It doesn't suit me, right? 

236
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,720
Didn't it suit her?

237
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,790
Etiquette training?

238
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:49,830
He needs to learn manners himself first.

239
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:53,090
He always acts as he pleases—

240
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:57,100
You weren't talking about me, were you?

241
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,600
You're too self-conscious.

242
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,970
Me. I meant me.

243
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:03,970
I do as I please too much.

244
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:05,740
Objectifying oneself.

245
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:07,900
You're good at that, at least.

246
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,620
Let's start the meeting.

247
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,080
You must understand

248
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,950
the importance of the renewal project.

249
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:22,960
It will start in Seoul and spread nationwide.

250
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,030
The beginning will be most important.

251
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:28,610
That's why we chose the Gangnam store.

252
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:30,240
   

253
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,840
The Gangnam store, not the flagship store?

254
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,160
Gangnam is the center of commerce.

255
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,760
But our store had lower sales than others.

256
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,820
We're currently in need of refreshing.

257
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,550
It'd be highly risky if we fail.

258
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:44,320
The reward will be big if we succeed, too.

259
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,310
Sales are guaranteed once we pave the path.

260
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:50,670
The next candidate is a safer option.

261
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:54,330
That's okay. I had the Gangnam store in mind, too.

262
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:56,840
We all agree. Why waste time?

263
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,910
Let's go with the Gangnam store. Let's go.

264
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:00,230
Okay.

265
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:05,140
Where are you going?

266
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:07,530
To the Gangnam store. It's the chosen store.

267
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:10,300
I should assess the site accurately.

268
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,460
- Well... 
 - What?

269
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:18,560
They didn't plan this together ahead of time, did they?

270
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,690
I know. They're totally on the same page.

271
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:31,680
 ­  

272
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,900
 Do you want to sleep with me? 

273
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,780
 Shall we? 

274
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,310
Shit.

275
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,500
I'm okay.

276
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,880
You must've heard about the renewal project.

277
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,790
Yes, I heard our store could be the first one.

278
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,730
It will be starting today.

279
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:04,120
Oh, I see.

280
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,450
Let's work well together, Branch Manager.

281
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:07,520
Yes, of course.

282
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,310
We'll survey the customers and gauge the demand.

283
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:12,420
Will that be enough?

284
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:14,550
Pardon?

285
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:16,460
The main goal of the renewal

286
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:18,220
is to get new customers.

287
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:20,410
Conduct a survey beyond

288
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:21,940
the current customers.

289
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,890
The brands, products, services,

290
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:26,120
and facilities they want.

291
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,880
How can we ask the non-customers?

292
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,470
Make them desperate to participate.

293
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:33,700
Spend money or anything excessively.

294
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,680
There's no need to be conservative.

295
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,960
Got it. We'll proceed immediately.

296
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,650
Okay. You can leave.

297
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:41,090
Pardon? Already?

298
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:42,510
They'll know

299
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:45,080
a higher-up is here if I were with you.

300
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:48,050
I want to assess the store as it is.

301
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:50,410
Okay, then. Feel free to look around.

302
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,720
We'll be in touch.

303
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,160
This is...

304
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,700
You recognize it. It's the brand I use.

305
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:06,760
I only use their products.

306
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:12,710
So does my favorite band's vocalist.

307
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:14,950
Oh, I see.

308
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:19,720
I was noticing the crooked letter on the sign.

309
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:21,980
You're observant.

310
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:24,030
But you didn't notice my sunglasses brand.

311
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:25,960
I'll let the worker know.

312
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,190
It's a million won sunglasses.

313
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:30,100
But how is the repair 800,000?

314
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,610
The legs and screws...

315
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:35,410
were designed by an artisan.

316
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:38,850
Repairs need to be done at the HQ in Italy

317
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:40,300
and be shipped back to you.

318
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:43,750
But still. You aren't remaking it.

319
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,340
800,000 won is no joke.

320
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:49,030
They basically need to be remade.

321
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,520
Who are you?

322
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,910
If you don't understand their value,

323
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:58,690
you don't have the right to wear them.

324
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:01,850
Who are you? Why do you decide

325
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:04,000
I have the right or not?

326
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,400
Me?

327
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,390
Someone who understands the product's value.

328
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:36,120
Whatever. Whatever. I don't care.

329
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,240
If you're here to shop,

330
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,980
just buy yourself a pair and leave.

331
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,660
You're pissing me off.

332
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:44,080
Piss you off? Are you serious—

333
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,540
Excuse me.

334
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,100
How about these?

335
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:51,550
They'd look better on you than the old ones.

336
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:54,990
You're telling me to get a new pair now?

337
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:58,190
Are you trying to piss me off more?

338
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:01,160
He doesn't deserve any of these—

339
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,880
You have to wait a long time

340
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,760
for the repair.

341
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,190
If it'd cost the same,

342
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:10,310
shouldn't you get a pair that suits you better?

343
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:11,790
I'm a Yongseong employee.

344
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:13,070
I can get you a discount.

345
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:16,320
They'd be 650,000 won, then.

346
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,320
What do you think?

347
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,160
Why don't you try them on briefly?

348
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,120
Just hover them over your face.

349
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,180
Let me show you the mirror.

350
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,690
Let me see.

351
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:39,620
♫  Don't be alone, this night  ♫

352
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:43,350
♫  Stay in my world, down  ♫

353
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:47,040
♫  Welcome, welcome this fire  ♫

354
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,110
Amazing.

355
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:10,260
I suppose I'll buy a new pair.

356
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,090
- Would you like to? 
 - Sure.

357
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:14,820
Get him a new pair.

358
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:17,550
Gosh, amazing.

359
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,860
It's not that he doesn't understand the value.

360
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:25,200
He couldn't afford the fee.

361
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,740
You still shouldn't have dealt with him like that.

362
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:29,590
It was too much even for you.

363
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:30,870
I know.

364
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:33,790
I almost made an unforgivable mistake.

365
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:38,010
It could've been one of the few errors in my life.

366
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:40,750
But you prevented it.

367
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:44,780
Thank you, but that's a bit...

368
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,940
I've never seen his bare face.

369
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,950
I didn't recognize him.

370
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:51,830
Pardon?

371
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:53,560
Who?

372
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:59,090
The singer from the concert? Right?

373
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:01,180
Amazing. You should've said something.

374
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:03,270
You're a fan.

375
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:05,280
Right, it was a secret.

376
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,730
Will you just let him leave?

377
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:13,350
Should I get an autograph for you?

378
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,050
It's okay.

379
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:20,610
Just wait.

380
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:21,980
I'll...

381
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,440
A pen. I don't have a pen.

382
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,130
Here.

383
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,420
Excuse me!

384
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:38,490
Excuse me.

385
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,640
Just one moment.

386
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:43,190
I saw your show once.

387
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:44,970
I'm a huge fan.

388
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,590
Could I have an autograph?

389
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:47,630
Of course.

390
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:49,520
I didn't recognize you.

391
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,800
You're so cool.

392
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,590
Thank you.

393
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:57,520
A photo?

394
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,520
Just one moment.

395
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:02,320
Director,

396
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,430
I told him I was a fan and he offered a photo.

397
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:06,420
A photo?

398
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:08,470
It'd be nice if you were in it,

399
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:09,830
but you can't let anyone know.

400
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:13,200
I'll take one for you. Live vicarious through me.

401
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,590
I'll take it now.

402
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:38,880
One, two, three.

403
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,440
What's this?

404
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,880
You can only see my hair.

405
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,280
It's because I'm not your fan.

406
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,950
Message me the photo.

407
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:06,170
Maybe I won't.

408
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,910
I got you an autograph and a photo.

409
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:11,840
But you treated me like this.

410
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,010
I know.

411
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:15,880
I got an autograph and a photo.

412
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,770
I don't need a thank you.

413
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:20,660
I'm a fan for a reason.

414
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:22,490
I thought he was just a good singer,

415
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:25,290
but he's a great person, too.

416
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,030
Do you like him that much?

417
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:31,220
Are you mocking me?

418
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,450
I'm jealous.

419
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:37,160
Having a passion for something.

420
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,570
I think it's a valuable thing.

421
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:42,390
It's hard to find what you like.

422
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:45,740
It's hard to like something for a long time, too.

423
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:50,420
So...

424
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:53,350
enjoy it all you want.

425
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,270
No matter what others think,

426
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:59,700
I don't think you enjoying your hobby

427
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,800
makes you a bad successor.

428
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:09,500
The chairman chooses the successor, not you.

429
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,070
You think I don't know that?

430
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:16,040
Is that how you respond to...

431
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:18,350
Whatever.

432
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:21,410
Be careful. You'll get wet.

433
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:16,370
Wow!

434
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:18,220
It's a rainbow.

435
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:23,740
I haven't seen one in a while.

436
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,150
It's pretty.

437
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:52,790
I'm enjoying it...

438
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:56,550
plenty already.

439
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:59,360
But...

440
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:02,100
I'll try to enjoy it more freely...

441
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,030
in front of you, at least.

442
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,850
She's not bad at her job.

443
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:41,910
I mean, Ms. Baek Su Jeong.

444
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:43,770
You said that doesn't matter...

445
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:46,070
and she needs to be eliminated.

446
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:49,830
Not anymore. She doesn't seem bad anymore.

447
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:52,360
You said she's a talent I'd appreciate, too.

448
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,290
Right?

449
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:58,120
I knew I understood your type.

450
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:11,450
He's not bad at his job.

451
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:14,830
- Who? 
 - Director Ban Ju Yeon.

452
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:16,890
He makes decisions quickly, motivated,

453
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:18,460
and he has a good sense, too.

454
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:23,040
I think you called him unruly this morning.

455
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:26,240
I guess we have two directors now.

456
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:30,520
I thought you disliked him, Team Leader.

457
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,830
I did, too.

458
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:33,370
There's nothing to like or dislike.

459
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:35,560
He just needs to be good at his job.

460
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:56,300
 ­  

461
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,720
It wakes you right up.

462
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,800
This is the best thing when you're working late.

463
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:13,710
Are you working late?

464
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:15,310
Well, yes.

465
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:17,500
I had work to do after working offsite.

466
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,280
I wanted to finish it before I left.

467
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,940
If you work late due to a sudden schedule change,

468
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,920
how would that make me look?

469
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:27,150
Don't work late for no reason and leave.

470
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,910
I mean...

471
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:34,550
who says to get off work so rudely like that?

472
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,830
Also,

473
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:39,320
it's too late to get the dress dry-cleaned.

474
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,460
You should just keep it.

475
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,740
Pardon? Why?

476
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:46,080
I don't need it...

477
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:49,300
and it was pretty.

478
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:54,800
The dress. I mean, the dress.

479
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,930
I mean, the dress.

480
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:59,950
Peace.

481
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,240
Hilarious.

482
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:28,510
You're coming to my hideout.

483
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,720
- Who's this? 
  - Bbanjju! Honey! 

484
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,570
 My face turns red when I see you. 

485
00:29:56,570 --> 00:30:00,000
It really doesn't sound like her.

486
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:08,220
Please thank your mother for me.

487
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:22,890
What are you smiling at? How annoying.

488
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,330
Me?

489
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:26,410
I smiled?

490
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:29,820
How dumb do you have to be to not realize it?

491
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:35,930
I've never experienced this before.

492
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:39,090
Hey,

493
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:43,470
do you think destiny is a real thing?

494
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,660
 We were meant to be. 

495
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:49,940
 My destiny. 

496
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:51,110
 Your existence. 

497
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:53,270
 Your existence itself disgusts me. 

498
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:57,470
 Stay sealed forever, you little nerd! 

499
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,370
You're in a dangerous state. Be careful.

500
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:03,100
Falling for someone precariously

501
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:06,350
will put you in excruciating pain.

502
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:11,340
You just...

503
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:14,640
thought about your first love, right?

504
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,620
I'll put you out of your misery now.

505
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:20,500
Hey, stop!

506
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,640
Is it pretty?

507
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:51,800
I'd never wear it and it doesn't even suit me.

508
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:29,930
 I'm busy because I just opened a shop. 

509
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:31,890
 What kind of shop is it? 

510
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:33,770
   

511
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:36,840
   

512
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,730
   

513
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:42,600
   

514
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:46,040
Finally.

515
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:03,700
I cleaned everywhere except the study per your orders.

516
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:07,200
Okay, thank you. You can leave.

517
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,520
That spot should be good.

518
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:57,940
Okay. Should we prepare to welcome...

519
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:59,950
a new friend?

520
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:14,780
♫  Yeah, you never spoke about it  ♫

521
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:17,360
♫  Still I always think about it  ♫

522
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:22,490
♫  Everything is flooding back to me  ♫

523
00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:25,140
♫  Things will never be like before  ♫

524
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:27,700
♫  Since you told me game is over  ♫

525
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:33,440
♫  Why you are so far away from me?  ♫

526
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,660
♫  Hey!  ♫

527
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:38,630
♫  So I wanna ask if you've been thinking about me  ♫

528
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:39,830
♫  Hey!  ♫

529
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:42,270
♫  Just want to know  ♫

530
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:46,120
♫  This time, I swear I'll get back to you  ♫

531
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:48,240
♫  I can't get over you  ♫

532
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:50,790
♫  So, here I am  ♫

533
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:53,280
♫  I'm going out of control  ♫

534
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,510
♫  I won't lie, lie, lie, lie to you  ♫

535
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:58,560
♫  I can't get over you  ♫

536
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,400
♫  So, here I am  ♫

537
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:07,080
♫  Not gonna lose you this time  ♫

538
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:12,150
 I'm jealous. 

539
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:15,360
 Having a passion for something. 

540
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,960
 I think it's a valuable thing. 

541
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:20,990
 It's hard to find what you like. 

542
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:24,490
 It's hard to like something for a long time, too. 

543
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:27,790
 So, 

544
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:29,970
 enjoy it all you want. 

545
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:34,190
♫  I'm going to say what's in my heart  ♫

546
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:39,420
♫  If I could go back in your time to see you  ♫

547
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:42,750
♫  I promise I'm going to say this  ♫

548
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:49,340
♫  All I wanted, I wanted is you  ♫

549
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,920
   

550
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,070
   

551
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:11,780
To confirm the delivery,

552
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:14,110
please sign here.

553
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:16,520
Who sent all this?

554
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:19,260
Black... Dragon?

555
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,040
Oh, I see.

556
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,660
Okay.

557
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:24,250
- Here. 
 - Okay.

558
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:26,320
Thank you.

559
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:28,730
Have a good day.

560
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:31,060
- Thank you. 
 - Sure.

561
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:42,290
Unni.

562
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:43,830
What were those flowers in the front?

563
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:45,670
Gosh, what's this?

564
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:47,650
Why is it so cold in here?

565
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:49,070
What's this now?

566
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:51,110
What brings you here without notice?

567
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:53,470
I never give you notice.

568
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:55,060
I asked you what that was.

569
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:57,080
I got it as a gift for opening.

570
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,730
Who sends you a gift like this?

571
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:01,990
It's as if it's from a chaebol.

572
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:03,480
I know.

573
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,690
Have a seat for now.

574
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:07,940
Let's turn off the AC, Unni.

575
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:10,810
AC won't prevent that from melting.

576
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:12,550
Should I?

577
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:15,090
So, who is it?

578
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:17,670
- A friend of mine. 
 - Which friend?

579
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:20,450
Do you have a friend I don't know?

580
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:22,970
It scared me!

581
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:26,360
Who sent you a serving robot

582
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,840
when you have no customers?

583
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,080
   

584
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:32,260
"Noonim"?

585
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:34,890
Is it from a man?

586
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:37,240
   

587
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:42,680
"Black Dragon"?

588
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:49,040
I'll go take out the trash and not come back.

589
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,050
Black Dragon?

590
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:55,270
Unni, have you been in touch with him?

591
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:59,070
Why?

592
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:01,900
You were angry that he deceived us, too.

593
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,350
I was, but...

594
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:07,260
You know. H-He's a good gamer.

595
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,710
I swear we...

596
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:12,810
We only talked briefly during team battles.

597
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:15,120
I see.

598
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,700
I see now.

599
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:19,140
I'll go now. We need some time away.

600
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:21,070
Strawberry. Su Jeong.

601
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:22,460
Should I throw it all out?

602
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:24,700
I'll throw it all out.

603
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,530
   

604
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,340
Forget it.

605
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:33,220
Right?

606
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:35,660
They're gifts. I shouldn't throw them out, right?

607
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:36,940
Sell on Altari Market.

608
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:39,690
I can't stand them, but it's a waste.

609
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:41,490
Okay.

610
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,370
   

611
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,560
You came in early.

612
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,320
You're here early, too, Director.

613
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,630
I'm just diligent.

614
00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:04,300
Did you check today's weather, too?

615
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,840
Yes.

616
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:08,540
Today will be clear. Fine dust level, low.

617
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:11,210
UV level, moderate. The humidity level is 46%.

618
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:14,240
The wind speed is 2 meters per sec.

619
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,810
I see. It does look really handy.

620
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:21,120
Yes, it is.

621
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:25,090
But the letters are so small. Can you read them?

622
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:30,120
I-I can.

623
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,950
You can?

624
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:39,790
By the way,

625
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:42,750
how long will you do that for?

626
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:44,530
Pardon?

627
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,900
Director, are you okay?

628
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,120
Well, sorry...

629
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,140
I didn't mean to do that.

630
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:06,870
A-Are you okay?

631
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:09,580
He has a strange watch.

632
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:13,530
My stress level is high.

633
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:16,500
So is mine.

634
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,720
Should I report what you requested

635
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,090
last week?

636
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:24,090
Let's hear about it right away.

637
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:26,920
What's this?

638
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,930
Huh? That...

639
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:32,440
looks like a capsule toy.

640
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:42,070
It's my son's favorite character.

641
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:45,530
Does anyone have a kid in the office?

642
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:48,570
No. Whose is it?

643
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:01,120
I left something in the car.

644
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:03,630
Okay.

645
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:32,910
It can't be mine.

646
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:45,210
No way.

647
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,950
 You're late. 

648
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:53,650
 Where have you been looking like that? 

649
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,920
 G-Grandmother. 

650
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:02,450
 Who's your grandmother? 

651
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:06,280
 I don't have a grandson like you. 

652
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:11,200
 You want to replace my son? 

653
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,150
 You aren't just an embarrassment. 

654
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:15,490
 You got lost, too, now? 

655
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:22,020
 It's not that. 

656
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:31,530
   

657
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,230
 My son... 

658
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:41,320
 was killed by you. 

659
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:44,620
 My only son... 

660
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:50,580
 died because of this stupid stuff that day. 

661
00:43:55,110 --> 00:43:57,140
 I'm sorry. 

662
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:01,930
 It's all my fault, Grandmother. 

663
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:04,990
 Forgive me. Forgive me. 

664
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,300
 I said... 

665
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:12,440
 I don't have a grandson like you. 

666
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:15,680
 I knew you've been unreliable lately. 

667
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,470
 But it's this stuff again... 

668
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:22,870
 All this trash. 

669
00:44:22,870 --> 00:44:26,060
 Remove it from my sight immediately! 

670
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:28,910
 I'm sorry, Grandmother. 

671
00:44:28,910 --> 00:44:32,300
 Please don't. N-No... 

672
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:35,780
 I'm sorry. 

673
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:49,290
 Grandmother. 

674
00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:51,800
 It's my fault. 

675
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:54,990
 I'll never do it again, Grandmother. 

676
00:44:54,990 --> 00:44:56,770
 Grandmother! 

677
00:44:56,770 --> 00:44:58,400
 I'll never do it again, Grandmother. 

678
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,070
 Forgive me just once. 

679
00:45:00,070 --> 00:45:02,080
 Grandmother. 

680
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:10,190
 G-Grandmother! Not that one, Grandmother. 

681
00:45:10,190 --> 00:45:11,790
 Grandmother, please. Grandmother. 

682
00:45:11,790 --> 00:45:13,910
 Forgive me just once, Grandmother. 

683
00:45:13,910 --> 00:45:15,410
 Don't do that, Grandmother. 

684
00:45:15,410 --> 00:45:18,620
 Grandmother! Grandmother! 

685
00:45:20,970 --> 00:45:25,410
 Don't throw it away, Grandmother. 

686
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:36,580
 Grandmother... 

687
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:38,560
 I'm sorry. 

688
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:41,760
 I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 

689
00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:12,130
According to Chief Kwon, this is really expensive.

690
00:46:12,130 --> 00:46:14,010
It's rare or something.

691
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:16,680
Who brought this kid stuff to work?

692
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:19,670
Be honest. It's yours, isn't it, Na Na?

693
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:20,610
Me?

694
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:22,730
You're the youngest among us.

695
00:46:22,730 --> 00:46:24,210
It's not mine.

696
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:25,940
It's yours, right, Deputy?

697
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:27,300
Are you crazy?

698
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:31,730
It's an eyesore for a man to like this stuff.

699
00:46:31,730 --> 00:46:34,050
- Really? 
 - Of course.

700
00:46:34,050 --> 00:46:37,280
A classmate of mine collects this stuff.

701
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:40,580
He's a grown man. Seriously...

702
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:42,550
I really don't get it.

703
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:44,740
Do you, Na Na?

704
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:47,340
Well, I don't, but—

705
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:51,230
I know. It's definitely not me.

706
00:46:51,230 --> 00:46:52,570
Okay, then.

707
00:46:52,570 --> 00:46:54,930
We should still return it to the owner.

708
00:46:54,930 --> 00:46:57,490
How ignorant and close-minded.

709
00:46:59,370 --> 00:47:01,240
What if we post it on the company bulletin board?

710
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:03,110
Yes, that should work.

711
00:47:03,110 --> 00:47:04,600
This was taken care of, then.

712
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:06,750
How far are you along with the report?

713
00:47:06,750 --> 00:47:09,970
Oh, let me get mine.

714
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:16,590
Oh, right.

715
00:47:16,590 --> 00:47:19,140
The file you mentioned last time...

716
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:21,210
Just one moment.

717
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:25,190
What's that?

718
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:27,120
I found it just now.

719
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:30,020
I've asked around, but no one claimed it.

720
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:32,910
I'll carry it until I find the owner.

721
00:47:32,910 --> 00:47:34,970
Why don't you ask me?

722
00:47:34,970 --> 00:47:37,110
It could be mine.

723
00:47:37,710 --> 00:47:40,060
Are you into stuff like this?

724
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:44,970
I'm not into stuff like that.

725
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:54,910
Ms. Baek Su Jeong,

726
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:59,140
that dress. Return it to me.

727
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:00,580
You told me to keep it.

728
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:02,530
Are you changing your mind now?

729
00:48:02,530 --> 00:48:03,860
Why can't I?

730
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:06,140
You do that, too.

731
00:48:07,270 --> 00:48:09,330
Come to think of it, I'm not a philanthropist.

732
00:48:09,330 --> 00:48:11,680
There's no need to be spreading charity.

733
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:15,000
I never wanted it. What do you mean, donate?

734
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,780
Did I beg you for it or something?

735
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:18,020
What gives you the right?

736
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:21,320
Just give it back since you never wanted it.

737
00:48:25,350 --> 00:48:26,600
You said you had a lot of debt.

738
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:29,850
Did you sell it because it's worth something?

739
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:33,660
I actually helped you, then.

740
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:36,780
I'm the one who's helping you.

741
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:39,280
Your personal life you want to hide.

742
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:41,490
I'm pretending not to know about it.

743
00:48:41,490 --> 00:48:44,950
Everyone needs to learn your secret, right?

744
00:48:44,950 --> 00:48:45,960
Are you crazy?

745
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:47,120
Not yet.

746
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:49,900
I'll bring you the dress on Monday.

747
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:02,690
 ­  

748
00:49:11,950 --> 00:49:13,570
 Okay. See you tomorrow. 

749
00:49:13,570 --> 00:49:15,900
   

750
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:18,530
 Hello. I'm sorry, 

751
00:49:18,530 --> 00:49:20,360
 but there's a bit of a situation. 

752
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:22,790
 Could I have the dress back? 

753
00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:24,540
 I'll pay you back in full. 

754
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:27,370
 It's okay if you wore it once. 

755
00:49:27,370 --> 00:49:28,980
 The deal is done. 

756
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:31,200
 I don't like being contacted like this. 

757
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:35,240
   

758
00:49:36,950 --> 00:49:41,110
I have to spend millions on his tantrum?

759
00:49:42,530 --> 00:49:45,390
Should I expose him and go down with him?

760
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:49,620
No, calm down.

761
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:52,420
People finding out won't change anything.

762
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:55,790
I'll get sued for breaking the contract.

763
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:06,300
 ­  

764
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:12,070
 So, 

765
00:50:12,070 --> 00:50:15,200
 enjoy it all you want. 

766
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:18,480
What did I expect?

767
00:50:24,790 --> 00:50:29,090
   

768
00:50:29,090 --> 00:50:30,550
Yes.

769
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:33,380
All humans are the same.

770
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:35,670
Let's not worry.

771
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:42,420
    
 ♫  I've been watching you for a long time  ♫

772
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:46,080
♫  I've been watching you for a long time  ♫

773
00:50:47,090 --> 00:50:49,260
♫  It's okay to be awkward  ♫

774
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:51,550
It crossed the ocean safely and quickly.

775
00:50:51,550 --> 00:50:54,780
I knew they'd trusted me, Ban Ju Yeon.

776
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:58,980
♫  Everything cools down when the morning comes  ♫

777
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:03,040
♫  The Green Light that illuminates us  ♫

778
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:06,220
♫  Let everything be in my hands, in the rhythm  ♫

779
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:09,980
♫  Like this, it's so hot tonight  ♫

780
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:12,380
Yes. This is it.

781
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:15,600
This is plenty.

782
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:18,800
♫  Follow, follow me  ♫

783
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,790
♫  Follow, follow  ♫

784
00:51:20,790 --> 00:51:22,740
♫  Follow, follow me  ♫

785
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:25,710
♫  Follow, follow  ♫

786
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:37,240
 In subdivision, one... 

787
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:38,860
 out of one. 

788
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:41,940
 That's the key to this question. 

789
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:44,310
 So, for example... 

790
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:46,490
I have no clue.

791
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:50,630
Was I this useless of a person?

792
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:54,090
This is no good.

793
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:03,410
 Experience and skills. 

794
00:52:03,410 --> 00:52:05,330
 I'll call a trustworthy expert. 

795
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:09,500
 Someone who doesn't know it's my place. 

796
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:11,310
 Somewhere further, 
   

797
00:52:11,310 --> 00:52:13,210
 but within the service area. 

798
00:52:13,210 --> 00:52:15,080
 Too many reviews are bad, too. 

799
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:18,310
 Because they're likely fake. 

800
00:52:18,310 --> 00:52:20,770
   

801
00:52:23,170 --> 00:52:24,530
Dad.

802
00:52:24,530 --> 00:52:26,050
Hey.

803
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:32,410
Hello?

804
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:35,990
 Is this No. 1 Hardware? 

805
00:52:35,990 --> 00:52:37,530
Yes, this is.

806
00:52:37,530 --> 00:52:40,850
I'm calling about a faulty power plug.

807
00:52:40,850 --> 00:52:44,450
I'm in Yeonghae-dong. Can you come right now?

808
00:52:44,450 --> 00:52:46,150
Yeonghae-dong?

809
00:52:46,150 --> 00:52:48,720
It's a bit far from here.

810
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:51,650
Gosh, can you not come?

811
00:52:51,650 --> 00:52:53,680
N-Never mind. I can.

812
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:56,040
It's too far.

813
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:59,890
I'll be there. It's a short bike ride distance.

814
00:52:59,890 --> 00:53:04,030
Instead, I'll pay you five times...

815
00:53:04,030 --> 00:53:06,150
 your usual price. 

816
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:09,980
 Can you come right now? 

817
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:11,310
Right now?

818
00:53:11,310 --> 00:53:13,790
I have neighborhood appointments—

819
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:15,340
We can.

820
00:53:15,340 --> 00:53:17,360
I'll go.

821
00:53:18,810 --> 00:53:22,460
W-Who was that just now?

822
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:24,440
Well, it's my daughter.

823
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:27,510
Should we leave right now, then?

824
00:53:27,510 --> 00:53:29,280
I'll give you the address.

825
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,750
No, I'll give you our phone number.

826
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:33,610
Text the address instead.

827
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:35,670
Okay.

828
00:53:38,230 --> 00:53:40,090
That was perfect.

829
00:53:41,090 --> 00:53:43,040
You're busy already. Get some rest.

830
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:44,180
Why would you do this?

831
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:45,910
He said he'd pay five times the rate.

832
00:53:45,910 --> 00:53:47,400
I'll drive there real quick.

833
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:48,760
Seriously.

834
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:50,400
You should've rested at home.

835
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:51,790
Why did you come here?

836
00:53:51,790 --> 00:53:54,750
I wanted to eat out with you like we used to.

837
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:56,090
I'm sorry.

838
00:53:56,090 --> 00:53:58,950
Let's get something very tasty for dinner, then.

839
00:53:58,950 --> 00:54:01,860
And be careful even in small jobs. Careful.

840
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:04,480
You'd better not help people with random stuff.

841
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:06,410
Only focus on the job, okay?

842
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:08,050
Okay.

843
00:54:14,290 --> 00:54:16,460
Is this Yongsung Palace?

844
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:20,530
Wow, the chaebols sure live differently.

845
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:35,650
 Just letting you know that you'd be 

846
00:54:35,650 --> 00:54:37,020
 filmed on CCTV. 

847
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:39,110
 Activities unrelated to the repair, 

848
00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:42,530
 especially photographing or filming is banned. 

849
00:54:42,530 --> 00:54:46,230
 See the picture to find where the broken plug is. 

850
00:54:46,230 --> 00:54:48,900
Why so strict?

851
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:11,530
Wow, this is amazing.

852
00:55:31,270 --> 00:55:32,960
Here it is.

853
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:42,690
 I'm here now. I'll go inside. 

854
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,690
A woman?

855
00:56:02,490 --> 00:56:05,190
- Hello? 
 - What's the deal—

856
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:08,330
What's the deal?

857
00:56:08,330 --> 00:56:10,180
The owner on the phone was a man.

858
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:12,560
I'm the owner's daughter.

859
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:15,620
 Don't worry. I'm as good as the owner. 

860
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:19,130
 So, pressing the button next to the painting 

861
00:56:19,130 --> 00:56:21,220
 will reveal the room, right? 

862
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:24,120
By the way, your voice sounds familiar.

863
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:35,610
 Should I get an autograph for you? 

864
00:56:39,130 --> 00:56:43,030
Director Ban Ju Yeon?

865
00:57:38,550 --> 00:57:46,860


866
00:57:51,190 --> 00:57:54,650
   

867
00:57:55,340 --> 00:57:57,050
   

868
00:57:57,050 --> 00:57:58,460
   

869
00:58:01,810 --> 00:58:07,160
♫  Keep falling to love, oh, tonight  ♫

870
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:09,710
♫  Shine a light on my heart  ♫

871
00:58:09,710 --> 00:58:13,520
♫  Shine me, shine a light  ♫

872
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:18,830
♫  Keep falling to love, oh, tonight  ♫

873
00:58:18,830 --> 00:58:22,270
♫  Forever be all right  ♫

874
00:58:22,270 --> 00:58:25,170
 You decorated the room so well. 

875
00:58:25,170 --> 00:58:27,690
 Leave. I only deal with a top expert. 

876
00:58:27,690 --> 00:58:30,550
 It doesn't go with the image you go for. 

877
00:58:30,550 --> 00:58:31,820
 Hospital? 

878
00:58:31,820 --> 00:58:34,010
 I would've been flustered if I were alone. 

879
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:36,430
 How do you lift your mood? 

880
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:38,390
 Director? Are you flirting? 

881
00:58:38,390 --> 00:58:40,380
 He didn't seem that way. 

882
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:42,230
 How unexpected. 

883
00:58:43,350 --> 00:58:45,130
 Black Dragon. 

884
00:58:45,130 --> 00:58:50,060
 Our relationship might be irreversible now. 

885
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:53,620
♫  Destiny is playing tricks  ♫

886
00:58:53,620 --> 00:58:56,640
♫  It's like magic  ♫
