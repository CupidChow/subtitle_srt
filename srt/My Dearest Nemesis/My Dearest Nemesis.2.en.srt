Right, I saw it in a webtoon recently, too.

63
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:14,320

You must be happy to receive the gift.

187
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:23,090
But this man-

188
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:24,190
Go on your way now.

189
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:27,510
I don't want any unwanted interest.

190
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,620
Okay.

191
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,000
Goodbye.

192
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:06,030
No way.

193
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:09,000
I've been hiding my true self perfectly,

194
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,120
but someone almost caught me three times?

195
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,610
She's dangerous.

196
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:16,970
This might damage my public persona.

197
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:24,860
Baek Su Jeong's danger level went up by two.

198
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,720
Very dangerous.

199
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,590
She must be...

200
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:30,310
eliminated.

201
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,760
Eliminate?

202
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,700
Team Leader Baek Su Jeong?

203
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:37,580
Yes.

204
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,900
You mentioned her nickname

205
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,620
just to keep her on alert.

206
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:45,640
She caused trouble by getting the directors fired,

207
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,180
but it wasn't her fault.

208
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,390
- Right.
- But why-

209
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:49,640
Based on my observation.

210
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:53,910
Team Leader Baek is too dangerous.

211
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:55,200
How strange.

212
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,770
She seemed like a talent you'd appreciate.

213
00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:00,530
Not at all.

214
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:06,080
Are you questioning my judgment?

215
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,870
Do you think I want to fire her because

216
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:10,610
of my personal reasons or feelings?

217
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:11,850
That can't be.

218
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:13,200
You have no personal life because

219
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,640
you always prioritize the company and results.

220
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,520
I know that better than anyone.

221
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,370
Yes, it seems that way.

222
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:22,150
Of course. If so,

223
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:24,500
how will you eliminate her?

224
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,240
If you just fired her, it'd be an unjust dismissal.

225
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,100
She won't just let it happen, either.

226
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:32,160
That never happens at Yongsung.

227
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,770
I'll make her leave on her own.

228
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:37,430
[Hehehe]

229
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:39,400
[Foreign Market Advancement Progress]

230
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,490
[The purpose of the advancement]

231
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:43,710
How's the South American market advancement going?

232
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:44,850
The on-site survey was finished.

233
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:47,270
We're choosing the right brands for the market.

234
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:50,930
Did you carry out the field research correctly?

235
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:56,680
Didn't you say one cannot carry it out
without perfectly knowing the language?

236
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:59,350
Because language is culture.

237
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,120
There's a saying that goes like...

238
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,610
Anyone who doesn't dare jump into the sea wouldn't be able to cross it.

239
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:17,470
I'm certain we're ready to jump in.

240
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:22,100
What will the market share be in South America?

241
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,950
It's 8.74573%.

242
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:25,180
Our goal is 14%.

243
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,590
Is it a plausible goal?

244
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:30,030
It will be in three years if we work aggressively.

245
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,210
That's easy to say.

246
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,410
It's not hard at all.

247
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:33,630
You're too confident.

248
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:35,660
Are you an arrogant type?

249
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:39,470
Anyone can talk.

250
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:42,200
I'll prove it with the results.

251
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,520
Team Leader Baek is very good.

252
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,380
She was well prepared, too.

253
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,650
Does that matter now?

254
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,930
She's nothing but my target.

255
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,550
You know how to give answers, Su Jeong.

256
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,800
That's a compliment, right?

257
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,800
Thank you.

258
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,500
He obviously wanted to defeat you.

259
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,050
But you had to one-up him.

260
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:20,930
Meetings aren't kids' fights.

261
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:23,430
I was just answering his questions.

262
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:25,380
But I'm happy you think I won.

263
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,260
I hate losing.

264
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,690
Right.

265
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:31,640
You fight like a dog, no matter who it is.

266
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,490
I acknowledge that, at least.

267
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:35,920
Like a what?

268
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:36,950
Can you call yourself

269
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:39,590
a person when you're so relentless?

270
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:41,550
Stop staring so intensely.

271
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:42,980
Don't your eyes hurt?

272
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:45,740
Why is she so tough and aggressive?

273
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:48,840
Women get criticized because of ones like you.

274
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,470
Sunbaenim,

275
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:52,630
don't dump shit because we're in the bathroom.

276
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:55,010
Please watch what you say.

277
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:56,580
- What?
- You're my senior at work,

278
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:59,370
but you're nothing outside.

279
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:04,220
I said something so you don't get fired. What the-

280
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,110
We worked hard to come this far.

281
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:07,460
You gave up on getting married

282
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:10,420
and I acted like a dog to come this far.

283
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:14,340
So, can't we all just get along?

284
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:17,000
We can fight the ones who are after us.

285
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:22,670
I'm grateful if you were genuinely concerned,

286
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:24,700
but I'd rather walk out on my own.

287
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,640
I won't get fired or anything like that.

288
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,140
Because my pride won't allow that.

289
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:30,890
Okay.

290
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:34,650
Invite me to your send-off party regardless.

291
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:44,230
Why is all this happening today?

292
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:49,610
Hello.

293
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,910
Excuse me, Na Na,

294
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:55,530
we haven't met since the welcome party.

295
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:58,350
Are you finding things okay here?

296
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:00,060
W-Well, yes.

297
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,830
That's good to hear.

298
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:05,680
By the way, how did you know my name?

299
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,140
Because it's pretty.

300
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,760
- Pardon?
- Your name is pretty.

301
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,710
How could I have forgotten it?

302
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:19,290
Are you free now, by chance?

303
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:21,190
I'd like to grab coffee with you if it's okay.

304
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,950
I have some questions, too.

305
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,270
F-For me?

306
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,690
Yes.

307
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,220
Okay, sounds good.

308
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,020
I have plenty of time.

309
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:36,190
How's the research I requested going?

310
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:39,240
I've been asking people, but

311
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,650
there isn't much.

312
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:42,630
Do I have to keep doing this?

313
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:45,340
It just feels wrong. I don't feel good.

314
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:48,290
It's still work. Keep at it.

315
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:50,550
Why do you ask me this instead of Chief Kwon?

316
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:52,800
Do you need my help, too?

317
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,410
Right now,

318
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:57,330
I have no time to be so careful.

319
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:09,500
I'm sorry. A-Are you okay? I'm sorry.

320
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,190
What? Did something happen?

321
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:13,030
Why are you sorry?

322
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:16,070
Thank you.

323
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:21,640
Well, by chance,

324
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,540
do you have a girlfriend?

325
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,570
Yes.

326
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:32,650
She'll be here soon.

327
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:34,890
I'm sorry.

328
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:37,400
- Enjoy, then.
- Okay.

329
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:50,780
What? What did you talk about with her?

330
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:53,370
You came. You must be hungry. What should we eat?

331
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:55,530
I asked what you talked about.

332
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:01,150
- Well-
- She asked your number, huh?

333
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:02,980
Of course, I said no.

334
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,100
I said I was waiting for my girlfriend.

335
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,220
Did you smile again?

336
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:08,210
Were you friendly?

337
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:10,130
I was just being polite.

338
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:12,690
You're way too polite.

339
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,420
This is annoying. I won't come back here.

340
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:18,980
Okay, we won't.

341
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:23,420
I'll take you somewhere better next time, miss.

342
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,050
So, what would you like?

343
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:29,830
We have a new director.

344
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:31,260
Let's have a fresh start.

345
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,960
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

346
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,990
This isn't a send-off party, right?

347
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:41,250
What are you talking about?

348
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,510
I heard the director...

349
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:44,740
openly attacked you during the meeting today.

350
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:47,440
But you fired back every chance you got.

351
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,010
Everyone already says he hates you.

352
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:52,190
I know.

353
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:55,400
I knew he'd hold grudges.

354
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,490
It's okay. I've been hated before.

355
00:18:57,490 --> 00:18:58,590
Don't worry so much.

356
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:00,550
But things are different this time.

357
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:02,190
How are they different?

358
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:03,650
Don't you know?

359
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:05,900
Well, haven't you heard the rumor?

360
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:08,290
What? W-What rumor?

361
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:38,880
You don't have to welcome me like this.

362
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,590
How did you find us here-

363
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,760
I heard you were having a team dinner.

364
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,390
Wasn't it to welcome me?

365
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:46,170
You said it won't be necessary-

366
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:48,550
Yes, this is your welcome dinner.

367
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:50,860
This was that dinner.

368
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,400

Because humans spare them.

Earthworms die when you step on them

559

560
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:31,810

735
00:45:46,170 --> 00:45:48,320
Do you know what's the

736
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:50,350
most important to office workers?

737
00:45:50,350 --> 00:45:52,430
Vacation. Salary.

738
00:45:52,430 --> 00:45:53,810
They're correct answers,

739
00:45:53,810 --> 00:45:57,100
but job security is crucial.

740
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:03,440
Good morning, Director.

741
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:09,710
Yes, good morning.

742
00:46:15,870 --> 00:46:18,710
He greeted back to you.

743
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:25,710
- Enjoy your meal.
- Enjoy your meal.

744
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,200
[Director Baek / Respond to Ban immediately]

745
00:46:32,170 --> 00:46:34,910
Put this away for me. Sorry.

746
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:39,690
[Respond to Ban immediately]

747
00:46:41,850 --> 00:46:43,200
[Director Baek]

748
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,080
Shit.

749
00:46:49,610 --> 00:46:50,530
[Yongsung]

750
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:53,250
Come to the director's office.

751
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:55,310
Geez.

752
00:46:57,450 --> 00:46:59,620
You want me to read all this-

753
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:01,200
Don't read it. Destroy it.

754
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,680
Right there.

755
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:03,630
Why?

756
00:47:03,630 --> 00:47:06,230
Don't you want to work after securing your job?

757
00:47:06,230 --> 00:47:09,210
You said you'd work hard, no matter what.

758
00:47:20,030 --> 00:47:22,000
Isn't this too noisy?

759
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,770
Why does it have to be here...

760
00:47:23,770 --> 00:47:26,240
There are paper shredders outside, too.

761
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:28,930
Can I do this outside?

762
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:30,470
Please?

763
00:47:34,850 --> 00:47:37,010
Did you say something?

764
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:41,010
I suppose it wasn't noisy.

765
00:47:41,830 --> 00:47:46,540
Are you taking revenge on me by chance?

766
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:47,880
I'm watching you.

767
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:50,130
You discovered the top secret and threatened me.

768
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:52,290
You should've expected this much.

769
00:47:52,290 --> 00:47:57,270
But why are the photos a top secret?

770
00:47:57,270 --> 00:47:59,690
I sent them to you because you wanted to hide it.

771
00:47:59,690 --> 00:48:02,370
I didn't think it'd work.

772
00:48:02,370 --> 00:48:04,980
Did you forget who I am?

773
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:07,500
Because he's Yongsung's successor?

774
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:09,770
Is a successor not a human?

775
00:48:09,770 --> 00:48:12,440
Your fashion sense is a bit lame

776
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:14,960
and they way you enjoy concerts

777
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:17,080
is a little too intense, but-

778
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:19,440
Are you insulting me or defending me?

779
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:20,960
Anyway,

780
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:23,590
it's not so bad that you'd see it on the news.

781
00:48:23,590 --> 00:48:24,730
Why are you hiding it so much?

782
00:48:24,730 --> 00:48:26,660
It's unnecessary for the

783
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:28,940
successor who needs to be perfect.

784
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:36,660
People often ask you why you try so hard, right?

785
00:48:38,130 --> 00:48:40,490
Why do you try so hard?

786
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:46,350
Because that's how I've lived.

787
00:48:46,350 --> 00:48:48,620
This is the way I've lived.

788
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:50,290
My answer is the same.

789
00:48:50,290 --> 00:48:52,970
This is my way. So,

790
00:48:52,970 --> 00:48:55,520
let's stop wasting time and finish work.

791
00:49:05,870 --> 00:49:08,210
I'm finally going home.

792
00:49:15,810 --> 00:49:18,070
[Could you send me the photo you mentioned?]

793
00:49:18,070 --> 00:49:20,010
Su Jeong, could you send me the

794
00:49:20,010 --> 00:49:21,970
photo you mentioned?

795
00:49:21,970 --> 00:49:24,260
The photo?

796
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:26,570
Why are you looking at my phone?

797
00:49:26,570 --> 00:49:28,710
Did you forget you were to be watched closely?

798
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:31,240
But still, it's my phone.

799
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:32,870
She means the food photo. The food photo.

800
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:34,520
She runs a restaurant.

801
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:38,120
She didn't mean your photo. Don't worry.

802
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:41,960
I'm telling you the truth.

803
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:44,440
Anyway, I finished the task. I'll go home now.

804
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:46,020
You can't.

805
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:47,710
How am I supposed to trust you?

806
00:49:47,710 --> 00:49:50,070
Will you watch me all day, then?

807
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:51,650
- Yes.
- Pardon?

808
00:49:51,650 --> 00:49:53,280
Follow me.

809
00:50:07,110 --> 00:50:09,380
I choose this one.

810
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:11,140
Why would you choose clothes?

811
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:13,080
"Lovers in Paris."

812
00:50:14,610 --> 00:50:15,960
I thought we were doing that.

813
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:18,320
I'm buying my clothes.

814
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:19,660
We're going this way, not that way.

815
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:22,380
Why did you bring me here, then?

816
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:23,880
Huh?

817
00:50:37,170 --> 00:50:39,120

00:52:31,410 --> 00:52:33,310
I guess it doesn't.

854

You're lending it. Return it by tomorrow.

Oppa.

You must be hungry. Let's eat.

882
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:27,730
I've been thinking.

883
00:54:27,730 --> 00:54:29,490
Yes, what have you been thinking?

884
00:54:29,490 --> 00:54:32,200
I'm not sure if you really like me.

885
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:33,630
How do you not know?

886
00:54:33,630 --> 00:54:35,750
I adore and love you.

887
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:37,820
But you do this to anyone.

888
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:39,320
You're nice and sweet.

889
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:40,770
And you smile.

890
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:44,230
But you're my only girlfriend.

891
00:54:45,030 --> 00:54:46,030
So, what?

892
00:54:46,030 --> 00:54:48,500
You're the same before or after we started dating.

893
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:50,480
You think so?

894
00:54:55,550 --> 00:54:57,430
Let's break up.

895
00:55:03,250 --> 00:55:05,640
- Eun Hee.
- I was happier before we dated.

896
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:09,980
I feel too nervous and pathetic now.

897
00:55:16,850 --> 00:55:18,190
Okay, then.

898
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:19,560
Let's break up.

899
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:21,610
What?

900
00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:23,090
Just like that?

901
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:27,740
I prefer you to be happy than feel pathetic.

902
00:55:32,110 --> 00:55:33,780
Wow.

903
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:39,230
You really are a bastard.

904
00:55:49,810 --> 00:55:51,440
Do you want this?

905
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:56,150
Do you want to feed a bastard like me?

906
00:55:56,150 --> 00:55:57,440
Did you cheat?

907
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:58,660
No, of course not.

908
00:55:58,660 --> 00:56:00,630
You're not much of a bastard, then.

909
00:56:00,630 --> 00:56:03,690
You were just nice to everyone.

910
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:07,650
But people call that cheating.

911
00:56:07,650 --> 00:56:10,380
You have to cheat to be a cheater.

912
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:12,000
I know.

913
00:56:13,170 --> 00:56:14,800
Here you go.

914
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:17,490
Wow, the sashimi aged well.

915
00:56:17,490 --> 00:56:19,590
Good sizes, too.

916
00:56:19,590 --> 00:56:20,840
That's good to hear.

917
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:24,110
Could you give me a bottle of soju?

918
00:56:55,810 --> 00:56:57,300
How cheap.

919
00:56:58,170 --> 00:57:00,390
Why are we here, anyway?

920
00:57:00,390 --> 00:57:03,040
I'm here to meet an important client.

921
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:06,430
I came for your peace of mind,

922
00:57:06,430 --> 00:57:09,190
but don't introduce me as your girlfriend.

923
00:57:09,190 --> 00:57:12,510
I don't want to get involved with a chaebol.

924
00:57:12,510 --> 00:57:14,280
Ms. Baek?

925
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:15,520
Yes?

926
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:17,900
Do you think I want to get involved with you?

927
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:19,790
Isn't the Cinderella story getting too old?

928
00:57:19,790 --> 00:57:22,140
Stop making it obvious that you're old.

929
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:24,570
Okay. It must be nice being young.

930
00:57:24,570 --> 00:57:27,470
I actually don't like it.

931
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:31,160
Hey, isn't that Ban Ju Yeon?

932
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:33,150
Ban Ju Yeon of Yongsung?

933
00:57:34,590 --> 00:57:35,830
It's him.

934
00:57:35,830 --> 00:57:37,540
What's he doing here?

935
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:38,820
Those losers.

936
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:40,740
- What?
- You were still alive.

937
00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:43,090
Wait here. Don't go anywhere.

938
00:57:43,090 --> 00:57:44,500
Pardon? Wait?

939
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:46,640
How long should I wait-

940
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:48,870
Geez, that psycho.

941
00:57:48,870 --> 00:57:50,840
I should run away.

942
00:57:53,180 --> 00:57:55,280
I'm hungry.

943
00:57:57,150 --> 00:57:58,400
Hey, Ban Ju Yeon.

944
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,160
I thought you were in the US.

945
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:01,690
When did you come to Korea?

946
00:58:01,690 --> 00:58:04,170
You must really be working at the department store.

947
00:58:04,170 --> 00:58:05,260
Daebak.

948
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:07,970
Hey, I thought your grandma abandoned you

949
00:58:07,970 --> 00:58:10,090
because she didn't get you a position.

950
00:58:10,090 --> 00:58:11,710
Hey, don't say that.

951
00:58:11,710 --> 00:58:13,760
He hasn't received a stock yet.

952
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:17,660
He'd be left high and dried at this rate.

953
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:20,110
You guys are as fun as ever.

954
00:58:20,110 --> 00:58:22,340
We do have a lot of fun.

955
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:25,640
Hey, you should enjoy your life, too.

956
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:28,050
You can't do anything because of your grandma.

957
00:58:28,050 --> 00:58:30,840
I'm not sure. I think I enjoy life, too.

958
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:32,000
What are you saying?

959
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,230
You didn't drink or gamble in the US.

960
00:58:34,230 --> 00:58:35,750
You had zero fun there.

961
00:58:35,750 --> 00:58:37,240
You came here alone, didn't you?

962
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:40,680
Go and get him a nice-looking one.

963
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:42,490
A nice looking one?

964
00:58:42,490 --> 00:58:43,800
Should I?

965
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:46,570
- No thanks.
- You're no fun. Saying no again?

966
00:58:46,570 --> 00:58:48,160
Alcohol, women, and gambling.

967
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:51,070
Your idea of fun is so obvious. It's pathetic.

968
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:52,820
It's so trashy.

969
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:54,210
What?

970
00:58:58,080 --> 00:58:59,240
What did you say just now?

971
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:00,940
Trashy, I said.

972
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:03,220
But it's funny how you always provoke me.

973
00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:04,910
I should probably let you win.

974
00:59:04,910 --> 00:59:08,400
You don't even know the expression "high and dry."

975
00:59:21,820 --> 00:59:23,560
I haven't seen you before.

976
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:25,210
You know me, right?

977
00:59:25,210 --> 00:59:27,090
What? Are you a chaebol, too?

978
00:59:27,090 --> 00:59:29,570
Yes, I am a chaebol.

979
00:59:29,570 --> 00:59:31,600
Want to hang out with me if you're alone?

980
00:59:32,370 --> 00:59:35,060
I must be a customer of your company, then.

981
00:59:35,060 --> 00:59:36,890
Why do you talk to me casually?

982
00:59:36,890 --> 00:59:39,150
Shouldn't you be polite to your customer

983
00:59:39,150 --> 00:59:40,720
if you're a chaebol?

984
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:44,550
This bitch is funny.

985
00:59:44,550 --> 00:59:45,790
When I first saw you,

986
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:49,990
I knew you weren't one of us.

987
00:59:49,990 --> 00:59:52,940
You were a customer, huh?

988
00:59:52,940 --> 00:59:54,290
Okay.

989
00:59:54,290 --> 00:59:56,520
I'll treat you like a queen.

990
00:59:57,430 --> 00:59:59,280
In bed.

991
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:00,780
Let go. Let go, I said!

992
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:02,570
I liked your feisty mode.

993
01:00:02,570 --> 01:00:04,050
I know your kind well.

994
01:00:04,050 --> 01:00:06,230
Stop playing hard to get. Come.

995
01:00:11,450 --> 01:00:13,090
What's going on?

996
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:16,510
Are you out of your mind?

997
01:00:18,310 --> 01:00:20,220
What's wrong with them?

998
01:01:01,690 --> 01:01:05,010

Keep the dress.

1014
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,510
I don't need it, and it was pretty on you.

1015
01:02:10,510 --> 01:02:13,390
I thought you disliked the director.

1016
01:02:13,390 --> 01:02:14,890
There's nothing to like or dislike.

1017
01:02:14,890 --> 01:02:16,220
