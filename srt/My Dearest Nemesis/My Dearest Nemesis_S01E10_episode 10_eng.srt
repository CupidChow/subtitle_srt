1
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:15,080


2
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:17,730
   

3
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,420
   

4
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,130
   

5
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,990
   

6
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:27,830
   

7
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:31,980
   

8
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,770
   

9
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,020
   

10
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,170
Why are you crying?

11
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:05,570
When I look at you like this...

12
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:11,670
you look even more angelic.

13
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:16,180
Gosh, seriously.

14
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:22,590
Thinking now, you also said that

15
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,920
when we first met.

16
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,840
 Angel? 

17
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:33,640
You always said...

18
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,570
stuff like this so shamelessly.

19
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,370
But you do look like an angel.

20
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,910
You did then and even now.

21
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:48,130
I'll make you porridge. Sleep more.

22
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,050
   

23
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:04,570
Take the medicine again before bed. Don't forget.

24
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:06,700
I'm all better now.

25
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,540
No, you aren't.

26
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:10,240
I really am.

27
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,140
Still take it. You never know.

28
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,570
Are you really leaving?

29
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:22,560
Why don't you stay a bit longer?

30
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,190
I need to go. It's late.

31
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:27,170
You should rest today.

32
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:30,250
We can be together from now on.

33
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:35,280
Okay. You should rest at home, too.

34
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,670
Thank you.

35
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,090
See you tomorrow.

36
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,520
Get home safely.

37
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,790
Call me when you arrive.

38
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,710
I can't.

39
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,730
I can't let you go.

40
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,730
Please stay with me.

41
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,360
What's wrong?

42
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,050
When did I fall asleep?

43
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,730
Baek Su Jeong.

44
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:34,820
Dad, you're up.

45
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:38,340
The thing is, I need to go back to work—

46
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:41,170
Were you with the director?

47
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,450
Are you back together?

48
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:49,200
Yes.

49
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,980
Su Jeong, his family isn't a normal family.

50
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:54,060
According to the article, many eyes are on him.

51
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,840
A lot of people are talking.

52
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,790
You know I don't care about stuff like that.

53
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,390
I really like him a lot.

54
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:08,710
So, can't you just allow it?

55
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:16,450
What do you mean allow?

56
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,840
I should trust your decision.

57
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,450
But, Su Jeong,

58
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,840
tell me you're having a hard time.

59
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,700
Don't just hold it in.

60
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,750
I don't care about anything else.

61
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:33,670
I just want you to be happy.

62
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:35,560
That's enough.

63
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:38,920
Okay.

64
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,500
Whatever. Go to work now.

65
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,800
Okay, I will.

66
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,350
But sleeping outside is...

67
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:49,030
Just don't get caught.

68
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:51,750
Okay, I'll never get caught.

69
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:55,970
Say you won't stay out all night!

70
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:06,540
   

71
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,430
 Director Ban. 

72
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:16,530
Yes.

73
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:20,300
 You're dismissed as of today. 

74
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:40,640
I knew this would happen.

75
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:47,440
Didn't you say there was nothing going on?

76
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,310
 Yes, Chairwoman. 

77
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:52,190
 It seems clear... 

78
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:55,570
 there is nothing going on between them. 

79
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:59,780
I'm sorry for disappointing you.

80
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,650
   

81
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:07,330
Thank you for everything.

82
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:11,910
   

83
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:13,180
   

84
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,580
   

85
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:20,290
 The customer is not available at the moment. 

86
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:24,860
The chairwoman is taking it too far.

87
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,680
Did the director get fired?

88
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,050
All of a sudden?

89
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,400
Is this about the rumor involving Team Leader?

90
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,740
It can't be.

91
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,700
There's no other way to explain it.

92
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,070
And overnight? In the middle of the project?

93
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:39,970
But still. Dismissal?

94
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,700
- What about our project? 
 - Team Leader.

95
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:52,120
Director...

96
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:57,420
Team Leader!

97
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:02,190
 The call is not going through. 

98
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:04,670
 You'll be connected to... 

99
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,590
Chief,

100
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:11,030
what happened to the director out of the blue?

101
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,580
You're in such a hurry.

102
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:16,430
You aren't hiding your relationship anymore.

103
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:17,680
It's okay.

104
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,920
The chairwoman also knows about it now.

105
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,710
- Pardon? 
 - She knows when you

106
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:25,510
entered and left the director's house.

107
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:26,810
She knows everything.

108
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:30,030
Looks like she had many lookouts.

109
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:32,020
That's what happened...

110
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,400
Chief Kwon.

111
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,970
I quit.

112
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,040
- Why? 
 - Because I knew from the beginning.

113
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,140
But I kept it a secret.

114
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:58,250
Take good care of the director.

115
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:01,250
But I'm relieved someone like you

116
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,400
is by his side.

117
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:20,660
   

118
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:28,630
Chief, where's the chairwoman right now?

119
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:53,690
Chairwoman.

120
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:58,950
How dare you come in here?

121
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:01,680
I know you aren't happy...

122
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,180
about our relationship.

123
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,770
But I won't let my

124
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:06,970
personal feelings jeopardize Yongsung, so—

125
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:11,070
I said it'd be over if you disappointed me.

126
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,420
Grandmother.

127
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:31,970
You know I've done...

128
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:36,500
everything for Yongsung.

129
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,200
I'll be better from now on.

130
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,460
I'll work harder as your grandson.

131
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:44,340
I thought you could be a substitute,

132
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:47,050
but you were a defect.

133
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:52,180
I'm disgusted that you're related to me.

134
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,560
What about me, then?

135
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,890
- What? 
 - Ever since my parents passed,

136
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:00,750
I couldn't even be sad or happy freely.

137
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,850
Because I was always an unworthy grandson.

138
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:04,950
No matter how painful that was,

139
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:07,800
I endured it and worked hard every day.

140
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,450
I thought you'd acknowledge me someday

141
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:12,560
if I lived the way you wanted me to.

142
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,420
I've been trying to satisfy your standards.

143
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:19,220
But I can't even...

144
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:23,670
- love her? 
 - Of course not.

145
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:25,860
You said you want to be my successor.

146
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,450
Love?

147
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:29,170
With a junior employee,

148
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:32,090
a daughter of a hardware store owner?

149
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:36,300
I never should've accepted

150
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,010
someone who wasn't qualified.

151
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:43,630
I guess...

152
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:49,630
I never would've been good enough for you.

153
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:51,360
That's right.

154
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,630
 ­  

155
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,610
 I... 

156
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:42,650
 will fill in for my father. 

157
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:45,090
 I thought you could be a substitute, 

158
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,900
 but you were a defect. 

159
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:52,200
 I'm disgusted that you're related to me. 

160
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,670
 Are you okay? 

161
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:34,280
 Call me when you see this. 

162
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,870
 I'm okay. 

163
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:45,370
 I'm sorry for making you worry. 

164
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:50,310
 See you after work. 

165
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,920
 Where are you? 

166
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,370
 I'm leaving now. 

167
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,810
Here you are.

168
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:10,460
You must be hungry.

169
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,800
What should we eat?

170
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,950
Director,

171
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:15,780
you can tell the chairwoman that we broke up.

172
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,110
I really don't care.

173
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:18,960
There's no need to deny our relationship.

174
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,240
And we shouldn't.

175
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:24,380
I'm sorry for everything.

176
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:30,800
Where should we go?

177
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,740
I can have a date anywhere now.

178
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:36,010
You're right.

179
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:38,230
We can do that now.

180
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,520
We can hold hands like this, too.

181
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:45,780
I like it.

182
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,970
You can go to concerts freely, too.

183
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:53,700
Ever since I became public,

184
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:56,070
I never thought I'd go to a concert again.

185
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:59,350
I can go to the next one now.

186
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,930
Should we go together?

187
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:05,160
I'd love to go with you, of course.

188
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,360
I'll do the things you've done alone

189
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,030
with you from now on. Whatever it is.

190
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:13,060
Sounds good.

191
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:16,130
I'll be okay as long as I have you.

192
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:18,630
You'll continue to be okay, then.

193
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:21,900
Because I'll stay by your side.

194
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:31,420
How could I not worry?

195
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:34,780
 I'm with Su Jeong. 

196
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:39,070
Kim Shin Won.

197
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:41,690
Why is it so hard to see you these days?

198
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:43,720
Because I've been with my girlfriend.

199
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,370
You think I don't know that?

200
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:47,840
It's because you come home less these days.

201
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,990
Son.

202
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:52,130
You said you don't do portraits.

203
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:53,930
But look what you're working on now.

204
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:56,260
I wanted to draw it once.

205
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,170
It'd be a nice gift later, too.

206
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:02,470
Looks like you finally found the right one.

207
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:05,770
I think so, too.

208
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:08,570
Are you thinking of even marrying her?

209
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:10,940
I haven't considered that yet, but...

210
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,840
How should I say it?

211
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,650
I want to always be with her.

212
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:16,890
I don't want to be apart from her.

213
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:20,580
If I got to share a lifetime with her like you two,

214
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:23,260
I'd definitely be happy.

215
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:31,840
I didn't think I'd be seeing you dressed like this.

216
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:35,140
I'm no longer your boss.

217
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:38,100
Why did you do that?

218
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:42,330
The fact that you upset the chairwoman.

219
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:44,230
I just don't understand it.

220
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,400
Do you know...

221
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,300
when I started to respect and look up to

222
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,700
the chairwoman?

223
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:57,150
This might sound cruel to you,

224
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:59,360
but it was after she lost her son.

225
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,300
Seeing how strong she was at the time,

226
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:09,600
I thought, "I can trust someone like her."

227
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:15,730
You don't like espresso, right?

228
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:20,200
You go to concerts sometimes.

229
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,630
I didn't check inside the packages

230
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:25,590
you ordered under a strange name.

231
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:28,030
When you knew all that,

232
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,640
why didn't you report it to her?

233
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,770
You hid that to become the person she wanted.

234
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:37,880
Hiding emotions and suppressing them

235
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:41,940
couldn't have been easy, but you endured it.

236
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:46,810
That side of you resembled the chairwoman a lot.

237
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:51,700
And I thought that was the successor she had in mind.

238
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,670
- Then, this time also— 
 - No.

239
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:59,880
I was just an ordinary person, drawn to affection.

240
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,520
Being a successor is nice,

241
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,420
but I've known you since you were a child.

242
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:10,140
I thought it'd be nice for you to be happy

243
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,460
with someone you love.

244
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:21,090
So, Chief Kwon...

245
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:22,990
that's how you felt.

246
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:26,770
Yes. I did.

247
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:39,930
Thank you for working with me all this time.

248
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,210
What do I do now?

249
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,470
 What are you going to do now? 

250
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,540
 Do you want to read comic books in the attic? 

251
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:18,120
 I think Su Bin is home. 

252
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,940
 Okay. 

253
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,290
I'm nearing the shop now.

254
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:39,030
Huh? I'm still on my way from grocery shopping.

255
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:40,770
 It's okay. I can wait. 

256
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:42,350
I took a half day off today.

257
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:44,150
We really have to see a movie today.

258
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:47,260
We can't suddenly go to a hotel like last time.

259
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:50,510
Didn't you gladly change the destination?

260
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:54,770
Geez. We're on the same page too often.

261
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:57,060
Okay, see you later.

262
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,950
What?

263
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:28,200
What are you doing here at this hour?

264
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:35,380
So, your grandma threw you out

265
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,140
and you lost your job.

266
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:39,690
That means you're...

267
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:43,080
jobless. Just like me.

268
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:45,430
Jobless?

269
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:47,850
Well, aren't you?

270
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:50,500
Do you have something to do?

271
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:53,670
I do not.

272
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:56,950
That's why you wanted to wait for Noona at our place.

273
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:58,440
It's not exactly that—

274
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:03,800
By the way, what exactly do you like about her?

275
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,130
She's pretty.

276
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:07,340
Are you crazy by chance?

277
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:09,170
Being crazy in love isn't a sin.

278
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:11,820
Geez, stop.

279
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:16,240
I think I'll puke. Stop talking, please.

280
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,050
And she loves me as I am.

281
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:23,430
She cried about breaking up.

282
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:26,850
But you're both totally head over heels. Seriously.

283
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:29,650
Did Su Jeong cry?

284
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:30,980
Yes.

285
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:33,470
Dad and I never saw her bawling like that.

286
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:36,400
It gave me chills... not.

287
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,420
Thinking now, she did that back then, too.

288
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:41,270
Because of Black Dragon or whatever.

289
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:42,380
Black Dragon.

290
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:44,730
There's this guy. He was her first love.

291
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:47,040
Her dark days. If she finds out that I know,

292
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,310
she'd bite her tongue and kill herself.

293
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:52,460
Did she cry a lot then, too?

294
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,750
Yes.

295
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:55,800
She didn't eat for days.

296
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,820
Dad was very worried, too. But he couldn't show it.

297
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:01,600
It was the most unfilial thing she did.

298
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,720
Eat.

299
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,450
Okay.

300
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:15,010
   

301
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:16,700
Father.

302
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,800
Hand me the heavy stuff.

303
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,030
What brings you here?

304
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:24,140
I don't know. He suddenly wants to help you.

305
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,590
He must be busy, though.

306
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:27,840
He's not. He's jobless.

307
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,390
I'll do my best to help you.

308
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:33,080
I have no skills, but I have strength.

309
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,870
I don't think you do.

310
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:37,950
You see?

311
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:40,420
Follow me, then.

312
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,030
- Me, too? 
 - Yes, help him.

313
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:43,190
M-Me?

314
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:46,390
I was going to rest because it's my day off.

315
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:50,150
- Hand me that. 
 - Okay.

316
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,950
What should I start with?

317
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:56,750
You said you have no skills.

318
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:58,650
Can you do this stuff?

319
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:00,890
You just need to change the doorknob.

320
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:05,060
Of course. I'll try to take care of it myself.

321
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:07,080
Just let me know if you can't.

322
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,790
Su Jeong does this with her eyes closed.

323
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:12,910
I'm bad at being bad at things.

324
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:20,800
Will he do it with bare hands?

325
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,340
Go help him.

326
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:34,610
How do I do this...

327
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:38,190
You have to glue it if you do it that way.

328
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:41,320
You do it like this. Got it?

329
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,420
And you... No.

330
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:46,060
Use this to undo this.

331
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:49,280
I'll try this myself, then.

332
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,810
Be careful. Then...

333
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:53,380
Hold this for me.

334
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:55,380
- I'll hold it. 
 - Okay.

335
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:57,190
Is it expensive?

336
00:24:57,190 --> 00:25:00,360
Well, I don't really know.

337
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,770
So...

338
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:04,600
No, no, no.

339
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,640
If you don't know how to do this,

340
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,280
it'd be good if you let me know.

341
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,490
Thank you for teaching me.

342
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:13,680
- I can do it well. 
 - Can you?

343
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,890
Okay.

344
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:26,110
Father, I accomplished this important task.

345
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,210
You do the same, right?

346
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:32,180
- The opposite direction. 
 - The same way, right?

347
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:46,320
Why won't he respond?

348
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:51,710
 Guess what your boyfriend is doing. 

349
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:53,340
What?

350
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,130
There's a lot of concern about

351
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:00,940
the vacant director position.

352
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:05,490
Also, about the successor, besides Director Ban—

353
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:10,780
You think there's no one to replace him?

354
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:14,440
Call Yongsung Trading's

355
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,340
Park Ji Cheol.

356
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,740
Yes.

357
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:20,560
And as for Team Leader Baek Su Jeong—

358
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,710
Get rid of her discreetly.

359
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:24,220
Okay.

360
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,350
You worked hard today.

361
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:39,530
Why don't we have dinner together?

362
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:42,250
Yes, I'll enjoy it.

363
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:45,230
How do you know if you'll enjoy it?

364
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:48,950
What are we supposed to eat today?

365
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:50,240
Should I cook, then?

366
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,110
I'm strong,

367
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:55,350
but I can cook, too.

368
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:58,290
I don't think you can.

369
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:18,240
He was desperate to impress you all day.

370
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,520
That was pretty good, huh?

371
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:24,000
- Impress me? 
 - You're his girlfriend's dad.

372
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,920
Right. You don't have to do that.

373
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29,120
I'm happy as long as Su Jeong is happy.

374
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,360
Hey, come on.

375
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,130
I know you didn't trust him.

376
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:33,330
I didn't?

377
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:36,190
I didn't? That's not true.

378
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:38,450
Of course, you're worried.

379
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:41,740
I don't come from a normal background.

380
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:45,800
You must trust Su Jeong, but not me.

381
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,720
My situation is like this now,

382
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,580
but I'll make sure you won't worry.

383
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:53,230
No matter what,

384
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:56,190
I won't make her cry or leave her alone.

385
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,600
I'm such a bad dad.

386
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,200
All I could do was trust her and nothing else.

387
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:08,340
But I'm relieved, thanks to you.

388
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:11,610
I'll make sure you won't have to worry.

389
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:22,170
Su Jeong, welcome.

390
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:23,650
What are you doing?

391
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:25,200
What's with the headwrap?

392
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,790
Welcome, Su Jeong. Let's eat.

393
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:30,280
My son-in-law is a great cook.

394
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:34,950
- Your what? 
 - I learned how to cook as a child.

395
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:37,770
The galbijjim is amazing, Brother-in-law.

396
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:39,100
Brother-in-law?

397
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:43,200
Su Jeong, I made it because you like that.

398
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:46,550
All right.

399
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:48,700
What's all this?

400
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,300
Okay.

401
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,480
Wow.

402
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,180
Say, "Ah."

403
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,630
What?

404
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:04,250
Why is it so good?

405
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:05,930
I know, right?

406
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:07,400
It's by Chef Ban Ju Yeon.

407
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,530
Let's eat.

408
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,730
How nice.

409
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:32,350
Eating and talking together at home like this.

410
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:39,650
It's my first time since my parents passed away.

411
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:44,170
He must've had a hard time.

412
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:50,630
Sleep over.

413
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:52,220
Pardon?

414
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:54,900
You worked hard today.

415
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,980
Drink with us and sleep over.

416
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,770
We'll have breakfast tomorrow, too.

417
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:01,600
I'll make breakfast.

418
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,110
- Would that be okay? 
 - Of course.

419
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:05,500
Let's share my room.

420
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,180
Your room is messy.

421
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,960
An important guest can't sleep there.

422
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,980
Sleep with me in the main bedroom.

423
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:13,500
You'll snore up a storm.

424
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,750
He can't sleep. You'll sleep in my room, right?

425
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:17,740
You both want me. This is tricky.

426
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:20,160
I only have one body.

427
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:22,310
Just sleep in my room.

428
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:24,010
- Are you crazy? 
 - Are you crazy?

429
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:25,830
What are you thinking?

430
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:28,490
I can sleep in the living room.

431
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,650
Oh, okay.

432
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:21,410
(Goodnight.)

433
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:17,530
 Are you sleeping? 

434
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:20,670
 Can I see you briefly if you aren't? 

435
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,350
What is it?

436
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:41,730
I bought this for you,

437
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:44,300
but I realized I only got one.

438
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,570
Dad or Su Bin

439
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:47,100
would drink it if I put it in the fridge.

440
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,050
I thought you were a filial daughter.

441
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:51,390
You only care about me.

442
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:56,140
Thank you. I was craving something sweet.

443
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,730
Are you okay after drinking?

444
00:32:58,730 --> 00:32:59,950
I'm fine.

445
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:04,380
You're the only one who could kill me.

446
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,280
Anyway, what did you do today?

447
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,000
I told you to read comic books and rest.

448
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,800
I had tteokbokki with your brother and helped Father.

449
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:17,440
You know what?

450
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,410
I'm a man who knows how to change doorknobs.

451
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:23,910
Amazing. You did that?

452
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:27,150
You're a good cook, too. You're good at everything.

453
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:29,280
I know.

454
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,710
I know how to do something.

455
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:35,180
Good work.

456
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,300
Was everything okay with you?

457
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:42,890
Yes, of course, everything was fine.

458
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:44,890
That's good to hear.

459
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:46,500
Read comic books since you're here.

460
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:49,010
Should I? Let's read together.

461
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:50,410
I'll recommend you one.

462
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:52,150
Sounds good.

463
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:56,340
This is it.

464
00:33:56,340 --> 00:34:01,700
I read it when I feel combative.

465
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:04,080
- Did you get that autograph? 
 - Yes, right.

466
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:09,200
You can say this is one of my proud achievements.

467
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:15,330
This is what happened...

468
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:19,240
Look where I marked it.

469
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:31,500
You don't have to see me off.

470
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:34,500
I wish I could drive you to work.

471
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:37,770
But the breakfast with family is more important.

472
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,700
Did you sleep comfortably?

473
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,400
You should've slept comfortably at home.

474
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,850
Dad and Su Bin took it too far.

475
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:46,150
I felt comfortable.

476
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:48,220
More than I do at home.

477
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:51,860
That's a relief, then.

478
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:55,740
I'm glad you're a loved daughter and sister.

479
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:58,230
I can be loved because of that, too.

480
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:00,240
Like family.

481
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:04,110
Go inside now.

482
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:06,420
You'll be late for breakfast.

483
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:11,310
I'll go.

484
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,790
Su Jeong.

485
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,760
I made up my mind yesterday.

486
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:28,760
I won't make you cry for the third time.

487
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:39,890
So, get back safely.

488
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:42,940
Don't fall or get hurt.

489
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:45,520
Don't worry about me, either.

490
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:13,050
   

491
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:24,380
   

492
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:29,840
What's this, Team Leader?

493
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,260
Why would you...

494
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:33,140
This makes no sense.

495
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:36,590
They can't do this over a false rumor.

496
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:40,220
The rumor is true.

497
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:41,330
Pardon?

498
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:43,110
You said it wasn't then.

499
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:45,170
With Director?

500
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:48,230
I'm sorry. It wasn't true then.

501
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:51,250
But we are dating now.

502
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,320
Okay.

503
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,070
Okay, but still—

504
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:58,310
Yes, it's unjust.

505
00:36:58,310 --> 00:37:01,720
Team Leader, you won't just let this slide.

506
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,530
Right?

507
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:13,740
I'm sorry this happened while we are busy.

508
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:23,090
Team Leader.

509
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:30,550
Why did she send her

510
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:32,430
grandson's rumored girlfriend here?

511
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:34,370
She probably has no skills.

512
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:35,910
That's why she sent her here.

513
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:39,130
So, she'd do nothing, give up on her own, and leave.

514
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:41,010
Excuse me.

515
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,720
I won't get in your way.

516
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,840
If you have any task that's a hassle for you,

517
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,990
just give it to me.

518
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:52,070
I'm sure there are things I can do.

519
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:00,140
W-What? Huh?

520
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:04,060
Something must be broken. It won't shut off.

521
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:06,230
What? An hour?

522
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:07,870
H-Hey...

523
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:10,510
Let me give it a try.

524
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:13,680
This isn't something anyone can fix.

525
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,970
I have electrician and fire inspection certificates.

526
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:17,800
You don't mind, right?

527
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,710
It worked.

528
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:51,330
What else can I do?

529
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:58,190
Just one moment.

530
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:04,820
Why are you all standing here...

531
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,830
What are you doing?

532
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:21,340
I thought you didn't tolerate stuff like this.

533
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:23,790
How about you? Why are you angry?

534
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:25,160
I thought you'd be happy to

535
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,710
not see the annoying junior in meetings.

536
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:30,140
The reason I don't like you is because

537
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:32,400
you don't tolerate anything.

538
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,400
I've walked around eggshells and

539
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,400
gave up on self-respect to come this far.

540
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,410
But you never tolerate anything.

541
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:40,770
You say everything you want to say

542
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:43,450
and protect your sense of pride.

543
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:45,410
You think you're so superior.

544
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:48,480
I really hated that, but...

545
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:52,230
But seeing you tolerate this—

546
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:53,950
You hate this, too?

547
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:55,650
Yes.

548
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:57,440
I hate it.

549
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,300
Baek Su Jeong,

550
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:01,910
- why don't you just— 
 - Senior,

551
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:04,610
I haven't tolerated things all this time...

552
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:07,110
to protect myself.

553
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:09,760
But to protect someone else,

554
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,040
I do have to tolerate some things.

555
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:15,290
I'll get going now.

556
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:52,120
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

557
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:58,770
Please drink this.

558
00:40:58,770 --> 00:41:00,780
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

559
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:02,810
Thank you.

560
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:05,130
That's the new director.

561
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:08,770
Do you think this is it for Director Ban?

562
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:13,690
 Yongsung Department Store's strategy team director, 

563
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:16,240
 Ban Ju Yeon was dismissed 

564
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,880
 and Yongsung Trading's Park Ji Cheol 

565
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,820
 was hired for the position. 

566
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:22,940
 This appointment strongly 

567
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:24,890
 reflected Chairwoman Jeong Hyo Seon's 

568
00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:28,720
 will, according to the source. 

569
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:34,980
   

570
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:49,070
   

571
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:52,980
   

572
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:54,360
   

573
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,600
Are you okay?

574
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:15,010
I heard the news.

575
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,600
Of course.

576
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,380
Aren't you overdoing it?

577
00:42:21,090 --> 00:42:23,080
Does it seem that way?

578
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:27,760
But no one would be okay

579
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,150
in this situation.

580
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:33,650
I should try to look happier.

581
00:42:34,450 --> 00:42:37,530
I have a favor to ask.

582
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,810
Could you keep this...

583
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:43,150
a secret from the director for now?

584
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:46,870
He'd get upset if he found out.

585
00:42:46,870 --> 00:42:49,830
He might tell me to just quit.

586
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,730
I think...

587
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:55,230
that'd be better, too.

588
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:58,140
You're capable of working anywhere.

589
00:42:58,870 --> 00:43:01,280
I know, but...

590
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:05,370
if I left, everything would be completely over.

591
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:10,020
So, I'll try doing everything I can.

592
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,820
   

593
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:22,840
Things must feel unsettling at work.

594
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,540
How's Su Jeong doing?

595
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:26,940
She sounded cheerful over the phone.

596
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:28,410
All done.

597
00:43:28,410 --> 00:43:30,200
She was cheerful in person, too.

598
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,120
I know it can't be easy.

599
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:35,510
She's like that when things are difficult.

600
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:38,780
- Welcome. 
 - Welcome.

601
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:42,460
- Mom. 
 - Hey, Ha Jin. I—

602
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:45,160
Who's this?

603
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,460
Hello, I'm Ha Jin's boy—

604
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:50,430
He's a part-timer.

605
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:53,020
Hey, why hire one when you have no customers?

606
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:54,700
That's why I just fired him.

607
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:59,000
I'll deposit the payment for the work you've done.

608
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:02,530
I'm so, so sorry.

609
00:44:02,530 --> 00:44:03,860
I'll call you after Mom leaves.

610
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:05,390
Can't I just be your boyfriend?

611
00:44:05,390 --> 00:44:07,250
She'd get us married immediately, then.

612
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:09,180
I'm fine with that.

613
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:15,370
Ha Jin, long time no see.

614
00:44:15,370 --> 00:44:19,460
He asked me to help persuade you.

615
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:21,610
Crazy jerk.

616
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:25,010
Hey, what's wrong with you?

617
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:27,340
He wants to get back together.

618
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:28,960
H-Ha Jin,

619
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,150
Mother wants it so badly, too.

620
00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:33,130
Let's try to make things work.

621
00:44:33,130 --> 00:44:36,460
I miss the crab stew you make and...

622
00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:39,170
It's so hard being alone.

623
00:44:39,170 --> 00:44:40,860
Hey!

624
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:42,840
Because I didn't want to

625
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:45,130
regret the 20s I spent with you,

626
00:44:45,130 --> 00:44:47,640
I got divorced quietly.

627
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:50,340
So, stop talking bullshit

628
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:51,450
and get lost.

629
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:53,810
Seo Ha Jin! Gosh.

630
00:44:53,810 --> 00:44:55,360
Why are you so mean?

631
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:56,920
When you got divorced,

632
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:59,400
he gave you money to start this shop, too.

633
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,940
You think he did that for me?

634
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:03,570
What?

635
00:45:04,270 --> 00:45:05,600
What, then?

636
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,280
Ha Jin.

637
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:11,570
What's with you?

638
00:45:11,570 --> 00:45:14,400
You can't do this if you have a conscience.

639
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,820
Especially not in front of Mother.

640
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:21,710
I didn't get divorced for no reason.

641
00:45:21,710 --> 00:45:23,570
This jerk cheated on me.

642
00:45:23,570 --> 00:45:25,940
With another woman at work.

643
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:29,410
What? Hey...

644
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:32,070
Is that true—

645
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:34,870
M-Mother, well...

646
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:37,660
It was a mistake.

647
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:38,870
- Mistake. 
 - Mistake?

648
00:45:38,870 --> 00:45:42,560
- M-Mother, I-I'm sorry. 
 - Mistake?

649
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:43,780
- Mother! 
 - Mom.

650
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:46,020
- Mother. 
 - Mom.

651
00:45:54,990 --> 00:45:58,640
Gosh, I made him see all sorts of things.

652
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:07,810
Seo Ha Jin.

653
00:46:07,810 --> 00:46:10,170
Mom, are you awake?

654
00:46:10,990 --> 00:46:12,650
Are you awake, Honey?

655
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:14,260
Gosh.

656
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:16,040
Hey,

657
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:20,180
why didn't you tell me? Huh?

658
00:46:20,990 --> 00:46:23,120
I had no idea.

659
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:26,950
I blamed my precious daughter instead.

660
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:32,050
It must've hurt.

661
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,850
It didn't hurt at all.

662
00:46:34,850 --> 00:46:38,010
Your fists are soft now.

663
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:39,210
Goodness...

664
00:46:39,210 --> 00:46:41,910
Gosh, poor me.

665
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:44,900
Why should our daughter be treated...

666
00:46:48,470 --> 00:46:51,650
I didn't tell you because I knew you'd be upset.

667
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:55,020
You think I wasn't upset when I blamed you?

668
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:56,300
Dad! Dad!

669
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:59,120
Honey, calm down. Come on...

670
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:02,270
Good thing we finally found out.

671
00:47:02,270 --> 00:47:03,660
Gosh...

672
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:06,650
Putting him in the fridge to make cold sashimi out of him

673
00:47:06,650 --> 00:47:09,770
wouldn't be good enough.

674
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:15,330
If he comes back again,

675
00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:18,330
call me first thing. Got it?

676
00:47:18,330 --> 00:47:21,300
- Okay. 
 - Do you understand?

677
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:25,490
Yes, I will.

678
00:47:25,490 --> 00:47:27,040
Hey.

679
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:29,200
By the way, that man earlier...

680
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,940
that part-timer...

681
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:34,020
Is he a boyfriend?

682
00:47:36,130 --> 00:47:38,480
Did you have a boyfriend?

683
00:47:41,310 --> 00:47:43,010
Yes.

684
00:47:43,910 --> 00:47:45,520
How old is he?

685
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:48,020
Is he a divorcee? Or just single?

686
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:50,160
Does he want to get married?

687
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:51,380
Gosh, Mom.

688
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:52,910
I mean...

689
00:47:52,910 --> 00:47:56,350
I noticed he was very handsome.

690
00:47:56,350 --> 00:47:58,990
Gosh, stop. I'm happy with the way it is now.

691
00:47:58,990 --> 00:48:01,480
You're fine now. Let's go.

692
00:48:07,990 --> 00:48:11,110
It doesn't seem Ms. Baek is willing to leave quietly.

693
00:48:11,110 --> 00:48:13,070
Since people notice her here and there,

694
00:48:13,070 --> 00:48:16,170
there are more talks internally.

695
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:20,210
What should I do?

696
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:31,550
Yes.

697
00:48:31,550 --> 00:48:32,810
Did you call?

698
00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:34,240
 Did I? 

699
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:37,960
Oh, I must've pressed it while changing.

700
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:40,000
Why did you change?

701
00:48:40,810 --> 00:48:43,760
Well, I spilled water on me.

702
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,460
Did you have lunch?

703
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:46,720
I haven't yet.

704
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,320
 Go ahead and eat. 

705
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:50,870
You know you have to eat well at times like this.

706
00:48:50,870 --> 00:48:52,500
You don't have much food at home.

707
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:55,490
Should we get groceries after work?

708
00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:00,800
Su Jeong,

709
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,440
what's wrong?

710
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:06,210
I need to do something. I'll call you back.

711
00:49:25,390 --> 00:49:27,830
You wanted to see me, Chairwoman.

712
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:37,020
Why are you...

713
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:38,930
fighting to stay?

714
00:49:38,930 --> 00:49:42,140
Can't you tell I want you to leave quietly?

715
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:46,750
It's because the director might come back.

716
00:49:48,690 --> 00:49:50,560
I see.

717
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:53,100
It was because you were dumb.

718
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:57,940
I get you want him to become the successor again,

719
00:49:57,940 --> 00:50:00,750
but I have no interest in bringing back

720
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:03,320
someone so unqualified.

721
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:05,850
That position will be vacant forever, then.

722
00:50:05,850 --> 00:50:08,130
If the director isn't qualified,

723
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:11,100
who would fill that position?

724
00:50:12,990 --> 00:50:15,000
How can you be so confident?

725
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,210
Because you are...

726
00:50:17,830 --> 00:50:20,420
his only family.

727
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:23,440
He worked hard to be acknowledged

728
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,810
and be loved by his only family.

729
00:50:25,810 --> 00:50:29,300
You think anyone else would work that hard?

730
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:32,020
- What? 
 - You don't know...

731
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:35,260
how you feel, either.

732
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:39,010
After blaming your misfortunes on your grandson,

733
00:50:39,010 --> 00:50:41,270
does that make you feel at ease?

734
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:45,200
And what I'm hoping to get back

735
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,960
isn't the successor position.

736
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:50,660
It's the director's family.

737
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:22,140
Hey, Ju Yeon. Is everything okay?

738
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:23,430
 Hyung, 

739
00:51:23,430 --> 00:51:25,910
be honest with me.

740
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:30,410
It's too much...

741
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,620
Please have some of this.

742
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:38,440
What is it?

743
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:45,350
What do you think?

744
00:51:45,350 --> 00:51:48,020
Doesn't it wake you up?

745
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:56,640
We're done for the day after moving these, right?

746
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:58,060
Yes.

747
00:51:58,060 --> 00:52:01,320
It's nice to have a young person around.

748
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:03,660
She cheers us up like this.

749
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,910
What are you doing?

750
00:52:32,910 --> 00:52:34,830
You should've told me.

751
00:52:34,830 --> 00:52:37,680
Or you should've quit immediately. Why...

752
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,810
are you doing this?

753
00:52:40,470 --> 00:52:42,300
Why are you enduring this for me?

754
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:43,810
Because I knew you'd be like this.

755
00:52:43,810 --> 00:52:47,330
Because you'd blame yourself and be upset.

756
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:48,480
That's why I couldn't tell you.

757
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:49,790
It's true.

758
00:52:49,790 --> 00:52:53,500
You wouldn't be victimized if it wasn't for me.

759
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:55,730
Why are you tolerating it?

760
00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:58,760
Just because of a word from the chairwoman,

761
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:01,660
should I let my time and effort devoted here

762
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:04,580
be forgotten and leave?

763
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:07,060
I made this decision for me.

764
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:09,830
For myself because I love you.

765
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:14,440
Because I had to stay here for what comes next.

766
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:19,000
So, please respect my decision.

767
00:53:22,110 --> 00:53:24,510
I'll make a decision, too, then.

768
00:53:26,630 --> 00:53:28,700
For you, Su Jeong.

769
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:35,640
Thank you.

770
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:37,790
You didn't have to drive me.

771
00:53:37,790 --> 00:53:38,990
Aren't you tired?

772
00:53:38,990 --> 00:53:40,690
Not at all.

773
00:53:40,690 --> 00:53:44,550
I must've been working out so much to do this.

774
00:53:44,550 --> 00:53:48,510
And these would've been hard to carry alone.

775
00:53:48,510 --> 00:53:50,630
That's why I had to drive you today.

776
00:53:50,630 --> 00:53:52,570
What are all these?

777
00:53:52,570 --> 00:53:54,030
Are they for me?

778
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:58,480
I'm sorry, but they aren't for you.

779
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:01,260
They're for your mother.

780
00:54:01,850 --> 00:54:03,710
And how about you

781
00:54:03,710 --> 00:54:06,030
install a CCTV at the shop?

782
00:54:06,030 --> 00:54:09,500
Your ex-husband didn't look so nice.

783
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:12,200
You never know when he'd be back.

784
00:54:14,270 --> 00:54:16,330
Shin Won,

785
00:54:18,140 --> 00:54:21,270
I couldn't help it then, but

786
00:54:21,270 --> 00:54:24,480
it makes me uncomfortable that you worry

787
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,290
about me this much.

788
00:54:26,290 --> 00:54:30,470
Not to mention my ex-husband and family.

789
00:54:31,550 --> 00:54:35,080
As for the gifts, I appreciate the gesture.

790
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:40,520
Drive home safely.

791
00:54:57,030 --> 00:54:58,770
Ha Jin.

792
00:55:01,230 --> 00:55:03,540
You drew a line

793
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:06,130
between us just now. Right?

794
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:10,450
But...

795
00:55:11,150 --> 00:55:13,060
can I just...

796
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:15,330
ignore that line?

797
00:55:16,190 --> 00:55:17,820
I...

798
00:55:18,710 --> 00:55:21,250
have so much fun when I'm with you.

799
00:55:21,250 --> 00:55:24,170
It excites me and I feel at home.

800
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:26,460
So, I want to share boring, painful,

801
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:28,460
and sad things with you.

802
00:55:29,140 --> 00:55:31,460
That's how much I want to...

803
00:55:32,330 --> 00:55:34,050
get deeply involved in your life—

804
00:55:34,050 --> 00:55:36,570
But I'm saying I don't want that.

805
00:55:39,510 --> 00:55:41,960
Don't you understand what I'm saying?

806
00:55:42,870 --> 00:55:44,180
I do.

807
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:46,820
I know what you dislike and fear, but—

808
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:48,990
You didn't get it.

809
00:55:50,460 --> 00:55:52,890
Then, we can't do this.

810
00:56:16,650 --> 00:56:17,930
Where are you guys going?

811
00:56:17,930 --> 00:56:19,870
There's an agreement ceremony today.

812
00:56:19,870 --> 00:56:21,870
The one that's happening with the renewal project.

813
00:56:21,870 --> 00:56:24,630
Hana City is supporting it generously, right?

814
00:56:24,630 --> 00:56:25,720
Yes.

815
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:29,460
Team Leader and Director did all the prep for it.

816
00:56:31,910 --> 00:56:34,400
 ­  

817
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,890
   

818
00:56:36,890 --> 00:56:37,990
Hello.

819
00:56:37,990 --> 00:56:40,560
Good to see you.

820
00:56:41,570 --> 00:56:43,530
- Have a seat. 
 - Okay.

821
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:49,160
Chairwoman, you should step out for a moment.

822
00:56:57,300 --> 00:57:00,500
We'll kick off the business agreement between

823
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:02,700
Hana City and Yongsung Department Store

824
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:05,030
for global tourism.

825
00:57:05,030 --> 00:57:09,450
Please welcome Hana City's Mayor, Oh Hyeok Su.

826
00:57:17,030 --> 00:57:19,310
Next is...

827
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:21,420
I'm so sorry.

828
00:57:22,650 --> 00:57:25,550
 What? What are they doing? 

829
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:29,540
Just one moment.

830
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:15,780
My name is Ban Ju Yeon.

831
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:17,610
Yes.

832
00:58:17,610 --> 00:58:20,140
This is Yongsung Department Store's strategy team's

833
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:22,830
Director Ban Ju Yeon.

834
00:58:28,550 --> 00:58:39,630


835
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:49,800
   

836
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:52,500
   

837
00:58:54,110 --> 00:58:59,510
♫  The showering stars and the rising moon  ♫

838
00:58:59,510 --> 00:59:02,430
♫  I whisper in the river  ♫

839
00:59:02,430 --> 00:59:04,810
♫  Draw me now  ♫

840
00:59:04,810 --> 00:59:07,810
♫  We glow under the moonlight  ♫

841
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:10,060
♫  The moon goes down  ♫

842
00:59:10,060 --> 00:59:15,580
♫  Even on dark nights, winter days  ♫

843
00:59:15,580 --> 00:59:16,730
♫  It's shining on you  ♫

844
00:59:16,730 --> 00:59:18,980
 Your plan to oust Team Leader Baek Su Jeong. 

845
00:59:18,980 --> 00:59:20,250
 Please withdraw it. 

846
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:23,060
 Team Leader! I missed you so much. 

847
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:24,900
 But under one condition. 

848
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:27,810
 The renewal project must become a success. 

849
00:59:27,810 --> 00:59:30,050
 Don't try to be responsible for everything. 

850
00:59:30,050 --> 00:59:31,950
 We agreed to lean on each other 

851
00:59:31,950 --> 00:59:33,020
 so we aren't lonely. 

852
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:35,900
 They're canceling the renewal performance. 

853
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:37,600
 The opening is around the corner. 

854
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:40,930
 If you fail, you'll lose everything. 

855
00:59:40,930 --> 00:59:42,520
 It's me. 

856
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:44,380
 Black Dragon.
