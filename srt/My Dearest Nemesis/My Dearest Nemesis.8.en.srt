Oh, yeah. That's right.

157
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:53,770
I dated my ex...

158

You were together for a long time.

161

Since we knew each other for a long time,

I thought I knew him well.

163
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,760

00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:15,290

But everyone keeps saying I can't be okay.

171
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:27,100

00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:00,210
Do you still feel that way?

188
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:02,010
If I said yes, would you reject me?

189
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:04,550
Yes, I will.

190
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,680
You rejected me, but you kissed me back.

191
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,750
You should've pushed me away.

192
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:21,400
There's no way I can push you away.

193
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,950
Do you like me that much?

194
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:28,300
This is no good.

195
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:32,470
You'll have to date me seriously.

196
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,700
Follow me back, too.

197
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,710
Don't you want to?

198
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:46,350
I want to.

199
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:48,250
Because I like you.

200
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:15,610
You said you had a meeting. What are you doing here?

201
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:18,210
I have time to see you briefly.

202
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:21,820
- There was no traffic?
- No. I got here fine.

203
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:25,610
Su Jeong.

204
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:27,890
When did you leave the house...

205
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:29,640
Director?

206
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,510
Dad.

207
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:40,730
What brings you here today, Director?

208
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:42,710
Well, the thing is...

209
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,500
How are you, Father?

210
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,930
I'm fine.

211
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:49,440
You saw me yesterday, so you know.

212
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,950
The packages...

213
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:53,870
The packages in my room belong to him.

214
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:55,990
It's the company's confidential documents.

215
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:57,380
I see.

216
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,850
It's because

217
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:01,140
Ms. Baek is an employee I trust the most.

218
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:03,140
That's why I'm storing them in your house.

219
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:05,660
Thank you for letting me.

220
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,980
We're just storing them.

221
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,860
By the way, why...

222
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:13,090
The document I need to check today

223
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:16,060
happened to be here. That's why I'm here.

224
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:22,370
It's the weekend, though.

225
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:28,480
I see.

226
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,720
You're a workaholic, too.

227
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,720
You sure are the leader of Yongsung.

228
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,050
Actually, Su Jeong is a serious workaholic, too.

229
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:41,770
She works late and on the weekends, too.

230
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:43,200
It's unbelievable.

231
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,870
But you must like her because

232
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:47,720
she works so hard.

233
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,560
Yes, I...

234
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,760
like her.

235
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,270
Instead of standing here,

236
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:55,960
why don't you come inside?

237
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,950
- What are you doing, Su Jeong?
- Huh?

238
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:59,980
- W-Why...
- Help him inside.

239
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:02,030
I'll take this out first.

240
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:07,670
It'd be okay, right?

241
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,530
Come on in.

242
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:29,340
This is your room?

243
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,710
Yes.

244
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,370
Toggaengyi.

245
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:47,070
You've been keeping him safe.

246
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:48,750
Of course.

247
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,210
Don't you want the document?

248
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:56,080
You said you were looking for an important document.

249
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,050
Oh, the document.

250
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:00,630
I forgot. I need to find it now.

251
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:03,320
The key is... the key...

252
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,150
It was around here.

253
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,810
It was here somewhere.

254
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:09,790
Where...

255
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:13,150
I found it! The key.

256
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,730
Key point.

257
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:20,590
Come when you're done. I'll cut some fruit.

258
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:22,130
Okay.

259
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,420
Did you find the document?

260
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,730
Yes, I'm looking.

261
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:04,470
You've been trapped in here.

262
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,240
Keep this place safe for me.

263
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,210
You're the smartest one of them all.

264
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:25,160
Everything was stored well.

265
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:33,090
I'm curious about something.

266
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,100
What's this?

267
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:43,600
I-I'm not sure. What could that be...

268
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,690
Dad must be waiting. Come out and eat some fruit.

269
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:55,450
I'm home.

270
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:59,180
- Hey.
- Hey, hey!

271
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,930
G-Get out of here.

272
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:08,310
Please leave.

273
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:20,220
The bathroom doorknob is loose.

274
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,110
It sometimes opens even when it's locked.

275
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:24,640
It had to happen while you were in there.

276
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,120
I should fix it immediately.

277
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,070
I'll fix it later.

278
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:29,600
You must've been startled.

279
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,590
I was, but...

280
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:32,860
it's okay.

281
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:35,730
I didn't lose my dignity as a human.

282
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:37,050
Okay.

283
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:40,350
Have some.

284
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:47,380
Why did you come to our house?

285
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:49,320
He has an important document here.

286
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,520
He came to get it.

287
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,060
An important document?

288
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,480
Why didn't you take it and leave?

289
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,480
Why did you mark your territory?

290
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,210
- Mark my territory?
- You little-

291
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,280
Su Bin,

292
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,940
why are you being rude to the guest?

293
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:12,470
Why didn't you loaf around-

294
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:15,100
in your apartment. Why are you here?

295
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,100
I'm visiting my house.

296
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,540
Stop petting me. My hair is falling out.

297
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:21,630
Director,

298
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:23,610
eat some. Here.

299
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:25,620
It's getting cold.

300
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:28,230
I'm sorry, but I have a meeting.

301
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:29,750
I'll get going now.

302
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,640
Still, just eat one.

303
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:35,230
Okay.

304
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:47,410
I'll get going now.

305
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:49,540
Thank you for inviting me in.

306
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,460
Oh, okay.

307
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:08,920
What are you doing? Stop.

308
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:13,310
Are you two dating already?

309
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:15,120
Why would you invite him here so soon?

310
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,290
That's out of the line.

311
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:18,960
What are you saying? Didn't you hear Dad?

312
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,310
- He was here for a document-
- I know.

313
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:24,050
The fact that he has it here means you're serious.

314
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:25,320
You fooled Dad, too.

315
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,790
You agreed to date secretly or something?

316
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:29,590
- Hey, you-
- Noona,

317
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:31,860
what if you get caught doing this?

318
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:33,760
Dad and I are fine,

319
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,700
but what if your coworkers find out?

320
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:38,680
The Director's family will find out eventually.

321
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,670
He might be sincere,

322
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:43,490
but his family wouldn't like you.

323
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:45,280
What if they splash water on you

324
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,440
and throw an envelope at you?

325
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,520
Would you cry and say, "Let us be in love."

326
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,480
Like that?

327
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,400
Have you been watching dramas instead of studying?

328
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,980
We're not dating, I said.

329
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:59,150
That won't happen.

330
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:01,190
And even so,

331
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:03,270
it won't matter.

332
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:06,910
- You're crazy.
- Stop being silly and get out.

333
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:08,300
Okay.

334
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,540
I'm sure you'll figure it out.

335
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:12,630
But Noona,

336
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,780
I really...

337
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:19,700
don't want you to get hurt.

338
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:23,370
I'm worrying about you right now.

339
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:38,100
I'm such a great little brother.

340
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:44,220
Gosh, who'd marry him?

341
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:52,400
Isn't he the successor or something of your company?

342
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,480
You showed me the photo last time.

343
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,930
Daebak. What's he doing here?

344
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:59,040
He must be here to get dessert.

345
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,740
The chaebols eat this dessert?

346
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:09,170
There are too many employees.

347
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:12,650
You said it'd be hard to get.

348
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:15,400
There are so many people in there.

349
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,860
I'm glad I ordered in advance.

350
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,600
Let's get going.

351
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,150
She's arriving in about five minutes.

352
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:26,620
Okay.

353
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,860
Chief Kwon,

354
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,890
you started at Yongsung

355
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:37,690
20 years and three months ago.

356
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,110
As expected.

357
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:42,450
That's exactly right.

358
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,300
In the meantime,

359
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:48,760
my daughter is already in middle school.

360
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:51,150
Time really flies.

361
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:54,390
For that long period of time,

362
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:58,200
you've always been loyal to the Chairwoman.

363
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,290
Must've been possible because you truly respect her.

364
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:03,770
I'm happy that you acknowledge that.

365
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:07,730
But on that day,

366
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:12,150
why did you tell me the Chairwoman was visiting me?

367
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:16,250
You went against her word and helped me. Why?

368
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,790
I didn't know...

369
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:23,450
I was helping you, Director.

370
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:24,830
I didn't want

371
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:28,360
her next appointment to be delayed just in case.

372
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,510
That's why I called you.

373
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,170
But in the end,

374
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:36,390
something happened, and it was delayed.

375
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:39,500
Director.

376
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,670
Yes.

377
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:45,210
I want someone who would continue her vision

378
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:47,880
to become Yongsung's successor.

379
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,360
And I've never met anyone

380
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,770
who resembles her as much as you do.

381
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:54,700
Not yet, at least.

382
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,750
So...

383
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:03,290
I hope you don't disappoint the Chairman anymore.

384
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:07,520
Don't worry.

385
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,590
That won't happen.

386
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:22,090
She's the CEO of Arteta Asia.

387
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:23,350
I'm Ban Ju Yeon.

388
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:26,110
I've wanted to meet you sooner, but here we are.

389
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:27,620
This is...

390
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:30,630
for your daughter.

391
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:33,120
I can't say no to that.

392
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,820
My daughter wanted to try this while in Korea.

393
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:51,900
Here.

394
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,170
Thank you.

395
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:54,950
I'm a bit forgetful.

396
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:57,820
I can help you from now on, right?

397
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:59,500
That sounds good.

398
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,760
I didn't get to ask you yesterday.

399
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,880
You said you don't want a serious relationship.

400
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,260
Why did you change your mind?

401
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,110
Just because.

402
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:15,330
I realized there was no reason not to see you.

403
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:19,000
You like me, and I like you, too.

404
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,980
I just don't want anything complicated.

405
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:26,620
Tied to a relationship, you hope, get disappointed,

406
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:28,120
deceive, and get hurt.

407
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,660
Isn't that awful?

408
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:31,440
If you're happy, that's good.

409
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,460
If you're not, forget it. That's what I want.

410
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:38,440
I thought that'd be possible with you.

411
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:40,890
You're right.

412
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:44,320
You date someone to be happy.

413
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,410
It's here.

414
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:52,100
Yes, I'm about to leave.

415
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,520
How about you, Su Jeong?

416
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,230
I'm also on my way to work.

417
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:59,720
I'll get to see you at work soon.

418
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,850
<i>You know we have to be more careful at work, right?</i>

419
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:04,340
Did you forget?

420
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:07,550
I've practiced hiding my private life my whole life.

421
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:09,550
<i>I keep them guessing.</i>

422
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:12,740
We won't get caught. Don't worry.

423
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,380
But I caught you.

424
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:18,180
That means we were meant to be.

425
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:19,980
<i>You said we were ill-fated.</i>

426
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:22,040
Anyway, you can't let it show.

427
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,130
I won't let it show.

428
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,430
Never.

429
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,380
I won't, either.

430
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:29,210
Never.

431
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,700
Hello, Team Leader.

432
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:41,820
Hello.

433
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,830
Hello.

434
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:17,350
Team Leader.

435
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:21,360
How are things with your blind date?

436
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,400
Did you have a blind date?

437
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,590
- Excuse me?
- You seemed to like him.

438
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:27,250
Really?

439
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:34,050
Deputy Yang, you must be mistaken.

440
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:35,750
I rejected him. Totally.

441
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:38,180
I cut him off completely.

442
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:56,760
I suppose.

443
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:08,890
I guess not just any man would catch your eye.

444
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:11,420
I think an older man would suit you.

445
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:13,700
W-Why...

446
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:17,350
Because you're so sure of yourself,

447
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:19,540
someone older

448
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:21,850
who's generous and gentle would suit you.

449
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:23,330
Yes, yes.

450
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:26,880
And not someone who's too qualified, either.

451
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,230
Why is that?

452
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:29,580
Think about it.

453
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:32,600
He needs to support your career.

454
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,100
If he obsesses over his reputation and success,

455
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,090
it'd be too tiring for you both.

456
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:40,030
Wouldn't it be nice if we were both good at our jobs?

457
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:43,000
I didn't want to say this because it's too obvious.

458
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,490
You know the guy in the cartoon you mentioned?

459
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:49,080
A guy like him who kisses you and says he forgot?

460
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,300
You can't date anyone like him.

461
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,110
That kind of a man is the worst.

462
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,390
Totally the worst.

463
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:55,280
What kind of main guy is that?

464
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:58,250
Don't read cartoons like that. It's bad for you.

465
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:00,120
I know. I know.

466
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,780
To be honest,

467
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:05,240
I just don't want you to date someone at work.

468
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:08,830
I don't want you to quit because of that.

469
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:13,190
Deputy, how could she date anyone at work?

470
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:17,320
She told me that office romance is like hell.

471
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:20,310
Hell at work. Right, Team Leader?

472
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:23,120
- Did I say that?
- Yes, hell at work.

473
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,010
That's good to hear, then.

474
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:27,300
There's no way she'd do that.

475
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,970
Hell?

476
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:31,130
Why did I say that?

477
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,240
Na Na, where's Deputy Yang?

478
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,480
He's been gone for a while.

479
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,960
Oh, he's at the Director's office.

480
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:21,840
Well, Director?

481
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:26,480
Director- Director!

482
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:59,120
Team Leader Baek,

483
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:04,380
who prints and copies like this these days?

484
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,270
It must be tiring.

485
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:07,960
It's for me.

486
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:10,170
It's for you, too.

487
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:13,890
I'll pick it up when you're done.

488
00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:15,290
Okay.

489
00:34:26,890 --> 00:34:28,550
Team Leader,

490
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:30,470
- this...
- Director!

491
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:33,130
How could you have no practical skills?

492
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:35,610
How do you not know how to make copies?

493
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:40,880
Look. Feed the paper like this,

494
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,680
press the button,

495
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,620
and the paper comes out.

496
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:48,260
The letters are black, and the paper is white.

497
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:50,030
Go ahead and approve it.

498
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,360
Go.

499
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,630
Okay.

500
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:00,370
How will he survive in this world?

501
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:10,280
Team Leader, are you the Director Killer again?

502
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,820
He's still the successor.

503
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:16,710
He still needs to know how to make copies.

504
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:18,340
He doesn't know how to do that?

505
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:21,320
No wonder. He didn't know how to shred, either.

506
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:24,090
I had a hard time since he held onto me all morning.

507
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:26,270
Did he do that to you, too?

508
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:29,530
- Yes.
- Geez.

509
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:32,090
What a strange guy.

510
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:45,470
I was spooked earlier.

511
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:48,430
You know I wasn't actually yelling at you, right?

512
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,880
I know how to make copies.

513
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:54,440
I did it a lot when I was an intern and secretary.

514
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,040
I know. I know.

515
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:59,050
There's nothing you can't do, Director.

516
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:04,170
So, you get it.

517
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:09,200
My stomach...

518
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,300
Yell at me right now.

519
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,530
Say you were upset earlier.

520
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:14,590
Yell at me and scold me.

521
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,700
How would you explain why we're here, then?

522
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:20,350
But still, how could I yell at you?

523
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:22,220
You used to be good at it.

524
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:23,920
Are they fighting again?

525
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,680
They seem close, too.

526
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,240
Seriously.

527
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:31,270
Director!

528
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:34,400
A boss shouldn't be offended by stuff like that.

529
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,950
You become a good boss by taking criticism.

530
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:41,050
Understand? I asked if you understand.

531
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:44,240
Here we go again.

532
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,180
I'm witnessing the legend right now, right?

533
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:49,740
Let's go downstairs before we get mixed up.

534
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,850
Yes. I think we'd better.

535
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:03,290
The office is dangerous. Let's hurry back.

536
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:05,050
You're...

537
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:07,760
too good at improvising.

538
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,790
Way too good.

539
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:12,410
I had no choice.

540
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:14,780
I was just pretending.

541
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:16,800
Are your feelings hurt?

542
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:20,490
Why are you so good at getting angry?

543
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:23,320
Do you get angry when you see me?

544
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,820
Why? Because I'm not older than you,

545
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:28,270
and I'm not the caring type?

546
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:30,350
Why worry about a comment like that?

547
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:31,630
No.

548
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:35,340
Didn't you prefer an older man, too?

549
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:38,140
At the farm, you mentioned the age difference.

550
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:39,880
You said I can't be your boyfriend,

551
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:43,120
and you don't think of me as a man.

552
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,970
That's what you said.

553

Why is it in the past tense?

735
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:18,860
Because I can't like it anymore.

736
00:48:20,090 --> 00:48:25,040
Does this have to do with your first love, too?

737
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:29,200
Yes, I suppose.

738
00:48:30,210 --> 00:48:32,000
You must've liked him a lot.

739
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,070
He takes up too much space in your life.

740
00:48:35,070 --> 00:48:37,750
That's how awful it was.

741
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:40,240
You don't have to worry.

742
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:46,770
The past is nothing but the past.

743
00:48:46,770 --> 00:48:48,990
The song is innocent.

744
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:53,950
Start liking it again with me.

745
00:48:57,090 --> 00:48:58,690
Okay.

746
00:49:01,950 --> 00:49:04,590

752
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:33,340
What's so funny?

753
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:39,890
Are you seeing someone?

754
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:42,450
The menu, please!

755
00:49:42,450 --> 00:49:43,810
The menu is here.

756
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:48,090
I'm not even the Chairwoman. Why try to hide it?

757
00:49:48,090 --> 00:49:49,670
Be honest with me.

758
00:49:49,670 --> 00:49:53,010
I'll always support your relationship.

759
00:49:53,010 --> 00:49:55,080
I fully support it.

760
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:01,200
Look at you.

761
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,420
You aren't denying it.

762
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:04,960
Are you really seeing someone?

763
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,220
- Yes.
- With whom-

764
00:50:07,990 --> 00:50:10,020
Who stole your heart?

765
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:11,850
Don't try to find out too much.

766
00:50:11,850 --> 00:50:13,440
You'd get hurt.

767
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:16,310
Is she pretty?

768
00:50:17,070 --> 00:50:18,290
How low.

769
00:50:18,290 --> 00:50:20,100
I guess she isn't.

770
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,970
You really think so?

771
00:50:26,090 --> 00:50:27,700
She's pretty.

772
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,500
She's pretty.

773
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,110
Everything about...

774
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:35,890
Strawberry is pretty.

775
00:50:38,890 --> 00:50:40,810
Everything about her is pretty.

776
00:50:41,970 --> 00:50:44,720
She really likes me,

777
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:47,300
and I like her, too.

778
00:50:51,150 --> 00:50:53,240
Is it Team Leader Baek Su Jeong?

779
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:59,540
Don't make ridiculous assumptions.

780
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:09,640
I hear the radish kimchi is amazing here.

781
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:12,410
It is Team Leader Baek.

782
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:17,190
The food section is the highlight of this project,

783
00:51:17,190 --> 00:51:19,390
but to boost the sales more,

784
00:51:19,390 --> 00:51:22,130
we have to remodel the Luxury Wing, too.

785
00:51:22,130 --> 00:51:25,890
Since the luxury brands have strong identities,

786
00:51:25,890 --> 00:51:28,490
it's difficult to remodel the interior.

787
00:51:28,490 --> 00:51:30,400
Especially Arteta.

788
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:33,120
If Arteta, the core of Luxury Wing, doesn't change-

789
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:35,380
There's no need to worry.

790
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:37,640
I already met them and took care of it.

791
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:40,190
- Pardon?
- I met with them over the weekend.

792
00:51:40,190 --> 00:51:42,870
I worked on this for a long time.

793
00:51:42,870 --> 00:51:45,030
The client I didn't get to meet at the party

794
00:51:45,030 --> 00:51:47,190
is the CEO of their Asia branch.

795
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:51,940
Since when did you think about this?

796
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:55,270
I've been thinking since the project started.

797
00:51:55,270 --> 00:51:57,500
I needed Arteta to participate to do aggressive PR

798
00:51:57,500 --> 00:52:00,600
and allow for a major image change, too.

799
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:05,500
You're...

800
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:07,800
impressed with me now, aren't you?

801
00:52:09,270 --> 00:52:12,140
- I'm not.
- I think you are.

802
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:15,310
I swear I'm not.

803
00:52:15,310 --> 00:52:17,550
Let's just say you are.

804
00:52:24,870 --> 00:52:27,400
Because I wanted to impress you.

You peeped at me...

816
00:53:02,970 --> 00:53:05,570
when I was undressed at work, too.

817
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:10,600
Do you know how startled I was?

818
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:12,290
You have a dragon tattoo on your back.

819
00:53:12,290 --> 00:53:13,830
You were like a thug...

820
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:15,960
I mean,

821
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:18,540
you were dressed weirdly and talked meanly.

822
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:20,990
Yet you were in the director's office.

823
00:53:22,370 --> 00:53:24,260
I don't like fashion styles like that.

824
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:25,840
I don't want to be anywhere near it.

825
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:27,530
How about now?

826
00:53:29,090 --> 00:53:31,010
I don't care.

827
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:35,770
Because I like you.

828
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,450
Since when did you like me?

829
00:53:40,430 --> 00:53:43,270
- Pardon?
- You must've hated me at first.

830
00:53:43,270 --> 00:53:46,840
What side of me did you start liking?

831
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:51,670
Do you usually ask questions like this so directly?

832
00:53:51,670 --> 00:53:53,000
I don't know what usually happens.

833
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,940
Since this is my first time.

834
00:53:55,950 --> 00:53:57,960
But I want to know.

835
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:01,450
So I can work on it.

836
00:54:01,450 --> 00:54:03,770
So that you'll continue to like me.

837
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:08,120
Hurry.

838
00:54:11,330 --> 00:54:14,410
Come on. Tell me.

839
00:54:20,250 --> 00:54:23,370
I noticed you were good at your job.

840
00:54:23,370 --> 00:54:28,280
And you don't dislike me for being intense.

841
00:54:29,370 --> 00:54:31,700
Can I record this?

842
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:34,520
Why would you record this?

843
00:54:35,770 --> 00:54:37,280
And?

844
00:54:39,030 --> 00:54:40,850
And...

845
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:45,290
your password is funny.

846
00:54:45,290 --> 00:54:49,440
I started finding you a bit cute.

847
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:50,680
What did you say?

848
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:54,170
It was supposed to be cool, not cute.

849
00:54:54,170 --> 00:54:56,870
Say that again. Did you call me cute just now?

850
00:54:56,870 --> 00:54:57,870
Not cool?

851
00:54:57,870 --> 00:55:00,310
Come on. You can be cute, too.

852
00:55:00,310 --> 00:55:02,170
No.

853
00:55:02,170 --> 00:55:04,050
I'll give you another chance.

854
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:05,400
You're cute.

855
00:55:06,290 --> 00:55:08,230
You're cute.

856
00:55:12,610 --> 00:55:15,880
That was a long report.

857
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:17,120
Yes.

858
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:19,200
He needs to go on a business trip later.

859
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,820
So, I had to report everything in advance.

860
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:29,440
I suppose. I heard we're setting up

861
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:32,860
a cafe and a stage in the Botanic House.

862
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:36,340
You must've needed time to talk over that.

863
00:55:37,330 --> 00:55:40,300
Yes, that, too.

864
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:41,740
Well, then...

865
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:54,490
Ju Yeon and Su Jeong...

866
00:55:54,490 --> 00:55:56,610
seem to be dating.

867
00:55:59,590 --> 00:56:02,790
Ju Yeon said he started seeing someone.

868
00:56:02,790 --> 00:56:04,920
No matter how much I think,

869
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:08,240
there's no one but Ms. Baek.

870
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:10,730
- If so-
- But...

871
00:56:10,730 --> 00:56:14,090
I think it'd be fine if they kept dating.

872
00:56:14,090 --> 00:56:17,200
What if they find out who each other is?

873
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,810
I'm sure it'd be a huge shock.

874
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:22,120
Since they haven't found out,

875
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:24,730
they might never know.

876
00:56:24,730 --> 00:56:27,170
And Ju Yeon...

877
00:56:27,170 --> 00:56:32,800
finally looks truly happy.

878
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:34,910
I can't bring myself to

879
00:56:37,050 --> 00:56:39,130
break them up.

880
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:51,180
I printed it.

881
00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:53,190
Thank you.

882
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:50,210
[My Other Half]

883
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:54,830
Yes, Director. Are you done with the appointment?

884
00:57:54,830 --> 00:57:57,870
Yes, I'm at the hotel now.

885
00:57:57,870 --> 00:57:59,160

887
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:03,490

888
00:58:03,490 --> 00:58:05,280
We'll meet tomorrow evening.

889
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:08,100
But what if I want to see you right now?

890
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:10,880
Try to hold out.

891
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:16,070
I suppose you don't miss me that much.

892
00:58:16,070 --> 00:58:17,360
<i>You have things to do tomorrow.</i>

893
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:20,370
<i>I don't want you to push it because of me.</i>

894
00:58:20,370 --> 00:58:23,120
Of course, I miss you, too.

895
00:58:26,370 --> 00:58:29,330
There's a comic book I want to read right now.

896
00:58:29,330 --> 00:58:31,610
<i>Its first copy came out in 1996.</i>

897
00:58:31,610 --> 00:58:33,830
You can't even find that on the internet.

- Pardon?
<i>- I can't hold out.</i>

899
00:58:35,570 --> 00:58:37,310
<i>I need to read that right now.</i>

903
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:47,570

904
00:58:50,050 --> 00:58:52,740
All right. I'll find it for you.

905
00:58:52,740 --> 00:58:54,280
Okay.

906
00:59:13,190 --> 00:59:15,560

908
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:43,570
He acted like he didn't like it.

909
00:59:43,570 --> 00:59:46,150
But he kept it so dearly.

910
00:59:47,310 --> 00:59:49,810
Is it kind of ugly?

911
00:59:55,250 --> 00:59:59,220
Where could the comic book be?

912
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:46,750
Su Jeong.

913
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:54,150
Why are you out? I said to come out when I called.

914
01:00:55,510 --> 01:00:57,830
Did you miss me too much?
