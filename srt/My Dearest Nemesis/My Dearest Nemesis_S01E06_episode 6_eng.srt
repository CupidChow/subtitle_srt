1
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:13,410


2
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:16,620
   

3
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:19,450
   

4
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,040
   

5
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,970
   

6
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:26,780
   

7
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:30,950
   

8
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,790
   

9
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:48,100
   

10
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:11,520
He's crazy.

11
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:29,250
 Why did he kiss me? 

12
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,640
 I know he was drunk, but still. 

13
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,170
 No matter how much I think about it, 

14
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:35,790
 there's only one reason. 

15
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:38,340
 It's too late to get the dress dry-cleaned. 

16
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,550
 You should just keep it. 

17
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:42,230
 Pardon? Why? 

18
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:44,280
 I don't need it 

19
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,530
 and it was pretty. 

20
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:48,480
 Because the only one who'd give me 

21
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,360
 chocolate milk is you, Ms. Baek. 

22
00:01:58,610 --> 00:01:59,980
 He... 

23
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,980
 likes me. 

24
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:05,570
 If that's the case, he should just say so.  

25
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:08,510
 Why would he startle me with a sudden kiss? 

26
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:10,980
 How will he see me from now on? 

27
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:13,990
 Gosh. Since when did he like me? 

28
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:16,000
 Was it... 

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,990
 from the beginning? 

30
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,460
Geez.

31
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:28,450
I stayed up all night.

32
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:50,320
Well...

33
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,510
You're up early.

34
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:56,840
I couldn't sleep well.

35
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,860
You couldn't sleep?

36
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,590
No.

37
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:01,670
As you'd expect.

38
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:04,800
 As expected, he was too flustered to sleep. 

39
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,070
 How could he sleep after doing such a thing? 

40
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:10,400
I tend to be picky with where I sleep.

41
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,180
 An obvious excuse. Fine. 

42
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:16,180
Oh, I see.

43
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:19,450
You're the one who woke up early.

44
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:21,830
Did you not sleep well?

45
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:23,380
Me?

46
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,530
Well, no, I slept really well.

47
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:30,440
I'm a morning person, an "early bird," always working hard.

48
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,650
An early bird...

49
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:35,580
By chance,

50
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:42,420
would you like to join me for a walk?

51
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:45,040
Where?

52
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:49,610
There's a nice place over there.

53
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:52,420
 Why go to a nice place? 

54
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,110
 Will he confess his love? 

55
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:56,750
 He's confessing just like this? 

56
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:00,510
   

57
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,300
 Gosh, what should I say? 

58
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:09,870
 He won't give me a hard time at work for saying no, right? 

59
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:14,070
 Why does he like me and make things difficult? 

60
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:16,960
- So— 
 - I'll give it a thought first.

61
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,400
Pardon?

62
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:23,230
Pardon?

63
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,580
It's over there.

64
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,390
Oh no...

65
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:33,340
He even chose a place to confess.

66
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,450
Aren't you coming?

67
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:41,380
I'm coming. Coming.

68
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:43,880
   

69
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,790
 He'll confess at a place like this? 

70
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:50,870
Is this the nice place?

71
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,050
Yes.

72
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:54,480
This is the spring CEO An mentioned yesterday.

73
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:58,500
The water is tasty and it's good for a hangover.

74
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:01,380
   

75
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,210
It does taste good.

76
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:10,240
Did we come here to drink spring water?

77
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,700
Why else would you come here?

78
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,110
Yes.

79
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:20,260
There's no need to rush it.

80
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,660
You should try some, too.

81
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,930
You came this far.

82
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,490
I should. I came this far.

83
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,140
We're in it together.

84
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:34,580
Should we say cheers?

85
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:49,030
It's cooling and sweet, right?

86
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:53,940
Yes, it's very invigorating.

87
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,270
Would you like more?

88
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:57,740
No, I can get it—

89
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,570
Well...

90
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,400
The thing is...

91
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,660
Pardon?

92
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,980
This is no good.

93
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:34,960
There...

94
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,680
There's an annoying leaf here.

95
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,540
This is no good.

96
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:41,620
No surroundings should be short of perfect for Yongsung's successor.

97
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,280
Let's go now.

98
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,210
Wait...

99
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:46,930
What?

100
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:50,700
Does he think this is a bathroom?

101
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:54,210
You made the right decision, CEO An.

102
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:57,220
You said you'd think about it, but here we are.

103
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,180
Thank you for changing your mind.

104
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,400
I'll make sure to pay you the margin.

105
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,100
We'll do our best to treat the customers well.

106
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,380
It's okay. It's okay.

107
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:08,070
I'll talk to the employees first

108
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,300
and sign the contract later.

109
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:14,320
Gosh. Of course, they'll follow your decision.

110
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,340
On behalf of the Yongsung Department Store,

111
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:19,400
I'll make sure you don't regret the decision.

112
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,790
This is how silly he is.

113
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:27,670
He was a scholarship student.

114
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:29,930
He is so devoted to the company.

115
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:32,220
Hey, you're acting like the CEO.

116
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,190
Stop acting cheeky.

117
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,770
Ms. Baek.

118
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:38,410
How dare you call your older sister that—

119
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:39,780
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

120
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:42,630
You're the grandson of the Yongsung chairwoman.

121
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:45,030
He's basically the CEO.

122
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,550
 I figured you would go to the spring yourself rather than asking someone. 

123
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:57,510
 So, I got some for you. 

124
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:00,200
 I get that you don't want to disappoint your grandson, 

125
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,410
 but you should use your subordinates sometimes. 

126
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:04,140
 Considering your age, 

127
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,370
 you might hurt your back. 

128
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:08,450
 Listen to you. 

129
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:10,740
 I take back the compliment. 

130
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:14,010
 Do you think I'd be moved by this and sign a contract? 

131
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:15,850
 Of course not. 

132
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:20,460
 I'm not that naive. 

133
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,500
   

134
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,200
 I wish you kept it a secret until the end. 

135
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,780
 Why are you revealing yourself now? 

136
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:34,120
 We need to trust each other to work together. 

137
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,190
 I'm sorry I couldn't tell you from the beginning. 

138
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:39,310
 That's how much I wanted you to hear me out. 

139
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,830
 Chairwoman Jeong... 

140
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:44,270
 cares more about the company than herself. 

141
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:47,060
 She can do anything for Yongsung. 

142
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:51,360
 She knows corporations benefit from a better society. 

143
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,500
 As her grandson, 

144
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,460
 I'm carrying out my grandmother's will. 

145
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,460
 If you sign with us, through the foundation, 

146
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,650
 we'll invest in Ganghan Farm's hospital charity 

147
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:08,260
 and the construction of the ice cream factory. 

148
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,500
 Do you mean that? 

149
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,990
 Yes. 

150
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,700
 I want those children to be healthy like your grandson someday. 

151
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,960
 I mean everything. 

152
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,440
   

153
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,660
Director said that?

154
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:33,280
Yes. As you said, if it had gone to someone else anyway,

155
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:36,560
it'd be better if I spent the profit well.

156
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,180
I'd be happy if you'd do all that.

157
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,760
Yes.

158
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:46,310
We'll get going now, then.

159
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:49,370
Okay. Right, take this with you.

160
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:51,280
These are our products

161
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,920
and I packed some doraji and godeulbbaegi.

162
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,750
I saw you enjoying them yesterday.

163
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,230
- Take them. 
 - Me?

164
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:02,080
Of course. You both liked them.

165
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,220
Take this, too.

166
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:15,070
It was worth coming this far.

167
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,980
The suggestion you made to CEO An...

168
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:22,260
Since when did you think about doing that?

169
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:26,460
You're the one who made me come up with the idea.

170
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,170
You made me come this far.

171
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:06,850
Last night...

172
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:08,360
Yes?

173
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:13,160
So, last night...

174
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:15,580
 Last night. 

175
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,010
 Oh, my gosh! 

176
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:19,540
 Will he finally tell me now? 

177
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:25,940
Are you hot? I have the AC on.

178
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:28,700
No, I'm okay.

179
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,300
I'm all ready. Tell me.

180
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,310
Ready for what?

181
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:47,270
You worked hard last night.

182
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,420
Is that it?

183
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,410
And if you're all right with it...

184
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:57,220
All right with what?

185
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,030
If you're all right with it, would you like to

186
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:03,900
listen to my music?

187
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:10,100
Yes.

188
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,810
Sure, go ahead.

189
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:21,210
Play the song I was listening to.

190
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:26,280
 I'll play Crackshot's "Follow Me." 

191
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:33,740
♫  Follow, follow, follow, follow me  ♫

192
00:13:53,300 --> 00:14:00,120
♫  I've been watching you for a long time  ♫

193
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:03,800
♫  It's okay to be awkward  ♫

194
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:07,870
♫  Let's give ourselves to the music  ♫

195
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:13,130
♫  Everything cools down when the morning comes  ♫

196
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:16,920
♫  The Green Light that illuminates us  ♫

197
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:20,150
 When will he talk to me, anyway? 

198
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,990
♫  Like this. It's so hot  ♫

199
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:24,790
♫  Tonight, it's party time  ♫

200
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:29,390
♫  Follow, follow, follow, follow me  ♫

201
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:47,850
I'll let you go in now.

202
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:52,110
Will you really leave like this?

203
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:56,480
I forgot something important.

204
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:14,380
That's it, right?

205
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,160
See you on Monday.

206
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,220
What do you mean, that's it?

207
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:22,330
What happened last night. Will you...

208
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:24,500
Will you just let it slide?

209
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:28,100
You should explain yourself or something.

210
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,930
It's already in the past. Is it necessary?

211
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,540
Let's not make a big deal out of a mistake.

212
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:35,350
Mistake?

213
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:39,870
Yes, a mistake we made while we were drunk.

214
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:42,480
Wasn't it the same to you?

215
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:47,500
It was.

216
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,130
Mistake.

217
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:51,560
It was a mistake and an accident.

218
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,080
I'm not that crazy of a person.

219
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,340
As you know,

220
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:59,730
I don't think of you as a man at all.

221
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:04,460
Why are you suddenly saying that?

222
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:06,340
Did I beg you to think of me as a man?

223
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,070
I would've forgiven you if you begged.

224
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,660
What?

225
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,510
I look manly.

226
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,570
He's crazy.

227
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:32,280
A big deal out of a mistake?

228
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:35,930
He kisses girls when he's drunk. He's the player.

229
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:49,690
Why is she angry, exactly?

230
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:12,120
 The makgeolli. 

231
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:15,180
 It doesn't go well with me. 

232
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,370
I fell asleep waiting for her call.

233
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:24,530
She left me alone that night.

234
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:30,550
Am I not the one who should be angry?

235
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,150
Su Jeong.

236
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:50,230
Su Jeong?

237
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:52,900
Hey, Dad. Did you call me?

238
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,480
You skipped dinner. What are you doing?

239
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,070
The door is acting up.

240
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,500
You don't even use it.

241
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,530
I'm just...

242
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:03,020
a bit angry,

243
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:05,950
but I can't blast someone's head.

244
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,390
Why?

245
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:10,290
Is it noisy? Should I stop?

246
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:12,540
No, no. It's okay. Go ahead.

247
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,250
Do whatever you want to do, sweetheart.

248
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,580
Okay.

249
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,060
Yes, I'm the same.

250
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:51,290
I was drunk by the alcohol and atmosphere and ki—

251
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:55,150
That's no big deal.

252
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:59,220
It was just a mistake of one night.

253
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,340
Yes.

254
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:05,700
Mistake?

255
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:13,380
Shouldn't he apologize if he made a mistake?

256
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,750
- Yes. 
  - How can you sleep right now? 

257
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,890
Ms. Baek?

258
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,640
Is something going on at work?

259
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,240
Something's going on with us two.

260
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,680
I just can't believe what's going on.

261
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:57,050
 What happened yesterday... I mean, the day before. 

262
00:19:57,050 --> 00:20:00,800
Can you just call it a mistake and move on?

263
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,220
What should I call it, then?

264
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:06,630
I'm being understanding. Why are you angry?

265
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:10,540
- You're being understanding? 
  - Yes. 

266
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:14,200
You drank makgeolli by mistake and we spent the night at the farm.

267
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,690
 I'm letting it go because it was a mistake. 

268
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:19,220
I'm being understanding. Very much so.

269
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:21,400
That's not what I'm talking about.

270
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,460
 Are you talking about that, then? 

271
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,300
Is it because you feel bad?

272
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,680
Apologize if you feel bad.

273
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,840
Don't get angry.

274
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,940
Seriously.

275
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:33,380
Are you telling me to apologize?

276
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,930
Should I, then?

277
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:38,070
You should since you disappeared while drinking together.

278
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,280
 How could you leave someone who fell asleep waiting for you? 

279
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,340
 I was so shocked when I woke up. 

280
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:46,130
I was cold, achy, and the bugs...

281
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:47,610
 It was unbelievable. 

282
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:49,700
 That's why I couldn't sleep well. 

283
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:50,870
Forget it.

284
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:54,080
I'll be understanding and let this go, too.

285
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:57,380
 Or did something else happen? 

286
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,450
Nothing happened.

287
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:14,280
He doesn't...

288
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:17,390
remember.

289
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:34,680
 He's not a man. He's the same age as Su Bin. 

290
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:37,090
 How could I think of him as a man? 

291
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:40,050
Thinking now, she said that back then, too.

292
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:43,210
On top of treating me like a little brother all day.

293
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,960
But why?

294
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,490
Why doesn't she think of me as a man?

295
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:02,180
One million and twenty-one.

296
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,600
She doesn't think of me as a man.

297
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,960
One million and twenty-two.

298
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:10,570
- She doesn't... 
 - One million and twenty-three.

299
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:16,940
She doesn't think of me...

300
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:22,220
You finally reached a million after three years.

301
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,860
You worked very hard.

302
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:26,250
One million and twenty-four.

303
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:27,490
Let's count from the beginning.

304
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:29,260
My next goal is two years.

305
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:31,120
Two years.

306
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,160
She doesn't think of me as a man.

307
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:43,610
- One. 
 - She doesn't think of me as a man.

308
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:11,340
Why doesn't she think of me as a man?

309
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:15,560
Do I need to know what it means to be a man?

310
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:25,860
Chief Kwon,

311
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:28,490
you met your husband at your previous job.

312
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,310
He's a year younger than you.

313
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:32,950
Y-Yes, so?

314
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:37,500
When did you start...

315
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,630
thinking of him as a man?

316
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:47,570
Well, he was good at his job and...

317
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:49,860
I'm already perfect at that.

318
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:52,990
He spent money generously on me.

319
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:54,970
That's too easy.

320
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:57,550
Is that it?

321
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:59,040
He was very thoughtful.

322
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:03,260
Yes, that was the biggest factor.

323
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:06,430
I already do that, too.

324
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:10,790
But that was out of the blue.

325
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:16,080
You never asked me any personal questions.

326
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,420
Did something happen over...

327
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:21,980
the weekend?

328
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:26,850
It was a professional question.

329
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:30,880
Knowing you well is a part of my job, too.

330
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,390
Anyway, that's what you liked about him.

331
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:38,010
It's simple.

332
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,880
 He was good at his job and... 

333
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,020
 He spent money generously on me. 

334
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,480
 He was very thoughtful. 

335
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:55,710
 Yes, that was the biggest factor. 

336
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:24,890
Let's all check ourselves in the mirror.

337
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:31,560
   

338
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:45,010
It's a shame just to use it as a lounge area.

339
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:49,620
Wouldn't it have a bigger role in attracting new customers?

340
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:53,330
Yes, it'd be a shame not to utilize it.

341
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:57,560
Wow. You really have a good sense, Director.

342
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:01,510
What do you think, Team Leader Baek?

343
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,000
It sounds like a good idea.

344
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,700
I'll think about how we could use it.

345
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,300
Sounds good.

346
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,540
You haven't had lunch yet, right?

347
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:11,050
Pardon?

348
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,970
Yes.

349
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:17,240
Let's go to the Yongsung Hotel next door, then.

350
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:29,210
You have the renewal project on top of everything.

351
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:31,120
You're all working a lot.

352
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,580
I'll treat you to today's lunch for that reason.

353
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:39,770
This is Yongsung Hotel's pride, the S-class Buffet.

354
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:42,180
Thank you.

355
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:43,620
Help yourselves, everyone.

356
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:45,040
 Thank you. 

357
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,790
Thank you.

358
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:52,730
I prepared a lobster dish per person.

359
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:07,970
How much does all this cost?

360
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:09,750
It's at least 100,000 won per person.

361
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:12,390
He really must be the chairwoman's grandson.

362
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:15,670
He's using the chefs like his personal chefs.

363
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:18,410
Geez, and he works hard, too?

364
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:22,040
Gosh, I desperately want to get involved with him.

365
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:25,440
He'll be more popular than Chief Kim from the design team.

366
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,380
I know.

367
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,790
I thought Director Ban was unfriendly.

368
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:53,550
But he knows how to do this, too.

369
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:56,640
He seems like a workaholic who doesn't date.

370
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:01,360
Whoever gets him would be striking gold. Right?

371
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,700
Why are you suddenly telling me that?

372
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:07,560
You agree with each other often and you seem to get along.

373
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,980
I wondered if you were seeking a class upgrade.

374
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,290
I didn't think you were that type.

375
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:15,290
Of course, I'm not that type.

376
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:17,980
The director is just a boss to me.

377
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:21,970
I never considered him as a boyfriend or husband.

378
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:25,400
You can consider me, then.

379
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:31,180
You're the strategy team leader.

380
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:34,230
But you lack creativity.

381
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:46,080
 Enjoy. 

382
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,790
 Enjoy. 

383
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:49,540
Thank you, Director.

384
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:52,500
 Enjoy. 

385
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:58,340
Lack creativity?

386
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:01,260
He should worry about his memory.

387
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,400
- Yes, Unni. 
  - Can you talk? 

388
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,260
Nothing happened last weekend, right?

389
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:11,340
- Like what? 
 - I was wondering

390
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:14,410
if anything happened on the way home with your director.

391
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,660
Of course not.

392
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:20,130
Nothing would happen with that shitty, stupid player.

393
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:22,460
You said he didn't seem bad.

394
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:24,030
Are you back to normal now?

395
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:26,330
I added the "shitty, stupid" part.

396
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:28,660
What? Is that why you called?

397
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:30,040
No.

398
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,130
Do you want to go on a blind date?

399
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:34,560
 There's a great match for you. 

400
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,780
He's older and he's a lawyer.

401
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,960
 He's understanding, dependable, and sweet. 

402
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,380
He's totally your type.

403
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:43,080
You'd better not say no.

404
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,870
Think about it.

405
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:46,650
Hey!

406
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,470
You! You! You little brat!

407
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:51,920
You go on a date instead.

408
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,880
Seriously! Gosh.

409
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,260
You little...

410
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,420
It hurts! I said I don't want to.

411
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,320
You're so immature.

412
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:02,350
That's why you divorced as soon as you married.

413
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:06,170
You're the same. You two. Seriously...

414
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:08,090
Why suddenly a blind date?

415
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:09,890
Team Leader.

416
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:11,720
Are you going on a blind date?

417
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,160
Great idea, Team Leader.

418
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,320
How old is he?

419
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,550
What's his occupation? Hold on.

420
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:18,050
He can't just have any job to be your match.

421
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:20,750
Is he handsome? He's tall, too. Right? How tall is he?

422
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:23,430
You need to check without shoes.

423
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:25,820
I haven't decided. I don't know yet—

424
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:27,490
Who's going on a blind date?

425
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:29,720
Team Leader is.

426
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,690
Is that true?

427
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:36,860
I asked if it was true.

428
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:39,260
Why do you want to know?

429
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:41,740
D-Don't worry, Director.

430
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:45,670
She won't slack off just because she's dating.

431
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:47,910
- Right? 
 - Director.

432
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:50,490
The chairwoman wants to see you.

433
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:52,160
Team Leader Baek,

434
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,980
talk to me briefly before you leave for the day.

435
00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:01,340
He looked happy earlier. How strange.

436
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:13,750
Congratulations.

437
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:18,640
The dream of your life will come true soon.

438
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:23,110
She told us to completely expose you to the media.

439
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:26,130
She's trying to make you the official successor.

440
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:29,610
I thought she'd wait for the renewal result.

441
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:31,370
It's sooner than I thought.

442
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:34,680
I think she's preparing ahead since it's going well.

443
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:37,970
Actually, when I was reporting to her,

444
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:40,490
she asked me about you.

445
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:42,340
What I thought watching you closely.

446
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:46,320
She asked if you're only focusing on work.

447
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:51,920
Since Yongsung is her life,

448
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:55,400
she wants the successor to be the same.

449
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:59,020
So, what did you tell her?

450
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:01,090
I told her the truth.

451
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:04,800
That no one focuses only on work like you.

452
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:08,270
You can just keep doing what you've been doing.

453
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:10,090
I guess so.

454
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:26,100
 I was thinking you and I are similar. 

455
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:39,280
 The director is just a boss to me. 

456
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:43,250
 I never considered him as a boyfriend or husband. 

457
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:47,800
 I hope I don't get disappointed. 

458
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,180
 Like I was before. 

459
00:32:55,250 --> 00:33:00,530
I wasted time on silly stuff.

460
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:04,940
Wake up, Ban Ju Yeon.

461
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:08,410
Don't make another mistake.

462
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:17,450
It's well summarized.

463
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,700
That's it for the day.

464
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,920
Thank you.

465
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:24,800
Aren't you going home, Team Leader?

466
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,580
I'll stop by the director's office first.

467
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,110
Huh?

468
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:31,750
He won't yell at you about the blind date, right?

469
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:33,810
No way. It must be something else.

470
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:36,010
Right. Doesn't sound right.

471
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:38,570
Unless he's interested in you. Yes.

472
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:39,640
Right?

473
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:44,630
Yes. I'll get going now, then.

474
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:46,260
See you.

475
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,820
Jun Su!

476
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:49,980
Jun Su!

477
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:51,630
Jun Su.

478
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,660
Can I help you with something?

479
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:57,660
A man...

480
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:01,730
visited a woman late to warn her about a womanizer. Why would he do that?

481
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:02,950
He's interested.

482
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:05,080
And getting angry because I don't see him as a man?

483
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,070
- It's 100%. 
 - How about kissing while drunk?

484
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:08,580
And he forgot about it.

485
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:12,000
This isn't about you, right?

486
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,300
No, it isn't.

487
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:16,340
I'm talking about an anime. A romance anime.

488
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:18,520
I read it recently.

489
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:21,680
I can't understand the male lead's psychology.

490
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:25,330
I was wondering if you can.

491
00:34:25,890 --> 00:34:28,170
Do you read anime, too? Are we having a pop-up?

492
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:29,350
You think I always work?

493
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:30,450
Of course not.

494
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:33,440
Your hobby is self-improvement. That's why.

495
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,770
Never mind, then.

496
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:39,580
By the way,

497
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:40,740
it's too obvious.

498
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:43,370
It's a cliche. A cliche.

499
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:45,400
The fact that he kissed.

500
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,530
He couldn't have actually forgotten.

501
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:49,950
He's pretending like he did.

502
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:52,390
Why is he pretending to have forgotten?

503
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:53,760
In case he gets rejected.

504
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,300
Male leads don't have the courage to speak first.

505
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,280
That's just how it is.

506
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:01,750
You can go home.

507
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:04,810
Okay. See you.

508
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:16,420
No wonder. I knew something was strange.

509
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:19,330
I didn't think he was like this.

510
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:22,200
But he had no courage, huh?

511
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:30,070
Come in.

512
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:39,490
You wanted to see me before I left.

513
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:45,120
What is it?

514
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:48,690
Are you concerned that I'm going on a blind date?

515
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:50,310
You want to stop me from dating?

516
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:55,310
No. As Deputy Yang said, dating won't stop you from working hard.

517
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:57,170
I'm not concerned.

518
00:35:57,170 --> 00:35:59,960
It's none of my business as your boss either.

519
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:06,060
You can just be honest.

520
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:09,610
How could I be more honest?

521
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:11,120
Pardon?

522
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,460
Then...

523
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:17,790
why did you come all the way to my house?

524
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:19,740
You told me not to date Chief Kim.

525
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:22,410
Because you really have to watch out for players.

526
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:23,970
So, I was warning you.

527
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:25,610
Anyone would've stopped you.

528
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:28,560
I was just being nice. Don't get the wrong idea.

529
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:33,350
The chairwoman praised you for signing with the Ganghan Farm.

530
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:35,750
You'll hear good news during the salary negotiation.

531
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:38,410
You'll receive a bonus, too.

532
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:40,900
That's what I wanted to tell you.

533
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:46,680
Aren't you happy?

534
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:49,730
You said money makes you happy instantly.

535
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:53,630
I'm happy.

536
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:57,810
Thank you.

537
00:36:57,810 --> 00:37:00,080
You can leave.

538
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:16,830
Am I mistaken?

539
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:22,780
Does this mean I got it all mixed up?

540
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:25,930
   

541
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:52,810
 You must kiss people to be nice. 

542
00:37:52,810 --> 00:37:54,640
 - Kiss? 
 - Yes. 

543
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,750
 You got drunk and kissed me. 

544
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:58,010
 Am I still mistaken? 

545
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:00,380
 Didn't you confuse me? 

546
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:04,090
 I apologize if I did. 

547
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:06,620
 He's apologizing now? 

548
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:08,370
 But... 

549
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:11,890
 should you be so angry about that? 

550
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:15,660
 - Pardon? 
 - By chance, did you... 

551
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:18,930
 enjoy that kiss? 

552
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:43,290
What's going on?

553
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:48,870
This. I wanted to give it back.

554
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,290
What's the money for?

555
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:52,900
Think of it as a rental fee.

556
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,930
Although I didn't want it.

557
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,950
And don't ever recommend cartoons like this to me.

558
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:00,660
It's so childish.

559
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:04,260
You learned about relationships this way. No wonder you got dumped by your first love.

560
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:06,400
If an adult keeps reading stuff like this,

561
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,860
you'd keep getting dumped.

562
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:10,380
You'd get dumped forever.

563
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:12,020
I didn't tell you that to be mocked like this.

564
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:13,690
I'm also warning you to be nice.

565
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:15,450
I'm being nice.

566
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:18,380
Take it.

567
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:22,400
I don't want money from someone who doesn't understand its value.

568
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,820
You're the one who should improve your taste.

569
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,920
Because you have such poor taste,

570
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:32,090
isn't that why you got scammed by your first love?

571
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:49,660
The kiss?

572
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:51,390
I didn't like it.

573
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:54,690
I didn't like it. There's no way I did!

574
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:11,890
   

575
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:15,690
   

576
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:17,900
 - Unni.  
 - Yes, Su Jeong.

577
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:21,990
I want to go on that blind date.

578
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:23,480
What?

579
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,940
You want to go on a blind date?

580
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:26,700
Yes.

581
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:34,180
At this rate,

582
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:37,330
I don't think they'll grow any closer.

583
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:41,590
She's back to the boss-hating employee again.

584
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:44,230
We won't have to worry anymore.

585
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:47,590
I would've done nothing if I had known.

586
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:51,270
Ms. Baek is going to hate me for no reason.

587
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:52,410
 ­  

588
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:54,440
Anyway, it's a relief.

589
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:57,060
They won't get hurt again.

590
00:40:57,060 --> 00:41:00,050
But why have you been working here since earlier?

591
00:41:00,050 --> 00:41:02,600
You followed me to the market last time.

592
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:05,620
Using this as an excuse, I wanted to help

593
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:07,440
and gain brownie points from you.

594
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,350
What would you want brownie points from me?

595
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:15,360
Did you forget I confessed my feelings to you?

596
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,190
Oh, that?

597
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:19,780
Did you forget I said no?

598
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:22,950
They say the third time is the charm.

599
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:26,140
I thought you were cooler than this.

600
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:31,180
I thought I was, too.

601
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:36,580
If that's why you come here, I find it uncomfortable.

602
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:39,040
Did you like it that much that day?

603
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:42,250
Of course, I liked it, too.

604
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:46,080
I think I could sleep with you again.

605
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:48,450
But not three times.

606
00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:51,760
It'd feel like we're something, then.

607
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:56,110
I don't want that.

608
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:58,730
What do you want to do?

609
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:09,330
Oppa.

610
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:21,940
Why did you come all the way here?

611
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:24,180
Because I couldn't reach you.

612
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:25,810
Oppa,

613
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:27,870
I'm so sorry.

614
00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:31,810
I must've been crazy that day. I know you're friendly and sweet.

615
00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:34,470
I got jealous because I like you so much.

616
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:39,070
And you suggested breaking up so easily?

617
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:41,850
- Huh? 
 - Eun Hee,

618
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:44,970
you date someone to be happy.

619
00:42:44,970 --> 00:42:47,920
To be happier as two than alone.

620
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:52,130
But you felt jealous and anxious being with me.

621
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:55,740
You think I was happy seeing you like that?

622
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,330
I won't be like that anymore.

623
00:43:00,130 --> 00:43:02,700
Please reconsider just once.

624
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:04,150
Please?

625
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:10,540
When you said you liked me,

626
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:12,820
I didn't check twice.

627
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:14,350
It's the same with the breakup.

628
00:43:14,350 --> 00:43:16,700
If it was off once, it's off.

629
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:19,870
And don't come to see me like this again.

630
00:43:19,870 --> 00:43:21,980
It makes me feel uncomfortable.

631
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,470
Oppa.

632
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:28,210
Oppa!

633
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:43,540
   

634
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:49,690
Yes.

635
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:52,790
If it was off once, it's off.

636
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:54,790
This isn't like me.

637
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:25,320
Are you Mr. Yun Ji Wu?

638
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:27,320
Yes, I'm Yun Ji Wu.

639
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:28,870
You're Su Jeong, right?

640
00:44:28,870 --> 00:44:30,920
Yes, I am.

641
00:44:32,270 --> 00:44:34,020
Have a seat.

642
00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:39,930
I'm sorry. I'm a bit late.

643
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:43,690
Three minutes is nothing.

644
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:46,020
Thanks to that, I was practicing smiling

645
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:48,210
trying to relax.

646
00:44:48,890 --> 00:44:51,050
You haven't eaten yet, right?

647
00:44:51,050 --> 00:44:52,400
I asked for recommendations

648
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:56,340
and they suggested the lobster pasta.

649
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:58,950
Oh, lobster?

650
00:44:58,950 --> 00:45:02,950
 I prepared a lobster dish per person. 

651
00:45:05,450 --> 00:45:07,870
Do you not like it or...

652
00:45:07,870 --> 00:45:09,990
are you allergic?

653
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:12,220
No, I like it.

654
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:14,150
Should we get this?

655
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:15,530
Yes.

656
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:17,820
Excuse me.

657
00:45:20,870 --> 00:45:23,440
♫  You and me  ♫

658
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:28,770
♫  That one day we met  ♫

659
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:34,390
♫  I'm standing in front of you like this  ♫

660
00:45:34,390 --> 00:45:39,560
♫  And you're looking at me  ♫

661
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:43,070
 You learned about relationships this way. 

662
00:45:43,070 --> 00:45:45,080
 No wonder you got dumped by your first love. 

663
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:47,060
 If an adult keeps reading stuff like this, 

664
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:48,610
 you'd keep getting dumped. 

665
00:45:48,610 --> 00:45:51,810
 You'd get dumped forever. 

666
00:45:51,810 --> 00:45:59,390
♫  Will you acknowledge my heart?  ♫

667
00:45:59,390 --> 00:46:01,320
 Who's going on a blind date? 

668
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:03,470
 Team Leader is. 

669
00:46:03,470 --> 00:46:05,580
 Is that true? 

670
00:46:07,070 --> 00:46:09,340
 I asked if it was true. 

671
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:11,470
 Why do you want to know? 

672
00:46:11,470 --> 00:46:16,700
♫  The showering stars and the round moon  ♫

673
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:20,100
♫  I wish while wondering more  ♫

674
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:23,350
 We both have the worst first loves. 

675
00:46:23,350 --> 00:46:25,260
 Should we say cheers? 

676
00:46:27,850 --> 00:46:29,540
 Cheers. 

677
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:32,890
♫  Even on dark nights, winter days  ♫

678
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:38,140
♫  It's shining on you, tell me now  ♫

679
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:41,160
♫  Our bright night  ♫

680
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:43,760
♫  We stay bright  ♫

681
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:49,600
♫  Stay bright all around  ♫

682
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:56,620
I wonder if a stage

683
00:46:56,620 --> 00:46:58,560
would be good for the lounge area.

684
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,580
If we get a popular artist,

685
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:03,140
it'd help attract new customers.

686
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:06,390
It'd be entertaining to the current customers, too.

687
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:08,260
If we did a live streaming of the show,

688
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:11,210
it'd help with the promotion, too.

689
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:17,760
I'd also like to use it for the renewal project promotion.

690
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,070
Would you be available?

691
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:21,240
Yes, I'd be available.

692
00:47:27,990 --> 00:47:32,650
 Deputy, am I the only one who's cold? 

693
00:47:32,650 --> 00:47:35,630
 No, I'm freezing, too. 

694
00:47:35,630 --> 00:47:37,260
Any other suggestions?

695
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:40,210
- No. 
 - That's all, then.

696
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:12,010
Su Jeong!

697
00:48:23,890 --> 00:48:25,190
Director Ban,

698
00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:27,490
why don't you get in?

699
00:48:48,110 --> 00:48:49,480
You said you could be late.

700
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:51,250
But you're off early.

701
00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:53,850
Yes, thankfully.

702
00:48:53,850 --> 00:48:57,230
Shall we go, then?

703
00:48:57,230 --> 00:48:58,710
Yes.

704
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:06,440
I'll award the plaque of appreciation next.

705
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:10,680
Here's Director Ban Ju Yeon of

706
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:11,910
Yongsung Department Store

707
00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:14,030
who donated the highest amount last year.

708
00:49:14,030 --> 00:49:17,210
Thank you so much for caring for the children

709
00:49:17,210 --> 00:49:20,670
who needs help after losing their families.

710
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:31,200
Next is a performance from the violinist Yu Ri Ah,

711
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:34,440
one of our scholarship students.

712
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:44,160
When did you make time to do something so nice?

713
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:46,970
You're so impressive.

714
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:51,210
Yongsung must have no worries.

715
00:49:51,210 --> 00:49:53,570
You have such a great successor.

716
00:49:53,570 --> 00:49:55,610
Don't you agree?

717
00:49:56,200 --> 00:50:01,190
Of course, Gureum Constructions has him, too.

718
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:04,280
Who said that?

719
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:06,740
- Pardon? 
 - Who said

720
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:10,800
my successor is Director Ban Ju Yeon here?

721
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:14,340
Of course, because he's your only grandson.

722
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:17,600
I raised Yongsung like a child.

723
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:20,760
No one can just become a successor

724
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:23,680
unless they can do as good of a job.

725
00:50:25,890 --> 00:50:29,320
Only my late son could have.

726
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:33,500
For the sake of the company,

727
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:35,000
I'm even considering

728
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,400
hiring a management specialist.

729
00:50:41,710 --> 00:50:43,710
Of course,

730
00:50:43,710 --> 00:50:47,360
Director Ban has been doing a great job.

731
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:50,870
So, I'm thinking of exposing him to the media, too.

732
00:50:50,870 --> 00:50:54,120
I'll let them know he's my grandson, too.

733
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:56,550
Oh, I see.

734
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:59,290
Congratulations.

735
00:51:00,230 --> 00:51:01,770
Thank you.

736
00:51:01,770 --> 00:51:03,720
Once your face is exposed,

737
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:06,990
you'll have to pay more attention to your behavior.

738
00:51:06,990 --> 00:51:08,490
Do you understand?

739
00:51:08,490 --> 00:51:10,180
Yes.

740
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:12,460
I'll keep that in mind.

741
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:29,600
♫  The new sun will rise again today  ♫

742
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:37,100
♫  A different day from yesterday will start  ♫

743
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:42,200
Does the chairwoman allow you to drink?

744
00:51:43,590 --> 00:51:45,820
Hey, what...

745
00:51:46,550 --> 00:51:50,290
You're scary when you stare like that.

746
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:54,160
What? Will you screw me over again?

747
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:59,230
You can't. The chairwoman is still here.

748
00:51:59,230 --> 00:52:01,030
What if you cause trouble

749
00:52:01,030 --> 00:52:03,400
and failed to inherit the company?

750
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:07,500
You've been humoring the old lady all your life cowering yourself at her mercy.

751
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:10,120
Haven't you? Huh?

752
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:11,610
Huh?

753
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:14,990
Hey.

754
00:52:14,990 --> 00:52:18,280
Since I got to see it for the first time in a while,

755
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:21,670
it was such a blast.

756
00:52:21,670 --> 00:52:22,880
Ju Yeon,

757
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:26,250
I realized why you live like such a loser.

758
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:29,540
I suddenly realized it. Really.

759
00:52:31,630 --> 00:52:33,870
You're the loser.

760
00:52:33,870 --> 00:52:36,810
Me? Me?

761
00:52:36,810 --> 00:52:38,070
Why is that?

762
00:52:38,070 --> 00:52:40,590
You don't know how to read the room.

763
00:52:41,550 --> 00:52:44,600
I'm in a terrible mood right now.

764
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:59,040
Oh, no.

765
00:53:00,530 --> 00:53:04,670
The chairwoman also taught me to squash anyone who provokes me.

766
00:53:08,710 --> 00:53:12,080
Didn't you see your father wagging his tail at me?

767
00:53:14,530 --> 00:53:17,490
I'm trying to teach you, but you can't learn.

768
00:53:18,270 --> 00:53:20,520
What am I supposed to do?

769
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:38,830
There's a very famous cafe here.

770
00:53:38,830 --> 00:53:40,290
They're from Italy.

771
00:53:40,290 --> 00:53:42,650
This is the only store that has it.

772
00:53:42,650 --> 00:53:46,260
I know. I've always wanted to try it, too.

773
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:48,190
You should've told me.

774
00:53:48,190 --> 00:53:49,930
This is your workplace.

775
00:53:49,930 --> 00:53:53,300
I didn't think you'd want to come after work.

776
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:54,980
That's not true.

777
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:58,610
Visiting often as a customer helps, too.

778
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:03,160
Even better to hear a real customer's opinions.

779
00:54:04,770 --> 00:54:08,660
Were you here for work, not a date?

780
00:54:09,910 --> 00:54:12,010
I heard their dessert is good, too.

781
00:54:12,010 --> 00:54:13,730
Do you like sweets?

782
00:54:13,730 --> 00:54:18,120
Yes, I eat everything bitter or sweet.

783
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:21,950
You like both.

784
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:25,400
Do you not like that I eat everything?

785
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:27,760
Does it look like I have no taste?

786
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:31,720
No. I like that you aren't picky.

787
00:54:47,230 --> 00:54:48,690
It's so delicious.

788
00:54:48,690 --> 00:54:50,760
I can see why they're famous.

789
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:53,480
I'm glad to hear that.

790
00:54:55,150 --> 00:54:57,200
You're such a great person.

791
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:01,190
I wonder why you haven't had a boyfriend.

792
00:55:01,690 --> 00:55:04,200
- Me? 
 - Yes.

793
00:55:05,370 --> 00:55:08,970
By chance, were your standards very high?

794
00:55:11,450 --> 00:55:14,330
Rather than seeing just anyone,

795
00:55:14,330 --> 00:55:16,970
I preferred to be alone. It's easier.

796
00:55:17,530 --> 00:55:19,230
I'm more surprised by you.

797
00:55:19,230 --> 00:55:21,600
You must be popular.

798
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:23,290
You think so?

799
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:30,120
I've actually been waiting for someone like you.

800
00:55:31,410 --> 00:55:33,320
That was cheesy.

801
00:55:37,050 --> 00:55:39,410
That's why I've been single.

802
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:45,030
Su Jeong, if you don't mind,

803
00:55:45,030 --> 00:55:48,180
can I do some shopping while I'm here?

804
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:49,910
I needed some clothes.

805
00:55:49,910 --> 00:55:53,370
I think you'd pick a good one for me.

806
00:55:53,370 --> 00:55:55,690
Okay, sounds good.

807
00:55:56,580 --> 00:55:59,330
♫  You in my eyes  ♫

808
00:55:59,330 --> 00:56:01,940
♫  Your eyes are piercing me  ♫

809
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:06,180
♫  And I'm crying bloody tears for you  ♫

810
00:56:07,210 --> 00:56:09,660
♫  (Go away) Go away. Be gone  ♫

811
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:12,590
♫  Your smile is so fake  ♫

812
00:56:12,590 --> 00:56:15,110
♫  There will be no second chance  ♫

813
00:56:15,110 --> 00:56:20,230
 This is my last chance to enjoy the outside world. 

814
00:56:20,230 --> 00:56:23,650
♫  My blackened heart  ♫

815
00:56:23,650 --> 00:56:25,420
But why...

816
00:56:26,070 --> 00:56:28,120
isn't it fun?

817
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:49,930
♫  There will be no second chance  ♫

818
00:56:49,930 --> 00:56:53,300
♫  (Go away) Go away. Be gone  ♫

819
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:57,050
It's not like that.

820
00:56:57,050 --> 00:56:58,790
What are you saying?

821
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:01,420
Seriously. What man?

822
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:04,640
Why would I suddenly see him as a man?

823
00:57:15,050 --> 00:57:17,990
 He's not a man. He's the same age as Su Bin. 

824
00:57:17,990 --> 00:57:20,490
 How could I think of him as a man? 

825
00:57:21,660 --> 00:57:23,060
 Ridiculous. 

826
00:57:23,060 --> 00:57:25,550
 If you're young, you're not a man? 

827
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:35,530
 What about me? What's wrong with me? 

828
00:57:37,770 --> 00:57:39,970
 She has poor taste. 

829
00:57:49,590 --> 00:57:51,520
 But... 

830
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:57,810
 why do I find Baek Su Jeong pretty? 

831
00:58:09,030 --> 00:58:11,830
 Why do you keep looking down on me? 

832
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:15,500
 When did I? 

833
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:33,540
How's this one?

834
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:36,390
It's simple. I think it'd suit you.

835
00:58:36,390 --> 00:58:38,860
That's nice. I like it.

836
00:58:38,860 --> 00:58:41,120
The size is...

837
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:43,820
- Just one moment. 
 - Sure.

838
00:58:45,110 --> 00:58:46,800
Excuse me.

839
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:14,830
Director.

840
00:59:15,930 --> 00:59:18,260
You can't be here looking like that.

841
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:19,990
You've tried so hard to hide that.

842
00:59:19,990 --> 00:59:21,840
I know.

843
00:59:22,310 --> 00:59:24,020
I know this is crazy, too, but—

844
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:26,940
- But why are you here— 
 - I remember everything.

845
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:36,940
That was...

846
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:41,020
my first kiss.

847
00:59:52,620 --> 00:59:54,580
 Gosh, why won't it open? 

848
00:59:54,580 --> 00:59:56,110
Gosh.

849
00:59:56,110 --> 00:59:58,050
 How strange. 

850
01:00:07,660 --> 01:00:16,500


851
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:25,920
   

852
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:29,520
   

853
01:00:34,690 --> 01:00:37,580
♫  To be honest, I don't know, oh, no  ♫

854
01:00:37,580 --> 01:00:39,740
♫  I think I'm losing my mind  ♫

855
01:00:39,740 --> 01:00:41,270
♫  Oh, my gosh  ♫

856
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:42,660
♫  Like this  ♫

857
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:45,070
♫  What to do? I don't know  ♫

858
01:00:45,070 --> 01:00:50,130
♫  Keep falling to love, oh, tonight  ♫

859
01:00:50,130 --> 01:00:53,540
♫  Shine a light on my heart  ♫

860
01:00:53,540 --> 01:00:56,160
 Does he want an office romance or something? 

861
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:57,430
 I don't apologize for kissing. 

862
01:00:57,430 --> 01:00:59,710
 Because it wasn't a mistake. 

863
01:00:59,710 --> 01:01:01,060
 I don't like younger men. 

864
01:01:01,060 --> 01:01:03,410
 And I hate his strange taste. 

865
01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:04,960
 Why does she keep avoiding me? 

866
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:07,660
 Study? What's in there? 

867
01:01:07,660 --> 01:01:10,660
 Everything I liked was a secret. 

868
01:01:10,660 --> 01:01:12,150
 Are you in there, Director? 

869
01:01:12,150 --> 01:01:17,930
 I think I'd be okay as long as I have you. 

870
01:01:18,650 --> 01:01:20,630
 I like you. 

871
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:24,720
♫  (So go) I approach you little by little  ♫

872
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:26,730
♫  (Go) I put a spell on you secretly  ♫

873
01:01:26,730 --> 01:01:30,500
♫  Spell on. Hold on. You're the ending of this game  ♫
