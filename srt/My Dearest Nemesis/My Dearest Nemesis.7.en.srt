You can't do that in the right mind.

00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:33,760
That's how bad it was for me.

191
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,200
Anyway, I'm fine hearing that

192
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,890
but don't say that to anyone else.

193
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:38,780
If you say getting divorced is a flaw,

194
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,680
someone is bound to hate you for it.

195
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,670
I'm not the only one who says that.

00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,620
Is it a man?

201
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,110

You can't stop thinking about men, can you?

203
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:00,500
Let me meet him if it's a man.

204
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,590
Why? Will you date him?

205
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:04,700
Aigoo, aigoo, you little.

don't tease your mom.

210
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:16,040
It's because she worries about you.

211
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,690
Aigoo, poor me for being single.

212
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:41,530
Are you looking for someone?

213
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,290
I assure you I'm not.

214

216
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:02,400
why would you do this yourself?

217
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,960
Because it's my job.

218
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,590
I know, but give them to me.

219
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:06,720

- I'm okay.

00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,250
No.

Director Ban has been avoiding exposure,

251
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,160
however, he officially made his existence known.

252
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,690
Many predict it as a preliminary step to set him up

253
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:45,970
as the successor.

00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:17,480
Don't you think so?

371
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,610
To be honest,

372
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:27,650
I felt like I had to go somewhere.

373
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:31,460
Or I would've gone back there again.

374
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:34,310
Ju Yeon,

375
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:36,560
do you know why General Kim Yu Sin

376
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,160
beheaded his horse?

377
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,730
You mean General Kim Yu Sin

378
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:42,780
who was born in 595 AD Silla?

379
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:44,560
He's admirable as a general, but

380
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:48,850
he blamed his weak willpower on an innocent animal.

381
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:51,440
- Why?
- Huh?

382
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,000
Yes.

383
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,920
Yes, you're right.

384
00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:00,140
But I can understand how he felt.

385
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:06,040
It's not like I can tie myself up.

386
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:09,810
My head says I shouldn't

387
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,490
but I keep missing her.

388
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,720
Is that why?

389
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:22,730
My body keeps going to her.

390
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:29,230
Gosh, I need to get it together.

391
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:34,560
One's heart always

392
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:38,000
acts before one's head.

393
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:42,710
Is that what it means to like someone sincerely

394
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:46,390
sincerely that I can't give up?

395
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:59,090
[Yongsung Department Store]

396
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,770
Good morning.

397
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:14,600
Well, yes.

398
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:29,250
Yes, we'll meet again for lunch tomorrow.

399
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:31,240
It's a treat for me.

400
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:34,220
Do you know Baekyonggak?

401
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:36,470
I heard there's a reservation there.

402
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:39,650
I know.

403
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:41,940
I admire the effort.

404
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:44,380
But I'll pay for the meal.

405
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,890
Yeah...

406
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:48,780
all right.

407
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:55,550
Who are you meeting?

408
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:01,440
Could it be the man I saw at the department store?

409
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,530
It's personal.

410
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:08,960
I don't think I need to answer, Director.

411
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:57,530
we'll meet again for lunch tomorrow.

412
00:29:57,530 --> 00:29:59,660
Do you know Baekyonggak?

413
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:02,020
I heard there's a reservation there.

414
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:15,480
I thought I should do that.

415
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,960
- Is he crazy?
- It could be a surprise.

416
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,320
Gosh, what do I do?

417
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,390
Who's that man now?

418
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:23,780
Stop!

419
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,560
That's enough.

420
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,290
Director.

421
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:31,390
What are you doing here?

422
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:34,030
Father?

423
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:37,500
Su Bin's girlfriend?

424
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,080
Didn't you say you met her once?

425
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:42,350
Yes, we'll meet again for lunch tomorrow.

426
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:43,650
It's a treat for me.

427
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:45,290
Lunch? Where?

428
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:47,200
Do you know Baekyonggak?

429
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,740
I heard there's a reservation there.

430
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:50,520
That's a famous restaurant.

431
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,710
But they're not even married.

432
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:53,200
Why would she treat you guys?

433
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,470
I know.

434
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:56,370
I admire the effort.

435
00:30:56,370 --> 00:30:58,630
But I'll pay for the meal.

436
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:02,100
You're the one who paid Dad's hospital bill.

437
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:04,280
That director?

438
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:08,450
Hello, I'm Baek Su Bin, the eldest son.

439
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:11,940
But what brings you here, Director?

440
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:15,510
I'm meeting someone here, too.

441
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:17,450
I happened to run into you here.

442
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:18,870
I see.

443
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:20,050
We'll let you go, then.

444
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:22,930
But they canceled on me just now.

445
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:25,490
Do you mind if I join you?

446
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,840
Well, we're having a family meal.

447
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,430
Yongsung is one family.

448
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:31,770
Wouldn't it be okay?

449
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:34,880
Team Leader Baek achieved something great recently.

450
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,260
I've been meaning to treat her to a meal.

451
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:39,440
Our Su Jeong did?

452
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,140
Su Bin's girlfriend is coming.

453
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:43,140
Gosh. It's okay. It's okay.

454
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:44,550
She's a social butterfly.

455
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:46,170
She's not shy.

456
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:48,010
Why don't we have a seat?

457
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:50,930
I'll tell you what she did, where and when

458
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:52,710
in great detail.

459
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:55,820
Sounds good. Have a seat. Yes.

460
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:03,270
Thanks to Team Leader Baek,

461
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:05,220
we were able to convince CEO An.

462
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:07,130
That's how tenacious she is.

463
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:09,020
I don't know who she got that from.

464
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:12,350
She must've gotten that from her amazing father.

465
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:16,060
You really have a good eye for people.

466
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,060
I tend to be that way.

467
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,540
I knew it.

468
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:22,120
What do we do?

469
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,570
Ye Na can't come because of an emergency dispatch.

470
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:26,960
Really? We can't help it, then.

471
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,050
His girlfriend is a police officer.

472
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:31,280
She feels terrible.

473
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,790
She congratulates you again for removing the cast.

474
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:35,170
She wants to treat us next time.

475
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:38,250
Tell her I appreciate the gesture alone.

476
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:41,480
Then, I can treat you to this meal today.

477
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,270
Have plenty to eat.

478
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:44,650
Who said you could-

479
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:46,100
Excuse me!

480
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:49,770
Please bring us the menu.

481
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:55,480
Thank you for the meal.

482
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,420
Excuse me, Mr. Ban.

483
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:07,130
I wasn't sure, but

484
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:10,000
you're interested in my sister, right?

485
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:12,600
My dad told me

486
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,230
that you're Yongsung's successor.

487
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:19,040
You're an impressive person. Why my sister?

488
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,990
I don't know how you think of her,

489
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:24,450
but she's very precious to us.

490
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:27,210
She went through and sacrificed a lot.

491
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:28,630
When I was being looked down on,

492
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:31,430
she used to play a video game in my place.

493
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:34,730
So, if you're doing this lightly to play around,

494
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:37,310
I won't let you get away with it.

495
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:44,190
You don't have to worry about that.

496
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:50,690
I'm not doing this lightly.

497
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:58,990
Chairwoman, I finished what you asked me to do.

498
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:00,990
- Already?
- Yes.

499
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:04,750
You sure are quick and thorough.

500
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:06,220
This is why

501
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:08,700
I also asked you to clean Director Ban's house.

502
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:11,230
You're doing a good job there, too, right?

503
00:34:11,910 --> 00:34:15,130
It's all good, but he said not to enter the study.

504
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:17,000
He said he doesn't need it cleaned.

505
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,690
The study?

506
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:20,540
What's he keeping in there?

507
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:22,150
I'm not sure,

508
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:25,370
but it looked like there was a CCTV, too.

509
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:30,470
All right. You can go now.

510
00:34:35,390 --> 00:34:38,000
[Chief Kwon In Gyeong]

511
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:46,970
You wanted to see me, Chairwoman.

512
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:49,240
You can go ahead inside.

513
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,830
As soon as we're done here,

514
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:57,480
let's go to Director Ban's house.

515
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,860
What is it all of a sudden?

516
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:01,590
I need to check his study.

517
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:04,410
He doesn't let anyone in there.

518
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:09,110
I'm curious what important stuff he has there.

519
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:10,700
I'll let Director Ban know.

520
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,180
No.

521
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:14,030
That's not necessary.

522
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:28,280
Where are your father and brother?

523
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:32,790
I let them go because I wanted to say something.

524
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:36,550
What are you thinking, exactly?

525
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:39,310
Why did you come here for?

526
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:41,420
I thought we finished talking last time.

527
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:43,450
I thought you understood.

528
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:47,890
It's because I was scared.

529
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,460
While I was acting foolishly,

530
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:57,410
if you came to like someone else,

531
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,450
what would I do?

532
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:02,430
I don't like that.

533
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:06,740
Understanding doesn't mean

534
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:10,730
I no longer have feelings.

535
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,260
Yes, Chief.

536
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:30,230
As soon as the event ends,

537
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:32,190
the Chairwoman will visit your house.

538
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,910
She's coming to my house?

539
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:37,360
Yes. We'll be leaving in two hours.

540
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,370
She seems to think

541
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:42,830
there's something in your study.

542
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:52,680
I need to go home immediately.

543
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:53,880
What's going on?

544
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,380
What's wrong with her coming to your place?

545
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,700
The study.

546
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,970
She found out there's...

547
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:02,630
Calm down for a moment.

548
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:05,150
Grandmother, please. Grandmother...

549
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:07,040
Forgive me just once, Grandmother.

550
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,730
Don't do that, Grandmother.

551
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:11,580
Grandmother! Grandmother!

552
00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:16,320
Everything could burn and disappear.

553
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:19,860
The things I treasure.

554
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,390
- Move.
- And if you went like this?

555
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:26,430
Do you have a plan?

556
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,840
Let's buy time for now.

557
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:38,900
[2024 Future Energy Industry Expo]

558
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:41,670
Chairwoman.

559
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:43,980
Hello.

560
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:45,860
You remember me, right? I'm Sin Won.

561
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:47,090
Kim Sin Won.

562
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:48,820
Yes.

563
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:50,690
Long time no see.

564
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:54,300
I heard you're still close with Director Ban.

565
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,760
Yes, of course.

566
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,620
We're basically like brothers.

567
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:59,840
Since he's working at the department store,

568
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,930
we're able to hang out more often.

569
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:03,370
Is that so?

570
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:07,880
By the way, you haven't changed at all.

571
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:10,040
Does the passage of time not apply to you?

572
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:13,010
The PR Team at the HQ needs to work harder.

573
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:15,040
Your photos don't do justice.

574
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,530
You look so young and beautiful.

575
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:22,460
You're still good at schmoozing.

576
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:23,800
Thank you.

577
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,880
By the way, what brings you here?

578
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,050
Oh, well, I-I was just in the area.

579
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:32,000
Have you eaten, Chairwoman?

580
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,480
If you haven't, would you like to join me?

581
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,960
When would I ever get to

582
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:39,310
have the honor of having a meal with you again?

583
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:40,650
Yes.

584
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:42,380
I'm sorry,

585
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:44,510
but I need to get going. I'm busy.

586
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:46,250
Chairwoman.

587
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:49,560
How about a t-tea for a moment, then?

588
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,700
Stop taking more of my time.

589
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,500
T-Take care.

[Bbanjju]

591
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:06,450
Yes, I did try to stall her

592
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:08,270
but I think eating with her is pushing it.

593
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:10,530
What's going on, exactly?

594
00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:11,980
If you leave your truck here,

595
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:14,290
how about the other cars?

596
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:16,070
Restroom?

597
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:20,150
I'll call the police if you don't come now.

598
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:22,040
A lot of time has passed.

599
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:25,440
Should I postpone the visit to the Director's house?

600
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,830
It's okay.

601
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:29,400
It'd just take a moment, anyway.

602
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,820
You have another appointment afterward, too.

603
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:33,120
Why are we still talking?

604
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:35,830
I'm sorry.

605
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:43,380
I'm sorry, I was in such a hurry.

606
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:47,050
I think a car could easily pass through here.

607
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:48,420
How weird.

608
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:51,770
What do you mean, parked in the middle of the road?

609
00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:53,190
Did I?

610
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:55,550
But I guess you can't...

611
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:57,500
you can't just go like this.

612
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,830
Whatever. Move your truck now.

613
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:01,140
Okay, okay.

614
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:03,690
I feel so terrible, by the way.

615
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:05,780
Should I cut some sashimi for you?

616
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:08,870
I have a ton of fish straight from Jeju-

617
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:12,690
Look! Stop talking nonsense and move the truck!

618
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:15,310
I guess you don't want it.

619
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:17,570
I got it! Okay.

620
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:35,690
Yes, Su Jeong.

621
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:38,210
I did my best, but...

622
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:41,160
So, why are you trying to stop the Chairwoman?

623
00:41:06,850 --> 00:41:09,560
You'll tell me later?

624
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,520
Huh? Okay.

625
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:15,010
Hello? Hello...

626
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:17,400
What?

627
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,950
I can't believe I ran into you here.

628
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,410
I know. What brings you here?

629
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:29,990
Su Jeong asked me a favor.

630
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:32,710
Huh? Ju Yeon asked me a favor.

631
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:34,080
Really?

632
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:36,090
I thought they weren't close anymore.

633
00:41:36,090 --> 00:41:37,760
Was I wrong?

634
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:40,980
Anyway, good to see you.

635
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:42,430
I'll get going now.

636
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:43,860
Okay.

637
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,930
- Drive safely.
- Okay.

638
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:01,820
If she was so happy to see me,

639
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:03,970
she should've gotten out briefly.

640
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:28,090
What are you doing? Load the rest of the stuff.

641
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:30,570
Yes, I should.

642
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:37,510
We're at the parking lot.

643
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:39,970
They're in front of the building now.

644
00:42:41,010 --> 00:42:42,480
Already?

645
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:45,540
We moved the important stuff, right?

646
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:47,490
What should we do with the rest?

647
00:42:47,490 --> 00:42:49,040
If we blocked the door to this room-

648
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,750
She's already suspicious.

649
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:52,620
She won't just go back.

650
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:54,630
What should we do, then?

651
00:43:17,950 --> 00:43:21,580
I came to see how you live.

652
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:23,480
I guess you were about to leave.

653
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:24,950
Yes.

654
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:27,390
I'd like to invite you next time if that's okay-

655
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:30,740
No need to be invited to check out your place.

656
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:32,180
Why?

657
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:35,580
Is there a reason I shouldn't go into your place?

658
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:41,470
No.

659
00:43:41,470 --> 00:43:45,050
Let's go up together if it's not anything urgent.

660
00:44:03,490 --> 00:44:05,860
Take me to the study.

661
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:07,360
Okay.

662
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:42,620
It looks normal.

663
00:44:43,810 --> 00:44:47,700
I'm curious why you don't let her clean this room.

664
00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:56,110
Are you...

665
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:59,560
hiding something in here?

666
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:02,130
Huh?

667
00:45:30,190 --> 00:45:32,020
I'm sorry.

668
00:45:34,790 --> 00:45:36,390
I'll leave first.

669
00:45:36,390 --> 00:45:39,580
You don't want to leave now and run into her.

670
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:45,160
Stay here.

671
00:46:01,270 --> 00:46:04,560
I thought you were doing something silly again.

672
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:07,180
Were you trying to hide this?

673
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:11,220
I know you wouldn't be happy

674
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:14,390
if you knew I had that photo.

675
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,940
I don't have the right to

676
00:46:20,790 --> 00:46:23,310
cry or feel sad.

677
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:25,520
Yes.

678
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:27,940
So, why did you keep it if you knew that?

679
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:29,520
I know...

680
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:34,740
I don't have the right,

681
00:46:35,490 --> 00:46:38,600
but I wanted to keep a photo, at least.

682
00:46:43,070 --> 00:46:45,460
Because I miss them so much.

683
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:49,740
You think you have the right to miss them?

684
00:46:57,410 --> 00:46:59,590
If it wasn't for you,

685
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:03,730
my son would still be here.

686
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:08,910
Not this stupid photo,

687
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:11,570
but my actual son!

688
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:35,790
Weak bastard.

689
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:05,820
Keep a closer eye on him from now on.

690
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:07,830
Should I have someone watch him?

691
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,880
I'm having you watch him.

692
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:13,080
Who else do we need?

693
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:17,520
Yes, I'll watch him more closely.

694
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:47,890
Be careful. You'll hurt yourself.

695
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:01,930
You know my parents died in a car accident, right?

696
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:08,980
We were on the way to an anime event.

697
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:11,220
They were both busy,

698
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:16,060
but I begged them because I wanted to go.

699
00:49:17,450 --> 00:49:19,850
That's when we got into an accident on the way.

700
00:49:21,310 --> 00:49:24,180
Thanks to their protection, I survived.

701
00:49:25,050 --> 00:49:26,690
But they died in an accident

702
00:49:26,690 --> 00:49:29,050
they shouldn't have been in because of me.

703
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:34,470
Grandmother indeed lost her only son because of me.

704
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:38,660
So, I decided to make it up for her.

705
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:44,860
To become the person she wants and replace Father.

706
00:49:46,990 --> 00:49:48,840
Director.

707
00:49:57,510 --> 00:49:59,730
But even after that,

708
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:03,960
I still couldn't give up on my joy.

709
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:06,750
The next volume of my favorite cartoon,

710
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:09,740
and the band's new song and show.

711
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:13,790
I needed things like that

712
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:18,120
to look forward to tomorrow.

713
00:50:22,650 --> 00:50:26,850
Even though no one loved me, I felt fulfilled.

714
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:33,540
That's why...

715
00:50:35,730 --> 00:50:39,640
when you told me to like the things I like

716
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:43,600
all I want in front of the fountain,

717
00:50:46,990 --> 00:50:49,390
I was really happy.

718
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:54,060
I meant it.

719
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:56,710
You looked...

720
00:50:58,450 --> 00:51:01,370
really happy, then.

721
00:51:03,370 --> 00:51:06,980
I wanted you to continue to be happy.

722
00:51:17,330 --> 00:51:19,090
I like you.

723
00:51:22,930 --> 00:51:26,410
I've hidden things I liked for a long time.

724
00:51:27,610 --> 00:51:30,210
Because everything I liked was a secret.

725
00:51:30,210 --> 00:51:33,220
That's why I couldn't tell you, but...

726
00:51:37,590 --> 00:51:40,460
But I like you so much, Baek Su Jeong.

727
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:49,190
I'm sorry I couldn't hold it in.

728
00:51:52,110 --> 00:51:54,250
Thank you for today.

729
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:38,230
There's my daughter.

730
00:52:38,230 --> 00:52:40,430
Yes, Dad. You were home.

731
00:52:40,430 --> 00:52:41,800
What are you talking about?

732
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,540
You asked me to receive packages.

733
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:46,110
People came to deliver them and left.

734
00:52:46,110 --> 00:52:48,940
Oh, yeah. That's right.

735
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:50,270
Are you sick?

736
00:52:50,270 --> 00:52:52,670
You were meeting someone. You look terrible.

737
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:55,190
No, I'm not sick.

738
00:52:55,190 --> 00:52:58,040
I asked them to put the packages in the attic.

739
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:00,360
Why was there so much stuff?

740
00:53:01,070 --> 00:53:02,890
Someone I know asked me to keep them briefly.

741
00:53:02,890 --> 00:53:04,490
They'll take them back soon.

742
00:53:04,490 --> 00:53:06,870
We don't use that space, anyway.

743
00:53:06,870 --> 00:53:10,380
I don't mind keeping them there for a long time, but

744
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:12,830
you're sure you're okay, right?

745
00:53:12,830 --> 00:53:16,660
Of course. Why would I not be okay?

746
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:21,670
Su Jeong.

747
00:53:21,670 --> 00:53:22,940
Yes?

748
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:24,770
You know...

749
00:53:25,570 --> 00:53:28,520
seeing you smile like that breaks my heart.

750
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:30,590
Because I'm not good enough,

751
00:53:30,590 --> 00:53:34,020
and because you can't rely on me...

752
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:36,860
Since you can't tell me when something's going on,

753
00:53:36,860 --> 00:53:39,530
I wonder if all you do is smile like that.

754
00:53:39,530 --> 00:53:41,220
So...

755
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:44,180
Dad,

756
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:47,270
please don't worry. Nothing's going on.

757
00:53:47,270 --> 00:53:50,950
I'm just tired because I've been out a while.

758
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:54,350
Okay, then. Go inside and rest.

759
00:53:55,060 --> 00:53:56,270
You go in, too.

760
00:53:56,270 --> 00:53:57,630
Okay.

761
00:54:14,370 --> 00:54:16,980
You've been smiling a lot.

762
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:19,030
You don't usually smile.

763
00:54:19,030 --> 00:54:21,530
How can I make you feel better?

764
00:54:23,730 --> 00:54:26,810
Isn't working alone hard?

765
00:54:26,810 --> 00:54:28,540
It's lonely, too.

766
00:54:41,190 --> 00:54:43,960
I've hidden things I liked for a long time.

767
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:46,780
Because everything I liked was a secret.

768
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:49,590
That's why I couldn't tell you, but...

769
00:54:50,590 --> 00:54:53,560
But I like you so much, Baek Su Jeong.

There you are.

800
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:42,740
Ms. Baek.

801
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:46,080
I was curious about something.

802
00:57:46,790 --> 00:57:48,910
That's why I came.

803
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:55,580
When you remembered you kissed me,

804
00:57:56,580 --> 00:57:59,430
why did you run all the way here?

805
00:58:00,630 --> 00:58:03,570
You knew it was a crazy thing to do.

806
00:58:04,470 --> 00:58:07,390
If you came looking like that, the things you hid...

807
00:58:08,570 --> 00:58:11,040
the secrets you've worked hard to keep

808
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:14,890
could've been revealed. You knew that.

809
00:58:14,890 --> 00:58:17,170
So, why did you come?

810
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:24,000
Just because you like me?

811
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,240
For that one reason?

812
00:58:33,890 --> 00:58:35,980
Would you be okay?

813
00:58:37,350 --> 00:58:40,470
Our relationship could get exposed anytime

814
00:58:40,470 --> 00:58:43,390
and it could be problematic for your dream of

815
00:58:43,390 --> 00:58:45,550
becoming Yongsung's successor.

816
00:58:47,510 --> 00:58:49,110

817
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:54,440
think I'd be okay

818

as long as I have you.

819
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:00,990

820
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:14,360
All right.

821
00:59:16,450 --> 00:59:18,110
If so,

822
00:59:21,070 --> 00:59:24,900
I'll become your biggest secret.

823
00:59:25,820 --> 00:59:28,950
You said everything you like is a secret.

824
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:34,380
