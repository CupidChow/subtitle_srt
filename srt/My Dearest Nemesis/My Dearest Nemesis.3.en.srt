Does that excite you more?

188
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:30,490
I think I'd better stop.

189
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,290
I have to go to work.

190
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:34,280
Get going.

191
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:37,220
I had fun last night, thanks to you.

192
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,710
See you.

193
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:46,610
Mom!

194
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:47,980
What took you so long?

195
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:50,600
Huh? I'm not late. I came just in time.

196
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,050
That's late.

197
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:54,100
If you want the stuff at the original prices,

198
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,300
you'd better come early and help us.

199
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,530
Have you seen a conscientious thief?

200
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:00,110
Seriously. Don't be so proud.

201
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:02,270
Right, how about your shop?

202
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:04,800
Ha Jeong says you have no customers.

203
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,150
I can't help it if it fails.

204
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:07,640
Seriously.

205
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,350
I told you to save the alimony and get a job.

206
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:13,070
Why did you start a business?

207
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:16,310
You quit your job to get married,

208
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:18,100
but you got divorced within a year.

209
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:22,460
You're about to close the shop within a year.

210
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:25,570
Why can't you stick with anything?

211
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:27,630
Why are you such a troublemaker?

212
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:30,010
I dated one man for 10 years

213
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:32,490
and married him. Did you forget?

214
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,810
Dad, what's the good stuff today?

215
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:37,910
Snapper.

216
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:40,650
Snapper. Okay.

217
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:43,400
Director.

218
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,560
Here's the dress from last night.

219
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,440
Did you dry-clean it?

220
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,190
I don't think you had time.

221
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:54,260
Well, I only wore it for a moment last night.

222
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,700
You clean it if you wore it.

223
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,200
Isn't that obvious?

224
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,900
It rained last night, too.

225
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,690
I didn't even want to wear it.

226
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:02,130
I thought it was a basic manner.

227
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:04,280
But I had too high an expectation.

228
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:08,220
I think the staff could use an etiquette training.

229
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,870
Someone talked loudly in the elevator, too.

230
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:13,250
Are you saying I have such poor manners?

231
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,790
It might've been your voice.

232
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,570
Fine, I'll do it.

233
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:20,750
You'd better get me reimbursed.

234
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:29,360
What was that little nod?

235
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:50,470
I told you. It's not my style.

236
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,210
It doesn't suit me, right?

237
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,720
Didn't it suit her?

238
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,790
Etiquette training?

239
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,930
He needs to learn manners himself first.

240
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:07,890
He always acts as he pleases-

241
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,100
You weren't talking about me, were you?

242
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,600
You're too self-conscious.

243
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,970
Me. I meant me.

244
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:18,870
I do as I please too much.

245
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:20,840
Objectifying oneself.

246
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,800
You're good at that, at least.

247
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:31,520
Let's start the meeting.

248
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,080
You must understand the

249
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,950
importance of the renewal project.

250
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:38,060
It will start in Seoul and spread nationwide.

251
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,030
The beginning will be most important.

252
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:43,010
That's why we chose the Gangnam store.

253
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:45,340
[Renewal Candidate No. 1, Gangnam Store]

254
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,940
The Gangnam store, not the flagship store?

255
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:49,160
Gangnam is the center of commerce.

256
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:52,860
But our store had lower sales than others.

257
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,820
We're currently in need of refreshing.

258
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,550
It'd be highly risky if we fail.

259
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:59,320
The reward will be big if we succeed, too.

260
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:02,310
Sales are guaranteed once we pave the path.

261
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:05,670
The next candidate is a safer option.

262
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:09,330
That's okay. I had the Gangnam store in mind, too.

263
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:11,840
We all agree. Why waste time?

264
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,910
Let's go with the Gangnam store. Let's go.

265
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:15,330
Okay.

266
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:20,140
Where are you going?

267
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:22,630
To the Gangnam store. It's the chosen store.

268
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,100
I should assess the site accurately.

269
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,360
- Well...
- What?

270
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:33,560
They didn't plan this together ahead, right?

271
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,590
I know. They're totally on the same page.

272
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,900
Do you want to sleep with me?

273
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,580
Shall we?

274
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,210
Shit.

275
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,000
I'm okay.

276
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,980
You must've heard about the renewal project.

277
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:15,890
Yes, I heard our store could be the first one.

278
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:17,830
It will be starting today.

279
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:19,120
Oh, I see.

280
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,450
Let's work well together, Branch Manager.

281
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:22,620
Yes, of course.

282
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:25,410
We'll survey the customers and gauge the demand.

283
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:27,320
Will that be enough?

284
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,450
Pardon?

285
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:31,560
The main goal of the renewal

286
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,220
is to get new customers.

287
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,410
Conduct a survey beyond the

288
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:36,940
current customers.

289
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,690
The brands, products, services,

290
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:41,120
and facilities they want.

291
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,880
How can we ask the non-customers?

292
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,670
Make them desperate to participate.

293
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48,800
Spend money or anything excessively.

294
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,780
There's no need to be conservative.

295
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:53,060
Got it. We'll proceed immediately.

296
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,650
Okay. You can leave.

297
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:56,190
Pardon? Already?

298
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:57,610
They'll know

299
00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:00,180
a higher up is here if I were with you.

300
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:03,050
I want to assess the store as it is.

301
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:05,410
Okay, then. Feel free to look around.

302
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:07,620
We'll be in touch.

303
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,260
This is...

304
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:17,800
You recognize it. It's the brand I use.

305
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:21,660
I only use their products.

306
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:27,810
So does my favorite band's vocalist.

307
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:30,050
Oh, I see.

308
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:34,520
I was noticing the crooked letter on the sign.

309
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:37,080
You're observant.

310
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,030
But you didn't notice my sunglasses brand.

311
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:40,960
I'll let the worker know.

312
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,190
It's a million won sunglasses.

313
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:45,100
But how is the repair 800,000?

314
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,710
The legs and screws...

315
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:50,410
were designed by an artisan.

316
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:53,850
Repairs need to be done at the HQ in Italy

317
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:55,300
and be shipped back to you.

318
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:58,750
But still. You aren't remaking it.

319
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,340
800,000 won is no joke.

320
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:04,130
They basically need to be remade.

321
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,620
Who are you?

322
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,010
If you don't understand their value,

323
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:13,690
you don't have the right to wear them.

324
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:16,850
Who are you? Why do you decide

325
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:19,000
I have the right or not?

326
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,400
Me?

327
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,390
Someone who understands the product's value.

328
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,220
Whatever. Whatever. I don't care.

329
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:53,240
If you're here to shop,

330
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,080
get the stuff and leave.

331
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,860
Don't piss me off like this.

332
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:59,080
Piss you off? Are you serious-

333
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,840
Excuse me.

334
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:03,100
How about these?

335
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:06,550
They'd look better on you than the old ones.

336
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:09,990
You're telling me to get a new pair now?

337
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:13,190
Are you trying to piss me off more?

338
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:16,160
He doesn't deserve any of these-

339
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,880
You have to wait a long time

340
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,760
for the repair.

341
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,190
If it'd cost the same,

342
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:25,310
shouldn't you get a pair that suits you better?

343
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:26,790
I'm a Yongseong employee.

344
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,070
I can get you a discount.

345
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:31,220
They'd be 650,000 won, then.

346
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,320
What do you think?

347
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:36,160
Why don't you try them on briefly?

348
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,120
Just hover them over your face.

349
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,180
Let me show you the mirror.

350
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,790
Let me see.

351
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:54,620
♫ Don't be alone, this fire ♫

352
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:58,450
♫ Stay in my world, down ♫

353
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:01,840
♫ Welcome, welcome this fire ♫

354
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:15,110
Amazing.

355
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:25,260
I suppose I'll buy a new pair.

356
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,090
- Would you like to?
- Sure.

357
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:29,620
Get him a new pair.

358
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:32,550
Gosh, amazing.

359
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,860
It's not that he doesn't understand the value.

360
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:40,200
He couldn't afford the fee.

361
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,740
You still shouldn't have dealt with him like that.

362
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,690
It was too much even for you.

363
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:45,970
I know.

364
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:48,890
I almost made an unforgivable mistake.

365
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:53,010
It could've been one of the few errors in my life.

366
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:55,650
But you prevented it.

367
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:59,880
Thank you, but that's a bit...

368
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,040
I've never seen his bare face.

369
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,950
I didn't recognize him.

370
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:06,830
Pardon?

371
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,460
Who?

372
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:14,090
The singer from the concert? Right?

373
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:16,180
Daebak. You should've said something.

374
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,370
You're a fan.

375
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:20,280
Right, it was a secret.

376
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,830
Will you just let him leave?

377
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:28,250
Should I get an autograph for you?

378
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,950
It's okay.

379
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:35,710
Just wait.

380
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:37,080
I'll...

381
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,540
A pen. I don't have a pen.

382
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,130
Here.

383
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,320
Excuse me!

384
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:53,490
Excuse me.

385
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,640
Just one moment.

386
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:58,290
I saw your show once.

387
00:21:58,290 --> 00:21:59,970
I'm a huge fan.

388
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:01,590
Could I have an autograph?

389
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:02,630
Of course.

390
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:04,520
I didn't recognize you.

391
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,900
You're so cool.

392
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,590
Thank you.

393
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:12,520
A photo?

394
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,420
Just one moment.

395
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,420
Director,

396
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:20,430
I told him I was a fan, and he offered a photo.

397
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:21,520
A photo?

398
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,470
It'd be nice if you were in it,

399
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:24,930
but you can't let anyone know.

400
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:28,100
I'll take one for you. Live vicarious through me.

401
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,690
I'll take it now.

402
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:53,880
One, two, three.

403
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,440
What's this?

404
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,980
You can only see my hair.

405
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:17,380
It's because I'm not your fan.

406
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:19,050
Message me the photo.

407
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:20,970
Maybe I won't.

408
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,910
I got you an autograph and a photo.

409
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:26,840
But you treated me like this.

410
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,110
I know.

411
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:30,680
I got an autograph and a photo.

412
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:33,870
I don't need a thank you.

413
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,760
I'm a fan for a reason.

414
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,590
I thought he was just a good singer,

415
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:40,190
but he's a great person, too.

416
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,930
Do you like him that much?

417
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:46,320
Are you mocking me?

418
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,350
I'm jealous.

419
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:52,160
Having a passion for something.

420
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,670
I think it's a valuable thing.

421
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:57,490
It's hard to find what you like.

422
00:23:57,490 --> 00:24:00,740
It's hard to like something for a long time, too.

423
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:05,520
So...

424
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,250
enjoy it all you want.

425
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:12,370
No matter what others think,

426
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:14,700
I don't think you enjoying your hobby

427
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:17,700
makes you a bad successor.

428
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:24,500
The chairman chooses the successor, not you.

429
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,070
You think I don't know that?

430
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:30,940
Is that how you respond to...

431
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:33,450
Whatever.

432
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:36,310
Be careful. You'll get wet.

433
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:31,470
Wow!

434
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:33,120
It's a rainbow.

435
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:38,640
I haven't seen one in a while.

436
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,050
It's pretty.

437
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:07,690
I'm enjoying it...

438
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:11,450
plenty already.

439
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:14,260
But...

440
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:17,100
I'll try to enjoy it more freely...

441
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,930
in front of you, at least.

442
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,750
She's not bad at her job.

443
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,010
I mean, Ms. Baek Su Jeong.

444
00:26:57,010 --> 00:26:58,870
You said that doesn't matter...

445
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:01,170
and she needs to be eliminated.

446
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:04,930
Not anymore. She doesn't seem bad anymore.

447
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:07,360
You said she's a talent I'd appreciate, too.

448
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,290
Right?

449
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:13,020
I knew I understood your type.

450
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:26,550
He's not bad at his job.

451
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:29,930
- Who?
- Director Ban Ju Yeon.

452
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:31,990
He makes decisions quickly, motivated,

453
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:33,460
and he has a good sense, too.

454
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:38,040
I think you called him unruly this morning.

455
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,940
I guess we have two directors now.

456
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:45,620
I thought you disliked him, Team Leader.

457
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:46,930
I did, too.

458
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:48,370
There's nothing to like or dislike.

459
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:50,460
He just needs to be good at his job.

460
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,820
It wakes you right up.

461
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:21,600
This is the best thing when you're working late.

462
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:28,810
Are you working late?

463
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:30,410
Well, yes.

464
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:32,500
I had work to do after working offsite.

465
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,380
I wanted to finish it before I left.

466
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,940
If you work late due to a sudden schedule change,

467
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:39,020
how would that make me look?

468
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:41,950
Don't work late for no reason and leave.

469
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,010
I mean...

470
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:49,350
who says to get off work so rudely like that?

471
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:51,930
Also,

472
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:54,420
it's too late to get the dress dry-cleaned.

473
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:56,560
You should just keep it.

474
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,740
Pardon? Why?

475
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,980
I don't need it,

476
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:04,200
and it was pretty.

477
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,900
The dress. I mean, the dress.

478
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,830
I mean, the dress.

479
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:14,850
Peace.

480
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:26,240
Hilarious.

481
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:43,410
You're coming to my hideout.

482
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:58,620
- Who's this?
- Bbanjju! Honey!

483
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:11,670
My face turns red when I see you.

484
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:14,800
It really doesn't sound like her.

485
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:23,120
Please thank your mother for me.

486
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:37,790
What are you smiling at? How annoying.

487
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,430
Me?

488
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:41,510
I smiled?

489
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:44,720
How dumb do you have to be to not realize it?

490
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,830
I've never experienced this before.

491
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:54,190
Hey,

492
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:58,370
do you think destiny is a real thing?

493
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,760
We were meant to be.

494
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,040
My destiny.

495
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,210
Your existence.

496
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:08,270
Your existence itself disgusts me.

497
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:12,370
Stay sealed forever, you little nerd!

498
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:16,470
You're in a dangerous state. Be careful.

499
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:18,100
Falling for someone precariously

500
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:21,250
will put you in excruciating pain.

501
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:26,440
You just...

502
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:29,740
thought about your first love, right?

503
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:32,720
I'll put you out of your misery now.

504
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,900
Hey, stop!

505
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:00,540
Is it pretty?

506
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,700
I'd never wear it, and it doesn't even suit me.

507
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:45,030
I'm busy because I just opened a shop.

508
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:46,990
What kind of shop is it?

509
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:48,770

What were those flowers in the front?

562
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:00,770
Gosh, what's this?

563
00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:02,750
Why is it so cold in here?

564
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:04,070
What's this now?

565
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:06,210
What brings you here without notice?

566
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:08,570
I never give you notice.

567
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:10,160
I asked you what that was.

568
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,180
I got it as a gift for opening.

569
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:14,730
Who sends you a gift like this?

570
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:16,990
It's as if it's from a chaebol.

571
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:18,580
I know.

572
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:20,090
Have a seat for now.

573
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:23,040
Let's turn off the AC, Unni.

574
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,910
AC won't prevent that from melting.

575
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,450
Should I?

576
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:29,990
So, who is it?

577
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:32,770
- A friend of mine.
- Which friend?

578
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:35,350
Do you have a friend I don't know?

579
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:37,970

00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:10,070
Unni, have you been in touch with him?

590
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:14,170
Why?

591
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:17,000
You were angry that he deceived us, too.

You're here early, too, Director.

00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:11,530
I'm just diligent.

613
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:19,400
Did you check today's weather, too?

614
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,940
Yes.

I see. It does look really handy.

619

Yes, it is.

00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:18,210
Yes, that should work.

733
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:31,780
Did I beg you for it or something?

734
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:33,020
What gives you the right?

735
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:36,220
Just give it back since you never wanted it.

736
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:41,600
You said you had a lot of debt.

737
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:44,750
