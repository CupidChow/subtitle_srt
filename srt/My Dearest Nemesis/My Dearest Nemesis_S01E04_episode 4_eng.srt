1
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:13,600


2
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:16,720
   

3
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,450
   

4
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:22,020
   

5
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,830
   

6
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:26,780
   

7
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,990
   

8
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:33,760
   

9
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:48,080
   

10
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:52,720
   

11
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,900
 After begging my busy parents, 

12
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:58,900
 we were heading to my favorite animation event. 

13
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:03,590
 Are you that excited, my son? 

14
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:09,590
 Yes. All the characters are coming to the event today. 

15
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:12,860
 I have something that'll add to your excitement. 

16
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:15,920
 - Ta-da! 
 - Wow! 

17
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:51,030
 Mom... 

18
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,920
 Mom. 

19
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,230
 Can you hear me? 

20
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:02,240
 Mom, Mom, Mom! 

21
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,160
 Dad! 

22
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,320
 Dad! 

23
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:10,950
 Over here! Hurry! 

24
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:12,420
 People are hurt! 

25
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,240
 Move out of the way! 

26
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,750
 Are you okay? 

27
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:53,320
 My parents protected me 

28
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,060
 at the cost of their lives. 

29
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,700
 Mom. 

30
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,070
 Dad. 

31
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:12,090
 Ban Ju Yeon, stop crying. 

32
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:16,950
 You don't even have a right to cry. 

33
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:18,890
 My son wouldn't have 

34
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:22,440
 gone there if it wasn't for you. 

35
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:26,670
 The guests are coming soon. Get up. 

36
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:38,180
 Secretary Kwon, have you done what I asked you to do? 

37
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,090
 I contacted all the media companies. 

38
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:41,350
 They all said they'd comply. 

39
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:44,870
 Make sure the stock value doesn't go down. 

40
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,810
 I understand. 

41
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,340
 Ever since the day I lost my dear parents, 

42
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,520
 I existed as my grandma's object of resentment. 

43
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:06,480
 I told you to manage that yourself. 

44
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,670
 What? 

45
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,430
 What? 

46
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:32,810
   

47
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:17,210
 If it wasn't for me... 

48
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,910
 It's all my fault. 

49
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,710
 But I wasn't the only one 

50
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:38,410
 who lost loved ones that day. 

51
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,980
 I... 

52
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,600
 will fill in for my father. 

53
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,640
 I did my best to become the person 

54
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,300
 Grandma wanted. 

55
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,430
 But the more I tried, the lonelier I got. 

56
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:02,860
 She took away the things I relied on. 

57
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,070
 Like a dragon hiding in a cave 

58
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:09,200
 finding comfort through loneliness, 

59
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,780
 I needed my cave, 

60
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:14,940
 my utopia no one could invade. 

61
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:07,330
   

62
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:09,450
It looks real.

63
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:12,640
What are you doing?

64
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,840
Hello, Director.

65
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,030
Funny to see you like this.

66
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:17,090
What are you doing here?

67
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:19,140
Don't you think I should ask that?

68
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:23,240
You decorated your room very well.

69
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,120
You said you didn't have hobbies like this.

70
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,790
Does this look like my room?

71
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:28,460
It's my nephew's room.

72
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,720
- Nephew? 
 - Nephew.

73
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,460
I'm not like those who take pleasure

74
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:35,140
in locking themselves up in their rooms.

75
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:37,180
I'm just pure-hearted and...

76
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:40,480
love music and cartoons.

77
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,310
Keep that in mind.

78
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,540
- Okay. 
 - Leave.

79
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:49,070
I only work with top experts.

80
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:51,340
I'm here for a job. I need to get it done.

81
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,240
I'm not as good as my dad,

82
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,320
but I'm an expert.

83
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,220
The stuff to repair is over there, right?

84
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:03,640
Be careful! You can't break it.

85
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,940
I waited forever for it to be stocked.

86
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,530
Pardon?

87
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,420
My nephew did.

88
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:15,670
My nephew waited a long time.

89
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:18,130
He'd get upset, you know?

90
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:22,270
Your nephew is very patient.

91
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:25,280
Could the uncle wait a bit, too?

92
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,440
I'll make sure to get it fixed.

93
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,190
What's she thinking, anyway?

94
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,850
Don't get nervous, Ban Ju Yeon. Overcome.

95
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:53,260
Stay alert even in crises.

96
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,250
Is it all right to be so loud?

97
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,130
Your neighbor will get angry.

98
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:41,830
I soundproofed the room.

99
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:44,740
It's like a concert venue.

100
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,350
What did you say?

101
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:51,710
You have a fun life, I said.

102
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:54,470
This room must be your...

103
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,930
What was that?

104
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:09,610
It was a mistake.

105
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:16,180
♫  ♫

106
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:21,490
♫  There's no such thing as a second chance  ♫

107
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:26,790
♫  My dark and burnt, black heart  ♫

108
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:32,540
♫  Become scattered in my memories  ♫

109
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,610
My nephew and I like the same music.

110
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:48,190
The kid resembles me a lot.

111
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,800
Oh, I see.

112
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,240
Stop!

113
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,690
Are you crazy? Why touch my stuff...

114
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:10,000
Why would you touch it?

115
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:14,930
This is the first edition, published in 1996.

116
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,500
How about this...

117
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:22,000
A rare edition published in 2001.

118
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,620
And this?

119
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:27,090
This is a signed copy. It's my precious...

120
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,980
I knew it.

121
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,990
It's not the imaginary nephew's.

122
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:35,950
It's yours.

123
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:38,370
All of this stuff.

124
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:40,560
I have a nephew.

125
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,620
You're an only child.

126
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,700
You don't have close relatives.

127
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,990
So? What exactly do you want?

128
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:55,360
Say this is my room and I like all this stuff.

129
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,560
How does that change anything?

130
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:00,780
Of course it changes things.

131
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,020
You must've forgotten about the contract.

132
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:05,200
You like rock bands but also cartoons.

133
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,420
You like many more...

134
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:10,260
things than I thought.

135
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:13,970
My perception has changed.

136
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:17,660
I got to know a lot more about you.

137
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:37,740
♫  The moment I hold your hand  ♫

138
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:40,380
♫  It's all right, it's so high  ♫

139
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,500
♫  I can't hide my feelings  ♫

140
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,730
♫  I'll work up my courage and tell you  ♫

141
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,590
♫  My first love is calling me  ♫

142
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:48,020
♫  I've been waiting  ♫

143
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,990
♫  It feels like I'm flying  ♫

144
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:51,660
Are you okay?

145
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:58,340
♫  Be my first love  ♫

146
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:11,940
I sent money to your father's account.

147
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,010
Thank you.

148
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:17,420
Also,

149
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:19,610
the...

150
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:22,400
dress, you know.

151
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:26,420
Unless you need it for something on Monday, could I...

152
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:30,770
It's okay. Why would you sell a gift, anyway?

153
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:35,330
Was it a gift?

154
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,300
Hello?

155
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:56,480
Yes, it's my dad.

156
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,200
Hospital?

157
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,440
I'll head over right now.

158
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,910
I'll get going now.

159
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:05,160
- I'll drive you. 
 - No, I can go on my own.

160
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:08,050
You'd get into an accident if you rush, like I did.

161
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:10,030
Let's get going.

162
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:28,720
 ­  

163
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,710
The surgery went well.

164
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:33,860
Since he fractured his ankle,

165
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:36,080
he won't be able to move for a while.

166
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:39,640
We'll see how long he needs to be hospitalized.

167
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,400
Okay. Thank you.

168
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,920
The patient will go to the VIP ward once he wakes up.

169
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,030
My dad isn't a VIP.

170
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:50,340
I am. I'm the VIP.

171
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:53,140
A VVIP, to be exact.

172
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,830
Double V.

173
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,550
Take us to the room.

174
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,880
Thank you.

175
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:05,550
I told you not to overdo it.

176
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:06,940
You did extra work, didn't you?

177
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:09,090
No, I didn't.

178
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:12,070
- You're lying. 
 - I'm not.

179
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:16,530
You must've worried, sweetheart. I'm sorry.

180
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:19,890
If you're sorry, then recover quickly and come home.

181
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:21,100
Would you like beef bone broth?

182
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,560
I'll boil it for eight hours—

183
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,020
The food is good here.

184
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:28,150
Oh, I suppose.

185
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:30,780
Thank you for the special treatment.

186
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,660
I don't know what to say.

187
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,550
Yongsung is a family.

188
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:36,530
I can't ignore an injured family member.

189
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:39,320
I'm only fulfilling my duty as an executive, so please,

190
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,770
just focus on your recovery.

191
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:43,490
Yes, of course.

192
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:47,290
Also, I'm sorry I came by late at night.

193
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:48,420
I was feeling impatient.

194
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,780
Team Leader Baek is a crucial member.

195
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:55,310
It's my fault for having a talented daughter.

196
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,960
I admire you.

197
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,860
Rest well, then. I'll leave.

198
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:06,230
Just one moment, Dad.

199
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:16,820
You must be close to your father.

200
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,320
You could say that.

201
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,680
Thank you.

202
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:24,010
I would've been flustered if I were alone.

203
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:26,720
We get to enjoy the VIP ward, thanks to you.

204
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,890
It's so nice.

205
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:35,870
What?

206
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:38,300
You've been smiling a lot.

207
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,560
You don't usually smile.

208
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:45,050
Let's not overdo it.

209
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:47,540
You don't have to see me off.

210
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:19,870
 This is your personal phone number, right? 

211
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:21,550
 Thank you so much for today. 

212
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:23,820
 Get home safely. 

213
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:39,900
Dad!

214
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,870
Dad.

215
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:47,290
You haven't met your future daughter-in-law.

216
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:48,430
You can't leave yet.

217
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:50,020
I'll be good to you.

218
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:52,530
I said I'd pass the exam at once.

219
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:54,620
Dad.

220
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:57,230
Don't die, Dad.

221
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:58,600
You heard him, Dad.

222
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,940
What?

223
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:02,780
You mean that, son?

224
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:05,250
Sis, are you crazy?

225
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,700
You're the stupid one.

226
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,110
Hurry up and help Dad.

227
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,420
What's with the VIP ward?

228
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,770
You didn't win the lottery while I was gone, right?

229
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:20,680
Did you secretly move, too?

230
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,500
Is our place still there?

231
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,460
Dad. Sis.

232
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,690
You'd better be honest.

233
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:27,330
Gosh, how noisy.

234
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:29,080
Since when was he so talkative?

235
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,010
Try studying for the government exam.

236
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:32,470
You don't ever get to talk.

237
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:34,410
I eat, sleep, and poop alone every day.

238
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:37,160
I talk to the lecturer in the videos now.

239
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,370
I see.

240
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:40,330
So, what's with the ward?

241
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:41,780
Did you really win the lottery?

242
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,560
Is it stock? Crypto?

243
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,530
My friends all lost money.

244
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:48,810
Su Jeong's director got me this room.

245
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:50,330
Director?

246
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:52,430
- Is it a man? 
 - Yes.

247
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:53,900
Are you two dating?

248
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,590
- Are you crazy? 
 - How old is he?

249
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:59,100
He looked very young. How old is he?

250
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,330
Probably the same age as him.

251
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:02,410
No way, the same age as me?

252
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:05,080
He definitely isn't interested in you then.

253
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:08,010
That confidence really rubs me the wrong way...

254
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:10,610
Someone my age won't find you attractive.

255
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:11,820
You're too old.

256
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,310
What?

257
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:36,090
 I left a gift for your father at the front desk. 

258
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:37,830
 Pick it up. 

259
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:47,740
Thank you.

260
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,800
 They're giving out stuffed animals. 

261
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,340
 Why would you want a stuffed animal? 

262
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:00,230
 It's cute and free. 

263
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:03,800
 Cute? That stuff? 

264
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:07,470
Seriously. He's funny.

265
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:10,680
How cute.

266
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,800
I've never seen Team Leader using her vacation.

267
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:22,110
I know. It's her first time since I came here.

268
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:23,960
Everything is okay with her, right?

269
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,480
Should we give her a call?

270
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,130
Hello.

271
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:30,150
Deputy Yun from the legal team.

272
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:31,440
What brings you here?

273
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,250
I saw the post on the company bulletin board.

274
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,060
I'm here to pick my stuff up.

275
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:38,560
Oh, the...

276
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,110
The capsule...

277
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:42,920
Yes, the capsule toy.

278
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:46,630
That's yours, Deputy Yun? Really?

279
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:48,100
Yes.

280
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:51,350
It's my hobby to collect these.

281
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,490
Would that be an issue?

282
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:56,320
- No, no. 
 - No.

283
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,960
It's so unexpected.

284
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,180
Carry on, then.

285
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:02,420
- Yes, see you. 
 - Take care.

286
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,800
 You left the toolbox at home. 

287
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,670
 Do you need it? 

288
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,250
Dad!

289
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,810
What? Why are you here?

290
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:40,400
Why? You were here alone all weekend.

291
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,880
I'll be here starting today. Go home.

292
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,420
You're studying for the exam. You don't have time.

293
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:48,630
You don't have time for this, either.

294
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:50,410
I can study here.

295
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,820
It's nicer than my tiny dorm.

296
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:55,870
Don't be silly and go study.

297
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:58,300
You aren't his only child.

298
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:01,430
- What? 
 - I'm his son, too.

299
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:05,650
And how will we survive if you get sick, too?

300
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:09,260
You pay for my tuition and rent.

301
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:13,020
I'll care for him. Go rest.

302
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,240
Stay just for today, then.

303
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,620
I was going to get a caretaker starting tomorrow.

304
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,020
Okay.

305
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,140
Don't leave him alone.

306
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,370
Make sure he eats a lot, too.

307
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:31,390
Okay.

308
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:33,760
Don't get lazy and call me if anything happens.

309
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,000
Okay, just leave—

310
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,010
Be quiet.

311
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:40,230
Sorry.

312
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:42,610
Don't eat Dad's food.

313
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:44,930
I just ate. I'm fine.

314
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:56,500
- Here. 
 - Sorry for bothering you.

315
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:00,200
By the way, why didn't you call the lawyer?

316
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,900
It was my fault. I told them to

317
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:04,660
compensate you when you called.

318
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:07,000
I ripped that business card.

319
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,010
You ripped the business card?

320
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:09,410
I was so pissed.

321
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:12,120
You know I'm kind of unhinged.

322
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:14,580
I'll compensate you now.

323
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,720
It's okay.

324
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,930
I sold the dress, not knowing it was a gift.

325
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:19,940
I have a conscience, too.

326
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:22,240
Okay, then.

327
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,140
I'll go now, then.

328
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:55,320
The window won't roll down.

329
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,130
Does anything work? Can you drive it?

330
00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:58,790
Of course. I drove it here.

331
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:01,450
It sometimes stops, but it's fine.

332
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:03,160
You call this fine?

333
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,250
As the future leader of Yongsung Motors,

334
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:07,390
I can't tolerate this.

335
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:09,100
Let's go to the service center immediately.

336
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:12,450
I'll just get it fixed later.

337
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:14,480
What if you get into an accident?

338
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,120
Who will care for you, then?

339
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,140
Unless you also want to end up hospitalized,

340
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:22,590
get out. Now.

341
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:32,320
How's your father doing?

342
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,030
He just needs to rest and recover.

343
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:38,460
Then I guess you won't have reason to cry again.

344
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:41,030
Who cried? Me?

345
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:42,460
You cried that day.

346
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:44,320
- Did you peep at me? 
 - I just happened to be watching.

347
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,800
No need to feel embarrassed.

348
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,440
Humans are inherently weak.

349
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,370
- I'm not weak. 
 - Sure.

350
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:54,560
It wasn't because of my dad.

351
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,170
I just...

352
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,720
I just thought of my childhood.

353
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:04,280
My mom was very sick when I was a kid.

354
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:07,490
She was stuck in the ward until she died.

355
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:10,620
I can't help but think of her

356
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:11,690
when I'm at the hospital.

357
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:14,100
Even though a lot of time has passed.

358
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:20,010
Time can't be a cure for all.

359
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:23,890
You need other comforts to heal and forget.

360
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,080
For example?

361
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:30,440
There's music, cartoons, and...

362
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,590
video games.

363
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:35,140
Video games. You're right.

364
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:37,840
Video games do suck you in.

365
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,430
I used to play a bit.

366
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:41,560
It's fun.

367
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:44,080
Although I was hurt by it.

368
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:48,960
- Hurt? 
 - You could say I was a scam victim.

369
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,930
It happens all the time.

370
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:59,050
Is there a serious problem?

371
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:03,810
They can't believe the car works.

372
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:07,260
Would you donate it to the Yongsung Car Museum?

373
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,200
No, I won't.

374
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:19,750
Use this car from now on.

375
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:20,910
Pardon?

376
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:22,800
A car this nice?

377
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,100
I don't want to. No.

378
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,280
I'm letting you rent it under my name.

379
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,630
Return it once the repair is done.

380
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:31,790
But still. It's too much.

381
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:35,570
I'm really okay. I can commute by bus.

382
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:43,650
I'm being generous and kind as a boss.

383
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:45,690
Just accept it.

384
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,610
That's your concept?

385
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:53,080
You need a car when your father gets discharged.

386
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,480
She's refusing this car?

387
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:00,390
She'd like it once she drives it.

388
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:03,830
Pardon?

389
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,910
A new car sure is nice.

390
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:13,580
I didn't think he was like this.

391
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:16,030
How unexpected.

392
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:31,440
   

393
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,410
   

394
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:35,770
I got one from them, too.

395
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:40,050
   

396
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,970
Why haven't there been any updates?

397
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:45,820
What's going on?

398
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:49,610
It takes 40 minutes to get to the event venue

399
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:51,360
from the airport.

400
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,520
You can finish the report during that time.

401
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,460
Okay.

402
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:59,300
- My gosh. 
  - It's Jason! 

403
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:01,750
 Gosh! 

404
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,040
What in the world?

405
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:11,330
They're blinded by love.

406
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:15,020
I'm sorry. It's my son's fault.

407
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:17,160
I told you to watch where you go.

408
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:20,120
Go ahead and apologize.

409
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:23,320
- I'm scared. 
 - Goodness, come on.

410
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,130
It's our fault. I'll compensate you.

411
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:28,840
It's okay.

412
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,450
A child can make a mistake.

413
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:31,990
It wasn't totally his fault.

414
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:34,050
And the tablet can be repaired.

415
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:35,630
I'm not sure if you know,

416
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:37,170
but Yongsung repairs

417
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:39,950
tablets for free for six months.

418
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:43,080
Can it be fixed?

419
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,760
Everything is possible at Yongsung.

420
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,970
If you feel bad,

421
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:47,850
only purchase our products from now on.

422
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:50,730
That'd be enough compensation for me.

423
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:52,260
Let's go.

424
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,560
Use mine for now.

425
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,380
Should I download the report?

426
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:59,740
I only saved it on the device for security.

427
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:02,330
It's only on the office computer now.

428
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:04,030
I'll call the secretary's office.

429
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:06,150
Okay.

430
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:07,300
No.

431
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:10,440
No, no, no!

432
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,420
You don't have to call.

433
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:20,230
I realized I saved it on my phone, too.

434
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:24,090
You definitely are thorough.

435
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:26,220
There's still time.

436
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,070
Nothing happened to you, right?

437
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:33,660
We were worried that you suddenly took a day off.

438
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:36,020
Nothing happened.

439
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:40,270
Is the new shop list for the Gangnam store not ready?

440
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:42,340
We asked the business team a while ago.

441
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:46,450
They said the director is looking through it first.

442
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:47,950
Oh, really?

443
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:49,430
Yes.

444
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:53,600
   

445
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:56,600
Just one moment.

446
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:58,910
Baek Su Jeong speaking.

447
00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:00,650
 Ms. Baek. 

448
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:02,240
Yes.

449
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,410
 Listen to me without getting the wrong idea. 

450
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:08,790
 This is very important. 

451
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,730
Starting now, our relationship...

452
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:16,340
might be irreversible.

453
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:27,250
   

454
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:34,740
 You need the file on the desktop, right? 

455
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:36,780
I heard you.

456
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:41,110
If I reveal the password, you won't sue me but murder me, right?

457
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:43,920
 Ask someone else if you don't trust me. 

458
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,760
That can't be done.

459
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,120
The computer is on.

460
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,160
Give me the password.

461
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:55,890
Orewa.

462
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:57,930
Type that in Korean, right?

463
00:31:57,930 --> 00:31:59,920
Ore...

464
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:06,940
Orewa...

465
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,050
Akumada.

466
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:15,370
   

467
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,140
 Is that Japanese? 

468
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:22,330
Orewa what?

469
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:26,800
Akumada.

470
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:30,210
Akuma.

471
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:32,300
Huh? That's not it.

472
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,770
Are you doing this on purpose?

473
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:35,490
You said it's urgent.

474
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:38,280
Say it again slowly and clearly.

475
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:41,910
Orewa...

476
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:43,410
Akuma...

477
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:46,150
Akumada. Orewa akumada!

478
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:47,570
I am the devil. Get it?

479
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:49,840
Okay? Do you understand?

480
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:59,340
I'll email you right now.

481
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,910
Sumimasen*. 
  (Sorry in Japanese) 

482
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:22,390
   

483
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:23,800
   

484
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,050
   

485
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:30,990
That's good enough.

486
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:32,270
Thank you.

487
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:36,670
And before you start the project,

488
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:39,190
do an internal check, too.

489
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:41,390
You know how, right?

490
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:43,900
I'm already preparing one.

491
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:49,980
   

492
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:51,490
 Wow. 
   

493
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:53,730
 Hey, this place is amazing. 

494
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:56,540
I acknowledge Kim Sin Won's taste.

495
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:01,850
Are you really not going to respond to Eun Hee?

496
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:03,560
She even called me.

497
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,990
She wants to see you.

498
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:07,730
We broke up. What's the point?

499
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:10,580
Cold bastard. You said you loved her.

500
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:14,090
How can you cut someone off like that?

501
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:16,680
I can. I have no feelings left.

502
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:19,060
You aren't desperate at all.

503
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:22,110
It's because you have too many women.

504
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:26,370
Even the veggies are tasty.

505
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:27,900
- Crazy, right? 
 - Yes.

506
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:30,560
Wow, the shop became flashy.

507
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,290
Did someone gift you all this?

508
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:33,690
It's from Black Dragon.

509
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:35,930
Were you in a gang?

510
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:39,540
Did you use a knife on something else besides fish?

511
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,190
Why? Does that turn you on?

512
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:45,830
I guess you could say that.

513
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:47,510
You have a strange taste.

514
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:48,980
It's 80,000 won.

515
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:51,310
Okay. Here.

516
00:34:57,490 --> 00:34:59,470
 Akumada. Orewa akumada! 

517
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:00,780
 I am the devil. Get it? 

518
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:03,100
 Okay? Do you understand? 

519
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:13,680
Gosh, he's really something.

520
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,030
I am the devil?

521
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:16,950
What? What are you laughing about?

522
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:18,580
Don't be weird.

523
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:19,680
None of your business.

524
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,950
Why do you keep coming here and not to your dorm?

525
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:24,020
Is it because it's a VIP ward?

526
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,630
I like it better here.

527
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:27,510
You go home.

528
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:33,450
Is he pitiful or shameless?

529
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:37,490
I'm not satisfied for some reason.

530
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:40,190
You should've said it sooner.

531
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:41,880
I already called a driver, you jerk.

532
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,290
It's not that.

533
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:46,040
I turned around, but I keep thinking of her

534
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,550
and I want to see her again.

535
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:51,490
Eun Hee? You're back to your senses.

536
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:54,730
Go now. You said you loved her a lot.

537
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:56,130
Does it mean I love her?

538
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:58,650
Isn't that obvious?

539
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:03,340
I guess so.

540
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:08,100
♫  It's hard being in pain  ♫

541
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:11,840
♫  Whenever I see you like that  ♫

542
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,620
3, 2, 1!

543
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:15,540
♫  Be mine  ♫

544
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:19,230
♫  I love you  ♫

545
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:22,870
♫  I worry for you  ♫

546
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:27,970
♫  I'll take care of you until the end  ♫

547
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:30,320
♫  Be mine  ♫

548
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,970
♫  You know me  ♫

549
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:37,580
♫  You have seen me, OH!  ♫

550
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:44,570
♫  I will protect you until the end  ♫

551
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:46,550
Wow.

552
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:48,800
Did you leave something?

553
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:54,940
I wanted to find out something today.

554
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:59,220
Your name.

555
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:00,840
All of a sudden?

556
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:04,370
Here.

557
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:07,000
Seo Ha Jin. 
    

558
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,820
I'm Kim Shin Won.

559
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,670
Oh, I see.

560
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:13,010
Why do you want to know my name?

561
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:14,440
Ha Jin.

562
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,360
Yes?

563
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,250
Do you want to go out with me?

564
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:22,570
I had to know your name to ask you out.

565
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:26,130
You're more formal than I thought.

566
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:28,590
- If so— 
 - It's a no.

567
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:32,520
- What did you say? 
 - It's a no, I said.

568
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:39,510
I may look impatient and unserious.

569
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:43,380
But I've never fallen in love at first sight, kept thinking about someone,

570
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:47,030
or asked someone out first.

571
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:50,400
That means my feelings for you are serious.

572
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,600
I'm not sure if you'd believe me.

573
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,850
- I do. 
 - Pardon?

574
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:56,710
I have no reason not to believe you.

575
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:59,230
But it's still a no.

576
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:03,310
- W-Why? 
 - Do people usually say yes to you?

577
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:07,380
I can't just date anyone I like.

578
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:09,020
I suppose...

579
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:12,030
I'm not interested in dating for a while.

580
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:14,730
By chance,

581
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:17,250
did you get divorced recently?

582
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:20,250
To be honest, I find it to be a bother.

583
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:24,420
Would it be better to blame it on a painful divorce?

584
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:29,760
No, okay. I can't help that.

585
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:50,420
Did you take care of everything yesterday?

586
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:52,070
Yes, I suppose.

587
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:55,440
Shouldn't you change the password?

588
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,830
"I am the devil."

589
00:38:57,830 --> 00:39:01,190
It doesn't go with the image you go for.

590
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:02,340
I'll manage it myself.

591
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,690
But you couldn't yesterday.

592
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:08,820
I'll manage it myself from now on.

593
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:11,430
Let's cut the nonsense and start.

594
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:14,740
Drink this. 
    

595
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,180
I'm okay.

596
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:23,600
You don't seem to drink anything at work.

597
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,040
That's why I brought it.

598
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,490
I'll say I drank it.

599
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:53,440
It's so delicious.

600
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:10,810
I was annoyed you kept finding out my secrets,

601
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,910
but having one person

602
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:17,460
who knows isn't bad.

603
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,490
 This is a secret, but... 

604
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:27,770
 I miss my mom more today 

605
00:40:27,770 --> 00:40:30,070
 because it's her birthday. 

606
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:31,800
 I see. 

607
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,300
 But why is that a secret? 

608
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:38,140
 Because it makes my dad sad. 

609
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:43,600
 But I'm happy I could tell someone now. 

610
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:47,850
 You can tell me anything. 

611
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:03,230
   

612
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:05,810
   

613
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:12,420
Am I here too early?

614
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:14,940
 Send it like that. 

615
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,480
Okay.

616
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:22,520
Huh?

617
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:27,390
Huh?

618
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:30,140
Black Dragon!

619
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:31,840
It's you, right?

620
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:40,870
You've grown a lot, Black Dragon.

621
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:42,410
 I almost didn't recognize you. 
   

622
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:44,290
 I'm an adult, too, now. 

623
00:41:44,290 --> 00:41:46,150
 Why did you have to lie, then? 

624
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:48,970
 You shouldn't have come and got caught. 

625
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:52,350
 I thought my appearance wouldn't matter, 

626
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:54,800
 but it did. 

627
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,490
 Hey, from her perspective— 

628
00:41:57,490 --> 00:41:59,560
 It's okay. 

629
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:02,870
 I don't need a human to understand me anymore. 

630
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:06,220
 I'm here to apologize to you. 

631
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:09,420
 I haven't been in touch for personal reasons. 

632
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:11,560
I couldn't game, either.

633
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:14,320
 It's okay. It's all in the past. 

634
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:18,500
 I know it's late, but I apologize for hurting the team. 

635
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:21,320
 I thought I should tell you before I left Korea. 

636
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:23,560
 You're leaving? Where? 

637
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,850
 I'm studying in the US. 

638
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:29,020
 And I won't be seeing you like this anymore. 

639
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:31,530
 Why not? Will you stay there? 

640
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:34,840
 You'll learn my true identity someday. 

641
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:38,010
 You'll know why I couldn't see you. 

642
00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:40,510
 Because we live in different worlds. 

643
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:42,380
 What are you, anyway? 

644
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:44,620
 Are you a spy? An alien? 

645
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:46,130
 Don't try to find out. 

646
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:49,880
 Don't acknowledge me even if you run into me. 

647
00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:53,310
 Okay, then. 

648
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:55,260
 I don't have to see you. 

649
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:58,370
 Aren't you planning to game anymore? 

650
00:42:58,370 --> 00:43:02,330
 Can you help me only in team battles? 

651
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:08,420
 I'll think about it. 

652
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:11,810
 Okay, okay. Think about it. 

653
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:16,950
Do you work around here?

654
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:18,190
Your suit looks nice.

655
00:43:18,190 --> 00:43:20,920
I said not to acknowledge me if you ran into me.

656
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:22,410
Did you forget?

657
00:43:22,410 --> 00:43:23,880
Oh...

658
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:25,740
Did you say that?

659
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:28,380
I was happy to see you after all this time.

660
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:30,590
You sent me opening gifts, too.

661
00:43:30,590 --> 00:43:33,280
I couldn't just ignore you.

662
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,080
By the way,

663
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:38,150
do we have to talk like this?

664
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:40,260
I don't think your shop is nearby.

665
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:42,300
What are you doing here?

666
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,760
Did you follow me because

667
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,080
you found out who I am?

668
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:47,660
Why would I follow you?

669
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:50,320
I had a reason to be here.

670
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:51,880
I'll believe you, then.

671
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:55,690
I hope you don't make the same mistake again.

672
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:58,170
Okay, then.

673
00:43:58,170 --> 00:44:00,270
I will not talk to you then.

674
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:01,420
Okay, okay.

675
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:04,420
I won't acknowledge you again. I swear.

676
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,760
Bye, Black Dragon.

677
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:14,050
Don't call me that, either.

678
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:18,870
What do I call you? I don't know your name.

679
00:44:18,870 --> 00:44:20,940
What's his deal, anyway?

680
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:23,650
Is he in a gang or a cult?

681
00:44:27,690 --> 00:44:29,200
Unni.

682
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,240
You must've waited a long time.

683
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:33,350
Yes.

684
00:44:33,350 --> 00:44:35,000
No.

685
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,310
Huh?

686
00:44:36,310 --> 00:44:38,120
Yes, drink it.

687
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:41,090
- Let's go. 
 - Should I finish this?

688
00:44:41,090 --> 00:44:43,120
No, let's go. I'm hungry.

689
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:45,930
You should've told me your dad was hospitalized.

690
00:44:45,930 --> 00:44:47,270
Is he okay?

691
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:49,500
Yeah. Don't worry. He's coming home in two days.

692
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:51,820
We could've canceled our dinner.

693
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:53,270
Don't you have to go?

694
00:44:53,270 --> 00:44:55,060
I can have dinner and go.

695
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:57,090
I've been eating at the hospital lately.

696
00:44:57,090 --> 00:44:59,270
I want something tasty for a change.

697
00:44:59,270 --> 00:45:01,490
You're unbelievable.

698
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:04,130
You must've suffered alone again.

699
00:45:04,130 --> 00:45:06,880
Su Bin is all grown up.

700
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:10,730
And I received unexpected help, too.

701
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:13,790
- Help? 
 - Yes.

702
00:45:13,790 --> 00:45:17,660
The director ended up helping us.

703
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:19,300
The...

704
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:22,600
psycho, thug, or scammer...

705
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:25,440
What was it? Anyway, that guy?

706
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,900
He's not that bad.

707
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:30,460
He's just a regular psycho.

708
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:33,810
He's funny, too.

709
00:45:34,510 --> 00:45:36,190
Are you...

710
00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:39,300
still not interested in dating?

711
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:41,580
Huh? All of a sudden?

712
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:43,460
How many times did I tell you? I'm not.

713
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:46,940
Seeing someone inferior to me is a burden.

714
00:45:50,570 --> 00:45:52,420
I mean it.

715
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:55,270
I prefer being alone.

716
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:58,350
Gosh, I'm hungry.

717
00:45:58,350 --> 00:46:00,620
Why isn't the line moving?

718
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:03,740
Do some research to attract customers to the shop.

719
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:04,800
I don't need them.

720
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,430
I do, okay?

721
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:09,330
Where will I eat free if you run out of business?

722
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:16,010
Maybe photos really are important.

723
00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:18,360
Of course, they are.

724
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,040
Really?

725
00:46:32,230 --> 00:46:33,500
 Honey. 

726
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:35,040
Yes.

727
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,190
Do you need help?

728
00:46:37,190 --> 00:46:40,590
No, no, no. Tonight, you should

729
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:43,600
let me cook for you.

730
00:46:44,490 --> 00:46:45,690
Okay.

731
00:46:45,690 --> 00:46:47,890
This is perfectly seasoned, too.

732
00:46:47,890 --> 00:46:50,020
- Tasty, right? 
 - Yes.

733
00:46:50,930 --> 00:46:54,070
How's Ju Yeon? Is he doing well at work?

734
00:46:54,070 --> 00:46:55,620
Of course. You know him.

735
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:58,430
He's smart, thorough, capable, and cute.

736
00:46:58,430 --> 00:47:00,120
Stay close to him.

737
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:02,640
As if we're brothers?

738
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:07,720
Dad, I think your order is here.

739
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:08,780
Really?

740
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:11,200
There it is.

741
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,740
Seriously. Every day is a special day.

742
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:17,620
This is why I know all the flower meanings.

743
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:19,710
Are you jealous, son?

744
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:21,480
Then, you should settle down, too.

745
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:23,430
Don't be such a heartbreaker.

746
00:47:23,430 --> 00:47:27,450
Break hearts? I said I get dumped all the time.

747
00:47:27,450 --> 00:47:29,790
Come on, punk!

748
00:47:30,870 --> 00:47:33,190
Honey, it's here.

749
00:47:33,190 --> 00:47:35,790
Congratulations.

750
00:47:35,790 --> 00:47:38,870
Gosh, I'm depressed.

751
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:54,660
 Why did you cry? 

752
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:56,360
 I was cutting an onion. 

753
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:57,890
 I said, "Why did you cry?" 

754
00:47:57,890 --> 00:48:00,310
 I said, "It's because of an onion." 

755
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:02,570
 Am I an onion? 

756
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:09,940
 Sulo's new dish. 

757
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:13,590
 Tear-jerkingly delicious onion soup. 

758
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:24,750
What...

759
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:37,510
What is it all of a sudden?

760
00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:40,340
The shop list from the business team.

761
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:42,070
Is it the final version?

762
00:48:42,070 --> 00:48:44,690
There are too many absurd brands.

763
00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:47,690
Gangnam store's sales will go down at this rate.

764
00:48:47,690 --> 00:48:50,650
Those absurd brands were all

765
00:48:50,650 --> 00:48:52,030
recommended by the director.

766
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:54,350
That's why no one can say anything.

767
00:48:54,350 --> 00:48:57,920
He's busy benefiting himself using his power.

768
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,040
Go argue with him instead.

769
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:02,620
Don't blame an innocent person.

770
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:04,290
Is that true?

771
00:49:04,290 --> 00:49:05,830
Why?

772
00:49:05,830 --> 00:49:09,120
Can't challenge the chairman's grandson, either?

773
00:49:16,890 --> 00:49:17,860
Did your father—

774
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:20,010
The new shops for the Gangnam store.

775
00:49:20,010 --> 00:49:22,990
Is it true you chose them?

776
00:49:22,990 --> 00:49:25,580
Yes. Is there an issue?

777
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:27,650
Yes, there are so many issues.

778
00:49:27,650 --> 00:49:30,420
Even you can't make decisions like that.

779
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:33,610
Are you disobeying my decision?

780
00:49:36,210 --> 00:49:38,980
Becoming the perfect successor...

781
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:43,280
Is this what you meant by that?

782
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,570
That's it for today.

783
00:49:58,570 --> 00:50:03,250
Any more concerns about the Gangnam store shops?

784
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:11,570
Let's proceed, then.

785
00:50:11,570 --> 00:50:13,220
No, hold on.

786
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:16,010
Three of the new brands are lesser-known

787
00:50:16,010 --> 00:50:18,130
and their sales rate is low, too.

788
00:50:18,130 --> 00:50:21,660
They don't fit the target customers, either.

789
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:23,300
I don't think they belong in

790
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:25,320
Yongsung Department Store.

791
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:28,810
I'm curious why you want them, Director.

792
00:50:30,310 --> 00:50:32,830
Are you the only one

793
00:50:32,830 --> 00:50:35,390
who's curious about that?

794
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:41,610
Everyone must've found it problematic.

795
00:50:41,610 --> 00:50:43,980
You should've complained.

796
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:46,300
But everyone kept quiet.

797
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:48,710
I see how you've been performing.

798
00:50:48,710 --> 00:50:50,450
You've been so laid back

799
00:50:50,450 --> 00:50:52,310
that you fell for a trap like this.

800
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:54,480
You were just following my decision?

801
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,170
I don't need an excuse like that.

802
00:50:56,170 --> 00:51:00,320
The company's gain is more important to me.

803
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:03,360
I hope you learned what the priority is

804
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:05,820
going forward.

805
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:11,470
Individual reviews will start tomorrow

806
00:51:11,470 --> 00:51:13,770
based on your performance.

807
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:15,940
That's it for today's meeting.

808
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,980
Did Team Leader Baek leave?

809
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:34,460
No, she was getting some fresh air.

810
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:37,340
Thanks for the good info.

811
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:51,060
Why do you look upset?

812
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:53,870
Is there still an issue?

813
00:51:53,870 --> 00:51:56,250
Could you stand away from me?

814
00:51:56,250 --> 00:51:59,640
I don't want to grab a director's collar again.

815
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:02,180
Have you done that?

816
00:52:03,130 --> 00:52:05,460
I don't think I've done anything that bad.

817
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:09,400
I don't like it when someone tests me.

818
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:11,000
I only did what was necessary.

819
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,250
I know, but I'm offended by it.

820
00:52:15,870 --> 00:52:18,360
How can I make you feel better?

821
00:52:22,090 --> 00:52:24,560
What do you do to lift your mood?

822
00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:31,660
Leave me alone. I can do it myself.

823
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:36,790
I don't want to.

824
00:52:39,670 --> 00:52:42,680
Because the only one who'd give me

825
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:45,210
chocolate milk is you, Ms. Baek.

826
00:52:58,870 --> 00:53:01,230
You said you used to like to play games.

827
00:53:01,230 --> 00:53:04,460
I said I don't because I've been scammed.

828
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:06,640
That's an online game. We're at an arcade.

829
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:08,760
You won't get scammed.

830
00:53:09,450 --> 00:53:13,060
A raise would've made me happy immediately.

831
00:53:14,030 --> 00:53:17,200
What? You've never seen someone shallow?

832
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:20,760
By the way, can you be here?

833
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:22,600
What if people see you?

834
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:25,120
I'll say I'm researching the entertainment market.

835
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:27,810
Since I'm here with you.

836
00:53:27,810 --> 00:53:32,100
You're using me for personal enjoyment, right?

837
00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:03,980
 ­  

838
00:54:04,870 --> 00:54:06,950
  ­ 

839
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:12,780
  ­ 

840
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:14,700
Didn't you play this as a kid?

841
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:16,590
Maybe you were too young...

842
00:54:16,590 --> 00:54:18,300
  ­ 

843
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,970
  ­ 

844
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:28,170
 ­  

845
00:54:30,530 --> 00:54:33,340
Move. You're about to die.

846
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:37,230
 ­  

847
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:40,800
 ­  

848
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:51,990
 ­  

849
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:09,430
Seriously. You're terrible.

850
00:55:09,430 --> 00:55:13,660
I couldn't showcase my full potential because of my uncomfortable clothes.

851
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:16,250
And you're way too good, too.

852
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:18,150
Is this all you ever do?

853
00:55:18,150 --> 00:55:19,770
I practiced for about a week.

854
00:55:19,770 --> 00:55:22,250
There was a sixth grader who bothered me.

855
00:55:22,250 --> 00:55:24,160
I wanted to defeat him completely.

856
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:26,180
I hate losing.

857
00:55:26,180 --> 00:55:28,350
You think I like losing?

858
00:55:28,350 --> 00:55:30,070
We'll do what I'm good at next.

859
00:55:30,070 --> 00:55:31,800
Let's go.

860
00:55:33,150 --> 00:55:34,800
Fine.

861
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:39,400
♫  To be honest, I don't know, oh, no  ♫

862
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:41,790
I can totally finish him up.

863
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:44,350
Down here.

864
00:55:44,350 --> 00:55:46,120
There's one up there, too.

865
00:55:47,930 --> 00:55:51,050
♫  My heart pounds foolishly when I see you  ♫

866
00:55:51,050 --> 00:55:54,080
♫  I try to be mean out of pride  ♫

867
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:56,940
♫  It's not the truth, the last exclamation  ♫

868
00:55:56,940 --> 00:56:01,340
♫  I'm going up because I'm in love  ♫

869
00:56:01,340 --> 00:56:03,120
♫  Destiny is playing tricks  ♫

870
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:06,570
♫  It's like magic  ♫

871
00:56:06,570 --> 00:56:09,450
♫  Maybe we are  ♫

872
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:14,850
♫  Keep falling to love, oh, tonight  ♫

873
00:56:14,850 --> 00:56:17,170
♫  Shine a light on my heart  ♫

874
00:56:17,170 --> 00:56:20,930
♫  Shine me, shine a light  ♫

875
00:56:20,930 --> 00:56:26,100
♫  Keep falling to love, oh, tonight  ♫

876
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:29,230
   

877
00:56:29,230 --> 00:56:31,170
6:3.

878
00:56:31,170 --> 00:56:33,550
Accept your defeat now.

879
00:56:33,550 --> 00:56:37,230
One more. One more game, please?

880
00:56:42,730 --> 00:56:44,930
Okay. But...

881
00:56:46,230 --> 00:56:48,150
we'll play that.

882
00:56:50,210 --> 00:56:52,590
That'd be too disadvantageous to you.

883
00:56:52,590 --> 00:56:55,470
That's what makes me angry.

884
00:56:55,470 --> 00:56:57,280
That I have a disadvantage.

885
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:59,340
I'll get good if I try a few more times.

886
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:01,240
The humiliation from earlier...

887
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:04,360
I'll pay you back.

888
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:19,360
Gosh.

889
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:21,900
   

890
00:57:25,030 --> 00:57:27,130
Hey. Hello?

891
00:57:27,130 --> 00:57:28,360
Hey, Unni.

892
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:30,830
What? Why are you so out of breath?

893
00:57:30,830 --> 00:57:32,430
Well...

894
00:57:32,430 --> 00:57:33,540
I was playing a game.

895
00:57:33,540 --> 00:57:36,730
 A game? You said you'd never do it again. 

896
00:57:36,730 --> 00:57:40,910
My boss wanted to play with me.

897
00:57:40,910 --> 00:57:43,370
Is it the director, by chance?

898
00:57:43,370 --> 00:57:45,900
Yes. Why did you call, by the way?

899
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:48,100
 I was going to ask you to come here for dinner, 

900
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:49,000
 but it's okay. 

901
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,560
Or bring him along.

902
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:53,000
Huh?

903
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:01,640
What's the name of the business?

904
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:03,770
It might be a place I know.

905
00:58:03,770 --> 00:58:05,950
You probably don't.

906
00:58:05,950 --> 00:58:07,480
I wonder if it's because it's out of the way.

907
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:08,910
For some reason, they don't get customers.

908
00:58:08,910 --> 00:58:09,970
But the food is good.

909
00:58:09,970 --> 00:58:11,690
Are you sure?

910
00:58:11,690 --> 00:58:14,020
I have a very high standard.

911
00:58:14,020 --> 00:58:17,690
Eat at home, then. I'll go alone.

912
00:58:19,090 --> 00:58:21,110
Let's give it a shot.

913
00:58:41,550 --> 00:58:43,190
I can do it myself.

914
00:58:43,190 --> 00:58:46,730
How hard did you try to defeat me?

915
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:51,460
I can say the same to you.

916
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:59,720
All done.

917
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,550
- Unni, I'm in the front— 
  - Don't come. 

918
00:59:32,250 --> 00:59:35,240
- What? 
  - Black Dragon is here. 

919
00:59:44,030 --> 00:59:54,030


920
00:59:59,710 --> 01:00:02,800
   

921
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:04,700
♫  I can't get over you  ♫

922
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:07,660
♫  So, here I am  ♫

923
01:00:07,660 --> 01:00:09,860

924
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:13,160

925
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:15,120
♫  I can't get over you  ♫

926
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:18,070
♫  So, here I am  ♫

927
01:00:18,070 --> 01:00:23,300
♫  Not gonna lose you this time  ♫

928
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:33,950
 Black Dragon is Su Jeong's director? 

929
01:00:33,950 --> 01:00:36,740
 Team Leader Baek left to convince them. 

930
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:37,680
 Alone? 

931
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:38,680
 You're from Yongsung. 

932
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:40,340
 Can you sell our products? 

933
01:00:40,340 --> 01:00:42,240
 You came to help me? 

934
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:43,600
 He's my little brother. 

935
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:45,450
 A boyfriend can be younger. 

936
01:00:45,450 --> 01:00:47,020
 Why am I a little brother? 

937
01:00:47,020 --> 01:00:48,940
 Why does he keep confusing me? 

938
01:00:48,940 --> 01:00:52,190
 Isn't working alone hard? It's lonely, too. 

939
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:54,170
 By the way, 

940
01:00:54,170 --> 01:00:57,000
 are you interested in me? 

941
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:01,700
♫  I promise I'm gonna say this all I wanted is you  ♫

942
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:07,790
♫  If I could go back in your time to fix it  ♫
