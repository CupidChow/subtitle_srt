00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,990
You worked hard last night.

188
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,340
Is that it?

189
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,430
And if you're okay-

190
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:12,240
If I'm okay?

191
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,950
If you're okay, would you like to

192
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:18,820
listen to my music?

193
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:24,320
Yes.

194
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,730
Sure, go ahead.

195
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,930
Play the song I was listening to.

196
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:41,100
<i>I'll play Crackshot's "Follow Me."</i>

197
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:48,760
♫ <i>Follow, follow, follow, follow me</i> ♫

198
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:15,930
♫ <i>For a while, I've been watching you</i> ♫

199
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:18,820
♫ <i>It's okay to be awkward</i> ♫

200
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:23,630
♫ <i>Let the music carry your body</i> ♫

201
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:28,050
♫ <i>It gets cold when the morning comes</i> ♫

202
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:31,840
♫ <i>The light that shines on today</i> ♫

203
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:35,070
<i>When will he talk to me, anyway?</i>

204
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:37,010
♫ <i>Like this. Like this.</i> ♫

205
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:39,710
♫ <i>Tonight. It's party time.</i> ♫

206
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:44,310
♫ <i>Follow, follow, follow, follow me</i> ♫

207
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:02,870
I'll let you go in now.

208
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:06,930
Will you really leave like this?

209
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:11,400
I forgot something important.

210
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:29,400
That's it, right?

211
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,180
See you on Monday.

212
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,540
What do you mean, that's it?

213
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:36,650
What happened last night. Will you...

214
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:39,520
Will you just let it slide?

215
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,320
You should explain yourself or something.

216
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,850
It's already in the past. Is it necessary?

217
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:48,460
Let go of small mistakes like that.

218
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:50,370
Mistake?

219
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:54,790
Yes, a mistake we made while we were drunk.

220
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:57,300
Wasn't it the same to you?

221
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,520
Right.

222
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,850
Mistake.

223
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,580
It was a mistake and an accident.

224
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:09,000
I'm not that crazy of a person.

225
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,260
As you know,

226
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:14,150
I don't think of you as a man at all.

227
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:19,480
Why would you suddenly say that?

228
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,360
Did I beg you to think of me as a man?

229
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,890
I would've forgiven you if you begged.

230
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,580
What?

231
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,430
I look manly.

232
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,490
He's crazy.

233
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:47,300
Ignore a mistake like that?

234
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:50,750
He kisses when he's drunk. He's the player.

235
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:04,510
Why is she angry, exactly?

236
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,940
The makgeolli.

237
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:30,000
It doesn't go well with me.

238
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,290
I fell asleep waiting for her call.

239
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:39,450
She left me alone that night.

240
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:45,370
Am I not the one who should be angry?

241
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,170
Su Jeong.

242
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:05,250
Su Jeong?

243
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,920
Hey, Dad. Did you call me?

244
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,400
You skipped dinner. What are you doing?

245
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,090
The door is acting up.

246
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:13,520
You don't even use it.

247
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,450
I'm just...

248
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:18,040
a bit angry,

249
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,770
but I can't blast someone's head.

250
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,310
Why?

251
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,310
Is it noisy? Should I stop?

252
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:27,460
No, no. It's okay. Go ahead.

253
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:29,170
Do whatever you want to do, sweetheart.

254
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:30,500
Okay.

255
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,980
Yes, I'm the same.

256
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:06,110
I was drunk by the alcohol and atmosphere and ki-

257
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:09,970
That's no big deal.

258
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,940
It was just a mistake of one night.

259
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,360
Yes.

260
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:20,620
Mistake?

261
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:28,200
Shouldn't he apologize if he made a mistake?

262
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,570
- Yes.
<i>- How can you sleep right now?</i>

263
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,810
Ms. Baek?

264
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:04,660
Is something going on at work?

265
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:07,160
Something's going on with us two.

266
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,600
I just can't believe what's going on.

267
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,070
<i>What happened yesterday... I mean, the day before.</i>

268
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:15,720
Can you just call it a mistake and move on?

269
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,140
What should I call it, then?

270
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:21,550
I'm being understanding. Why are you angry?

271
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:24,660
You're being understanding?

272
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:25,530
<i>Yes.</i>

273
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:27,320
You drank makgeolli by mistake

274
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,120
and we spent the night at the farm.

275
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,610
<i>I'm letting it go because it was a mistake.</i>

276
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:34,240
I'm being understanding. Very much so.

277
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,420
That's not what I'm talking about.

278
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:38,380
<i>Are you talking about that, then?</i>

279
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:40,220
Is it because you feel bad?

280
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,700
Apologize if you feel bad.

281
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,760
Don't get angry.

282
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,960
Seriously.

283
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,400
Are you telling me to apologize?

284
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,850
Should I, then?

285
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:51,090
You should since

286
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:52,960
you disappeared while drinking together.

287
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,100
<i>How could you leave someone who fell asleep</i>

288
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,170
<i>waiting for you?</i>

289
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:58,360
<i>I was so shocked when I woke up.</i>

290
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:01,150
I was cold, achy, and the bugs...

291
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:02,530
<i>It was unbelievable.</i>

292
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:04,620
<i>That's why I couldn't sleep well.</i>

293
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:05,790
Forget it.

294
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:08,800
I'll be understanding and let this go, too.

295
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:12,200
<i>Or did something else happen?</i>

296
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,270
Nothing happened.

297
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:29,100
He doesn't...

298
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:32,210
remember.

299
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:49,600
<i>He's not a man. He's the same age as Su Bin.</i>

300
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,910
<i>How could I think of him as a man?</i>

301
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:55,070
Thinking now, she said that back then, too.

302
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:58,030
On top of treating me like a little brother all day.

303
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:01,880
But why?

304
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:07,310
Why doesn't she think of me as a man?

305
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,200
One million and twenty-one.

306
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,520
She doesn't think of me as a man.

307
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,780
One million and twenty-two.

308
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:25,290
- She doesn't...
- One million and twenty-three.

309
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:31,660
She doesn't think of me...

310
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:37,240
You finally reached a million after three years.

311
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,880
You worked very hard.

312
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,470
One million and twenty-four.

313
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:42,510
Let's count from the beginning.

314
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:44,280
My next goal is two years.

315
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,840
Two years.

316
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,980
She doesn't think of me as a man.

317
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,330
- One.
- She does think of me as a man.

318
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:26,360
Why doesn't she think of me as a man?

319
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:30,380
Do I need to know what it means to be a man?

320
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,880
Chief Kwon,

321
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,410
you met your husband at your previous job.

322
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:45,330
He's a year younger than you.

323
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:47,770
Y-Yes, so?

324
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,520
When did you start...

325
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,450
thinking of him as a man?

326
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:02,390
Well, he was good at his job and...

327
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:04,880
I'm already perfect at that.

328
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,010
He spent money generously on me.

329
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:09,790
That's too easy.

330
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:12,570
Is that it?

331
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:14,060
He was very thoughtful.

332
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:18,080
Yes, that was the biggest factor.

333
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,250
I already do that, too.

334
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:25,810
But that was out of the blue.

335
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:31,100
You never asked me any personal questions.

336
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:34,440
Did something happen over...

337
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,800
the weekend?

338
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:41,870
It was a professional question.

339
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:45,900
Knowing you well is a part of my job, too.

340
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:49,010
Anyway, that's what you liked about him.

341
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,830
It's simple.

342
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,900
<i>He was good at his job and...</i>

343
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:05,040
<i>He spent money generously on me.</i>

344
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,500
<i>He was very thoughtful.</i>

345
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:10,530
<i>Yes, that was the biggest factor.</i>

346
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:39,510
Let's all check ourselves in the mirror.

347
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,480
[Yongsung Department Store Renewal Info]

348
00:25:57,450 --> 00:26:00,030
It's a shame just to use it as a lounge area.

349
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:02,340
Wouldn't it have a bigger role

350
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,590
in attracting new customers?

351
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:08,350
Yes, it'd be a shame not to utilize it.

352
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:12,580
Wow. You really have a good sense, Director.

353
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:16,330
What do you think, Team Leader Baek?

354
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:19,020
It sounds like a good idea.

355
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,720
I'll think about how we could use it.

356
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,320
Sounds good.

357
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,560
You haven't had lunch yet, right?

358
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,970
Pardon?

359
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,890
Yes.

360
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:32,060
Let's go to the Yongsung Hotel next door, then.

361
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,130
You have the renewal project on top of everything.

362
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:46,140
You're all working a lot.

363
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:49,600
I'll treat you to today's lunch for that reason.

364
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,290
This is Yongsung Hotel's pride,

365
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:54,630
The S-class Buffet.

366
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:57,100
Thank you.

367
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,540
Help yourselves, everyone.

368
00:26:58,540 --> 00:26:59,960
Thank you.

369
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,610
Thank you.

370
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:07,650
I prepared a lobster dish per person.

371
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,990
How much does all this cost?

372
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:24,770
It's at least 100,000 won per person.

373
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:27,410
He really must be the chairwoman's grandson.

374
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:30,690
He's using the chefs like his personal chefs.

375
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:33,430
Geez, and he works hard, too?

376
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:37,060
Gosh, I desperately want to get involved with him.

377
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:39,060
He'll be more popular than Chief Kim

378
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:40,440
from the design team.

379
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,200
I know.

380
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:06,810
I thought Director Ban was unfriendly.

381
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,570
But he knows how to do this, too.

382
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:11,660
He seems like a workaholic who doesn't date.

383
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:15,580
Whoever gets him would be striking gold, right?

384
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,620
Why are you suddenly telling me that?

385
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:20,680
You agree with each other often

386
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,540
and you seemed to get along.

387
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:25,900
I wondered if you were seeking a class upgrade.

388
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,310
I didn't think you were that type.

389
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:30,310
Of course, I'm not that type.

390
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:33,000
The director is just a boss to me.

391
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,790
I never considered him as a boyfriend or husband.

392
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,220
You can consider me, then.

393
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:46,200
You're the strategy team leader.

394
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,850
But you lack creativity.

395
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:01,100
<i>Enjoy.</i>

396
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,810
<i>Enjoy.</i>

397
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:04,460
Thank you, Director.

398
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:07,320
<i>Enjoy.</i>

399
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,360
Lack creativity?

400
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,080
He should worry about his memory.

401
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:22,420
- Yes, Unni.
<i>- Can you talk?</i>

402
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:24,280
Nothing happened last weekend, right?

403
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,260
- Like what?
- I was wondering

404
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:29,330
if anything happened on the way home.

405
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,680
Of course not.

406
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:35,150
Nothing would happen with that shitty, stupid player.

407
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:37,480
You said he didn't seem bad.

408
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,050
Are you back to normal now?

409
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:41,050
I added the "shitty, stupid" part.

410
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:43,680
What? Is that why you called?

411
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,060
No.

412
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:47,150
Do you want to go on a blind date?

413
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:49,480
<i>There's a great match for you.</i>

414
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,700
He's older, and he's a lawyer.

415
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,980
<i>He's understanding, dependable, and sweet.</i>

416
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,400
He's totally your type.

417
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:58,100
You'd better not say no.

418
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,890
Think about it.

419
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:01,470
Hey!

420
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:05,490
You! You! You little brat!

421
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:06,940
You go on a date instead.

422
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:08,800
Seriously! Gosh.

423
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,180
You little...

424
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:12,440
It hurts! I said I don't want to.

425
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,240
You're so immature.

426
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,170
That's why you divorced as soon as you married.

427
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:21,190
You're the same. You two. Seriously...

428
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:23,110
Why suddenly a blind date?

429
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:24,910
Team Leader.

430
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:26,740
Are you going on a blind date?

431
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,180
Great idea, Team Leader.

432
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:29,340
How old is he?

433
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,470
What's his occupation? Hold on.

434
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:33,070
He can't just have any job to be your match.

435
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:34,870
Is he handsome? He's tall, too, right?

436
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:35,830
How tall is he?

437
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:38,350
You need to check without shoes.

438
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:40,740
I haven't decided. I don't know yet-

439
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,510
Who's going on a blind date?

440
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:44,740
Team Leader is.

441
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:46,510
Is that true?

442
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:51,880
I asked if it was true.

443
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,080
Why do you want to know?

444
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:56,760
D-Don't worry, Director.

445
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:00,690
She won't slack off just because she's dating.

446
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:02,930
- Right?
- Director.

447
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:05,510
The Chairwoman wants to see you.

448
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:07,180
Team Leader Baek,

449
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:09,900
talk to me briefly before you leave for the day.

450
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:16,160
He looked happy earlier. How strange.

451
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:28,770
Congratulations.

452
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:33,660
The dream of your life will come true soon.

453
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:38,030
She told us to completely expose you to the media.

454
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:41,050
She's trying to make you the official successor.

455
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:44,530
I thought she'd wait for the renewal result.

456
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:46,290
It's sooner than I thought.

457
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:49,600
I think she's preparing ahead since it's going well.

458
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,890
Actually, when I was reporting to her,

459
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:55,510
she asked me about you.

460
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:57,360
What I thought watching you closely.

461
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:01,240
She asked if you're only focusing on work.

462
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:06,940
Since Yongsung is her life,

463
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:10,220
she wants the successor to be the same.

464
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:14,040
So, what did you tell her?

465
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,110
I told her the truth.

466
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:19,820
That no one focuses only on work like you.

467
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:23,190
You can just keep doing what you've been doing.

468
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:24,910
I guess so.

469
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:40,620
<i>I was thinking you and I are similar.</i>

470
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:54,300
<i>The director is just a boss to me.</i>

471
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:58,070
<i>I never considered him as a boyfriend or husband.</i>

472
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:02,820
<i>I hope I don't get disappointed.</i>

473
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:04,800
<i>Like I was before.</i>

474
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:15,250
I wasted time on silly stuff.

475
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,760
Wake up, Ban Ju Yeon.

476
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,230
Don't make another mistake.

477
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:32,270
It's well summarized.

478
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,720
That's it for the day.

479
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,540
Thank you.

480
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:39,820
Aren't you going home, Team Leader?

481
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:41,600
I'll stop by the director's office first.

482
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,030
Huh?

483
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:46,770
He won't yell at you about the blind date, right?

484
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:48,830
No way. It must be something else.

485
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:51,030
Right. Doesn't sound right.

486
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:53,590
Unless he's interested in you. Yes.

487
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:54,660
Right?

488
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:59,650
Yes. I'll get going now, then.

489
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:01,180
See you.

490
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,840
Jun Su!

491
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,200
Jun Su!

492
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,350
Jun Su.

493
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:10,680
Can I help you with something?

494
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,680
A man...

495
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:15,150
visited a woman late to warn her about a womanizer.

496
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:16,850
Why would he do that?

497
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:17,970
He's interested.

498
00:34:17,970 --> 00:34:20,000
And getting angry because I don't see him as a man?

499
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,990
- It's 100%.
- How about kissing while drunk?

500
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:23,600
And he forgot about it.

501
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,220
This isn't about you, right?

502
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,320
No, it isn't.

503
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,360
I'm talking about an anime. A romance anime.

504
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,540
I read it recently.

505
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:36,700
I can't understand the male lead's psychology.

506
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:40,050
I was wondering if you can.

507
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:43,190
Do you read anime, too? Are we having a pop-up?

508
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:44,370
You think I always work?

509
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:45,470
Of course not.

510
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:48,460
Your hobby is self-improvement. That's why.

511
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,490
Never mind, then.

512
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:54,600
By the way,

513
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,760
it's too obvious.

514
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,090
It's a cliche. A cliche.

515
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:00,420
The fact that he kissed.

516
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:02,550
He couldn't have actually forgotten.

517
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:04,970
He's pretending like he did.

518
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:07,410
Why is he pretending to have forgotten?

519
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:08,780
In case he gets rejected.

520
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:12,320
Male leads don't have the courage to speak first.

521
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,100
That's just how it is.

522
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:16,770
You can go home.

523
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:19,630
Okay. See you.

524
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:31,240
No wonder. I knew something was strange.

525
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,350
I didn't think he was like this.

526
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:37,120
But he had no courage, huh?

527
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,890
Come in.

528
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:54,310
You wanted to see me before I left.

529
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:00,140
What is it?

530
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:03,710
Are you concerned that I'm going on a blind date?

531
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:05,330
So, I can't date anyone?

532
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:07,430
No. As Deputy Yang said,

533
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:10,310
dating won't stop you from working hard.

534
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:12,190
I don't worry.

535
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:14,880
It's none of my business as your boss, either.

536
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:20,880
You can just be honest.

537
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:24,630
How could I be more honest?

538
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:26,040
Pardon?

539
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,380
Then...

540
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,810
why did you come all the way to my house?

541
00:36:32,810 --> 00:36:34,760
You told me not to date Chief Kim.

542
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,430
Because you really have to watch out for players.

543
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:38,990
So, I was warning you.

544
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:40,630
Anyone would've stopped you.

545
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:43,380
I was just being nice. Don't get the wrong idea.

546
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:45,770
The Chairwoman

547
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:48,320
praised you for signing with the Ganghan Farm.

548
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,770
You'll hear good news during the salary negotiation.

I'm happy.

[He Kisses for 6,000 Won]

559
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:07,830
You must kiss people to be nice.

560
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:09,660
- Kiss?
- Yes.

561
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:11,770
You got drunk and kissed me.

562
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:12,930
Am I still mistaken?

563
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:15,200
Didn't you confuse me?

564
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,110
I apologize if I did.

565
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:21,640
He's apologizing now?

566
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,190
But...

567
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:26,710
should you be so angry about that?

568
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:30,380
- Pardon?
- By chance, did you...

569
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:33,750
enjoy that kiss?

570
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,110
What's going on?

571
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:03,690
This. I wanted to give it back.

572
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,310
What's the money for?

573
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:07,820
Think of it as a rental fee.

574
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:09,750
Although I didn't want it.

575

And don't ever recommend cartoons like this to me.

576
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:15,680
It's so childish.

577
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,180
You learned about relationships this way.

578
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:19,400
No wonder you got dumped by your first love.

579
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,320
If an adult keeps reading stuff like this,

580
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,880
you'd keep getting dumped.

581
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,300
You'd get dumped forever.

582
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:27,040
I didn't tell you that to be mocked like this.

583
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,610
I'm also warning you to be nice.

584
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:30,270
I'm being nice.

585

I don't want money from someone

who doesn't understand its value.

588
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:41,840
You're the one who should improve your taste.

589
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,940
Because you have such poor taste,

590
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:46,910
you got scammed by your first love.

591
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,980

592

What?

599

You want to go on a blind date?

600
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,520
Yes.

601
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:49,200
At this rate,

602
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,350
I don't think they'd grow any closer.

I would've done nothing if I had known.

606
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:06,230
Ms. Baek would hate me for no reason.

But why have you been working here since earlier?

610

You followed me to the market last time.

611
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:20,640
Using this as an excuse, I wanted to help

612
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,460
and gain brownie points from you.

613
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:25,170
What would you want brownie points from me?

614
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:30,380

615

Oh, that?

616
00:41:32,850 --> 00:41:34,900
Did you forget I said no?

They say the third time is the charm.

I thought you were cooler than this.

619
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:46,000
I thought I was, too.

620
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:49,300
If that's why you come here,

621
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:51,590
I find it uncomfortable.

622
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:54,060
Did you like it that much that day?

623
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:57,070
Of course, I liked it, too.

624
00:41:58,270 --> 00:42:01,100
I think I could sleep with you again.

625
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:03,470
But not three times.

626
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:06,580
It'd feel like we're something, then.

Oppa.

630
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:36,860
Why did you come all the way here?

631
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:39,200
Because I couldn't reach you.

632

I know you're friendly and sweet.

636
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:49,490
I got jealous because I like you so much.

637
00:42:49,490 --> 00:42:53,990
And you suggested breaking up so easily?

638
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:56,870
- Huh?
- Eun Hee,

00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:02,940
To be happier as two than alone.

641
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:07,150
But you felt jealous and anxious being with me.

642

You think I was happy seeing you like that?

643
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:14,150

When you said you liked me,

647
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:27,840
I didn't check twice.

648
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,370
It's the same with the breakup.

It'd be entertaining to the current customers, too.

00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:46,220
Next is a performance from the violinist Yu Ri Ah,

732
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:49,160
one of our scholarship students.

733
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:59,180
When did you make time to do something so nice?

734
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:01,690
You're so impressive.

735
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:06,230
Yongsung must have no worries.

736
00:50:06,230 --> 00:50:08,590
You have such a great successor.

737
00:50:08,590 --> 00:50:10,330
Don't you agree?

738
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:16,010
Of course, Gureum Constructions has him, too.

739
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:19,300
Who said that?

740
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:21,760
- Pardon?
- Who said

741
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:25,820
my successor is Director Ban Ju Yeon here?

742
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:29,360
Of course, because he's your only grandson.

743
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:32,620
I raised Yongsung like a child.

744
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:35,780
No one can just become a successor

745
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:38,500
unless they can do as good of a job.

746
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:44,040
Only my late son could have.

747
00:50:46,270 --> 00:50:48,620
For the sake of the company,

748
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:50,020
I'm even considering

749
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:53,220
hiring a management specialist.

750
00:50:56,730 --> 00:50:58,730
Of course,

751
00:50:58,730 --> 00:51:02,380
Director Ban has been doing a great job.

752
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:05,890
So, I'm thinking of exposing him to the media, too.

753
00:51:05,890 --> 00:51:09,140
I'll let them know he's my grandson, too.

754
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:11,270
Oh, I see.

755
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:14,110
Congratulations.

756
00:51:15,250 --> 00:51:16,790
Thank you.

757
00:51:16,790 --> 00:51:18,740
Once your face is exposed,

758
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:22,010
you'll have to pay more attention to your behavior.

759
00:51:22,010 --> 00:51:23,510
Do you understand?

760
00:51:23,510 --> 00:51:25,200
Yes.

761
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:27,180
I'll keep that in mind.

♫ <i>The new sun will rise again today</i> ♫

764
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:57,020
Does the Chairwoman allow you to drink?

765
00:51:58,610 --> 00:52:00,740
Hey, what...

766
00:52:01,570 --> 00:52:05,210
You're scary when you stare like that.

767
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:09,080
What? Will you screw me over again?

768
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:14,250
You can't. The Chairwoman is still here.

769
00:52:14,250 --> 00:52:15,950
What if you cause trouble

770
00:52:15,950 --> 00:52:18,420
and failed to inherit the company?

771
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:20,220
You've been humoring the old lady all your life

772
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:22,610
cowering yourself at her mercy.

773
00:52:22,610 --> 00:52:25,140
Haven't you? Huh?

774
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:26,530
Huh?

775
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:30,010
Hey.

776
00:52:30,010 --> 00:52:33,300
Since I got to see it for the first time in a while,

777
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:36,690
it was such a blast.

778
00:52:36,690 --> 00:52:37,900
Ju Yeon,

779
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:41,270
I realized why you live like such a loser.

780
00:52:41,270 --> 00:52:44,360
I suddenly realized it. Really.

781
00:52:46,650 --> 00:52:48,890
You're the loser.

782
00:52:48,890 --> 00:52:51,030
Me? Me?

783
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:53,090
Why is that?

784
00:52:53,090 --> 00:52:55,410
You don't know how to read the room.

785
00:52:56,570 --> 00:52:59,420
I'm in a terrible mood right now.

786
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:13,960
Oh, no.

787
00:53:15,550 --> 00:53:17,690
The Chairwoman also taught me to squash

788
00:53:17,690 --> 00:53:19,610
anyone who provokes.

789
00:53:23,730 --> 00:53:27,000
Didn't you see your father wagging his tail at me?

790
00:53:29,550 --> 00:53:32,410
I'm trying to teach you, but you can't learn.

791
00:53:33,190 --> 00:53:35,340
What am I supposed to do?

792
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,850
There's a very famous cafe here.

793
00:53:53,850 --> 00:53:55,210
They're from Italy.

794
00:53:55,210 --> 00:53:57,670
This is the only store that has it.

795
00:53:57,670 --> 00:54:01,280
I know. I've always wanted to try it, too.

796
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,110
You should've told me.

797
00:54:03,110 --> 00:54:04,850
This is your workplace.

798
00:54:04,850 --> 00:54:08,320
I didn't think you'd want to come after work.

799
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:09,900
That's not true.

800
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:13,630
Visiting often as a customer helps, too.

801
00:54:13,630 --> 00:54:18,080
Even better to hear a real customer's opinions.

802
00:54:19,790 --> 00:54:23,580
Were you here for work, not a date?

803
00:54:24,930 --> 00:54:27,030
I heard their dessert is good, too.

804
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:28,750
Do you like sweets?

805
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:33,040
Yes, I eat everything bitter or sweet.

806
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:36,870
You like both.

807
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:40,420
Do you not like that I eat everything?

808
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:42,780
Does it look like I have no taste?

809
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:46,540
No. I like that you aren't picky.

810
00:55:02,150 --> 00:55:03,710
It's so delicious.

811
00:55:03,710 --> 00:55:05,680
I can see why they're famous.

812
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,300
I'm glad to hear that.

813
00:55:10,170 --> 00:55:12,220
You're such a great person.

814
00:55:12,220 --> 00:55:15,910
I wonder why you haven't had a boyfriend.

815
00:55:16,610 --> 00:55:19,020
- Me?
- Yes.

816
00:55:20,390 --> 00:55:23,790
By chance, were your standards very high?

817
00:55:26,470 --> 00:55:29,350
Rather than seeing just anyone,

818
00:55:29,350 --> 00:55:31,790
I preferred to be alone. It's easier.

819
00:55:32,550 --> 00:55:34,250
I'm more surprised by you.

820
00:55:34,250 --> 00:55:36,520
You must be popular.

821
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:38,110
You think so?

822
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:44,940
I've actually been waiting for someone like you.

823
00:55:46,430 --> 00:55:48,240
That was cheesy.

824
00:55:51,970 --> 00:55:54,230
That's why I've been single.

825
00:55:57,140 --> 00:56:00,050
Su Jeong, if you don't mind,

826
00:56:00,050 --> 00:56:03,200
can I do some shopping while I'm here?

827
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:04,930
I needed some clothes.

828
00:56:04,930 --> 00:56:08,390
