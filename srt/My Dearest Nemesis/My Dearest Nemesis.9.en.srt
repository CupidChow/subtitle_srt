188
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:36,790
I thought I knew him well this time.

189
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:39,130
If he's the Black Dragon who tricked me,

190
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:42,450
who did I like, exactly?

191
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:46,300
What will you do now, then?

192
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,660
I want to avoid him for now, but...

193
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,890
Hello.

194
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:07,110
Well...

195
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:09,880
I'm not sure what to say,

196
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:12,970
but I thought I should see you.

197
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:19,160
I wanted to see you. That's why I came.

198
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,000
So,

199
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,500
you happened to meet at the shop

200
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,940
and found out we were

201
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:35,080
Black Dragon and Strawberry who met in the game.

202
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,490
While trying to separate us,

203
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,710
you ended up together?

204
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:42,400
We ended up together by chance, too.

205
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,660
We didn't get together while

206
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,870
trying to separate you.

207
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:49,320
That's not important here.

208
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:53,270
It means Chief Kim knew all about my past.

209
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:56,490
N-Not a lot. I learned a-a little.

210
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:58,330
A little.

211
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,990
- I'll go.
- Su Jeong!

212
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:08,830
Wait, calm down a bit.

213
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:10,620
Could you sit down for a moment?

214
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,270
Should we?

215
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:23,060
If y-you don't mind,

216
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:25,690
may I say one thing?

217
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:26,950
Since this happened anyway,

218
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:29,200
I want the four of us to get along.

219
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,360
Let's let bygones be bygones.

220
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,470
And it happened when you were little.

221
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:41,560
You two will keep seeing each other, right?

222
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,310
- Yes.
- No.

223
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:51,650
Gosh.

224
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,560
I should start prepping for today.

225
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:57,470
Gosh, I should h-help her, too.

226
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,840
Let's talk outside.

227
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:10,850
- Wait-
- Su Jeong-

228
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,600
- Ju Yeon-
- Black Dragon-

229
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,190
Do you think...

230
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:26,950
you can continue to like me?

231
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,440
What do you mean by that?

232
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,590
You found out who I am.

233
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:37,570
Would you still be able to like me?

234
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:43,890
Do you think...

235
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:49,180
you won't be able to?

236
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:57,730
I think it'd be difficult.

237
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:03,670
I don't think I could.

238
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:05,720
Can you decide that so easily?

239
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,700
It's not easy. It's obvious.

240
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,930
No matter how much I think,

241
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:13,480
my answer would be the same.

242
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:21,250
- Ms. Baek-
- So, let's stop now.

243
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:26,220
Stopping now...

244
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:29,520
would be best for both of us.

245
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,750
What do you think happened to them?

246
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,930
Ju Yeon wants to keep seeing her,

247
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:41,580
but Su Jeong doesn't want to.

248
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:45,460
Maybe she's more hurt by the past.

249
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,800
Rather than that,

250
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,550
if you hit a wall frequently,

251
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:54,470
you become good at breaking through the wall,

252
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:57,070
but you get to know the wall too well.

253
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:59,640
It could make your fear grow.

254
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,280
Su Jeong hit many different walls

255
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,340
often on her own.

256
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:09,800
She might not want to deal with a certain wall.

257
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:16,240
She doesn't want to dredge up the pain, I suppose.

258
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:39,360
[Su Jeong]

259
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:10,640
<i>So, let's stop now.</i>

260
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,110
<i>Stopping now...</i>

261
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:17,460
<i>would be best for both of us.</i>

262
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:23,030
It was easy for her.

263
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:35,160
Team Leader Baek.

264
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:45,530
Come to my office right now.

265
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:02,240
Please...

266
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,260
sit there and wait.

267
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:45,630
Team Leader Baek.

268
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,710
Yes.

269
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:52,410
The next branch for the renewal project

270
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:54,780
should be the Daejeon branch.

271
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:57,770
The inspection result looks good, too.

272
00:22:57,770 --> 00:23:01,530
I'll prepare so it doesn't affect the schedule.

273
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:04,100
I didn't tell you to leave yet.

274
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,610
Wait.

275
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,440
We're not done talking.

276
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:44,600
Director, why are you making me sit here all day?

277
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:52,950
I told you. I need to talk to you.

278
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:55,470
Talk to me now, then.

279
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:56,720
Just because we broke up-

280
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,890
That's what you think.

281
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:02,280
I can't break up.

282
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:05,000
Why should we break up?

283
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,210
Do you have to ask?

284
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:12,830
Did you forget what the first love means to us?

285
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:14,730
It's a bad memory.

286
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:15,960
We don't want to be reminded.

287
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,200
How could we keep seeing each other?

288
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:22,880
Because I still like you.

289
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:27,020
You told me to keep liking what I like.

290
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:29,360
That's you.

291
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:33,710
How could I stop?

292
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,670
You said you liked me, too.

293
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:44,720
That was when I didn't know who you were.

294
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,330
Back then...

295
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:03,310
lying about my age...

296
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,690
I'm sorry.

297
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,170
It was my fault.

298
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:12,750
Could you...

299
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:15,700
Could you please forgive me?

300
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,670
Forget about everything

301
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,200
and think of the Ban Ju Yeon now.

302
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:32,850
Why haven't you...

303
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,390
changed at all?

304
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:42,480
You were like this then, too.

305
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,000
You said you liked me.

306
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,300
But you left me behind as if everything was a lie.

307
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:58,280
See?

308
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:02,060
You haven't forgotten that I hurt you.

309
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,640
As you said,

310
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:12,750
I wish liking you was all a lie and a joke.

311
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:16,200
I wouldn't have gotten hurt

312
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,810
and wouldn't have said things that hurt a kid.

313
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:22,180
I could've comforted you

314
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:24,920
by saying we can meet when we're older.

315
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:28,200
I genuinely liked you.

316
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:32,300
That's how much I trusted you.

317
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:35,380
I was happy that I had someone to rely on.

318
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,650
But you were just a kid.

319
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:54,930
How could I like you again now?

320
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,160
I made it very spicy.

321
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,320
How is it?

322
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:58,820
I can't tell if it's spicy.

323
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:01,640
How strange. That can't be.

324
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,660
I broke up with him.

325
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:16,880
You don't open up easily.

326
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:20,650
You must've liked him a lot.

327
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:23,950
I know.

328
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:28,440
I guess I was very lonely.

329
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:36,960
After meeting Black Dragon

330
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:41,010
at the offline meeting, I realized...

331
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:47,620
that I was really lonely.

332
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:51,160
That I was desperate.

333
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,570
I needed someone so much that

334
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:01,050
I didn't realize he was a kid.

335
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:08,630
I think that's why I got tricked.

336
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:11,580
Like a fool.

337
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:15,460
I hate that so much.

338
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:20,890
You didn't just hate Black Dragon.

339
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,880
You hate yourself, too.

340
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,890
Yourself from back then.

341
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:45,100
Hyung,

342
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:49,110
have you been through a breakup?

343
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:50,490
What?

344
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:56,300
You must've had many since you dated a lot.

345
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:02,910
How did you repeat so many heartaches?

346
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:06,180
Ju Yeon, I think you're drunk.

347
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:08,750
When you start dating,

348
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:12,020
both people need to agree.

349
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,600
But why?

350
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,850
Why is it over when one person says,

351
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:20,450
"It's over" in the end?

352
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:21,930
I'm opposed to it.

353
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:24,100
I, Ban Ju Yeon,

354
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:27,190
will fight against this...

355
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,890
cruel breakup system.

356
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,380
No.

357
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:46,980
I actually can't.

358
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:49,640
Because I don't have the right.

359
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,940
What do you mean, the right?

360
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:53,390
I thought only I was hurting

361
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:58,730
because only I was sincere.

362
00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:01,650
I didn't know how disappointed she was in me

363
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:08,350
and how hurt she was, thinking she was deceived.

364
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:13,680
I really was a clueless kid.

365
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:18,450
I'm the one who hurt her more.

366
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:22,860
Ju Yeon.

367
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:29,130
Leave.

368
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:52,440
<i>The one I really hated</i>

369
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:56,130
<i>wasn't you.</i>

370
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,580
<i>It was me.</i>

371
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,510
[Yongsung's successor Ban Ju Yeon, getting married?]

372
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:40,300
An employee?

373
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:42,680
The rumor says a team leader.

374
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,450
[Dating a subordinate, not a chaebol?]

375
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:45,650
- Look.
- Seriously...

376
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:47,020
Look.

377
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,740
Team Leader,

378
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:51,040
have you seen this, by chance?

379
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,330
[Yongsung's successor Ban Ju Yeon, getting married?]

380
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:54,930
What is this?

381
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:57,860
I saw the original photo, too.

382
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:59,830
I think this woman is

383
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:02,720
Strategy Team's Baek Su Jeong.

384
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,140
<i>There was a post</i>

385
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:21,490
on an office worker site this morning.

386
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:24,100
[I saw a chaebol]
I think it started there.

387
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:27,320
You were announced as a successor recently

388
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,350
and some employees even recognized

389
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:31,310
Team Leader Baek in the photo.

390
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:33,700
Even before the PR Team can handle it,

391
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:38,030
it spread on various social media and websites.

392
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:40,550
The rumor snowballed in the process.

393
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:43,150
I see.

394
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:48,570
Why did you meet Team Leader Baek's family?

395
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:50,110
I ran into them.

396
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:53,360
And I treated them to a meal to be nice.

397
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,760
I see.

398
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,870
That's what I thought.

399
00:33:57,870 --> 00:34:01,340
You're in a tricky position over nothing.

400
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:03,050
I know.

401
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:05,090
How unfair to Ms. Baek.

402
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:11,210
Take care of it as soon as possible.

403
00:34:25,470 --> 00:34:27,290
Team Leader Baek,

404
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:29,000
I heard you're marrying the Director.

405
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,840
- Is that true?
- Pardon?

406
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:34,030
I hear your wedding is at the Yongsung Hotel.

407
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,320
The hotel employees know all about it.

408
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,620
But why would the Director date Team Leader Baek?

409
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:40,750
<i>And even marry her?</i>

410
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:43,390
<i>Why not? She's pretty.</i>

411
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:44,600
<i>Yes.</i>

412
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,990
Being pretty is the best.

413
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:49,170
Gosh, I want to be pretty, too.

414
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,470
Excuse me, team leaders,

415
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:57,410
I thought the Yongsung Department Store was No. 1.

416
00:34:57,410 --> 00:34:59,850
That's why I was proud to work here.

417
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:01,120
I gave my best, too.

418
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:03,990
But the team leaders of the No. 1 store

419
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:05,640
buys into an unconfirmed rumor

420
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:08,520
and judge a female coworker's looks.

421
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,770
It's disappointing.

422
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:12,370
We were complimenting you.

423
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,260
Let's start the meeting.

424
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:28,030
And...

425
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:32,740
let's only talk about work at the office.

426
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:52,480
I know what you're thinking,

427
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,670
but the Director and I aren't like that.

428
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:56,830
Yes. Of course not.

429
00:35:57,850 --> 00:35:59,210
Pardon?

430
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,820
Na Na,

431
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:05,140
what's wrong? Is something wrong?

432
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:07,250
It's not that.

433
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:10,100
No, it's just that...

434
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:14,330
I thought you might feel it's so unfair.

435
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:17,260
- Pardon?
- It makes no sense.

436
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:18,790
Why would you...

437
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:22,160
jump into hell at work with the Director, even?

438
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:25,400
Seriously. They know nothing.

439
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,180
It's totally impossible.

440
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:30,920
But people are talking so mean.

441
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,360
It's because they haven't seen

442
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,040
how much they hate each other.

443
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,630
They were so scary on the rooftop.

444
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:40,010
You must be frustrated by all this nonsense.

445
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,990
I'm okay.

446
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:46,030
- Don't cry, Na Na.
- Team Leader...

447
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:48,670
I know. They believe the way they want

448
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:50,820
just to entertain themselves. You know?

449
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:52,620
They know how to come up with sensational stuff.

450
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:54,460
They have no idea what Team Leader is like.

451
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:56,330
How long will this go on for?

452
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:57,660
I don't know.

453
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:00,180
It's a false rumor. They'd quiet down in a month.

454
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:02,620
Yes. They should.

455
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:06,780
I'll report them.

456
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:10,870
I took down all the articles.

457
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:13,820
We decided not to address it officially.

458
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:14,970
The PR team is handling

459
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:17,550
the public opinions on the online communities.

460
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:19,870
That it's a baseless rumor.

461
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:26,510
Many didn't believe it, saying the successor

462
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:28,630
and an employee can't be dating.

463
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:31,930
I think things will quiet down in time.

464
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:43,500
You wanted to see me, Chairwoman.

465
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,070
Yes.

466
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:48,160
I don't mind your charade

467
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,990
but acknowledging their family events is enough.

468
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:52,540
Why do you create noise

469
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:54,700
by not differentiating hierarchy?

470
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:57,340
You're giving people the wrong impression.

471
00:37:57,340 --> 00:38:01,690
Being excessive always causes trouble.

472
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:02,550
I'm sorry.

473
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:05,480
Since you're known as the successor,

474
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:08,540
wherever you go and whomever you meet,

475
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:12,270
don't forget that the investors are watching you.

476
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:14,700
If you are to grow the company,

477
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:18,610
meet people who suit you in the proper places.

478
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:21,240
Yes, I'll keep that in mind.

479
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,470
So...

480
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:26,020
will you just let this go?

481
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:28,550
They started talking over nothing already.

482
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:31,110
You think it won't happen again?

483
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:32,240
Next time,

484
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,580
they'll be noisy over even smaller things.

485
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:37,540
Baek Su Jeong...

486
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:39,550
Find the right moment

487
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:42,680
and dismiss her without people noticing.

488
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:49,350
You have to pull the weed from the get-go.

489
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:54,070
I think that'd be difficult.

490
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:00,180
It'd be difficult?

491
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:02,160
Team Leader Baek...

492
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:06,690
is a crucial staff to the renewal project.

493
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:09,320
Dismissing her over a false rumor

494
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:12,610
would be our loss facing an important project.

495
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:15,370
It'd be difficult to replace her, too.

496
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:29,920
Okay.

497
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:33,490
Just leave her, then.

498
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:37,040
If she gets on my radar again,

499
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:40,100
I'll take action myself.

500
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:43,240
I'll let you go.

501
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:56,170
You knew about...

502
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:59,130
their get-together, right, Chief Kwon?

503
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:01,390
Yes, I did.

504
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:02,550
But...

505
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:06,080
you've cared for the employees' families.

506
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,940
I didn't think it'd be such an issue.

507
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:09,800
So, I didn't report it to you.

508
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,480
I'm sorry.

509
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,590
If you're sorry,

510
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:17,550
you should take responsibility, Chief Kwon.

511
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:33,640
Are you okay?

512
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:37,050
Everyone is talking about you two all day.

513
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:38,700
Why should I not be okay?

514
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:41,100
It's not true, anyway.

515
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,590
I haven't seen...

516
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:56,210
Director in his office since earlier.

517
00:40:57,910 --> 00:41:01,310
He was probably summoned by the Chairwoman.

518
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:02,440
He'll be okay.

519
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,790
He's good at resolving anything.

520
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:07,110
You don't have to worry.

521
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:10,720
I'm not worried.

522
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:18,490
I think she was worried.

523
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:22,220
I'll do something about all the businesses

524
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:24,150
with a below 10% sales record.

525
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:26,210
- All of them?
- Yes.

526
00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:28,980
We'll cancel the contract or come up with a plan.

527
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:31,130
I'm planning to do something quickly.

528
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:34,170
The renewal project is underway, too.

529
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:35,950
I don't know how it'd be in the long run,

530
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:39,350
but fixing a few major stores won't be enough.

531
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:42,670
To double the sales and possibly more,

532
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:46,010
all branches need to improve the sales.

533
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:48,600
We'll get busy.

534
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,570
We should get busier.

535
00:41:51,570 --> 00:41:53,050
That's a good idea.

536
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:56,690
We have to be extra careful right now.

537
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,690
Director.

538
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:24,520
What is it?

539
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:27,610
Well...

540
00:42:27,610 --> 00:42:31,980
This isn't causing problems with Chairwoman, right?

541
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:35,120
I don't think it's any of your concern.

542
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:38,900
I'm directly involved. How can I not be concerned?

543
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:42,150
If she misunderstood, I'll explain myself.

544
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:43,990
I'll tell her there's nothing going on-

545
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:46,510
No. That's not necessary.

546
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:48,670
As you said, there's nothing going on.

547
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:50,820
It won't be an issue.

548
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,760
That's a relief, then.

549
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:56,090
Yes, it is.

550
00:42:56,090 --> 00:42:59,870
So, let's not get personally involved from now on.

551
00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:03,730
Okay.

552
00:43:03,730 --> 00:43:05,330
Finally...

553
00:43:06,090 --> 00:43:09,070
everything seems to be back to normal.

While I was checking the low-sales businesses,

599

I noticed one of them stood out.

600
00:47:32,670 --> 00:47:35,200
Do you mean the clothing brand, "Bukayo"?

601
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,590
Yes.

602
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,220
They're one of the top sellers in another branch.

603
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:51,700
The discrepancy was severe.

604
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:53,820
I'll create a report just on that.

I think the rumor will be gone in no time.

You look even more distant than before.

611

He's only focusing on work.

625

She's always been all about work.

They can't move on overnight.

632
00:49:37,810 --> 00:49:39,450
