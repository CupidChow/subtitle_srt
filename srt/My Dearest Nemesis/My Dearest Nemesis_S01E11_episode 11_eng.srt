1
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:14,940


2
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:17,790
   

3
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:20,400
   

4
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:23,150
   

5
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:25,970
   

6
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:27,710
   

7
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,000
   

8
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:34,760
   

9
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:50,000
   

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,110
   

11
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:52,240
Hello.

12
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,770
Hi. Good to see you.

13
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:58,030
- Have a seat. 
 - Okay.

14
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:03,500
Chairwoman, you should step out for a moment.

15
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:10,140
What's going on?

16
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,430
- What is it? 
 - I haven't seen Director Park Ji Cheol.

17
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:16,960
We only have five minutes left.

18
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,670
You're right.

19
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:20,040
What's going on?

20
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,910
Where's Park Ji Cheol?

21
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:25,580
- Well— 
 - You'd better not look for him.

22
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:29,570
He personally told me that he's quitting.

23
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:33,590
His nephew is the secretary of Hana City's mayor.

24
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,960
   

25
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:45,330
   

26
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:53,110
 Park Ji Cheol's relative is involved with Hana City. 

27
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:55,130
 Do you remember? 

28
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,560
 I didn't know you'd personally come. 

29
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,050
 I might as well do a good job and help you. 

30
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:06,690
 Thank you. 

31
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:08,540
It's an unjust recruitment.

32
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:12,070
Park Ji Cheol recommended him to Hana City's aide.

33
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:14,920
But this fellow is really something.

34
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,970
Fake academic background, adultery, and fraud.

35
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,190
He committed various crimes,

36
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:23,330
but Park Ji Cheol was involved in the fraud.

37
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:31,270
It's too big of a case to cover up.

38
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,080
Are you threatening me right now?

39
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,080
If I need to.

40
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,160
What is it that you want?

41
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,190
Your plan to kick Team Leader Baek out.

42
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,680
Please cancel it.

43
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,850
Promise me you'll never cause her any harm.

44
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:51,920
You're doing this just for a girl—

45
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,920
And the renewal project.

46
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,100
I'll finish it myself.

47
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,690
It's not a bad proposal for you either.

48
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:01,520
I must be the only one who can fill the position

49
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,840
without a need for verification.

50
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:13,800
But under one condition.

51
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,800
If the renewal project is a success, I will

52
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,250
leave Baek Su Jeong alone.

53
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,420
But if you fail,

54
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:25,220
you'll abandon your assets and name

55
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:28,860
and leave this country.

56
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:34,650
You can't do that?

57
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:07,680
I'm Ban Ju Yeon.

58
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:34,440
What's with you, Director? I couldn't reach you.

59
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,370
- Why did you go to the ceremony— 
 - Team Leader Baek,

60
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:40,460
let's go back to work starting tomorrow.

61
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:44,280
A single comment by the chairwoman will never

62
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,770
dismiss your efforts.

63
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:48,320
What did you do?

64
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,660
She's not someone to have a sudden change of heart.

65
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:56,270
The data I've been collecting as a secretary, intern, and an employee came in handy.

66
00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:00,300
And there's a condition for the reinstatement.

67
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,150
The renewal project must be a success.

68
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:07,950
If it fails, we'll have to leave the company.

69
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,580
Is that all?

70
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,630
You're not doubting yourself, right?

71
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:13,140
I know you're confident.

72
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:16,540
That's why I thought it wouldn't be a big deal.

73
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:19,210
Because we'll make it a success, anyway.

74
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:27,530
We should definitely make it a success, then.

75
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,760
And after that,

76
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,140
the chairwoman will realize it, too.

77
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:38,190
That she needs to acknowledge you.

78
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,020
   

79
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,960
   

80
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,550
Team Leader!

81
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:14,470
Hello.

82
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:17,760
Team Leader, you went through so much.

83
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:21,090
Let's see... You didn't get hurt or anything, right?

84
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:22,480
Why would I get hurt?

85
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,090
Come on now.

86
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:27,200
Team Leader, you went through so much.

87
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,360
I missed you so much.

88
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,180
I think Na Na went through more than me.

89
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:34,410
It's such a relief.

90
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,260
Let's make this work together again.

91
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,960
Okay. We'll work hard.

92
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:54,280
 Yongsung, Yongsung, Yongsung, Yongsung! 

93
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,820
Bye.

94
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,470
With the stores reopening in the Christmas season,

95
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:04,840
the first pop-up store will

96
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,350
satisfy the families with kids

97
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:10,650
and people in their 20s and 30s.

98
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:13,160
So, we came up with using cartoon characters.

99
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,800
Here's the list of the finalists.

100
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,480
The first candidate is "Star Bear's Travel."

101
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:22,850
It's the most popular mobile game character among teenagers.

102
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:25,930
And the second candidate is "Smile Cat."

103
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:28,860
It's popular among women in their 20s.

104
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,440
And the last candidate is

105
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,540
"Pirate King," the animated series.

106
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:38,710
It'd attract customers and boost sales the most.

107
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:41,250
It's owned by an international company,

108
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,970
but the creator's father is Korean.

109
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:46,200
It's very popular in Korea, too.

110
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,010
The mother, not the father.

111
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,490
Oh, I see.

112
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:51,860
Got it.

113
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:54,510
And if they had a pop-up with us,

114
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:58,200
it'd be their first event in Korea in a while.

115
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,860
It'd claim a lot of attention.

116
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:02,430
It hasn't been just a while. It's been seven years.

117
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:05,290
Yes, right. You know very well.

118
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:11,810
Yes, well, I did a thorough investigation prior to our meeting.

119
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:14,230
Since you've done your research, you should be aware.

120
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:16,930
These days, it's not just children that enjoy these cartoons,

121
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:20,050
but plenty of adults, too. They sell very well.

122
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:22,640
"Pirate King" has a nice message, too.

123
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,460
I think it'd be more meaningful.

124
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,860
Yes, I read it while doing the research.

125
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:29,100
The story is pretty great.

126
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:32,050
I got sucked into it, too.

127
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:34,190
If so,

128
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:37,220
the first renewal project pop-up

129
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:39,810
will be with "Pirate King."

130
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:41,970
Okay.

131
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:56,710
You and the director are really dating, right?

132
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:58,150
Why do you ask?

133
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:01,240
I couldn't even tell at all just now.

134
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,910
Why would we let it show at work?

135
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,780
But still.

136
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,550
Can you show it just a bit?

137
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:08,650
I'm curious.

138
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:10,080
What are you curious about?

139
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,440
When did you start dating? How did it start?

140
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,800
What do you like about him? Where do you normally go on dates?

141
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,270
And does he pay... Do you go Dutch?

142
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,550
You scared me!

143
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:21,310
What are you doing?

144
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,530
Why are you curious about that?

145
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,620
My role model is dating.

146
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:28,440
Of course, I'm curious. Don't you think?

147
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,020
I can't picture it, first of all.

148
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:33,730
You're dating the director, of all people.

149
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:38,250
Stop talking nonsense. Let's go and get lunch.

150
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:45,170
Director!

151
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:47,570
I don't like "Pirate King."

152
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:56,390
I thought you should join us for lunch.

153
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:25,970
Why aren't you eating?

154
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:28,150
We will. We will.

155
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:33,050
By the way,

156
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:36,530
did you get us lobster at the buffet

157
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:38,770
because of Team Leader?

158
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:42,840
Well, I did.

159
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:50,190
There's no reason to hide it.

160
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:51,920
Right.

161
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,800
You can't hide true love, they say.

162
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,960
Will you sleep here tonight? Let's hurry and eat.

163
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,190
- Okay, okay. 
 - Okay.

164
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,360
Thank you.

165
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:12,260
Here.

166
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,260
Try this first.

167
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,510
It's their signature dish.

168
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,120
I like to feed other people.

169
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:40,340
Here. Say, ah.

170
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:44,390
I'm sorry, but I don't share utensils.

171
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,860
Just eat, Seok Gi.

172
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,960
You're embarrassing him.

173
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:52,410
I don't want to.

174
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,760
I'll eat it.

175
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,720
Okay.

176
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,030
It's the best.

177
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:09,810
- It's tasty. 
 - It is.

178
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:11,830
Should we eat quickly and go?

179
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:13,700
Yes.

180
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,300
Yum.

181
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,840
 You didn't get it. 

182
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,250
 Then, we can't do this. 

183
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:26,720
I know.

184
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:30,240
Chief, you didn't go out for lunch?

185
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,870
Well, no. I-I'm on a diet.

186
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:36,640
You have no weight to lose.

187
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,600
He's all about self-care.

188
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:46,120
   

189
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:55,970
- The rumor was true? 
 - Yes.

190
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:57,860
They got fired together and came back?

191
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,060
Yes, I'm telling you.

192
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:02,010
Wow, what's it like dating a chaebol?

193
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:03,520
You don't have to worry about money

194
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,710
and you'd never get fired either.

195
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:08,140
You don't even have to work.

196
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:12,010
I would've quit immediately if I were her.

197
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,350
Why should I quit my job?

198
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:19,290
Well, because you're with the director.

199
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:21,560
It's because we're jealous. That's all.

200
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,660
Yes, he's right. We're jealous.

201
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:28,520
But we have a point, don't we?

202
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,820
It's like winning a lottery.

203
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:33,210
Why should you keep working?

204
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:35,800
The youngest team leader got promoted the fastest.

205
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,810
I won the Best Employee award countless times.

206
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:42,380
Wouldn't it be the company's loss if I quit?

207
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:46,140
And...

208
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:49,770
even lottery winners work these days.

209
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:51,960
- I see. 
 - Yes.

210
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,910
Go, go.

211
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,160
Seriously. I was shocked.

212
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,310
So tired.

213
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,400
What? What are you doing here?

214
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,700
Your team left. Why are you still here?

215
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,800
How about you? Why haven't you left?

216
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,160
Because you haven't left.

217
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,690
Move. I have more work to do.

218
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,380
The pop-up store...

219
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:50,050
You chose "Pirate King" from the beginning, right?

220
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:52,740
It really was the best candidate.

221
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,500
We have to make it a success.

222
00:14:55,500 --> 00:15:00,050
Of course, I wanted you to have fun, too.

223
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:02,030
Thank you.

224
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:05,380
To be honest,

225
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:10,440
"Pirate King" is the most special cartoon to me.

226
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,430
Before my parents passed away,

227
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:16,470
the last friend I had left...

228
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,560
was Toggangyi.

229
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,760
The plushie I gave you as a gift.

230
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:29,480
What if they find out I'm a "Pirate King" fan?

231
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,820
Is it because of the chairwoman?

232
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,250
It's not that.

233
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:36,500
I've had to keep it a secret and...

234
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,570
it's kind of embarrassing, too.

235
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:41,550
You don't find this embarrassing?

236
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:43,250
What if someone sees us?

237
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:46,350
Who'd see us? There's no one here.

238
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:48,460
Move now.

239
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,000
Okay...

240
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:04,590
 It was the tastiest seafood jjambbong 

241
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:06,890
 I've ever had. 

242
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:09,810
 If you haven't tried this, it's your loss. 

243
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:14,220
 The food is good, but the owner is amazing, too. 

244
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:17,460
 It was love indeed. 

245
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,740
 ­  

246
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:39,790
Boosting the younger customer rate from 24% to 45%

247
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,160
will be the key goal of this project.

248
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,310
We successfully acquired their favored brands...

249
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:48,180
The Christmas season concept is red.

250
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:50,200
So, we don't need to...

251
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,800
   

252
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:16,250
  The "Pirate King" team is very enthusiastic, too. 

253
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:19,520
They'll produce three versions of the limited goods.

254
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,040
I need to make sure I get in the queue immediately.

255
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,880
And the creator will be staying in Korea.

256
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,330
He can come to the pop-up, too.

257
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,420
- Really? 
 - Yes.

258
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:33,380
You won't make me get you an autograph again, right?

259
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:36,690
It's a special chance to get one yourself.

260
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,660
You can take a photo, too.

261
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,460
Gosh, a photo, too?

262
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,060
Like this.

263
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:48,790
Of course, I'll take a nice one with you.

264
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:49,900
That was...

265
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,030
Just think about it.

266
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:55,240
Okay. I will think about it.

267
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,500
Everyone is talking about you two at work.

268
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,120
He's probably fine, but are you okay, Su Jeong?

269
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,620
What do you mean?

270
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:07,120
People are talking a lot

271
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,680
since they heard about your dating.

272
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:13,380
It's better than being called a "Director Killer."

273
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,780
Let's start the meeting, Chief Kim.

274
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:18,380
I can't even talk?

275
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:23,450
I checked the design edits for the pop-up.

276
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:25,780
- Yes. 
 - Hyung.

277
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,260
What? What is it?

278
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,480
Are you in pain?

279
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,210
You don't look so well.

280
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:32,240
Bbanjju,

281
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,470
are you finally worrying about me?

282
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:36,870
I'm asking because you look uglier than usual,

283
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:38,360
Chief Kim Shin Won.

284
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,430
I knew it. Jerk.

285
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:44,390
Why does it throb so much?

286
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:46,970
The opening date is coming up soon.

287
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:49,250
You must feel the pressure.

288
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,400
I'm okay.

289
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,120
Everything will be fine if it's a success.

290
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,370
I'll rely on you until the end.

291
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:58,780
Okay.

292
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:03,730
Su Jeong.

293
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,970
Director,

294
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:13,840
you look way happier than when you're with me.

295
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,390
Can't be the same, of course.

296
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:16,970
Are you openly discriminating?

297
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:18,030
What do you mean?

298
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:20,640
You're Chief Kwon and

299
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,400
Su Jeong is Su Jeong.

300
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:27,040
This is no good.

301
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,760
I'll get you an espresso with triple shots

302
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,000
starting tomorrow.

303
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,750
Will you accept my apology?

304
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:36,090
No, I can't.

305
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:37,980
Because I was joking.

306
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,050
Enjoy your date.

307
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:43,370
I have more free time, thanks to you.

308
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:44,720
Thank you.

309
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,320
Of course.

310
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:51,610
Chief Kwon is a humorous person.

311
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:53,900
I just learned that, too.

312
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,870
I'm grateful to her.

313
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,850
This is for Black Dragon.

314
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:02,340
This is for Strawberry.

315
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,980
Unni.

316
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:06,490
It's nice to see you sitting together.

317
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:09,390
Is Chief Kim feeling better now?

318
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:12,200
Huh? Is he sick?

319
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:14,650
What? Didn't you know?

320
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:17,880
Well, the thing is...

321
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,770
Did you have a fight?

322
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:24,750
Of course not.

323
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,290
It's just...

324
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:29,300
Did he upset you by smiling at everyone?

325
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,800
No, he didn't.

326
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:35,280
I'm the one who's upsetting him.

327
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,660
I'm the one who couldn't love him as much as

328
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:41,620
he wanted or let him love me.

329
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:43,870
I thought I was fine after the divorce,

330
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:48,700
but I guess not enough to trust someone fully.

331
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:51,180
Of course, you're afraid.

332
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:54,140
Someone you trusted the most changed.

333
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,240
But if you want to trust him,

334
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:02,430
it means you love him that much, don't you think?

335
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,010
Even though you're afraid,

336
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:09,610
you want to believe in love.

337
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,170
Thank you for driving me home.

338
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:24,800
You're going straight home, right?

339
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,420
I'll stop by work.

340
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,920
What for?

341
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:31,500
I'm having a video meeting with Arteta HQ.

342
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,940
I thought you finished talking to them.

343
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:35,570
I just wanted to confirm things.

344
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:37,340
I can't allow even a slight mistake

345
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:40,250
for the project's success.

346
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,580
Don't feel too pressured.

347
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,540
We're working hard together.

348
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,300
Okay?

349
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:50,730
Get going now.

350
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:52,860
I'll see you go in first.

351
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:55,570
No, I want to see you leave.

352
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:54,930
 ­  

353
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,420
You came in early.

354
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:00,540
Yes. A higher-up nagged me to update

355
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:04,650
the design instead of feeling depressed.

356
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,320
He said he worked all night at the office.

357
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,910
So, I couldn't really complain.

358
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:11,920
He worked all night at the office?

359
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,390
Yes.

360
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:16,770
Is he in his office now?

361
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,330
He left for a meeting with a business.

362
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:20,060
He's checking the site while there, too.

363
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,440
He's checking the site, too?

364
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,550
We finished checking together recently.

365
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:25,000
We'll check the day before again.

366
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,390
You know how thorough he is.

367
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:28,090
Well, then...

368
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,910
 Didn't you go home last night? 

369
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:47,680
 I lost track of time while working. 

370
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,470
 When are you returning to the office? 

371
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:52,150
 I'll pick you up when you leave. 

372
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:55,910
 The renewal project must be a success. 

373
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:59,320
 If it fails, we'll have to leave the company. 

374
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:09,250
Chief Kwon.

375
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:15,110
I can't help but find it strange.

376
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:17,270
We're almost ready for the opening.

377
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:20,270
He shouldn't have so much work to do.

378
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:22,370
But he's been overworking.

379
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:24,520
He must be anxious.

380
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:29,250
Because he'd lose everything if it failed.

381
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:32,790
What do you mean by that?

382
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,190
Director.

383
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:47,250
Su Jeong, what brings you here—

384
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:51,980
Is everything okay?

385
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:54,060
I heard if this fails,

386
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:58,010
you won't just be quitting your job.

387
00:24:58,010 --> 00:25:00,440
You agreed to give up on your assets and name

388
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,450
and leave the country.

389
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:05,490
Why did you agree to such an unreasonable term?

390
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:07,150
I...

391
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:12,730
wanted to let you make the decision.

392
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:15,330
Whether you stay at the company or not,

393
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:17,620
I wanted you to choose.

394
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:21,050
I wasn't trying to secure my job.

395
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:22,100
Why do this for me—

396
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,360
I know. You did it for me.

397
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,840
You wanted my grandmother to acknowledge me

398
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:30,650
and not let my life's work go to waste.

399
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:34,010
You made that decision knowing that?

400
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:37,110
Because I can give up on everything.

401
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:42,630
If I can be greedy for myself for once,

402
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:46,220
it has to be Baek Su Jeong.

403
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,570
The only thing I cared about was...

404
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:53,670
for your efforts to be acknowledged.

405
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,330
Because I know...

406
00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:00,620
how desperately you want that.

407
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,890
Because I also know...

408
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:10,620
how it feels to want acknowledgment.

409
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:14,040
And the person I truly want to be acknowledged by...

410
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,690
is in front of me right now.

411
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,980
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

412
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:32,940
Could you come here for a moment?

413
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:42,890
You wanted to learn how to play the piano.

414
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,750
Don't you remember?

415
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:48,450
When did I want to learn...

416
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:51,720
 I have a piano lesson in the afternoon. 

417
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,990
 I'm free after five. 

418
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:54,740
 Geez, amazing. 

419
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:55,910
 You take piano lessons? 

420
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:58,070
 I've always wanted to learn. 

421
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:00,900
 You can learn from me later. 

422
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:08,100
To be honest, I still can't believe it.

423
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,620
That we met again like this

424
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:13,550
and we came to like each other.

425
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:16,660
So, I couldn't think about anything else.

426
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:22,340
Don't try to do everything by yourself.

427
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:26,190
I'll never do that again.

428
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:32,220
I'm not done being angry yet.

429
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,530
I think you are.

430
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:54,730
   

431
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:03,760
 But if you want to trust him, 

432
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,920
 it means you love him that much, don't you think? 

433
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:12,590
You know, that handsome employee.

434
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,210
I don't see him these days.

435
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:16,170
Did he quit?

436
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:20,460
He wasn't an employee. He was just helping briefly.

437
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:23,050
Why? Are you sad?

438
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:24,460
No, I'm not.

439
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:27,730
He was nicer to the owner than to the customers.

440
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:30,970
He's your boyfriend, isn't he?

441
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:33,160
Why would you ask that?

442
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,840
What? I'm curious.

443
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:37,540
Don't ask. You're being rude.

444
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:56,070
Team Leader, it's lunchtime.

445
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,190
Okay.

446
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:00,300
You haven't changed at all.

447
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:03,700
The director is your boyfriend. Why work so hard?

448
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:07,130
Can't we have steak today, too?

449
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:08,920
The director is at a shop.

450
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,960
And I'm meeting someone.

451
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:13,920
You're meeting up with Chief Kim Hee Jeong.

452
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,180
Wasn't she working in the US now?

453
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:17,840
She is. She's at Big Forest.

454
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,580
She's in Korea briefly.

455
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:23,140
Isn't Big Forest the biggest mall in the US?

456
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:24,460
It is.

457
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:25,880
But I didn't think

458
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:28,900
you were that close to get together.

459
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,220
Is she scouting you by chance?

460
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:33,860
Come on. No way.

461
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:36,580
You're right.

462
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,390
I'm scouting you.

463
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:43,370
We only worked together briefly,

464
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:46,280
but you stood out so much when you were new.

465
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:50,830
I've been following the news in Korea, but...

466
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:54,840
I can see why you got promoted so quickly.

467
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:58,260
Thank you for thinking so highly of me.

468
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:59,400
I heard about the scandal,

469
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:02,900
and how you got transferred briefly, too.

470
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:06,570
If you stay at Yongsung,

471
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:09,720
you'll keep being mistreated like that.

472
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:13,550
You'll be nothing but Ban Ju Yeon's girlfriend.

473
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:17,660
You won't give up on your career for love, right?

474
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:19,220
It'd be a shame.

475
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:22,670
It'd be a waste of all that hard work.

476
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:25,310
So,

477
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:28,100
come to the US.

478
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,270
I really appreciate your offer,

479
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:37,500
but there's a project I'm working on right now.

480
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,880
I even value your sense of responsibility, too.

481
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,680
Okay.

482
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,900
Take your time thinking about it

483
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:52,840
and we'll talk again after the project.

484
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:26,060
Mom!

485
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:27,660
Su Hyeok!

486
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,710
Are you crazy?

487
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:33,790
How could you push a child?

488
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:35,480
I didn't push him. I held him.

489
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,820
He almost ran into someone while running.

490
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:41,270
 Ban Ju Yeon? 

491
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:51,420
Yes, I've seen you on the news.

492
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:53,190
You could've just talked to him.

493
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:57,190
Can you touch my precious child if you're rich?

494
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,550
I'm sorry I startled him.

495
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:02,360
But it was an urgent situation.

496
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:05,840
You can check the CCTV if you'd like.

497
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:11,810
Team Leader,

498
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:13,720
you need to see this.

499
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:16,050
 The successor of Yongsung 

500
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:17,830
 who's famously young and handsome. 

501
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:19,660
 At a food court in a department store, 

502
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:22,370
 he pushed a young boy and knocked him over. 

503
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:26,340
 Just because he was apparently in his way. Whoa. 

504
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:28,310
- No way. 
  - Apparently, 

505
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:31,760
 with the renewal, Yongsung is planning to 

506
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:36,400
 turn the luxury wing into a no-kids zone. 

507
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,590
How could a department store not allow kids?

508
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:40,770
We have to report this jerk.

509
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:42,470
Send me the link right now.

510
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:43,950
Okay.

511
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,100
 He edited the social media posts by the customers 

512
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,960
 with a malicious intention. 

513
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:53,040
They're speculating that you were fired

514
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,910
due to poor character.

515
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:57,130
The public opinion is very negative.

516
00:32:57,130 --> 00:33:00,020
They're even mentioning boycotting.

517
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:02,100
Things will quiet down over time.

518
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:05,340
Say that we'll take firm action against fake news.

519
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:07,500
Okay, but...

520
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,130
timing wise,

521
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:13,600
it worries me that this will affect the reopening.

522
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,860
Find the person who posted the video first.

523
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:18,070
Something...

524
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:20,320
smells fishy.

525
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:23,260
   

526
00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:27,350
Deputy,

527
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:29,630
the performer wants to cancel

528
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:32,340
the renewal celebration show.

529
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:35,560
Geez, you've got to be kidding me.

530
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:38,130
The reopening is just around the corner.

531
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:46,950
 Team Leader, 

532
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:50,530
 the Botanic House show won't be happening. 

533
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,950
Yes, Team Leader, I'm leaving now.

534
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:56,070
 I don't know how to say this. 

535
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:57,660
 I'm so sorry, but 

536
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:00,010
 we'll have to cancel today's meeting. 

537
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:02,970
- Pardon? 
  - The creator learned about the rumor. 

538
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:05,700
 "Pirate King" is a cartoon for children. 

539
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,670
 He said the pop-up can't happen 

540
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:10,700
 where they're unkind to children. 

541
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,680
This is a misunderstanding.

542
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:14,840
I can send you the evidence to prove it.

543
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:17,750
 I'll email you regarding the contract cancellation. 

544
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:19,410
The opening is three days away.

545
00:34:19,410 --> 00:34:21,330
This isn't right, Team Leader.

546
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:23,680
 I'm so sorry. 

547
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:33,470
 "Pirate King" is the most special cartoon to me. 

548
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:00,770
Yes, it's me.

549
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,250
Black Dragon.

550
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:30,530
 We can finally meet him. 

551
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:35,100
We only ever communicated by the nickname Black Dragon.

552
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:39,290
So, I didn't have a chance to meet him.

553
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:43,450
But he really wanted to meet you this time.

554
00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:46,240
Actually, I was curious, too.

555
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,520
He helped show the animation to the children

556
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,830
who would've had no access to it otherwise.

557
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:56,590
He's been supporting my work sincerely.

558
00:35:56,590 --> 00:36:00,850
He has a deep love for your work.

559
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:03,730
Excuse me.

560
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:22,820
Nice to meet you.

561
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:27,580
I'm supposed to meet you today. I'm a fan of yours.

562
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:31,810
You've been supporting the children

563
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:34,300
who are fans of my work.

564
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,340
I've been wanting to talk to you.

565
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:41,510
"Pirate King" is enormously meaningful to me.

566
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:45,190
Watching "Pirate King," I looked forward to

567
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:47,430
the characters' next adventure

568
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:49,580
and the new friends they'd make.

569
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:53,980
Telling my parents about it made me happy.

570
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:55,920
That's why watching "Pirate King"

571
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,790
made me feel like they were

572
00:36:57,790 --> 00:37:02,320
still with me even after they passed away.

573
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:07,990
Hearing that makes me truly happy.

574
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:12,400
I've always wanted to know who the sponsor was

575
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:17,360
but I only knew you by your nickname.

576
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,920
Thank you so much for your help.

577
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:29,240
I've actually had to keep the things I liked a secret.

578
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:33,840
So, I had to give up on everything I liked,

579
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,930
but I couldn't bring myself to.

580
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:41,060
So, I ended up hiding them all.

581
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:45,680
I was living in anxiety every day,

582
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:50,110
but when I was looking forward to the next adventure…

583
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:52,270
Were you...

584
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:57,920
Were you able to look forward to tomorrow?

585
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,510
Yes.

586
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:03,720
You must be Ban Ju Yeon.

587
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:07,270
How did you know...

588
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:10,320
So, it is true…

589
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,850
that Mr. Ban Ju Yeon is a fan of mine.

590
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:17,420
 Sir, 

591
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,920
 I need to talk to you. Do you have a moment? 

592
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,890
 I'm sorry. Email me if you need to say something. 

593
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:26,780
 I just need a moment, sir. 

594
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:29,270
 I know you're a fan, but you're going too far. 

595
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:32,440
 I'll call someone if you keep following me. 

596
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:35,480
 I'm actually not your fan. 

597
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:41,220
 I'm not someone who likes 

598
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:45,470
 something purely and passionately. 

599
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:47,850
 Why are you here, then... 

600
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:54,040
 I know someone like that. 

601
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:58,330
 It's Director Ban of Yongsung Department Store. 

602
00:38:58,330 --> 00:39:01,070
 Because he loves your work so much, 

603
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:03,830
 he couldn't hide it even when he had to. 

604
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:05,650
 Even though he was so lonely, 

605
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:09,760
 he looked forward to a new day for "Pirate King." 

606
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,030
 Are you from Yongsung? 

607
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:14,490
 Please leave now. 

608
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:18,380
 Didn't you want to do the pop-up for fans like him? 

609
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:23,320
 As a long-time "Pirate King" fan, Director Ban 

610
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,450
 wants the kids who visit the pop-up 

611
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:28,900
 to be comforted and be happy like he was. 

612
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,730
 Sir. 

613
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:40,430
 She said... 

614
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:45,970
she can't like something purely and passionately,

615
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:52,860
but she likes you very much.

616
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:55,130
I see.

617
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:17,300
You told me to wait at home.

618
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:18,890
Where have you been?

619
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:23,100
The "Pirate King" pop-up is still happening.

620
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:25,480
So you don't have to worry.

621
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:28,080
Did you convince the creator?

622
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:31,050
Yes, I just met with him.

623
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:34,900
But he said someone visited him before I did.

624
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:39,740
I wasn't helpful that much, was I?

625
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:41,570
No.

626
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:43,960
You helped tremendously.

627
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,700
Thank you.

628
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:52,440
Why do you look unhappy, then?

629
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,450
I want to be someone you can rely on,

630
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:56,520
but I don't think I am.

631
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:04,140
You went through a lot because of me.

632
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:07,990
When I went to the farm alone,

633
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:10,650
do you remember why you came?

634
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:12,540
Because being alone...

635
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,940
makes you feel lonely?

636
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,400
Yes.

637
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,450
We agreed to lean on each other.

638
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:20,360
So we don't feel lonely.

639
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,970
♫  You and me  ♫

640
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:25,990
Did you forget our promise?

641
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,830
 Let's do this. 

642
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:33,590
 I'll rely on you and... 

643
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:36,180
 you'll rely on me. 

644
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:40,110
 So we don't feel lonely. 

645
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:42,020
 So we don't... 

646
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:45,400
 feel lonely. 

647
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:48,510
Everyone around me

648
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:52,350
didn't understand my way.

649
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:55,350
But someone understands me entirely.

650
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:57,970
He's happy because of me

651
00:41:57,970 --> 00:42:01,380
and he's grateful for my love.

652
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:05,580
I don't feel lonely, thanks to that fact alone.

653
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:09,900
But that must not be enough for you.

654
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:13,110
♫  It's shining on you  ♫

655
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:15,610
♫  Tell me now  ♫

656
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:18,410
♫  Our bright night  ♫

657
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:20,400
♫  We stay bright  ♫

658
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,350
Thank you.

659
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:01,670
Yes.

660
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:04,480
 Park Ji Cheol was behind it as expected. 

661
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,280
 Since his nephew was fired, too, 

662
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:08,540
 he must've held grudges. 

663
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:11,640
 I made sure he can't mess around again. 

664
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:14,690
Okay. Thank you.

665
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:54,520
   

666
00:44:11,290 --> 00:44:13,750
   

667
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:18,420
Team Leader.

668
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:22,750
What magic spell did you cast yesterday?

669
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:25,120
Is this about the pop-up moving forward?

670
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:28,400
Yes, the creator even posted this.

671
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,950
Here.

672
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:35,230
Also, the person who created the post

673
00:44:35,230 --> 00:44:36,710
posted an apology, too.

674
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:38,700
There's also a post about

675
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:42,000
the director forgiving someone's son's mistake.

676
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,940
The public opinion was changing already,

677
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:46,540
but this will definitely quiet things down.

678
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:48,290
I thought it'd take some time,

679
00:44:48,290 --> 00:44:50,960
but I don't think the opening will be affected.

680
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:53,560
Here comes the person who worked his magic.

681
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:55,080
Hello, sir.

682
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:58,050
I didn't get to tell you something yesterday.

683
00:44:58,050 --> 00:45:00,450
The "Pirate King" creator decided to do

684
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:02,770
a signing event during the pop-up.

685
00:45:02,770 --> 00:45:04,740
Oh my god!

686
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:08,120
That's amazing!

687
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:09,480
Isn't that incredible?

688
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:11,330
This has never happened in Korea before.

689
00:45:11,330 --> 00:45:13,800
Well, I suppose.

690
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:16,730
Hold on. We need to start preparing now.

691
00:45:16,730 --> 00:45:18,790
- Hurry. 
 - Okay.

692
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:29,120
You have a wisdom tooth.

693
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:31,480
W-Wisdom tooth? At this point?

694
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:34,190
Yes, you got one very late,

695
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:36,550
but it depends on the person.

696
00:45:36,550 --> 00:45:40,560
Would you like me to pull it out now?

697
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:43,490
Will it hurt a lot?

698
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:46,480
The location doesn't seem too bad.

699
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:49,410
I'd be lying if I said it wouldn't hurt.

700
00:45:49,410 --> 00:45:51,390
Oh, okay.

701
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:53,300
I...

702
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:55,490
I'm not ready for it yet.

703
00:45:55,490 --> 00:45:59,080
Okay. Get ready and come back.

704
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:02,200
Adults are more afraid than kids.

705
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:03,870
I see.

706
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:12,180
Shin Won.

707
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:15,950
Ha Jin.

708
00:46:15,950 --> 00:46:18,500
Are you feeling better?

709
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:21,090
Yes.

710
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:28,730
I know I can call you to see you,

711
00:46:28,730 --> 00:46:31,450
but I wanted to wait for you here.

712
00:46:31,450 --> 00:46:34,990
If I suddenly showed up, I thought you'd be

713
00:46:34,990 --> 00:46:37,840
happy to see me because of the surprise.

714
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:39,520
Ha Jin.

715
00:46:40,410 --> 00:46:44,580
Even I think I'm all over the place.

716
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,840
I'm sorry.

717
00:46:50,990 --> 00:46:55,890
I went too far that day.

718
00:46:55,890 --> 00:46:59,760
You didn't suggest doing anything right away.

719
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:03,130
You were being sweet as a boyfriend

720
00:47:03,130 --> 00:47:05,670
and you were showing concern.

721
00:47:07,350 --> 00:47:09,660
But I was afraid.

722
00:47:10,810 --> 00:47:12,840
That's why I did that.

723
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:18,450
I want to keep seeing you.

724
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:21,340
I had...

725
00:47:23,070 --> 00:47:27,330
many first experiences while being with you.

726
00:47:27,330 --> 00:47:30,500
I've never been afraid to break up,

727
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:34,110
but I'm so scared and anxious now.

728
00:47:35,010 --> 00:47:39,350
If we kept seeing each other, I'd like you more

729
00:47:39,350 --> 00:47:42,330
and I'd want to keep crossing the line.

730
00:47:42,330 --> 00:47:44,420
That'd...

731
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:46,970
make me more afraid, too.

732
00:47:49,150 --> 00:47:50,810
That's why...

733
00:47:51,710 --> 00:47:53,600
I can't do this.

734
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:56,760
You're right, Ha Jin.

735
00:47:57,790 --> 00:48:00,990
We aren't going to work.

736
00:48:06,690 --> 00:48:10,590
   

737
00:48:10,590 --> 00:48:12,680
 Looks so tasty. 

738
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:20,840
   

739
00:48:22,950 --> 00:48:25,990
   

740
00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:31,090
   

741
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:35,590
 Looks tasty. 

742
00:48:35,590 --> 00:48:38,340
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

743
00:48:47,930 --> 00:48:49,930
   

744
00:48:57,230 --> 00:48:58,530
   

745
00:49:38,310 --> 00:49:40,370
Director.

746
00:49:52,450 --> 00:49:55,800
Hello, I'm the Strategy Team director at Yongsung,

747
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:57,790
Ban Ju Yeon.

748
00:49:58,250 --> 00:50:00,090
But more importantly,

749
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:04,610
I'm a long-time fan of "Pirate King."

750
00:50:04,610 --> 00:50:06,350
What? Fan?

751
00:50:06,350 --> 00:50:08,990
I didn't know he was a fan. Did you know?

752
00:50:08,990 --> 00:50:10,490
Is it just lip service?

753
00:50:10,490 --> 00:50:15,260
"Pirate King" let me escape reality.

754
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:17,860
In the stuffy everyday life,

755
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:20,490
I felt free watching "Pirate King."

756
00:50:20,490 --> 00:50:22,600
It let me be honest with my feelings

757
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:27,080
and it let me be true to myself.

758
00:50:28,350 --> 00:50:31,240
Because I was with things I liked.

759
00:50:33,410 --> 00:50:38,330
You all must've protected yourselves like me.

760
00:50:38,330 --> 00:50:42,310
I hope you enjoy the things you enjoy more freely.

761
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:45,730
Thank you for coming.

762
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,480
I left you alone,

763
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,830
but you don't know when to stop.

764
00:51:40,830 --> 00:51:42,760
Did you forget that

765
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:47,000
you're still the successor publicly?

766
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,770
I...

767
00:51:49,710 --> 00:51:52,480
couldn't always be honest.

768
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:55,300
I wanted to be loved by you.

769
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:58,530
But I couldn't be loved

770
00:51:58,530 --> 00:52:01,620
while hiding what I liked and my feelings.

771
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:03,000
I now realize that

772
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,000
being loved like that is meaningless. Because...

773
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:09,620
that's not me.

774
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:11,900
So, Grandmother,

775
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:14,370
I have no desire to take that position anymore.

776
00:52:14,370 --> 00:52:16,660
I just want to live as Ban Ju Yeon.

777
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:18,850
That'd make me happier.

778
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:22,810
We already hit the highest visit and sales rate.

779
00:52:22,810 --> 00:52:26,090
You must know the project was a success already.

780
00:52:26,090 --> 00:52:29,620
Let Ms. Baek stay in her position as you promised.

781
00:52:32,390 --> 00:52:34,800
You can fire me.

782
00:52:56,030 --> 00:52:58,090
I'll stop by the food section.

783
00:52:58,090 --> 00:52:59,950
Okay, Team Leader.

784
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,400
Team Leader Baek?

785
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:05,400
   

786
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:08,420
It's her. It's Team Leader Baek.

787
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:11,230
How does it feel to date a chaebol successor?

788
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:13,210
Since when did you date Director Ban?

789
00:53:13,210 --> 00:53:15,590
Is it true Chairwoman Jeong approved?

790
00:53:15,590 --> 00:53:17,890
The public is curious. Please say something.

791
00:53:17,890 --> 00:53:19,070
A comment, please.

792
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:21,050
 How long has it been? 

793
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:24,840
 Say something. 

794
00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:31,130
Ms. Baek never allowed interviews like this.

795
00:53:31,130 --> 00:53:33,080
I didn't, either.

796
00:53:33,990 --> 00:53:35,470
Let's go.

797
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,210
Everyone!

798
00:53:42,210 --> 00:53:44,400
Where are you all from?

799
00:53:45,270 --> 00:53:47,570
 While everything changes, 

800
00:53:47,570 --> 00:53:49,830
 if you believe there's one unchanging thing... 

801
00:53:49,830 --> 00:53:52,290
 Sis, what's this? 

802
00:53:52,290 --> 00:53:54,180
   

803
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,490
   

804
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:12,530
I'm home.

805
00:54:12,530 --> 00:54:14,410
Su Jeong.

806
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:17,670
Are you okay?

807
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:21,730
I heard something happened at the store.

808
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:25,260
I'm okay.

809
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:27,600
Really?

810
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:30,810
I said I'm okay.

811
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:40,960
   

812
00:54:42,330 --> 00:54:43,970
   

813
00:54:43,970 --> 00:54:45,080
   

814
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:46,510
   

815
00:54:46,510 --> 00:54:47,690
   

816
00:54:47,690 --> 00:54:48,900
   

817
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:50,200
   

818
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:52,960
What are they talking about?

819
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:56,470
 You don't have to worry about money 

820
00:54:56,470 --> 00:54:58,610
 and you'd never get fired, either. 

821
00:54:58,610 --> 00:55:01,170
 You don't even have to work. 

822
00:55:01,170 --> 00:55:04,000
 I would've quit immediately if I were her. 

823
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,600
 The director is your boyfriend. Why work so hard? 

824
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:09,200
 If you stay at Yongsung, 

825
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,980
 you'll keep being mistreated like that. 

826
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:15,980
 You'll be nothing but Ban Ju Yeon's girlfriend. 

827
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:17,680
   

828
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:21,710
 Congratulations on the successful reopening. 

829
00:55:21,710 --> 00:55:24,140
 You went through a lot today, too. 

830
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:26,920
 I told you. 

831
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:29,520
 Staying at Yongsung has a limit. 

832
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,460
 Think about it 

833
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:34,470
 and give me an answer within this month. 

834
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:40,390
   

835
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:53,000
   

836
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,810
   

837
00:56:02,950 --> 00:56:04,920
I made sure Ms. Baek's personal info

838
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:06,850
wouldn't be released.

839
00:56:06,850 --> 00:56:10,130
But it's hard to remove the posts

840
00:56:10,130 --> 00:56:12,750
that are already on social media.

841
00:56:12,750 --> 00:56:14,520
We can't help it, then.

842
00:56:15,290 --> 00:56:17,690
Thank you for everything. You can go home.

843
00:56:17,690 --> 00:56:21,140
You should go home, too. It's late.

844
00:56:21,140 --> 00:56:22,710
Okay.

845
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:39,430


846
00:56:47,310 --> 00:56:48,820
Did you wait long?

847
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:50,020
Three minutes?

848
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:52,270
- Let's go. 
 - Okay.

849
00:56:52,270 --> 00:56:54,930
Wow, it's already Christmas.

850
00:56:54,930 --> 00:56:59,180
Remember hunting together on Legend on Christmas?

851
00:56:59,180 --> 00:57:03,120
Of course. We had matching outfits, too.

852
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:05,240
That was fun.

853
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:09,180
We've spent Christmas and

854
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:12,440
the New Year's Day together already.

855
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:15,850
Although it's our first Christmas holding hands.

856
00:57:19,630 --> 00:57:22,350
The reporters earlier today...

857
00:57:22,350 --> 00:57:23,970
It's okay.

858
00:57:23,970 --> 00:57:27,220
I was just shocked that they ambushed.

859
00:57:28,290 --> 00:57:31,340
- I— 
 - You aren't allowed to say sorry.

860
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:33,990
Don't blame yourself either.

861
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:37,740
I'd be curious if I were them, too.

862
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:40,550
I'd want to know who's dating you.

863
00:57:41,390 --> 00:57:43,120
Really?

864
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:44,890
Of course.

865
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,720
Su Jeong.

866
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:00,910
Leave if you want to.

867
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:05,530
As early as tomorrow.

868
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:23,340
   

869
00:58:24,130 --> 00:58:25,600
   

870
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:29,600
♫  Can't be grasped like it was a dream  ♫

871
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:37,380
♫  We thought we weren't meant to be together  ♫

872
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:41,200
♫  As much as I thought of you  ♫

873
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:46,030
♫  I hope we meet again someday  ♫

874
00:58:46,030 --> 00:58:51,260
♫  I'll say it tonight  ♫

875
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:52,790
 Chief, it's an emergency. 

876
00:58:52,790 --> 00:58:56,060
 Of course, you can't reach her. 

877
00:58:56,060 --> 00:58:57,800
 I knew it'd be here. 

878
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:59,950
 I love you, Ha Jin. 

879
00:58:59,950 --> 00:59:02,520
 Shin Won, don't talk for a moment. 

880
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:03,920
 Why are you suddenly removing the stuff? 

881
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:05,690
 If leaving is the right thing to do, 

882
00:59:05,690 --> 00:59:07,580
 what would I be leaving for? 

883
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:10,670
 - Cheers! 
 - I don't want to say bye to you. 

884
00:59:10,670 --> 00:59:14,150
 I'm grateful that you care so much for me. 

885
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:18,670
 We need to cancel the contract for that reason. 

886
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:24,800
♫  I hope we meet again someday  ♫

887
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:28,040
♫  I'll say it tonight  ♫
