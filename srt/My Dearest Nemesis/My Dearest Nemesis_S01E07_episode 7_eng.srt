1
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:15,080


2
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,750
   

3
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:20,590
   

4
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,160
   

5
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,970
   

6
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:27,820
   

7
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:31,980
   

8
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,740
   

9
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:49,100
   

10
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:51,290
   

11
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:01,160
 You recognize it. 

12
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,580
 It's the brand I use. 

13
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:05,800
 I only use their products. 

14
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,330
 So does my favorite band's vocalist. 

15
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:13,970
Su Jeong?

16
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:16,970
What's wrong?

17
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:22,190
I'm sorry, Ji Wu, but...

18
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,510
   

19
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:29,350
I'm sorry. Just one second.

20
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,970
Yes.

21
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,650
Pardon?

22
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:38,590
I'm at the department store now. Why—

23
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:40,380
Hello?

24
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,390
What?

25
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:45,570
Is something wrong?

26
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:47,680
No, it's nothing.

27
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:51,130
Shall we go, then?

28
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:52,560
Sure.

29
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:58,440
How's this?

30
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,240
It's simple. I think it'd suit you.

31
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,490
That's nice. I like it.

32
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,700
The size is...

33
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,910
Just one moment.

34
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:08,430
Sure.

35
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:11,510
Excuse me.

36
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,550
Director.

37
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,800
You can't be here looking like that.

38
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,740
You've tried so hard to hide that.

39
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,470
I know.

40
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,630
I know this is crazy, too, but—

41
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:43,570
- But why are you here— 
 - I remember everything.

42
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:53,570
That was...

43
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:57,620
my first kiss.

44
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,040
 Gosh, why won't it open? 

45
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,590
Gosh.

46
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,400
 How strange. 

47
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:09,630
What do we do?

48
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:14,030
What's wrong?

49
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,920
The door won't open.

50
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,290
No one went in.

51
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:25,200
Stay here.

52
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,810
My gosh!

53
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,700
 Gosh, I'm sorry. 

54
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,180
I didn't know you were in there.

55
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:34,080
Su Jeong, why were you in there...

56
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,990
I was checking to see if I wore my shirt inside out.

57
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:40,120
I must've startled you since I didn't answer.

58
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,640
How about your size? Did you find any?

59
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,080
- Well, no. 
 - Right.

60
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,010
Only my size was missing.

61
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:50,050
We can try something else, then.

62
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:51,880
That. That one. I love that one.

63
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,760
That gray one. The gray one. The gray one.

64
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,810
How's the gray one? It's so pretty.

65
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:58,090
Do you have his size?

66
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:59,540
Would you be able to check?

67
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,830
- Well, yes. Just one moment. 
 - O-Okay.

68
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,510
White clothes get ruined easily.

69
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,040
This one has a nice pattern.

70
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,690
Could you check this side?

71
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:09,180
I'll check over there.

72
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:13,210
This is pretty. That one is, too.

73
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:26,120
Thank you for shopping with me, Su Jeong.

74
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,610
When would you be free next time?

75
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:32,540
Well...

76
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:41,060
I don't think I can see you next time.

77
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,100
Team Leader Baek Su Jeong.

78
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,320
There's urgent work to do. What are you doing here?

79
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,540
Pardon?

80
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:59,350
There's no time to waste. Follow me.

81
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,950
Wait, Director...

82
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,250
I'm sorry.

83
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,980
It's okay.

84
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,040
You can get going.

85
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,370
I'm sorry.

86
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:19,650
I'm so sorry.

87
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,520
 So, 

88
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,700
 enjoy it all you want. 

89
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:53,720
You can't just act like this.

90
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,220
I was put in a tough spot.

91
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,640
I already felt bad for him.

92
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:00,110
I don't feel bad for that man.

93
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,430
- What? 
 - By the way,

94
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:05,130
I'm sorry I didn't remember the kiss.

95
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:07,140
I apologize for that.

96
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:10,210
You're apologizing now?

97
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:15,060
Well, fine. I'll accept it.

98
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:18,380
I decided to think it never happened, anyway.

99
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,390
Never happened?

100
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:23,970
Wouldn't it be easier for both of us going forward?

101
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,910
I think you're mistaken.

102
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:30,300
I only apologized for not remembering.

103
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,970
I'm not sorry I kissed you. That was...

104
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:37,740
not a mistake.

105
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:45,750
Well...

106
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:49,200
if it wasn't a mistake...

107
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,300
It wasn't a mistake.

108
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,020
It's not like I did it for no reason.

109
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,280
   

110
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:04,620
Um...

111
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:08,290
I just remembered I'm meeting someone.

112
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:10,890
I-I'll talk to you later.

113
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:12,650
Wait...

114
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:21,780
Is she shy?

115
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:26,210
I can see that.

116
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:28,870
She's shyer than I thought.

117
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,850
Are you all burning up from the date?

118
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:46,410
Unni!

119
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:49,450
I was asking if your heart was feeling the passion.

120
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:52,010
What are you thinking?

121
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:55,550
So? Will you keep seeing him?

122
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:58,120
No. I turned him down.

123
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,890
What? Why?

124
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:02,160
I thought he seemed all right.

125
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,130
You didn't like him this time?

126
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:06,740
He seemed all right this time, too.

127
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,260
That's what I'm saying.

128
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:10,600
He's the type you wanted.

129
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,470
He's older, has a stable job,

130
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:16,180
and has a down-to-earth taste and personality.

131
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,750
Yeah.

132
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:21,530
I don't like younger men and I hate men with strange tastes, too.

133
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:24,090
So, what's the issue?

134
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:28,970
Do you...

135
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:33,240
have someone else in mind, by chance?

136
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,610
A highball, please.

137
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:38,260
Okay.

138
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:41,260
Coming.

139
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,420
No.

140
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,800
I like that guy?

141
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,770
There's no way.

142
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,100
I was wearing this.

143
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:12,120
Is that why she found me more attractive?

144
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:33,750
How could I forget such a precious memory?

145
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,410
Don't...

146
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:38,770
Don't ever go anywhere near makgeolli, Ban Ju Yeon.

147
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:17,560
   

148
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:26,920
 It wasn't a mistake. 

149
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,640
 It's not like I did it for no reason. 

150
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,000
What now, then?

151
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,500
Does he want to go out or something?

152
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:39,300
He's the same age as Su Bin. The same age.

153
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:45,980
   

154
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:53,020
   

155
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,400
 I'm not like this guy. 

156
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,110
What's he talking about?

157
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,480
He's so funny.

158
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,250
 Please believe me. 

159
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:11,010
What's he saying?

160
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,890
What's this?

161
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:30,380
Gosh, I don't know!

162
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,280
 You said, "Talk to you later." 

163
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,500
 When is "later," exactly? 

164
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,620
   

165
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,900
It's too formal.

166
00:11:55,900 --> 00:12:00,120
Still... 
    

167
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,250
we kissed once.

168
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,800
   

169
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,420
   

170
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:19,050
   

171
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:26,140
Sometimes you have to wait.

172
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,640
I'll see her tomorrow.

173
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,960
Let's not be hasty.

174
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:40,780
Su Jeong.

175
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:45,580
I heard your friend rejected that man.

176
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,340
Yes. How did you know?

177
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:50,720
Hey, his mom is apparently crying about it

178
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,280
saying the woman must be snobby.

179
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:57,490
Geez! I told you to go on a date instead.

180
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:00,970
Not many men are okay with a flawed woman.

181
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:02,610
Hold on.

182
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:03,900
Am I the flawed woman?

183
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,100
That's right. Why did you have to get divorced?

184
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,880
Why is getting divorced a flaw?

185
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,760
I mean, you couldn't control your temper

186
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,420
and destroyed a perfectly good family.

187
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:16,230
Do you think you can do that in the right mind?

188
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:18,660
That's how bad it was for me.

189
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:21,900
Anyway, I'm fine hearing that but don't say that to anyone else.

190
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:25,680
If you say getting divorced is a flaw, someone is bound to hate you for it.

191
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,470
I'm not the only one who says that.

192
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:29,700
Everyone thinks you're flawed.

193
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,970
- A lot of people don't. 
 - Gosh...

194
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:33,420
It's just you. Just you.

195
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:37,070
I'm serious. There's someone else.

196
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:38,520
Is it a man?

197
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,010
Seriously.

198
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:42,930
You can't stop thinking about men, can you?

199
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:45,500
Let me meet him if it's a man.

200
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,490
Why? Will you date him?

201
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:49,700
Goodness, goodness, you little—

202
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,400
You're a little brat, aren't you?

203
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,420
Dad, Mom wants to date other men.

204
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:57,020
Hey, Seo Ha Jin,

205
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,610
don't tease your mom.

206
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:01,040
It's because she worries about you.

207
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,690
Gosh, poor me for being single.

208
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:26,930
Are you looking for someone?

209
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:28,580
Oh.

210
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,290
I assure you I'm not.

211
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:33,260
Let's go up. We have lots of important things to do.

212
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:45,470
Seok Hui,

213
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:47,400
why would you do this yourself?

214
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,960
Because it's my job.

215
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,590
I know, but give them to me.

216
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:51,620
- I'll carry them. 
 - I'm okay.

217
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,250
No.

218
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,940
Well...

219
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,280
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

220
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,400
Hello.

221
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,010
Hello.

222
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:17,960
Team Leader, aren't you getting in?

223
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:29,520
- Team Leader Baek— 
 - Deputy Jeong.

224
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,490
Yes.

225
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:33,710
Are Ludwig, Frid, Heinrich, Carlos, and Barbarossa doing well?

226
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:35,720
How do you know my dogs' names?

227
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,250
Even my parents don't know.

228
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,840
Of course I do.

229
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,120
I heard you rescued them.

230
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,880
I've always admired your kindness.

231
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,270
I'm so touched.

232
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,560
What the heck?

233
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,120
Na Na, eat this.

234
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,590
- I'll eat out. 
 - What?

235
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,860
Why does she keep avoiding me?

236
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,430
   

237
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:38,000
   

238
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,760
   

239
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,300
   

240
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,500
It's all stuff like this?

241
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,500
   

242
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,460
   

243
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,520
Gosh, I'm dying.

244
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:16,680
 Yongsung Department Store put forward Director Ban, 

245
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,550
 the grandson of Chairwoman Jeong Hyo Seon, 

246
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:21,610
 to work on a major renewal project. 

247
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:24,660
 Director Ban has been avoiding exposure; 

248
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:27,060
 however, he officially made his existence known. 

249
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:29,590
 Many predict it as a preliminary step to set him up 

250
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,870
 as the successor. 

251
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:33,670
 - As the succession becomes clear...  
 - Wow, he was...

252
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:36,490
an impressive man.

253
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:01,220
Team Leader, the promotional article is up.

254
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,450
I'll send you the link.

255
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:04,300
Okay. I'll check it right away.

256
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,340
I guess the PR Team added Director Ban's story, too.

257
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:11,940
And the public reaction is explosive right now.

258
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,590
Looks like he's officially the successor.

259
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:16,610
This is amazing.

260
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,520
We live in different worlds. Seriously.

261
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,580
   

262
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:24,620
   

263
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,200
I know.

264
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:32,090
How did I forget about this?

265
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:36,800
I had no reason to ponder.

266
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:45,370
   

267
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:47,500
   

268
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:49,780
 ­  

269
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:14,110
I have no reason to avoid him. Why am I doing this?

270
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,820
I know.

271
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:20,520
It's not like you can keep doing this.

272
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:24,540
We were supposed to talk. Why do you keep avoiding me?

273
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:27,680
You're friendly to everyone else.

274
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:30,110
What did you want to talk about?

275
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,570
I told you.

276
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:35,270
I don't think our kiss was a mistake.

277
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:38,890
I won't pretend it never happened, so...

278
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:41,970
- unless you dislike me and avoid— 
 - Director,

279
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:44,310
I think you forgot. We're at work.

280
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:46,330
You're the director.

281
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:50,410
Not just any director but Yongsung's successor.

282
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:55,950
And I'm your subordinate.

283
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,720
You don't want to just let it slide?

284
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,630
What will you do, then?

285
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:04,090
Will you hold my hand?

286
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:06,790
Can you hold my hand and go outside?

287
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:09,140
Can you stand...

288
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,820
in front of people and the chairwoman?

289
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,870
I don't want to either.

290
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,400
I'm not interested in getting fired.

291
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,300
So...

292
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,270
we have nothing to talk about.

293
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,950
We don't need to.

294
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,500

303
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,910
 Did you forget I confessed my feelings to you? 

304
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:30,390
 Oh, that? 

305
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,890
 Did you forget I said no? 

306
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:37,160
 If that's why you come here, I find it uncomfortable. 

307
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,120
I thought you went home.

308
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,840
I'm a bit out of it right now.

309
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,000
Get in. Get in.

310
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,520
Yes.

311
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:59,890
What? Se Won is getting married?

312
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:01,390
Our classmate?

313
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:04,740
 Yes, feels like it was yesterday she chased you in 12th grade. 

314
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,580
 I suppose she wasn't the only one. 

315
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,520
 She wants to give us the invitation in person. 

316
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,000
Okay.

317
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,950
Right, did you leave work?

318
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:14,750
Should we grab a drink if you're free?

319
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,340
 Deal. Sounds good. 

320
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:18,710
 Should we meet at Sulo again? 

321
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:24,850
Let's go somewhere else.

322
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:26,470
I stopped going there.

323
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,860
 Why? Their food was good. 

324
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:32,620
Because I can't make her feel uncomfortable.

325
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,080
 What did you say? 

326
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,160
Huh?

327
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:39,020
I think I went there too many times.

328
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:42,240
I won't go back there ever again.

329

♫  Don't shy away from the darkness  ♫

341
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:52,540
♫  Let the covers keep you warm  ♫

342
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:58,230
♫  We can brave the storm  ♫

343
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:15,840
Absence makes the heart grow fonder, they say.

344
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:25,050
You were mentioned in the last board meeting

345
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:26,940
and everyone reacted positively.

346
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:29,830
They seemed excited about the renewal project, too.

347
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:31,630
That's good to hear.

348
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,710
Since you were introduced officially,

349
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:39,750
people seem to treat you very differently.

350
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,810
Since I have a bigger responsibility,

351
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:44,220
I should work harder.

352
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:56,240
 You're the director. 

353
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,320
 Not just any director, but Yongsung's successor. 

354
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:05,000
 And I'm your subordinate. 

355
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,130
 So... 

356
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:09,630
 we have nothing to talk about. 

357
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:11,420
 We don't need to. 

358
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:19,350
She looked pretty even at that moment.

359
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,070
Baek Su Jeong.

360
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:34,290
I saw the article.

361
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:37,160
That was a nice photo. When did you take it?

362
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:40,780
Do you have anything carbonated? Or coffee?

363
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:43,350
I don't. Drink this.

364
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:47,900
Yes.

365
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:52,050
I should drink cold water and wake up.

366
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,640
What's going on out of the blue?

367
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,110
I just wanted to congratulate you.

368
00:25:57,110 --> 00:26:00,940
By the way, do I need a reason to visit you?

369
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,930
Don't you think so?

370
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:09,160
To be honest,

371
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:13,200
I felt like I had to go somewhere.

372
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:17,010
Or I would've gone back there again.

373
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,760
Ju Yeon,

374
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,910
do you know why General Kim Yu Sin

375
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:23,510
beheaded his horse?

376
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:28,180
You mean General Kim Yu Sin who was born in 595 AD Silla?

377
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:29,910
He's admirable as a general, but

378
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:34,200
he blamed his weak willpower on an innocent animal.

379
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,890
- Why? 
 - Huh?

380
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:38,350
Yes.

381
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:41,370
Yes, you're right.

382
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:45,490
But I can understand how he felt.

383
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:51,740
It's not like I can tie myself up.

384
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:55,360
My head says I shouldn't...

385
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:58,840
but I keep missing her.

386
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:02,070
Is that why?

387
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:08,280
My body keeps going to her.

388
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:14,780
Gosh, I need to get it together.

389
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,010
One's heart always...

390
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:23,350
acts before one's head.

391
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:28,160
Is that what it means to like someone...

392
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:31,840
sincerely that I can't give up?

393
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:44,540
   

394
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:56,220
Good morning.

395
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:00,050
Well, yes.

396
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:14,700
Yes, we agreed to meet again tomorrow for lunch.

397
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,790
It's a treat for me.

398
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:19,670
Do you know Baekyonggak?

399
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:22,120
I heard it's a reservation there.

400
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,000
I know.

401
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,390
I admire the effort.

402
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:29,930
But I'll pay for the meal.

403
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:32,240
Yeah...

404
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,330
all right.

405
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,000
Who are you meeting?

406
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:46,990
Could it be the man I saw at the department store?

407
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:50,980
It's personal.

408
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:54,510
I don't think I need to answer, Director.

409
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,880
 Yes, we agreed to meet again tomorrow for lunch. 

410
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,010
 Do you know Baekyonggak? 

411
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:47,470
 I heard there's a reservation there. 

412
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,930
 I thought I should do that. 

413
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:02,410
- Is he crazy? 
 - It could be a surprise.

414
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:03,770
Gosh, what do I do?

415
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:05,840
Who's that man now?

416
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,230
Stop!

417
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:11,010
That's enough.

418
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:14,740
Director.

419
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,840
What are you doing here?

420
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:19,480
Father?

421
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,950
 Su Bin's girlfriend? 

422
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:24,530
 Didn't you say you met her once? 

423
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:27,800
 Yes, we agreed to meet again tomorrow for lunch. 

424
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,000
 It's a treat for me. 

425
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,740
 Lunch? Where? 

426
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:32,650
 Do you know Baekyonggak? 

427
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:34,090
 I heard there's a reservation there. 

428
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:35,970
 That's a famous restaurant. 

429
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:37,160
 But they're not even married. 

430
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,650
 Why would she treat you guys? 

431
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:39,920
 I know. 

432
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,820
 I admire the effort. 

433
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:44,080
 But I'll pay for the meal. 

434
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,550
You're the one who paid Dad's hospital bill.

435
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:50,330
That director?

436
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:53,900
Hello, I'm Baek Su Bin, the eldest son.

437
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:57,390
But what brings you here, Director?

438
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,960
I'm meeting someone here, too.

439
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,900
I happened to run into you here.

440
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,320
I see.

441
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,500
We'll let you go, then.

442
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:08,380
But they canceled on me just now.

443
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:11,040
Do you mind if I join you?

444
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:14,290
Well, we're having a family meal.

445
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:15,880
Yongsung is one family.

446
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,120
Wouldn't it be okay?

447
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:20,230
Team Leader Baek achieved something great recently.

448
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:22,710
I've been meaning to treat her to a meal.

449
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:24,790
Our Su Jeong did?

450
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:26,590
Su Bin's girlfriend is coming.

451
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:28,590
Gosh. It's okay. It's okay.

452
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:30,000
She's a social butterfly.

453
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,620
She's not shy.

454
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:33,460
Why don't we have a seat?

455
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:36,380
I'll tell you what she did, where and when

456
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:38,160
in great detail.

457
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:41,470
Sounds good. Have a seat. Yes.

458
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:48,620
 Thanks to Team Leader Baek, 

459
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:50,670
we were able to convince CEO An.

460
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:52,580
That's how tenacious she is.

461
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:54,470
I don't know who she got that from.

462
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:57,800
She must've gotten that from her amazing father.

463
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:01,510
You really have a good eye for people.

464
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:04,510
I tend to be that way.

465
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:05,990
I knew it.

466
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:07,570
What do we do?

467
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:10,020
Ye Na can't come because of an emergency dispatch.

468
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:12,310
Really? We can't help it, then.

469
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:15,400
His girlfriend is a police officer.

470
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,730
She feels terrible.

471
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:19,140
She congratulates you again for removing the cast.

472
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,620
She wants to treat us next time.

473
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:23,600
Tell her I appreciate the gesture alone.

474
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,730
Then, I can treat you to this meal today.

475
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:28,720
Have plenty to eat.

476
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,100
Who said you could—

477
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:31,650
Excuse me!

478
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:35,220
Please bring us the menu.

479
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,930
Thank you for the meal.

480
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:46,870
Excuse me, Mr. Ban.

481
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:52,480
I wasn't sure, but

482
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,450
you're interested in my sister. Right?

483
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,950
My dad told me

484
00:32:57,950 --> 00:32:59,580
that you're Yongsung's successor.

485
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:04,490
You're an impressive person. Why my sister?

486
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:07,440
I don't know how you think of her,

487
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,800
but she's very precious to us.

488
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,660
She went through and sacrificed a lot.

489
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:14,080
When I was being looked down on,

490
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,880
she used to play a video game in my place.

491
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,080
So, if you're doing this lightly to play around,

492
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,760
I won't let you get away with it.

493
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:29,640
You don't have to worry about that.

494
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:36,140
I'm not doing this lightly.

495
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:44,440
Chairwoman, I finished what you asked me to do.

496
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,340
- Already? 
 - Yes.

497
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:50,100
You sure are quick and thorough.

498
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,570
This is why

499
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:54,050
I also asked you to clean Director Ban's house.

500
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:56,680
You're doing a good job there, too, right?

501
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,580
It's all good, but he said not to enter the study.

502
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,450
He said he doesn't need it cleaned.

503
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:04,140
The study?

504
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,990
What's he keeping in there?

505
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:07,600
I'm not sure,

506
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,820
but it looked like there was a CCTV, too.

507
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,920
All right. You can go now.

508
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:23,450
   

509
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:32,320
You wanted to see me, Chairwoman.

510
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,690
You can go ahead inside.

511
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:40,180
As soon as we're done here,

512
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:42,930
let's go to Director Ban's house.

513
00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:44,310
What is it all of a sudden?

514
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:46,940
I need to check his study.

515
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:49,760
He doesn't let anyone in there.

516
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:54,460
I'm curious about what important stuff he has there.

517
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:56,150
I'll let Director Ban know.

518
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:57,630
No.

519
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:59,580
That's not necessary.

520
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:13,730
Where are your father and brother?

521
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,240
I let them go because I wanted to say something.

522
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:21,900
What are you thinking, exactly?

523
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:24,760
Why did you come here for?

524
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,870
I thought we finished talking last time.

525
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:28,900
I thought you understood.

526
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:33,340
It's because I was scared.

527
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:39,810
While I was acting foolishly,

528
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:42,860
if you came to like someone else,

529
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:45,800
what would I do?

530
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,880
I don't like that.

531
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:52,190
Understanding doesn't mean...

532
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:56,180
I no longer have feelings.

533
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:13,610
Yes, Chief.

534
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:15,680
 As soon as the event ends, 

535
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,540
 the chairwoman will visit your house. 

536
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:19,360
She's coming to my house?

537
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:22,710
 Yes. We'll be leaving in two hours. 

538
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:24,720
She seems to think

539
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:28,280
 there's something in your study. 

540
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,130
I need to go home immediately.

541
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:39,330
What's going on?

542
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:40,830
What's wrong with her coming to your place?

543
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:42,150
The study.

544
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:44,420
She'll find out there's...

545
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:48,080
Calm down for a moment.

546
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:50,600
 Grandmother, please. Grandmother... 

547
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,490
 Forgive me just once, Grandmother. 

548
00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:54,180
 Don't do that, Grandmother. 

549
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:57,030
 Grandmother! Grandmother! 

550
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,770
Everything could burn and disappear.

551
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:05,310
The things I treasure.

552
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:09,740
- Move. 
 - And if you went like this?

553
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:11,880
Do you have a plan?

554
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:18,290
Let's buy time for now.

555
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,350
   

556
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:27,120
Chairwoman.

557
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:29,330
Hello.

558
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:31,210
You remember me, right? I'm Shin Won.

559
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:32,440
Kim Shin Won.

560
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,170
Yes.

561
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:36,040
Long time no see.

562
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:39,750
I heard you're still close with Director Ban.

563
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:41,210
Yes, of course.

564
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:43,070
We're basically like brothers.

565
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:45,290
Since he's working at the department store,

566
00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:47,380
we're able to hang out more often.

567
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:48,820
Is that so?

568
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:53,230
By the way, you haven't changed at all.

569
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:55,390
Does the passage of time not apply to you?

570
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:58,360
The PR Team at the HQ needs to work harder.

571
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,390
Your photos don't do justice.

572
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:03,080
You look so young and beautiful.

573
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:07,810
You're still good at schmoozing.

574
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:09,150
Thank you.

575
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:12,230
By the way, what brings you here?

576
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:15,400
Oh, well, I-I was just in the area.

577
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,350
Have you eaten, Chairwoman?

578
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:19,930
If you haven't, would you like to join me?

579
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:21,410
When would I ever get to

580
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:24,560
have the honor of having a meal with you again?

581
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,000
Yes.

582
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,730
I'm sorry,

583
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:29,860
but I need to get going. I'm busy.

584
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:31,600
Chairwoman.

585
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,910
How about a t-tea for a moment, then?

586
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:38,150
Stop taking more of my time.

587
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:41,950
T-Take care.

588
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,730
   

589
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:51,900
Yes, I did try to stall her

590
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,620
but I think eating with her is pushing it.

591
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:55,880
What's going on, exactly?

592
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,430
If you leave your truck here,

593
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:59,640
how about the other cars?

594
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,520
Restroom?

595
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,500
I'll call the police if you don't come now.

596
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,390
A lot of time has passed.

597
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:10,790
Should I postpone the visit to the director's house?

598
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:12,280
It's okay.

599
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:14,750
It'd just take a moment, anyway.

600
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:16,270
You have another appointment afterward, too.

601
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:18,570
Why are we still talking?

602
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,380
I'm sorry.

603
00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:28,830
I'm sorry, I was in such a hurry.

604
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:32,500
I think a car could easily pass through here.

605
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,870
How weird.

606
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:37,120
What do you mean, parked in the middle of the road?

607
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,640
Did I?

608
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,000
But I guess you can't...

609
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,950
you can't just go like this.

610
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:45,280
Whatever. Move your truck now.

611
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,590
Okay, okay.

612
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:49,040
I feel so terrible, by the way.

613
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,230
Should I cut some sashimi for you?

614
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:54,320
I have a ton of fish straight from Jeju—

615
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:58,140
Look! Stop talking nonsense and move the truck!

616
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:00,760
I guess you don't want it.

617
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:03,120
I got it! Okay.

618
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:21,040
Yes, Su Jeong.

619
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,560
I did my best, but...

620
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:26,610
So, why are you trying to stop the chairwoman?

621
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:55,010
You'll tell me later?

622
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:57,870
Huh? Okay.

623
00:40:57,870 --> 00:41:00,460
Hello? Hello...

624
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:02,850
What?

625
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:08,400
I can't believe I ran into you here.

626
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:12,760
I know. What brings you here?

627
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:15,240
Su Jeong asked me a favor.

628
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:18,060
Huh? Ju Yeon asked me a favor.

629
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:19,430
Really?

630
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:21,440
I thought they weren't close anymore.

631
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,210
Was I wrong?

632
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:26,330
Anyway, good to see you.

633
00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:27,780
I'll get going now.

634
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:29,310
Okay.

635
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:32,380
- Drive safely. 
 - Okay.

636
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:47,170
If she was so happy to see me,

637
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:49,620
she should've gotten out briefly.

638
00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:13,440
What are you doing? Load the rest of the stuff.

639
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,020
Yes, I should.

640
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:22,860
 We're at the parking lot. 

641
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:25,420
They're in front of the building now.

642
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,930
Already?

643
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:30,890
We moved the important stuff, right?

644
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:32,840
What should we do with the rest?

645
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,490
If we blocked the door to this room—

646
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:36,200
She's already suspicious.

647
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,970
She won't just go back.

648
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:40,080
What should we do, then?

649
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:06,930
I came to see how you live.

650
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:08,830
I guess you were about to leave.

651
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:10,300
Yes.

652
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:12,840
I'd like to invite you next time if that's okay—

653
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:16,090
No need to be invited to check out your place.

654
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:17,530
Why?

655
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:21,030
Is there a reason I shouldn't go into your place?

656
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:26,880
No.

657
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,500
Let's go up together if it's not anything urgent.

658
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:51,210
Take me to the study.

659
00:43:51,210 --> 00:43:52,810
Okay.

660
00:44:25,470 --> 00:44:28,070
It looks normal.

661
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:33,150
I'm curious why you don't let her clean this room.

662
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:41,460
 Are you... 

663
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:45,010
hiding something in here?

664
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:47,580
Huh?

665
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:17,470
I'm sorry.

666
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:21,740
 I'll leave first. 

667
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:25,130
 You don't want to leave now and run into her. 

668
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:30,610
 Stay here. 

669
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:49,910
I thought you were doing something silly again.

670
00:45:49,910 --> 00:45:52,730
Were you trying to hide this?

671
00:45:53,910 --> 00:45:56,670
I know you wouldn't be happy...

672
00:45:57,570 --> 00:45:59,840
if you knew I had that photo.

673
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:04,390
I don't have the right to...

674
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:08,760
cry or feel sad.

675
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:10,970
Yes.

676
00:46:11,490 --> 00:46:13,390
So, why did you keep it if you knew that?

677
00:46:13,390 --> 00:46:15,070
I know...

678
00:46:18,030 --> 00:46:20,190
I don't have the right,

679
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:24,050
but I wanted to keep a photo, at least.

680
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:30,910
Because I miss them so much.

681
00:46:31,710 --> 00:46:35,190
You think you have the right to miss them?

682
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:45,040
If it wasn't for you,

683
00:46:45,830 --> 00:46:49,180
my son would still be here.

684
00:46:52,270 --> 00:46:54,260
Not this stupid photo,

685
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:57,220
but my actual son!

686
00:47:19,050 --> 00:47:21,340
Weak jerk.

687
00:47:47,330 --> 00:47:51,170
Keep a closer eye on him from now on.

688
00:47:51,170 --> 00:47:53,280
Should I have someone watch him?

689
00:47:53,930 --> 00:47:56,330
I'm having you watch him.

690
00:47:56,330 --> 00:47:58,630
Who else do we need?

691
00:47:59,430 --> 00:48:03,170
Yes, I'll watch him more closely.

692
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:33,340
Be careful. You'll hurt yourself.

693
00:48:43,870 --> 00:48:47,380
You know my parents died in a car accident, right?

694
00:48:50,990 --> 00:48:54,330
We were on our way to an anime event.

695
00:48:54,330 --> 00:48:56,670
They were both busy,

696
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:01,710
but I begged them because I wanted to go.

697
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:05,500
That's when we got into an accident on the way.

698
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:09,630
Thanks to their protection, I survived.

699
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:12,140
But they died in an accident

700
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:14,500
they shouldn't have been in because of me.

701
00:49:15,850 --> 00:49:19,920
Grandmother indeed lost her only son because of me.

702
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:24,110
So, I decided to make it up to her.

703
00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:30,310
To become the person she wants and replace Father.

704
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:34,290
Director.

705
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:45,180
But even after that,

706
00:49:46,290 --> 00:49:49,410
I still couldn't give up on my joy.

707
00:49:49,410 --> 00:49:52,200
The next volume of my favorite cartoon

708
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:55,190
and the band's new song and show.

709
00:49:56,770 --> 00:49:59,240
I needed things like that...

710
00:50:00,810 --> 00:50:03,570
to look forward to tomorrow.

711
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,500
Even though no one loved me, I felt fulfilled.

712
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:18,990
That's why...

713
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:24,990
when you told me to like the things I like

714
00:50:24,990 --> 00:50:29,150
all I want in front of the fountain,

715
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:34,840
I was really happy.

716
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:39,510
I meant it.

717
00:50:40,530 --> 00:50:42,360
You looked...

718
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:47,020
really happy, then.

719
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:52,630
I wanted you to continue to be happy.

720
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:04,540
I like you.

721
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:11,860
I've hidden things I liked for a long time.

722
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:15,660
Because everything I liked was a secret.

723
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:18,870
That's why I couldn't tell you, but...

724
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:26,110
but I like you so much, Baek Su Jeong.

725
00:51:32,210 --> 00:51:34,640
I'm sorry I couldn't hold it in.

726
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:39,700
Thank you for today.

727
00:52:22,470 --> 00:52:23,580
There's my daughter.

728
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:25,780
Yes, Dad. You were home.

729
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:27,150
What are you talking about?

730
00:52:27,150 --> 00:52:28,890
You asked me to receive packages.

731
00:52:28,890 --> 00:52:31,460
People came to deliver them and left.

732
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:34,390
Oh, yeah. That's right.

733
00:52:34,390 --> 00:52:35,620
Are you sick?

734
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:38,020
You were meeting someone. You look terrible.

735
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:40,540
No, I'm not sick.

736
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:43,390
I asked them to put the packages in the attic.

737
00:52:43,390 --> 00:52:45,810
Why was there so much stuff?

738
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:48,340
Someone I know asked me to keep them briefly.

739
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:49,840
They'll take them back soon.

740
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:52,320
We don't use that space, anyway.

741
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:55,730
I don't mind keeping them there for a long time, but

742
00:52:55,730 --> 00:52:58,180
you're sure you're okay, right?

743
00:52:58,180 --> 00:53:02,210
Of course. Why would I not be okay?

744
00:53:05,330 --> 00:53:07,020
Su Jeong.

745
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:08,290
Yes?

746
00:53:08,290 --> 00:53:10,220
You know...

747
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:13,870
seeing you smile like that breaks my heart.

748
00:53:13,870 --> 00:53:15,940
Because I'm not good enough

749
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:19,370
and because you can't rely on me...

750
00:53:19,370 --> 00:53:22,210
Since you can't tell me when something's going on,

751
00:53:22,210 --> 00:53:24,880
I wonder if all you do is smile like that.

752
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,670
So...

753
00:53:27,890 --> 00:53:29,530
Dad,

754
00:53:29,530 --> 00:53:32,620
please don't worry. Nothing's going on.

755
00:53:32,620 --> 00:53:36,500
I'm just tired because I've been out a while.

756
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:39,800
Okay, then. Go inside and rest.

757
00:53:40,410 --> 00:53:41,620
You go in, too.

758
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:43,080
Okay.

759
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:02,330
 You've been smiling a lot. 

760
00:54:02,330 --> 00:54:04,380
 You don't usually smile. 

761
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:07,080
 How can I make you feel better? 

762
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:12,260
 Isn't working alone hard? 

763
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:14,190
 It's lonely, too. 

764
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:29,310
 I've hidden things I liked for a long time. 

765
00:54:29,310 --> 00:54:32,130
 Because everything I liked was a secret. 

766
00:54:32,130 --> 00:54:35,040
 That's why I couldn't tell you, but... 

767
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:39,010
 but I like you so much, Baek Su Jeong. 

768
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:10,570
♫  Love is just like a miracle  ♫

769
00:55:10,570 --> 00:55:17,200
♫  It seems close to grasp, but I can't  ♫

770
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:23,610
♫  Even if our hearts touch each other's  ♫

771
00:55:23,610 --> 00:55:26,170
 I know this is crazy, too, but... 

772
00:55:26,170 --> 00:55:28,140
 I remember everything. 

773
00:55:29,230 --> 00:55:30,820
 That was... 

774
00:55:32,290 --> 00:55:34,210
 my first kiss. 

775
00:55:34,210 --> 00:55:38,150
♫  The beautiful moments that passed by  ♫

776
00:55:38,150 --> 00:55:41,830
♫  Can't be grasped like it was a dream  ♫

777
00:55:41,830 --> 00:55:46,420
♫  We thought we were meant to be together  ♫

778
00:55:46,420 --> 00:55:49,620
♫  We thought we were meant to be together  ♫

779
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:54,160
♫  As much as I thought of you  ♫

780
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:56,150
 The phone is powered off. 

781
00:55:56,150 --> 00:55:58,440
 You'll be connected to the voicemail... 

782
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:02,300
♫  I'll say it tonight  ♫

783
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:04,160
 I like you. 

784
00:56:06,170 --> 00:56:11,880
♫  Even if moments I hoped for come  ♫

785
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:15,870
♫  We're not each other's miracle  ♫

786
00:56:15,870 --> 00:56:17,370
Director.

787
00:56:18,190 --> 00:56:20,390
Director, are you in there?

788
00:56:20,390 --> 00:56:23,140
I want to ask you something.

789
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:28,460
♫  In the end of the faint moments  ♫

790
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:32,120
♫  You're becoming more prominent  ♫

791
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:36,960
♫  We'll meet each other again someday  ♫

792
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:40,000
♫  I'll be hoping for that  ♫

793
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,790
♫  As much as I've waited  ♫

794
00:56:43,790 --> 00:56:48,630
♫  I hope we run into each other again  ♫

795
00:56:48,630 --> 00:56:52,380
♫  I'll say it tonight  ♫

796
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:57,270
♫  I hope you'll be my miracle  ♫

797
00:57:20,970 --> 00:57:23,370
There you are.

798
00:57:26,350 --> 00:57:28,190
Baek Su Jeong.

799
00:57:28,990 --> 00:57:31,530
I was curious about something.

800
00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:34,360
That's why I came.

801
00:57:36,710 --> 00:57:41,130
When you remembered you kissed me,

802
00:57:41,930 --> 00:57:44,880
why did you run all the way here?

803
00:57:45,980 --> 00:57:49,020
You knew it was a crazy thing to do.

804
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:52,840
If you came looking like that, the things you hid...

805
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:56,390
the secrets you've worked hard to keep

806
00:57:56,390 --> 00:58:00,240
could've been revealed. You knew that.

807
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:02,620
So, why did you come?

808
00:58:06,670 --> 00:58:09,450
Just because you like me?

809
00:58:09,450 --> 00:58:11,690
For that one reason?

810
00:58:19,340 --> 00:58:21,430
Would you be okay?

811
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:25,920
Our relationship could get exposed anytime

812
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:28,840
and it could be problematic for your dream of

813
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:31,000
becoming Yongsung's successor.

814
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:34,560
I...

815
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:39,890
think I'd be okay...

816
00:58:39,890 --> 00:58:42,460
as long as I have you.

817
00:58:43,650 --> 00:58:46,440
As long as you like me.

818
00:58:57,770 --> 00:58:59,810
All right.

819
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:03,560
If so,

820
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:10,350
I'll become your biggest secret.

821
00:59:11,170 --> 00:59:14,400
You said everything you like is a secret.

822
00:59:16,390 --> 00:59:19,830
That means I like you, too.

823
00:59:53,950 --> 01:00:05,480


824
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:42,710
   

825
01:01:42,710 --> 01:01:46,130
   

826
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:48,110
♫  Yeah, yeah  ♫

827
01:01:48,110 --> 01:01:49,490
   

828
01:01:55,020 --> 01:01:58,060
♫  To be honest, I don't know, oh, no  ♫

829
01:01:58,060 --> 01:02:00,300
♫  I think I'm losing my mind  ♫

830
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:01,580
♫  Oh, my gosh  ♫

831
01:02:01,580 --> 01:02:02,850
♫  Like this  ♫

832
01:02:02,850 --> 01:02:05,270
♫  What to do? I don't know  ♫

833
01:02:05,270 --> 01:02:10,400
♫  Keep falling to love, oh, tonight  ♫

834
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:13,910
♫  Shine a light on my heart  ♫

835
01:02:13,910 --> 01:02:16,660
 You know we have to be more careful at work, right? 

836
01:02:16,660 --> 01:02:19,040
 We'll never get caught. Don't worry. 

837
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:21,430
 They say office romance is like hell. 

838
01:02:21,430 --> 01:02:22,560
 Hell at work. 

839
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:23,830
 Approve it now. 

840
01:02:23,830 --> 01:02:26,770
 You're too good at improvising. 

841
01:02:26,770 --> 01:02:28,780
 How can I make you feel better? 

842
01:02:28,780 --> 01:02:30,570
 Are you really dating? 

843
01:02:30,570 --> 01:02:33,230
 Don't try to know too much. You'll get hurt. 

844
01:02:33,230 --> 01:02:37,500
 Ju Yeon finally looks truly happy. 

845
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:40,630
 What if they find out who the other person is? 

846
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:44,250
♫  I haven't forgotten you even for a moment  ♫

847
01:02:44,250 --> 01:02:47,070
♫  The one who'd save me from darkness  ♫

848
01:02:47,070 --> 01:02:48,730
♫  Only you  ♫

849
01:02:48,730 --> 01:02:50,680
♫  Keep falling to love  ♫
