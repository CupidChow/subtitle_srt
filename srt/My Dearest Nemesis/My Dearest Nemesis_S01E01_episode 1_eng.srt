1
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:14,340


2
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:17,730
   

3
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,430
   

4
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,140
   

5
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:25,920
   

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,660
   

7
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,030
   

8
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,750
   

9
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:49,100
   

10
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,980
   

11
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,000
   

12
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:03,700
Hey, Baek Su Jeong is studying again.

13
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,250
So annoying.

14
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,740
She's already been accepted into a college. What's with her?

15
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,860
The teacher says no end-day assembly today.

16
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:36,860
Was that too much?

17
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,400
What if she says something?

18
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,860
What will she do?

19
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:41,570
She has no money or connections.

20
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:43,770
She has no mom either.

21
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,560
You have a mom and money.

22
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,360
I wonder what went wrong with you?

23
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,960
Hey! Are you crazy?

24
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,130
Don't mess with me. You can't beat me.

25
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:55,530
You little—

26
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:57,940
I said you can't beat me.

27
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:04,060
Weren't there expensive tutors' notes in there?

28
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,800
Don't you need to pick them up?

29
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,130
They'll get soaked.

30
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:46,750
 Su Jeong! 

31
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:57,830
 Deok Gu! 

32
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,040
♫  Stay  ♫

33
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:27,170
♫  Until my tears dry, stay  ♫

34
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:33,250
♫  Until I don't recognize myself, stay  ♫

35
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:37,140
♫  Wait just a moment  ♫

36
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:43,240
♫  Stay  ♫

37
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,860
   

38
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:48,590
♫  Stay  ♫

39
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:54,500
♫  Until I let you go, stay  ♫

40
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:59,310
♫  Even in my memories  ♫

41
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:03,780
 I was strong even without 

42
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:06,570
 a proper umbrella then, 

43
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:09,490
 but I think I wanted to believe 

44
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:12,470
 that someone I can rely on... 

45
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:15,790
 and someone 

46
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:18,950
 who'd walk through this rain with me... 

47
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:23,450
 might exist somewhere in this world. 

48
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,650
 For example, 

49
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:31,790
 a first love, perhaps. 

50
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:34,060
♫  It'd be so terrible  ♫

51
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:39,180
♫  Stay, my dear  ♫

52
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:44,140
♫  Stay, my dear  ♫

53
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,530
 Go, go, go, go! 

54
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:48,920
   

55
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,770
Wow.

56
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:55,570
Pile it up.

57
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:58,230
Baek Su Bin, are you behind in lunch payment?

58
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:00,030
Your homeroom teacher called.

59
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:01,420
Right, I forgot.

60
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,260
How could you forget that?

61
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,600
I wired the money. Go tell your teacher.

62
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,800
Okay.

63
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,770
Aren't you embarrassed?

64
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:12,180
I said tell me stuff like that because Dad's busy.

65
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,590
Give me allowance then.

66
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:15,650
Dad forgot to give me money for supplies.

67
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:18,020
Why would you tell me that now?

68
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:23,060
Use this for now.

69
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,130
You should really clean up after yourself.

70
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:27,890
Stop playing video games so much.

71
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:29,360
Okay? Won't you answer me?

72
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,550
Gosh, okay, okay, okay.

73
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,660
   

74
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,250
Hold on. Seriously.

75
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,890
Two?

76
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:57,250
How am I supposed to defeat two?

77
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,780
 No! 

78
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:05,860
Why won't you die?

79
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:09,190
Seriously, die!

80
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,540
Seriously!

81
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,440
Die!

82
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,780
- Die! 
 - You die. You die.

83
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,610
Are you crazy? You stayed up all night playing a video game?

84
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:21,390
Can you afford the electricity bill?

85
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:23,500
- Stop, stop, stop. 
 - Come out.

86
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,350
- Stop. 
 - Dad!

87
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:27,590
Will you let him stay up playing a video game?

88
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:30,320
Kick him out or disown him!

89
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,910
Su Jeong, let go of him.

90
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:33,280
Come out.

91
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,840
- Stop. 
 - My hair. My hair.

92
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:38,100
- Come here. 
 - You're pulling out my hair.

93
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:42,230
Dad.

94
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:50,550
You pulled it out.

95
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:53,480
Will you be responsible if I go bald?

96
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,720
Huh?

97
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,580
I have to start over.

98
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:59,320
I need to reach the top level.

99
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,670
Seriously. What's the point of doing that?

100
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:03,600
Will they give you rice or something?

101
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,150
A student should study.

102
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:07,310
Everyone else reached the level.

103
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:09,430
They look down on me for being low-level.

104
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,430
They look down on me.

105
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,290
They look down on you?

106
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,360
They look down on you, Baek Su Bin?

107
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,200
Come on. Come on.

108
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:22,290
Huh?

109
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:24,750
Move.

110
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:28,790
How dare they look down on you?

111
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:32,270
They'll never look down on you again.

112
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,150
What? Did you stay up all night?

113
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:57,100
Geez, why did you choose to be a healer?

114
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,020
I can't even kill a dragon.

115
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,460
Don't you have any strategy?

116
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,830
Don't play alone. Form a party, I said.

117
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:05,450
There's no one strong enough for it.

118
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:06,980
You just wait.

119
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:10,090
I'll make you reach the top level in three days.

120
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,640
   

121
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,310
There's so much to do.

122
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:43,330
   

123
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:47,430
   

124
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:56,980
   

125
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,160
   

126
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:37,130
   

127
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:38,760
Huh?

128
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,120
Huh?

129
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:49,760
Excuse me, what are you doing in my spot?

130
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:51,880
Are you talking to me?

131
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,200
Who else is here right now?

132
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,700
This is my spot.

133
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:59,370
How silly. You claim this property?

134
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:01,480
You can't be a shareholder of this game.

135
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,910
Don't you have any business ethics?

136
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,760
Get out of the way now.

137
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,390
What if I don't want to?

138
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:10,120
Don't you have any manners?

139
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,050
How old are you to talk down to me?

140
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:15,410
Shouldn't you reveal first if you're curious?

141
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:17,160
I'm 19.

142
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,560
You're in elementary, right?

143
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,070
Since you don't understand—

144
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,730
I'm 22.

145
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:24,490
I'm 22. Happy now?

146
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:25,730
I don't believe you.

147
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:28,350
What's your resident registration number? Let's meet up in real life.

148
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:35,260
How pathetic.

149
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:38,920
Move, low-level. I'm busy.

150
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:08,010
Geez.

151
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:10,650
I can't do any damage.

152
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:26,140
   

153
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:36,150
   

154
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:53,700
   

155
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,940
Must I go back?

156
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:08,800
A healer doesn't even need the potion.

157
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,440
   

158
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:18,500
   

159
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,420
   

160
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,080
   

161
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:38,000
   

162
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,300
   

163
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,280
   

164
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,530
   

165
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,020
   

166
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:41,940
   

167
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:44,860
   

168
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:49,180
   

169
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,970
You're stronger than I thought.

170
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:55,280
You control well, too.

171
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,770
You, too.

172
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:58,250
You aren't too bad.

173
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:59,390
Although you're rude.

174
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:02,370
I'll try not to be rude from now on.

175
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:04,810
You...

176
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:07,880
should be my partner.

177
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:11,010
   

178
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:12,910
   

179
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,760
   

180
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,440
   

181
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,970
   

182
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:21,550
  .] 

183
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,400
   

184
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,630
   

185
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,070
   

186
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:28,280
   

187
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,530
   

188
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:33,750
   

189
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,920
   

190
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,830
Hey, over here.

191
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:39,450
   

192
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:41,810
   

193
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:43,700
   

194
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:48,290
   

195
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,140
   

196
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,810
   

197
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,670
   

198
00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:01,200
   

199
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:09,350
Black Dragon.

200
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,840
These are the team members.

201
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,300
And this is the healer I mentioned.

202
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,540
Hello.

203
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,490
Welcome to our team.

204
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:19,830
Team Fatal Attack's goal is...

205
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,250
To win.

206
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,120
To win.

207
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:30,120
 Let's win! 

208
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,600
 Well done! 

209
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,510
This is what it's like to win.

210
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:40,790
   

211
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:42,380
Congratulations on reaching the top level,

212
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:45,680
Black Dragon and Mangwon-dong Pimp.

213
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,380
What was that? 
    

214
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,940
Noona, it's Prince, not Pimp.

215
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,820
What are you saying?

216
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:54,400
Gosh, sorry, sorry. It was a typo.

217
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,960
Anyway, congratulations, Prince.

218
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,730
You and Black Dragon worked so well together.

219
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:00,480
It's such a shame.

220
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,350
They would've married if Prince was a woman.

221
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:04,400
Don't you agree?

222
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,790
I'm a woman.

223
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:08,130
Please stop calling me Prince.

224
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:09,660
A woman?

225
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,320
Gosh. I thought you were a man

226
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,040
because of your avatar and ID.

227
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,990
My brother came up with the ID.

228
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:17,380
He's kind of childish.

229
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,660
My goodness.

230
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,970
It was a princess, not a prince.

231
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:23,380
Gosh, I'm so happy.

232
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,610
Should I call you princess?

233
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:27,660
No, I hate that even more.

234
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:31,010
Just call me Strawberry. That's my original ID.

235
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:33,690
Strawberry? How cute.

236
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:35,630
Is this for the better?

237
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:38,170
You can't get married in the game,

238
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:39,530
but in real life...

239
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:42,580
Lovey-dovey. Lovey-dovey.

240
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,690
Come on.

241
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:04,120
Did you see that?

242
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:12,450
I won.

243
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:14,620
Not too bad.

244
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:23,980
I can't even tell where the stone went.

245
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:26,560
It fell right in front of you.

246
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,480
In the team battle,

247
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,410
it was so thrilling when

248
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:55,740
you put your skill into action on time.

249
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:59,510
Our team play skills finally shined.

250
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:03,870
But why are you playing under your brother's name?

251
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:05,950
He used to play this game,

252
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:08,000
but I started to help him reach the top level.

253
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,380
So he won't be looked down on by his friends.

254
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:14,780
You must be close to your brother.

255
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,260
Not at all.

256
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,710
He's just...

257
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:21,170
kind of immature.

258
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:22,990
Our mom passed away...

259
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:25,050
and our dad is busy.

260
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:28,220
I should care for him since I'm his sister.

261
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,540
How about you?

262
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:37,370
Huh?

263
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:39,570
Who cares for you?

264
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:41,620
Your mom passed away,

265
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,810
your dad is busy,

266
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:45,880
and your brother is immature.

267
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,810
I...

268
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:55,700
I'm okay.

269
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,650
I can do anything on my own.

270
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,700
I can tell.

271
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,580
But I'll care for you here.

272
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:09,690
Doing everything on your own...

273
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:12,630
is tiring and lonely even if you're good at it.

274
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:19,350
You don't have to be alone here.

275
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,510
I feel so supported.

276
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,920
Is it because you're older?

277
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:30,750
I've always wanted an older brother, not younger.

278
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,930
I thought I could rely on him then.

279
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:37,730
Rely on me, then.

280
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,270
Okay.

281
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,030
Do you have any siblings, Oppa?

282
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:48,820
I'm an only child.

283
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,310
Oh, really?

284
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:55,360
Is that why you know it's lonely to be alone?

285
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,950
Well,

286
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:58,830
you can say that.

287
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:02,260
To be honest, I have no parents.

288
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,840
If so,

289
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,210
let's do this.

290
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:17,600
I'll rely on you and...

291
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,230
you'll rely on me.

292
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:25,790
So we don't feel lonely.

293
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:27,550
What do you say?

294
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,570
So we don't...

295
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:35,050
feel lonely.

296
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:36,990
Yes.

297
00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:59,730
 What time will we hunt tomorrow? 

298
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:00,830
 You're coming, right? 

299
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:03,460
 Of course. What time should we meet? 

300
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:05,210
 8:00? 

301
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:06,890
 Sounds good. 

302
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:12,080
 Let's meet then every day from now on. 

303
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:19,980
   

304
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:23,160
   

305
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,870
 Should we meet early tomorrow 

306
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:26,070
 since it's the weekend? 

307
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:27,360
 Around noon? 

308
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,200
 I have a piano lesson in the afternoon. 

309
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,740
 I'm free after five. 

310
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:33,680
 Geez, amazing. You take a piano lesson? 

311
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,410
 I've always wanted to learn, too. 

312
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:38,900
 You can learn from me later. 

313
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,360
 I saw strawberry milk... 

314
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,510
 and thought of you, so I got one. 

315
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,460
 You said you like chocolate milk. 

316
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:47,810
 Strawberry milk is tasty, too. It's sweet. 

317
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:49,260
 What kind of person do you want to 

318
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:52,770
 seek an answer to life's hardest question, love? 

319
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:54,480
 Definitely someone older. 

320
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,880
 Someone like you? 

321
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,000
 Just kidding. 

322
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,080
 How about you? 

323
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,090
 Someone who understands me. 

324
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:03,680
 Should we add each other as friends? 

325
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:07,280
 Are you a Nell fan, too, Oppa? 

326
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,680
 Whoa, you, too? 

327
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:13,860
 2009. 

328
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:17,510
 Happy New Year, Black Dragon! 

329
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:18,760
 Thank you. 

330
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,420
 Happy New Year to you, too. 

331
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:23,660
 You heard about the team gathering, right? 

332
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:27,540
 Are we finally seeing each other? 

333
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:29,750
 I want to see you, Strawberry. 

334
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,070
 Me, too. 

335
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:34,000
 I want to see you, too. 

336
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:04,070
Hello.

337
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:05,940
You must be Strawberry.

338
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:09,120
Are you the Ultimate Pro?

339
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,280
Yes.

340
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:13,290
What? You are a total cutie, Strawberry.

341
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:15,690
You're really pretty, Unni.

342
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:17,610
You're so feminine.

343
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:19,970
You're cute.

344
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:29,300
♫  I want to be your bed just for a day  ♫

345
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,860
♫  Oh, babe  ♫

346
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:34,150
♫  Even more warmly  ♫

347
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:35,820
 Strawberry. 

348
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:40,480
♫ I want to embrace you and put you to sleep ♫

349
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,560
♫  Even a tiny movement  ♫

350
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:50,110
♫  Even your quiet whisper  ♫

351
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:51,390
Wassup?

352
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:53,740
So very nice to meet you.

353
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:55,670
Black Dragon?

354
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:58,800
No, this is Rising God of Money. Money god.

355
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,140
Oh.

356
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,410
I see.

357
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:04,340
Hello.

358
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:07,460
You look like my homeroom teacher.

359
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:10,280
- Really? 
 - Are you Strawberry?

360
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:17,310
No, this is Bean-eating Bean Bug.

361
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:19,820
When is Black Dragon coming?

362
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,510
We're meeting him for the first time, too.

363
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:22,970
Oh, really?

364
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:26,320
He never came to a team gathering.

365
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,620
He's probably coming because of you today.

366
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,950
♫  I want to be Strawberry's bed...  ♫

367
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:34,390
It's not like that.

368
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:36,480
- Not yet. 
 - Huh?

369
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,370
You and Black Dragon would make a great couple.

370
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:41,140
He's apparently a total hunk.

371
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,460
Who said that?

372
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:44,420
He did.

373
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:48,680
I should call him and ask where he is.

374
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,560
♫  Stay  ♫

375
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:21,890
♫  I own my memories, stay  ♫

376
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:27,850
♫  Until I let you go, stay  ♫

377
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:33,850
♫  Even in my memories  ♫

378
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,820
Yo, buongiorno.

379
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:44,910
Nice to meet you all.

380
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,920
I'm...

381
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,010
Black Dragon.

382
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:02,950
And you?

383
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:06,120
Black Dragon?

384
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:11,530
Hi...

385
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:13,430
Strawberry.

386
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:20,380
Black Dragon... He has to be a middle schooler.

387
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,370
An elementary schooler?

388
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:23,120
Anyway, we were all fooled by him.

389
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,310
What should we do?

390
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:26,600
Strawberry, are you okay—

391
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:35,750
Okay. I paid in advance.

392
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:37,220
Have as much as you'd like.

393
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,540
Hey, you have no money—

394
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:43,400
Don't worry about that. Never.

395
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:46,000
If you started college in 2006,

396
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,160
you must've done your military service already.

397
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:54,700
- Of course. 
 - What was your rank?

398
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:59,730
   

399
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:01,480
Sergeant?

400
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:05,390
Sgt. Frog?

401
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:12,180
Why don't we go to a karaoke, then?

402
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:14,470
Karaoke, my foot.

403
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:26,150
♫  What do I do?  ♫

404
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:31,440
♫  What am I supposed to do?  ♫

405
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:34,700
What do we do with him?

406
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:46,030
♫  I love that woman. Wow!  ♫

407
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:51,750
♫  People would point fingers  ♫

408
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:57,200
♫  And I'd lose my mind, too  ♫

409
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,910
♫  I know all that  ♫

410
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:04,960
♫  And I'm afraid of it  ♫

411
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:10,600
♫  But I love you  ♫

412
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:15,930
♫  Where are you?  ♫

413
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:22,850
♫  Can you really hear me?  ♫

414
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:30,480
♫  My bleeding tragic love  ♫

415
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:35,480
♫  Are you aware?  ♫

416
00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:05,140
♫  Please grant it to me  ♫

417
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:19,590
I-It's because I left the military recently.

418
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:21,340
I put it on, so I don't look bad.

419
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:22,510
Shut up.

420
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,530
You're a middle schooler, aren't you?

421
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:26,840
No, Strawberry.

422
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,870
I'll... I'll explain everything—

423
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:30,600
Shut up, I said!

424
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:35,140
You liar and a scammer who was born yesterday.

425
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:40,550
Strawberry!

426
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,920
Strawberry!

427
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,360
Strawberry, please.

428
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,140
Strawberry!

429
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,410
Hold on.

430
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:52,270
Please hear me out.

431
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,470
Yes, you're right.

432
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:57,620
I'm 15.

433
00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:01,620
- You jerk— 
 - I'm sorry I lied.

434
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,780
I didn't want to be made fun of.

435
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,420
So, I lied on a whim.

436
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:08,680
I couldn't tell you later because you seemed to

437
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,030
want someone older.

438
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:12,720
But why does that matter?

439
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,360
- What? 
 - Name and age.

440
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,420
We had a connection regardless of all that.

441
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:19,000
Hey, it's her.

442
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,080
Isn't that what matters?

443
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,520
 So cool! 

444
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,850
 He's so cool! 

445
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:31,220
We...

446
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,910
were meant to be.

447
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:34,900
My destiny.

448
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,630
Your name is Su Jeong*, too. 
  (Means "crystal") 

449
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:41,330
Dragons like me like shiny jewels, apparently.

450
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:44,200
So, you, Su Jeong entering

451
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:47,950
Black Dragon's heart...

452
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:51,230
must've been destiny.

453
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:53,130
I'm trapped in dark loneliness.

454
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:55,670
The one who can free the Black Dragon

455
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:57,440
is only you.

456
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,920
My love.

457
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:07,790
My destiny.

458
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:09,490
Please...

459
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:11,130
grant me...

460
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:12,760
love...

461
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,390
and freedom.

462
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,520
 Say yes! Say yes! 

463
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:31,820
 Say yes! Say yes! 

464
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:35,360
 Say yes! Say yes! 

465
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,780
 Say yes! Say yes! 

466
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:42,170
 Say yes! Say yes! 

467
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:46,540
 Say yes! Say yes! 

468
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:49,710
Okay.

469
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:53,400
Age doesn't matter.

470
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:58,050
The problem is you, Black Dragon.

471
00:31:58,050 --> 00:31:59,380
Your existence.

472
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:01,610
Your existence itself disgusts me.

473
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:03,980
You're disgusting from head to toe.

474
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:06,210
You look pathetic, you can't hold a tune,

475
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:07,790
and you talk stupid, too.

476
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:09,680
Your video game avatar isn't real.

477
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,900
You're actually this pathetic person.

478
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:14,800
Stop walking around looking like that...

479
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:19,570
and stay sealed forever, you little nerd!

480
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:37,280
My existence itself...

481
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:41,180
My existence itself is the issue.

482
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:53,270
It's time to go to the academy, sir.

483
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,900
Let go.

484
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,460
Let go!

485
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:01,970
How could you do this to me?

486
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:03,650
How...

487
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:07,050
Let go! Let go!

488
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:16,550
Su Bin! Su Bin!

489
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:18,210
What's wrong with her?

490
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:20,120
I don't know. So noisy.

491
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,970
She should be gaming instead.

492
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:25,230
 I guess elephants are herbivores, too. 

493
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:27,050
 Yes. 

494
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:36,960
 My first love, Black Dragon. 

495
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,040
 The darkest phase of my life. 

496
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:42,820
 I realized that day... 

497
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:45,820
 that if you try to lean on someone, 

498
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:48,940
 you can fall even harder. 

499
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:56,490
   

500
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:01,030
 You play life solo, anyway. 

501
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:04,340
 So, instead of a healer, 

502
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:07,020
 I decided to become a killer. 

503
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:10,660
Gosh! Spare me, Su Jeong!

504
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:12,840
L-Let go of me first, okay?

505
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,180
Let go of me first.

506
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:17,110
I can't. You'll leave if I do.

507
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:18,630
I'll be good to you.

508
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:20,790
- I said I'll be good to you! 
 - Stop!

509
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:22,610
Don't do anything! Do nothing!

510
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:24,970
You call every morning and come over every weekend!

511
00:34:24,970 --> 00:34:27,110
Were you possessed by a workaholic ghost?

512
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:30,230
I've never met someone so impossible as you.

513
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:33,170
I didn't want to say this, but...

514
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:36,160
you gave me hemorrhoids and I can't walk.

515
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:39,510
I'm quitting because of you. Don't you know?

516
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:41,500
Is that all?

517
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,570
What? Hemorrhoids?

518
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:45,980
Is that the only reason you're quitting?

519
00:34:48,970 --> 00:34:51,130
This is why I'm going crazy.

520
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:54,210
I always end up with bosses like you.

521
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:58,100
- Don't go! 
 - Gosh, please stop.

522
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:00,560
I'll easily become

523
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,100
the president of Yongsung Construction.

524
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,280
Mr. Kim,

525
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:07,280
did you look into the chairwoman's grandson?

526
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,730
Yes.

527
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:10,230
His name is Ban Ju Yeon.

528
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:12,190
He's a Harvard Economics Department graduate

529
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:14,330
and he finished his master's degree. An elite.

530
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:16,590
There's no information beyond that.

531
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:17,830
That's it?

532
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:20,620
 He's thorough and he's suspicious. 

533
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:23,140
 He doesn't seem to keep people around him. 

534
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:24,400
 He hasn't made a public appearance 

535
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,030
 since graduating middle school. 

536
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:27,700
People don't even know what he looks like.

537
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,920
So, you don't know what he's doing where either?

538
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,080
According to my research,

539
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,160
he seems to be gathering information on projects

540
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,760
and directors under a fake identity.

541
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,940
 He's influential in appointments, too. 

542
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:39,430
How about...

543
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:43,840
the dismissal of the Yongsung Motors president?

544
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,950
He's very powerful.

545
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:52,220
Is it because he's the chairwoman's only grandson?

546
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:54,160
Grandson.

547
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,900
He's more like her dog.

548
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,300
The chairwoman's dog.

549
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:58,710
He says everything

550
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:00,670
the chairwoman says to become the successor.

551
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:03,250
It sounds like he's not a dog,

552
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:05,850
but a fierce wolf.

553
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:07,470
Anyway, good work.

554
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:09,150
You can leave.

555
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:32,000
You're three minutes and 15 seconds late,

556
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,070
Chief Kwon.

557
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:35,520
My apologies.

558
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,750
There was rush hour traffic.

559
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:39,360
What are you doing right now?

560
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,780
Who are you?

561
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:42,990
A whistleblower reported bribery.

562
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:44,470
Come with us to the Audit Department.

563
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:47,660
What? Whistleblower?

564
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:50,970
- Hey, Mr. Kim— 
 - Don't try to blame me.

565
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:53,330
There's plenty of evidence.

566
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,300
Let go. Let go. Let go.

567
00:36:56,980 --> 00:37:00,630
Hey, you think you can survive after this?

568
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:03,030
This is how I meet the lazy ones.

569
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:04,180
What did you say?

570
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,680
Mr. Kim, do you want to die?

571
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,990
I'm not Secretary Kim.

572
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:09,980
Ban Ju Yeon.

573
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,900
That's me.

574
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:17,970
Have a nice trip to hell.

575
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,570
Hey! Hold on. Hold on.

576
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:22,070
W-W-What?

577
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:24,540
Hey! Come here!

578
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:30,800
   

579
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,830
- Seriously! 
 - I'm sorry.

580
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:45,920
That's so scary.

581
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,250
Do you want to know what's really scary?

582
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:50,360
- What? 
 - Our team leader.

583
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,930
I don't think she's going home tonight either.

584
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:54,660
I guess not.

585
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:55,760
   

586
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,320
It's because she can't.

587
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,250
The director suddenly quit.

588
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:01,350
That's why she's been working late.

589
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:03,660
Although she basically kicked him out.

590
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:05,780
For the third time, even.

591
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:07,550
By the way,

592
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:10,140
how can a team leader get directors fired?

593
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:13,440
A team leader is below a director.

594
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:17,100
You don't know because you're an intern.

595
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,160
Let me explain.

596
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,910
 Baby, pour me a drink. 

597
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:27,300
 Alcohol has to be poured by a woman. 

598
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:30,030
 Gosh, Director. 

599
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:33,240
 Your arm should be twisted by a woman, too. 

600
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,110
 Hey, hey, hey! 

601
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:35,500
 You're seeing the ethics committee. 

602
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,460
 Hey, hey, hey! 

603
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:38,800
 It hurts! It hurts! 

604
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,560
 Come on, let's go. 

605
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:44,240
 There's no smoking in the building. 

606
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,890
 I want to smoke. No one can say anything. 

607
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:50,450
 Did Team Leader Baek teach you like that? 

608
00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:53,240
 By the way, where's she now? 

609
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:01,780
 Gosh, I thought there was a fire. 

610
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:04,570
 Someone must've been smoking. How absurd. 

611
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:06,660
 Hey, what's this... 

612
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:08,630
 What do you think you're doing? 

613
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:10,060
He was smoking and...

614
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:12,870
she started spraying on the director like this.

615
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:14,240
Right in front of him.

616
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,710
Wow, that's impressive. How amazing.

617
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:17,650
That's why her nickname is "Director Killer."

618
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:18,940
Director Killer?

619
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:23,080
I hope the new director is someone good.

620
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,320
I know.

621
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,420
Can the fourth director...

622
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:29,080
survive from this killer?

623
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,260
That's what's important.

624
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:31,750
That's important.

625
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:32,910
Are you curious?

626
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:35,220
Pay me 500 won if you are.

627
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:40,880
Go home if you have time to talk nonsense.

628
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,730
When are you going home, Team Leader?

629
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:46,540
I'll go home early today.

630
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:49,940
I'll finish the report for the director first.

631
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:54,670
 Executive Director Choi won't just let it happen. 

632
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:57,690
Tell him to try his best.

633
00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:01,370
So, what's the chairwoman's next order?

634
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:04,600
You'll be going to the department store, Director.

635
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,020
- Director? 
 - Yes.

636
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:09,170
You aren't an intern, newbie, deputy, or secretary.

637
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:10,950
You're a director.

638
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,710
Congratulations on the promotion,

639
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:16,360
Director Ban Ju Yeon.

640
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,310
Looks like I can finally use my name.

641
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:21,290
It's thanks to all your hard work.

642
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:22,890
Here's the paperwork on

643
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:24,630
the Yongsung Department Store's strategy team.

644
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:25,750
What's my duty?

645
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:27,000
Double the sales.

646
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,090
They've been stalling. You'll be improving both

647
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:31,190
the sales and profit.

648
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:33,430
Nice and simple.

649
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:41,820
   

650
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:46,310
   

651
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,320
Oh, also,

652
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,670
since you'll be in an important position,

653
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:56,200
you've been told to follow the rules more strictly.

654
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,410
By the chairwoman.

655
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:07,760
 One. Always look perfect in public. 

656
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:12,250
 Two. Don't do things to harm your reputation. 

657
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:15,590
 Three. Give up on a personal life that could 

658
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:19,040
 damage your image as an ideal businessman. 

659
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:49,750
 If you can't give it up, 

660
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:51,550
 hide it. 

661
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:57,620
♫  Don't you know just who we are?  ♫

662
00:41:57,620 --> 00:42:00,830

675
00:42:51,810 --> 00:42:53,650
   

676
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,910
 Is something going on with the chairwoman? 

677
00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:08,380
She can't even be on the phone?

678
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:09,570
 It's not that. 

679
00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:11,570
 She said it was an emergency. 

680
00:43:11,570 --> 00:43:12,820
Emergency?

681
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:15,500
 You'll find out when you get there. 

682
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:27,410
 I can turn left and drop you off, right? 

683
00:43:27,410 --> 00:43:29,320
Yes.

684
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:32,580
By the way, aren't you getting a new car?

685
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:33,950
Looks like you've had this a long time.

686
00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:35,910
It still works fine.

687
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:38,490
But still. You should think of your position.

688
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:39,970
I do.

689
00:43:39,970 --> 00:43:42,690
This suits my position.

690
00:43:42,690 --> 00:43:44,760
I see.

691
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:52,530
   

692
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:07,640
What?

693
00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:13,290
Geez, you're kidding me.

694
00:44:14,050 --> 00:44:15,750
 - Are you okay? 
 - Yes, I'm okay. 

695
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:17,200
Stay inside.

696
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,770
Okay.

697
00:44:30,530 --> 00:44:33,250
Geez, I don't have time for this.

698
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:36,880
 Director, the chairwoman is waiting. 

699
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,890
Excuse me.

700
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:44,100
 Since you'll be in an important position, 

701
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:47,630
 you've been told to follow the rules more strictly. 

702
00:44:47,630 --> 00:44:49,780
 By the chairwoman. 

703
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:52,500
   

704
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:54,200
   

705
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:56,110
   

706
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:00,790
Won't you get off?

707
00:45:02,050 --> 00:45:04,130
Excuse me.

708
00:45:37,090 --> 00:45:39,090
I'm in a hurry right now.

709
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:42,460
Contact my lawyer.

710
00:45:51,370 --> 00:45:53,760
Where do you think you're going?

711
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:23,340
What was that?

712
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:25,190
You caused an accident. You should

713
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:27,480
apologize and ask me if I'm okay.

714
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:29,920
Don't you have any manners?

715
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,710
You're so young, but driving a car like this.

716
00:46:32,710 --> 00:46:34,830
You're car-poor, huh?

717
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:36,760
What poor?

718
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,480
Car-poor.

719
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:41,050
I know you're running away because you're poor.

720
00:46:41,050 --> 00:46:43,110
Let's call the police first.

721
00:46:43,110 --> 00:46:44,800
- Excuse me. 
 - What?

722
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,080
Are you scared that I'm calling the police?

723
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:49,300
Do I really need to ask if you're okay when you're standing here yelling at me?

724
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:50,400
You're obviously fine.

725
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,520
Let's not make a fuss over nothing.

726
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:54,800
Looks like a junk car, but I'll pay for the repair.

727
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,650
Call my lawyer.

728
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:00,470
Why call a lawyer if it's nothing?

729
00:47:00,470 --> 00:47:02,160
Let's settle this right now.

730
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:04,760
Move. I'm really in a hurry.

731
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:10,000
Jun Su!

732
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,860
- Yes. 
 - You have a driver's license, right?

733
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:13,700
Just drive home.

734
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:15,480
Pardon?

735
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:17,430
Are you crazy?

736
00:47:18,890 --> 00:47:21,240
How am I supposed to trust you?

737
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:24,570
Aren't you leaving? You were in a hurry.

738
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,120
Will you keep following me?

739
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:44,130
You should've said you were visiting

740
00:47:44,130 --> 00:47:45,160
someone at a hospital.

741
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:47,680
I think I told you I was in a hurry.

742
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:50,910
Why did you crash my car, then?

743
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:53,780
By the way,

744
00:47:55,110 --> 00:47:57,950
haven't we met somewhere?

745
00:47:57,950 --> 00:47:59,420
Pardon?

746
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:09,190
You're making a move on me right now?

747
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:11,540
Are you crazy?

748
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:15,050
Has this always worked? Huh?

749
00:48:26,450 --> 00:48:29,600
Excuse me! Excuse me! Hey!

750
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:34,630
What?

751
00:48:34,630 --> 00:48:36,940
Where did that jerk go?

752
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:38,690
Geez.

753
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:47,930
You're late.

754
00:48:48,910 --> 00:48:51,890
- I'm sorry. 
 - When my son died,

755
00:48:51,890 --> 00:48:53,280
he had just become

756
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:56,920
the director of the department store, too.

757
00:48:57,590 --> 00:48:59,540
Do you understand?

758
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:04,190
I gave you a good opportunity.

759
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:07,370
This can finally prove...

760
00:49:07,370 --> 00:49:11,560
if you can replace my son.

761
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:17,440
I'll prove to you that I'm qualified to...

762
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:20,960
become Yongsung's successor.

763
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:23,640
Yes. Prove it.

764
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:25,270
Don't make any mistakes.

765
00:49:25,270 --> 00:49:31,080
I won't forgive even a small mistake.

766
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:43,450
Chairwoman.

767
00:49:43,450 --> 00:49:45,130
I can't believe you came this far.

768
00:49:45,130 --> 00:49:48,860
He was my employee. Of course, I had to come.

769
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:50,950
Chairwoman.

770
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:58,130
Gosh.

771
00:49:58,130 --> 00:49:59,830
My goodness.

772
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:02,450
Your son is still young, too.

773
00:50:02,450 --> 00:50:04,430
It's okay.

774
00:50:04,430 --> 00:50:06,630
We should overcome this.

775
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:09,140
 Ban Ju Yeon, 

776
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:10,470
 stop crying. 

777
00:50:10,470 --> 00:50:12,990
 You don't even have the right to cry. 

778
00:50:12,990 --> 00:50:15,020
 You... 

779
00:50:15,830 --> 00:50:18,410
 killed my son. 

780
00:51:26,270 --> 00:51:31,120
♫  Don't you know just who we are?  ♫

781
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:34,330
♫  Never seen us rocking sitting around?  ♫

782

793
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:17,170
Crazy jerk. Psycho.

794
00:52:17,170 --> 00:52:18,600
Hit-and-run scammer.

795
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:20,330
You said you ripped his business card.

796
00:52:20,330 --> 00:52:22,410
I didn't know he'd just leave like that.

797
00:52:22,410 --> 00:52:25,360
It's a shame. He made a move on you, too.

798
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:27,800
How could he do that in that situation?

799
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:30,770
Seriously. He does have a good taste.

800
00:52:30,770 --> 00:52:32,540
He must've thought it was meant to be.

801
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:34,170
You should've let it happen.

802
00:52:34,170 --> 00:52:35,610
With that crazy scammer?

803
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:39,120
Unni, he's really out of his mind.

804
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:40,540
He was wearing sunglasses at night.

805
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:44,060
I hate his style, too. He was like Black—

806
00:52:50,190 --> 00:52:53,530
Here. Eat this and feel better.

807
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:58,660
Amazing. This is impressive, Unni.

808
00:52:59,430 --> 00:53:01,440
Can you just feed me like this?

809
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:02,900
You have no customers either.

810
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:04,650
 That's why I'm giving it away. 

811
00:53:04,650 --> 00:53:06,210
 The fish is about to go bad. 

812
00:53:06,210 --> 00:53:08,630
You opened two months ago. You'll be okay, right?

813
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:10,750
Just worry about yourself, Director Killer.

814
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:12,540
How many days have you been working late?

815
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:14,000
Today is the last day.

816
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,510
A new director is coming tomorrow.

817
00:53:15,510 --> 00:53:17,330
A new director?

818
00:53:17,930 --> 00:53:21,070
I swear I'll treat the new one well.

819
00:53:21,070 --> 00:53:23,990
I'll let him bury his bones in the office.

820
00:53:23,990 --> 00:53:27,460
Yes, I can tell you mean it.

821
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:32,540
   

822
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:37,070
Finally, a proper first day at work.

823
00:53:37,070 --> 00:53:38,820
Will you go straight to the director's office?

824
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:41,770
No, let's look around for now.

825
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:44,330
You left just like that last night.

826
00:53:44,330 --> 00:53:46,740
Do you know how shocked I was?

827
00:53:47,970 --> 00:53:49,060
Are you okay?

828
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:52,740
I'm not okay. I'm a bit annoyed.

829
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:54,700
You brought the car back safely, right?

830
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:57,780
Yes. I think it has a scratch on the back.

831
00:53:57,780 --> 00:53:59,330
What?

832
00:53:59,330 --> 00:54:01,540
He said he only brushed it.

833
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:05,360
I should've punched him when he said nonsense. Geez.

834
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,890
Seriously.

835
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:18,840
Loud noises in the public space.

836
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:21,610
Employee training needed.

837
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,460
The menu needs to be diversified.

838
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:35,430
Urgently need more protein.

839
00:54:38,310 --> 00:54:41,860
The new director's coming today, right?

840
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:43,570
The director's office was empty.

841
00:54:43,570 --> 00:54:45,540
I thought he came in.

842
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:47,720
I'm sure he'll see the higher-ups first.

843
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:51,010
Team Leader, you'll get along this time, right?

844
00:54:51,010 --> 00:54:52,410
I wish I could, too.

845
00:54:52,410 --> 00:54:55,860
I'm sick of the nickname "Director Killer," too.

846
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:59,040
I actually used to be a healer.

847
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:02,590
A killer, you mean. A killer.

848
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:05,070
I-I'm so sorry.

849
00:55:05,070 --> 00:55:08,790
By the way, they could just hire a good director.

850
00:55:08,790 --> 00:55:10,510
They need to hire a proper person.

851
00:55:10,510 --> 00:55:12,340
I just couldn't work with them.

852
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:14,910
The company's HR system is at fault.

853
00:55:14,910 --> 00:55:16,540
It's the system's fault.

854
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:18,440
Keep that in mind.

855
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:21,240
Look. There's no meat in the side dishes.

856
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:23,900
How are we supposed to work hard?

857
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:25,490
Openly criticizing the company.

858
00:55:25,490 --> 00:55:27,660
She could discourage the team spirit.

859
00:55:28,290 --> 00:55:30,010
You're working hard from day one.

860
00:55:30,010 --> 00:55:32,590
Tigers run fast, even when hunting for a rabbit.

861
00:55:32,590 --> 00:55:35,880
I need to do my best in a simple task, too.

862
00:55:44,210 --> 00:55:46,070
What's wrong?

863
00:55:46,070 --> 00:55:47,660
It's nothing.

864
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:50,830
I think I saw someone who shouldn't be here.

865
00:55:58,860 --> 00:56:01,430
   

866
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:08,540
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

867
00:56:17,950 --> 00:56:21,220
Happiness comes eventually.

868
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:23,120
   

869
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:25,420
Is it already marigold season?

870
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:28,360
Gosh, what do I do? I can't accept this.

871
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:31,560
The workspace is unruly. Needs to be improved.

872
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:32,660
Ban Ju Yeon?

873
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:34,490
I'm the director of the strategy team

874
00:56:34,490 --> 00:56:36,360
of Yongsung Department Store now.

875
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:39,820
Let's talk, Chief Designer Kim Shin Won.

876
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:42,210
Bbanjju!

877
00:56:42,210 --> 00:56:44,750
I warned you not to call me that.

878
00:56:44,750 --> 00:56:45,810
Especially in public.

879
00:56:45,810 --> 00:56:48,520
Why not? There's no one here.

880
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:52,350
So, you're the director of the department store.

881
00:56:52,350 --> 00:56:56,630
Did the chairwoman decide to make you the successor?

882
00:56:56,630 --> 00:56:57,850
This is only the beginning.

883
00:56:57,850 --> 00:56:59,050
Really?

884
00:56:59,050 --> 00:57:01,500
Hey, I should congratulate you.

885
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:02,710
I'm proud of you, little brother.

886
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:04,030
Why am I your little brother?

887
00:57:04,030 --> 00:57:05,300
We aren't related at all.

888
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:09,380
Why? Because my mom thinks of you as her son.

889
00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:11,760
And I've known you for over 20 years.

890
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:12,980
Can't you just be my brother?

891
00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:14,700
No.

892
00:57:16,210 --> 00:57:19,270
I would've gotten you a gift if I had known.

893
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:20,930
Welcome to Yongsung Department Store.

894
00:57:20,930 --> 00:57:22,330
How dare you regift me stuff?

895
00:57:22,330 --> 00:57:24,760
But my heart is sincere.

896
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:26,930
   

897
00:57:26,930 --> 00:57:29,390
Aren't you sick of seducing women?

898
00:57:29,390 --> 00:57:31,360
I don't seduce them.

899
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:34,310
All I do is exist.

900
00:57:35,930 --> 00:57:38,340
Come on. Don't be like that on your first day.

901
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:40,940
I don't care what you do outside,

902
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:42,050
but don't do this at work.

903
00:57:42,050 --> 00:57:43,960
Hey, there's nothing wrong with dating.

904
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:47,230
What you do isn't dating. It's disorderly conduct.

905
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:50,780
Come on. Do you have to say that?

906
00:57:51,950 --> 00:57:53,530
I need to give you a personal order.

907
00:57:53,530 --> 00:57:54,800
Come to my office before you leave.

908
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:56,020
You're leaving like this?

909
00:57:56,020 --> 00:57:59,750
My perfect shirt is getting ruined. I can't stay.

910
00:58:01,790 --> 00:58:03,920
Geez. Seriously.

911
00:58:04,510 --> 00:58:06,780
He was a little cuter as a kid.

912
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:08,950
I marked the typos.

913
00:58:08,950 --> 00:58:10,900
Fix them and...

914
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:12,570
please double-check, just in case.

915
00:58:12,570 --> 00:58:15,150
- Okay. 
 - Just one moment.

916
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:19,060
Looks like the director is here.

917
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:20,620
What?

918
00:58:22,310 --> 00:58:24,100
Finally.

919
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:25,780
Go say hello to him now.

920
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:28,840
Don't forget you'll be the healer this time.

921
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:34,730
Time to play office politics for once.

922
00:58:36,670 --> 00:58:38,630
I'll be right back.

923
00:58:39,590 --> 00:58:42,010
- Fighting. 
 - Fighting.

924
00:59:12,140 --> 00:59:14,090
Dragon.

925
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:21,130
You...

926
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:26,830
Huh?

927
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:31,550
You...

928
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:47,060


929
00:59:48,210 --> 00:59:50,920
♫  To be honest, I don't know, oh, no  ♫

930
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:52,770
♫  I think I'm losing my mind  ♫

00:59:52,770 --> 00:59:54,620

932
00:59:54,620 --> 00:59:55,980
♫  Like this  ♫

933
00:59:55,980 --> 00:59:58,440
♫  What to do? I don't know  ♫

934
00:59:58,440 --> 00:59:59,980
♫  Something made me cry  ♫

935
00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:02,810
♫  My heart pounds foolishly when I see you  ♫

936
01:00:02,810 --> 01:00:06,100
   

937
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:08,930

945
01:00:33,650 --> 01:00:36,760
 You and I never met outside of work. 

946
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:38,080
 Can you do that? 

947
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:39,270
 I have a bad feeling. 

948
01:00:39,270 --> 01:00:42,420
 He definitely is holding grudges. 

949
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:45,980
 Director, you must like toys. 

950
01:00:45,980 --> 01:00:48,030
 Why would you pay for mine, Ms. Baek? 

951
01:00:48,030 --> 01:00:50,410
 I don't want unnecessary attention. 

952
01:00:50,410 --> 01:00:52,400
 What are you hiding? 

953
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:56,650
 Isn't he living a double life? 

954
01:00:56,650 --> 01:00:58,210
 She's dangerous. 

955
01:00:58,210 --> 01:01:00,540
 She must be eliminated. 

956
01:01:00,540 --> 01:01:04,750
♫  Someone to rescue me, only you  ♫

957
01:01:04,750 --> 01:01:10,700
♫  Keep falling to a version of me  ♫
