I'll do the things you've done alone

189
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:26,030
with you from now on. Whatever it is.

190
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:28,060
Sounds good.

191
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:31,130
I'll be okay as long as I have you.

192
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:33,630
You'll continue to be okay, then.

193
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:36,600
Because I'll stay by your side.

194
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:46,320
How could I not worry?

195
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:49,580
<i>I'm with Su Jeong.</i>

196
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:54,070
Kim Sin Won.

197
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:56,690
Why is it so hard to see you these days?

198
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:58,620
Because I've been with my girlfriend.

199
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,270
You think I don't know that?

200
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:02,740
It's because you come home less these days.

201
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,990
Son.

202
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:07,030
You said you don't do portraits.

203
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,830
But look what you're working on now.

204
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:11,260
I wanted to draw it once.

205
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,170
It'd be a nice gift later, too.

206
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:17,170
Looks like you finally found the right one.

207
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:20,570
I think so, too.

208
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:23,570
Are you thinking of even marrying her?

209
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:25,940
I haven't considered that yet, but...

210
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,840
How should I say it?

211
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,650
I want to always be with her.

212
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:31,890
I don't want to be apart from her.

213
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:35,580
If I got to share a lifetime with her like you two,

214
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:38,060
I'd definitely be happy.

215
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:46,640
I didn't think I'd be seeing you dressed like this.

216
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:50,040
I'm no longer your boss.

217
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,800
Why did you do that?

218
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:57,330
The fact that you upset the Chairwoman.

219
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:59,230
I just don't understand it.

220
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:01,400
Do you know...

221
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,300
when I started to respect and look up to

222
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,400
the Chairwoman?

223
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:12,150
This might sound cruel to you,

224
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:14,360
but it was after she lost her son.

225
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,300
Seeing how strong she was at the time,

226
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:24,100
I thought, "I can trust someone like her."

227
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:30,530
You don't like espresso, right?

228
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:35,200
You go to concerts sometimes.

229
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,530
I didn't check inside the packages

230
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:40,590
you ordered under a strange name.

231
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:42,730
When you knew all that,

232
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,640
why didn't you report it to her?

233
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:49,770
You hid that to become the person she wanted.

234
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:52,980
Hiding emotions and suppressing them

235
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:56,940
couldn't have been easy, but you endured it.

236
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:01,810
That side of you resembled the Chairwoman a lot.

237
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:06,700
And I thought that was the successor she had in mind.

238
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,670
- Then, this time also-
- No.

239
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:14,580
I was just an ordinary person, drawn to affection.

240
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,520
Being a successor is nice,

241
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,420
but I've known you since you were a child.

242
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:25,140
I thought it'd be nice for you to be happy

243
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,160
with someone you love.

244
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:35,990
So, Chief Kwon...

245
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:37,790
that's how you felt.

246
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:41,270
Yes. I did.

247
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:54,830
Thank you for working with me all this time.

248
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,010
What do I do now?

249
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,170
<i>What are you going to do now?</i>

250
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,440
<i>Do you want to read comic books in the attic?</i>

251
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:33,020
<i>I think Su Bin is home.</i>

252
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,810
<i>Okay.</i>

253
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,290
I'm nearing the shop now.

254
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:54,030
Huh? I'm still on my way from grocery shopping.

255
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:55,770
<i>It's okay. I can wait.</i>

256
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:57,250
I took a half day off today.

257
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,150
We really have to see a movie today.

258
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:02,260
We can't suddenly go to a hotel like last time.

259
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:05,510
Didn't you gladly change the destination?

260
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:09,770
Geez. We're on the same page too often.

261
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:11,860
Okay, see you later.

262
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,950
What?

263
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:42,900
What are you doing here at this hour?

264
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:50,380
So, your grandma threw you out

265
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:52,140
and you lost your job.

266
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:54,690
That means you're...

267
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:57,780
jobless. Just like me.

268
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:00,430
Jobless?

269
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:02,750
Well, aren't you?

270
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:05,300
Do you have something to do?

271
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:08,670
I do not.

272
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:11,950
That's why you wanted to wait for Noona at our place.

273
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:13,340
It's not exactly that-

274
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:18,800
By the way, what exactly do you like about her?

275
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,130
She's pretty.

276
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:22,340
Are you crazy by chance?

277
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:24,170
Being crazy in love isn't a sin.

278
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:26,720
Geez, stop.

279
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:31,140
I think I'll puke. Stop talking, please.

280
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:34,850
And she loves me as I am.

281
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:38,430
She cried about breaking up.

282
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:41,850
But you're both totally head over heels. Seriously.

283
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:44,650
Did Su Jeong cry?

284
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:45,980
Yes.

285
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:48,370
Dad and I never saw her bawling like that.

286
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:51,400
It gave me chills... not.

287
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,420
Thinking now, she did that back then, too.

288
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:56,270
Because of Black Dragon or whatever.

289
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:57,380
Black Dragon.

290
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:59,730
There's this guy. He was her first love.

291
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:01,940
Her dark days. If she finds out that I know,

292
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:04,310
she'd bite her tongue and kill herself.

293
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:07,460
Did she cry a lot then, too?

294
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,750
Yes.

295
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,700
She didn't eat for days.

296
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:13,820
Dad was very worried, too. But he couldn't show it.

297
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:16,400
It was the most unfilial thing she did.

298
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,720
Eat.

299
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,150
Okay.

300
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:30,010
[No. 1 Hardware]

301
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:31,700
Father.

302
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,630
Hand me the heavy stuff.

303
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:35,930
What brings you here?

304
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:39,040
I don't know. He suddenly wants to help you.

305
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,590
He must be busy, though.

306
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:42,840
He's not. He's jobless.

307
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,390
I'll do my best to help you.

308
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:48,080
I have no skills, but I have strength.

309
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,870
I don't think you do.

310
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:52,950
You see?

311
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:55,420
Follow me, then.

312
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,930
- Me, too?
- Yes, help him.

313
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:58,190
M-Me?

314
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:01,090
I was going to rest because it's my day off.

315
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:04,850
- Hand me that.
- Okay.

316
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,650
What should I start with?

317
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:11,750
You said you have no skills.

318
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,550
Can you do this stuff?

319
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:15,890
You just need to change the doorknob.

320
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:20,060
Of course. I'll try to take care of it myself.

321
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:22,080
Just let me know if you can't.

322
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,790
Su Jeong does this with her eyes closed.

323
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:27,610
I'm bad at being bad at things.

324
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:35,800
Will he do it with bare hands?

325
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,040
Go help him.

326
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:49,610
How do I do this...

327
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:53,190
You have to glue it if you do it that way.

328
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:56,220
You do it like this. Got it?

329
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:58,420
And you... No.

330
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:00,960
Use this to undo this.

331
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,180
I'll try this myself, then.

332
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:06,810
Be careful. Then...

333
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:08,380
Hold this for me.

334
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,280
- I'll hold it.
- Okay.

335
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,190
Is it expensive?

336
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:15,360
Well, I don't really know.

337
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,670
So...

338
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:19,600
No, no, no.

339
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,640
If you don't know how to do this,

340
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,280
it'd be good if you let me know.

341
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,190
Thank you for teaching me.

342
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,680
- I can do it well.
- Can you?

343
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,390
Okay.

344
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,910
Father, I accomplished this important task.

345
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,110
You do the same, right?

346
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:46,980
- The opposite direction.
- The same way, right?

347
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:01,120
Why won't he respond?

348
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,710
<i>Guess what your boyfriend is doing.</i>

349
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:08,140
What?

350
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,130
There's a lot of concern about

351
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:15,940
the vacant director position.

352
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:20,090
Also, about the successor, besides Director Ban-

353
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:25,580
You think there's no one to replace him?

354
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:29,440
Call Yongsung Trading's

355
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,340
Park Ji Cheol.

356
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,740
Yes.

357
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:35,560
And as for Team Leader Baek Su Jeong-

358
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,610
Get rid of her discreetly.

359
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:39,020
Okay.

360
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,350
You worked hard today.

361
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:54,530
Why don't we have dinner together?

362
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:57,250
Yes, I'll enjoy it.

363
00:26:57,250 --> 00:27:00,230
How do you know if you'll enjoy it?

364
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:03,950
What are we supposed to eat today?

365
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:05,240
Should I cook, then?

366
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:08,110
I'm strong,

367
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:10,150
but I can cook, too.

368
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:13,090
I don't think you can.

369
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:33,240
He was desperate to impress you all day.

370
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,520
That was pretty good, huh?

371
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,000
- Impress me?
- You're his girlfriend's dad.

372
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,920
Right. You don't have to do that.

373
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,020
I'm happy as long as Su Jeong is happy.

374
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,260
Hey, come on.

375
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:47,130
I know you didn't trust him.

376
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:48,330
I didn't?

377
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:51,190
I didn't? That's not true.

378
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:53,450
Of course, you're worried.

379
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:56,740
I don't come from a normal background.

380
00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:00,800
You must trust Su Jeong, but not me.

381
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,720
My situation is like this now,

382
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,580
but I'll make sure you won't worry.

383
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:08,230
No matter what,

384
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:10,990
I won't make her cry or leave her alone.

385
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:16,700
I'm such a bad dad.

386
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:20,000
All I could do was trust her and nothing else.

387
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:23,340
But I'm relieved, thanks to you.

388
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:26,310
I'll make sure you won't have to worry.

389
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:37,170
Su Jeong, welcome.

390
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:38,650
What are you doing?

391
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:40,100
What's with the headwrap?

392
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,790
Welcome, Su Jeong. Let's eat.

393
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:45,280
My son-in-law is a great cook.

394
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:49,950
- Your what?
- I learned how to cook as a child.

395
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:52,770
The galbijjim is amazing, Brother-in-law.

396
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:54,100
Brother-in-law?

397
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:57,900
Su Jeong, I made it because you like that.

398
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:01,550
All right.

399
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:03,700
What's all this?

400
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,300
Okay.

401
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,580
Wow.

402
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:08,880
Say ah.

403
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,630
What?

404
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:19,150
Why is it so good?

405
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:20,930
I know, right?

406
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:22,400
It's by Chef Ban Ju Yeon.

407
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,130
Let's eat.

408
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,730
How nice.

409
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:47,050
Eating and talking together at home like this.

410
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,450
It's my first time since my parents passed away.

411
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:58,970
He must've had a hard time.

412
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:05,630
Sleep over.

413
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:07,020
Pardon?

414
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:09,900
You worked hard today.

415
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,980
Drink with us and sleep over.

416
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,770
We'll have breakfast tomorrow, too.

417
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:16,700
I'll make breakfast.

418
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:19,210
- Would that be okay?
- Of course.

419
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:20,500
Let's share my room.

420
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,180
Your room is messy.

421
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:23,860
An important guest can't sleep there.

422
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:25,880
Sleep with me in the main bedroom.

423
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:28,400
You'll snore up a storm.

424
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,750
He can't sleep. You'll sleep in my room, right?

425
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:32,740
You both want me. This is tricky.

426
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:34,860
I only have one body.

427
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,310
Just sleep in my room.

428
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:39,010
- Are you crazy?
- Are you crazy?

429
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:40,730
What are you thinking?

430
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:43,190
I can sleep in the living room.

431
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,450
Oh, okay.

432
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:36,310
Goodnight.

433

<i>Are you sleeping?</i>

434
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:35,470
<i>Can I see you briefly if you aren't?</i>

435
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,250
What is it?

436
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:56,730
I bought this for you,

437
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:59,300
but I realized I only got one.

438
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,470
Dad or Su Bin

439
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:02,100
would drink it if I put it in the fridge.

440
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,050
I thought you were a filial daughter.

441
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:06,190
You only care about me.

442
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:11,040
Thank you. I was craving something sweet.

443
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,730
Are you okay after drinking?

444
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:14,950
I'm fine.

445
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:19,180
You're the only one who could kill me.

446
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,180
Anyway, what did you do today?

447
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:26,000
I told you to read comic books and rest.

448
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,600
I had tteokbokki with your brother and helped Father.

449
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:32,440
You know what?

450
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:35,210
I'm a man who knows how to change doorknobs.

451
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:38,910
Daebak. You did that?

452
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:42,150
You're a good cook, too. You're good at everything.

453
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:44,280
I know.

454
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,510
I know how to do something.

455
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,980
Good work.

456
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,300
Was everything okay with you?

457
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:57,890
Yes, of course, everything was fine.

458
00:33:57,890 --> 00:33:59,890
That's good to hear.

459
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:01,500
Read comic books since you're here.

460
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:04,010
Should I? Let's read together.

461
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:05,410
I'll recommend you one.

462
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:06,950
Sounds good.

463
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:11,340
This is it.

464
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:16,700
I read it when I feel combative.

465
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:18,980
- Did you get that autograph?
- Yes, right.

466
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:24,000
You can say this is one of my proud achievements.

467
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,230
This is what happened...

468
00:34:31,450 --> 00:34:34,140
Look where I marked it.

469
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:46,500
You don't have to see me off.

470
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,500
I wish I could drive you to work.

471
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:52,570
But the breakfast with family is more important.

472
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,700
Did you sleep comfortably?

473
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:57,300
You should've slept comfortably at home.

474
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,850
Dad and Su Bin took it too far.

475
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:01,150
I felt comfortable.

476
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:02,920
More than I do at home.

477
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:06,860
That's a relief, then.

478
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:10,740
I'm glad you're a loved daughter and sister.

479
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:13,230
I can be loved because of that, too.

480
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:14,940
Like family.

481
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:19,010
Go inside now.

482
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:21,220
You'll be late for breakfast.

483
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:26,210
I'll go.

484
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:30,690
Su Jeong.

485
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:38,660
I made up my mind yesterday.

486
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:43,660
I won't make you cry for the third time.

487
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:54,890
So, get back safely.

488
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:57,940
Don't fall or get hurt.

489
00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:00,320
Don't worry about me, either.

492

What's this, Team Leader?

493
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,260
Why would you...

494
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:48,040
This makes no sense.

495
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,890
They can't do this over a false rumor.

496
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:55,220
The rumor is true.

497
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:56,330
Pardon?

498
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:58,110
You said it wasn't then.

I'm sorry. It wasn't true then.

502
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,320
Okay.

503
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,070
Okay, but still-

504
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:13,310
Yes, it's unjust.

505

506

Why did she send her

grandson's rumored girlfriend here?

511
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:49,270
She probably has no skills.

512
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:50,810
That's why she sent her here.

513
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:54,130
So, she'd do nothing, give up on her own, and leave.

514
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:55,810
Excuse me.

515
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,720
I won't get in your way.

516
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,840
If you have any task that's a hassle for you,

517
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,990
just give it to me.

This isn't something anyone can fix.

525
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:30,870
I have electrician and fire inspection certificates.

526
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:32,500
You don't mind, right?

527
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,210
It worked.

528
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:06,130
What else can I do?

529
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:12,890

What are you doing?

532
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:36,340
I thought you didn't tolerate stuff like this.

533
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:38,790
How about you? Why are you angry?

534
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:40,060
I thought you'd be happy to

535
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:42,710
not see the annoying junior in meetings.

536
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:45,140
The reason I don't like you is because

537
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:47,400
you don't tolerate anything.

538
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,300
I've walked around eggshells and

539
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:52,400
gave up on self-respect to come this far.

540
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,410
But you never tolerate anything.

541
00:39:54,410 --> 00:39:55,670
You say everything you want to say

542
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:58,450

543
00:39:58,450 --> 00:40:00,310
You think you're so superior.

544
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:03,180
I really hated that, but...

545
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:07,130
But seeing you tolerate this-

546
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:08,950
You hate this, too?

547
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:10,550

But to protect someone else,

554
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:26,940
I do have to tolerate some things.

555
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:30,090
I'll get going now.

556
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:06,920

I heard the news.

575
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,400
Of course.

576
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:35,180
Aren't you overdoing it?

577
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:37,880
Does it seem that way?

I should try to look happier.

00:42:49,450 --> 00:42:52,330
I have a favor to ask.

582
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,810
Could you keep this...

583
00:42:54,810 --> 00:42:57,850
a secret from the Director for now?

584
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:01,870
He'd get upset if he found out.

585
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:04,630
He might tell me to just quit.

He's a part-timer.

605
00:44:05,530 --> 00:44:07,920
Hey, why hire one when you have no customers?

606
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,700
That's why I just fired him.

I had no idea.

659
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:41,650
I blamed my precious daughter instead.

It must've hurt.

661
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,850

Why should our daughter be treated...

666
00:47:03,470 --> 00:47:06,450
I didn't tell you because I knew you'd be upset.

667
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:09,920
You think I wasn't upset when I blamed you?

668
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,200

669
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:14,120

672
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:21,550
Putting him in the fridge to make cold sashimi out of him

673
00:47:21,550 --> 00:47:24,470
wouldn't be good enough.

674
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:30,230
If he comes back again,

675
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:33,330
call me first thing. Got it?

676
00:47:33,330 --> 00:47:36,200
- Okay.
- Do you understand?

00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:40,490
Yes, I will.

678
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:42,040
Hey.

679
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:44,200
By the way, that man earlier...

680
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:46,940
that part-timer...

681
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:48,720

682
00:47:51,130 --> 00:47:53,180
Did you have a boyfriend?

683
00:47:56,310 --> 00:47:57,910
Yes.

684
00:47:58,910 --> 00:48:00,520
How old is he?

685
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:03,020
Is he a divorcee? Or just single?

686
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:05,060
Does he want to get married?

687
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:06,280
Gosh, Mom.

688
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:07,910

You're fine now. Let's go.

It doesn't seem Ms. Baek is willing to leave quietly.

693
00:48:26,110 --> 00:48:28,070
Since people notice her here and there,

694
00:48:28,070 --> 00:48:30,870
there are more talks internally.

695
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:34,910
What should I do?

696
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:46,550
Yes.

697
00:48:46,550 --> 00:48:47,810

<i>Did I?</i>

699
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:52,960
Oh, I must've pressed it while changing.

700
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:54,700
Why did you change?

701
00:48:55,910 --> 00:48:58,760
Well, I spilled water on me.

702
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:00,360
Did you have lunch?

703
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:01,720
I haven't yet.

704
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:03,320
<i>Go ahead and eat.</i>

705
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:05,870
You know you have to eat well at times like this.

706
00:49:05,870 --> 00:49:07,500
You don't have much food at home.

707
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:10,190
Should we get groceries after work?

708
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:15,800
Su Jeong,

709
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:17,340
what's wrong?

710
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:20,910
I need to do something. I'll call you back.

711
00:49:40,390 --> 00:49:42,630
You wanted to see me, Chairwoman.

712
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:52,020
Why are you...

713
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:53,930
fighting to stay?

714
00:49:53,930 --> 00:49:56,940
Can't you tell I want you to leave quietly?

715
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:01,450
It's because the Director might come back.

716
00:50:03,690 --> 00:50:05,560
I see.

717
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:08,100
It was because you were dumb.

718
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:12,940
I get you want him to become the successor again,

719
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:15,750
but I have no interest in bringing back

720
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:18,320
someone so unqualified.

721
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:20,850
That position will be vacant forever, then.

722
00:50:20,850 --> 00:50:23,030
If the Director isn't qualified,

723
00:50:23,030 --> 00:50:25,900
who would fill that position?

724
00:50:27,990 --> 00:50:29,900
How can you be so confident?

725
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:32,010
Because you are...

726
00:50:32,730 --> 00:50:35,220
his only family.

727
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:38,340
He worked hard to be acknowledged

728
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:40,810
and be loved by his only family.

729
00:50:40,810 --> 00:50:44,300
You think anyone else would work that hard?

730
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:46,920
- What?
- You don't know...

731
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:50,260
how you feel, either.

732
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:54,010
After blaming your misfortunes on your grandson,

733
00:50:54,010 --> 00:50:55,970
does that make you feel at ease?

734
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:00,200
And what I'm hoping to get back

735
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:02,960
isn't the successor position.

736
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:05,360
It's the Director's family.

737
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:37,140
Hey, Ju Yeon. Is everything okay?

738
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:38,430
<i>Hyung,</i>

739
00:51:38,430 --> 00:51:40,610
be honest with me.

740
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:45,310
It's too much...

741
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,620
Please have some of this.

742
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:53,140
What is it?

743
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:00,350
What do you think?

744
00:52:00,350 --> 00:52:02,820
Doesn't it wake you up?

745
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:11,640
We're done for the day after moving these, right?

746
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:13,060
Yes.

747
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:16,220
It's nice to have a young person around.

748
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:18,460
She cheers us up like this.

749
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:47,910
What are you doing?

750
00:52:47,910 --> 00:52:49,830
You should've told me.

751
00:52:49,830 --> 00:52:52,680
Or you should've quit immediately. Why...

752
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:54,510
are you doing this?

753
00:52:55,370 --> 00:52:57,200
Why are you enduring this for me?

754
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:58,710
Because I knew you'd be like this.

755
00:52:58,710 --> 00:53:02,230
Because you'd blame yourself and be upset.

756
00:53:02,230 --> 00:53:03,380
That's why I couldn't tell you.

757
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:04,790
It's true.

758
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:08,500
You wouldn't be victimized if it wasn't for me.

759
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:10,530
Why are you tolerating it?

760
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:13,760
Just because of a word from the Chairwoman,

761
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:16,660
should I let my time and effort devoted here

762
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:19,580
be forgotten and leave?

763
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:22,060
I made this decision for me.

764
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:24,630
For myself because I love you.

765
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:29,240
Because I had to stay here for what comes next.

766
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:33,800
So, please respect my decision.

767
00:53:37,110 --> 00:53:39,310
I'll make a decision, too, then.

768
00:53:41,530 --> 00:53:43,600
For you, Su Jeong.

769
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:50,640
Thank you.

770
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:52,790
You didn't have to drive me.

771
00:53:52,790 --> 00:53:53,990
Aren't you tired?

772
00:53:53,990 --> 00:53:55,690
Not at all.

773
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:59,550
I must've been working out so much to do this.

774
00:53:59,550 --> 00:54:03,510
And these would've been hard to carry alone.

775
00:54:03,510 --> 00:54:05,630
That's why I had to drive you today.

776
00:54:05,630 --> 00:54:07,570
What are all these?

777
00:54:07,570 --> 00:54:09,030
Are they for me?

778
00:54:09,030 --> 00:54:13,280
I'm sorry, but they aren't for you.

779
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:16,160
They're for your mother.

780
00:54:16,850 --> 00:54:18,610
And how about you

781
00:54:18,610 --> 00:54:21,030
install a CCTV at the shop?

782
00:54:21,030 --> 00:54:24,500
Your ex-husband didn't look so nice.

783
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:27,000
You never know when he'd be back.

784
00:54:29,270 --> 00:54:31,130
Sin Won,

785
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:36,270
I couldn't help it then, but

786
00:54:36,270 --> 00:54:39,480
it makes me uncomfortable that you worry

787
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:41,290
about me this much.

788
00:54:41,290 --> 00:54:45,270
Not to mention my ex-husband and family.

789
00:54:46,550 --> 00:54:49,880
As for the gifts, I appreciate the gesture.

790
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,320
Drive home safely.

791
00:55:11,930 --> 00:55:13,570
Ha Jin.

792
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:18,540
You drew a line

793
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:20,930
between us just now, right?

794
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:25,250
But...

795
00:55:26,150 --> 00:55:28,060
can I just...

796
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:30,230
ignore that line?

797
00:55:31,090 --> 00:55:32,620
I...

798
00:55:33,710 --> 00:55:36,250
have so much fun when I'm with you.

799
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:38,870
It excites me, and I feel at home.

800
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:41,360
So, I want to share boring, painful,

801
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:43,260
and sad things with you.

802
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:46,260
That's how much I want to

803
00:55:47,330 --> 00:55:48,950
get deeply involved in your life-

804
00:55:48,950 --> 00:55:51,270
But I'm saying I don't want that.

805
00:55:54,510 --> 00:55:56,760
Don't you understand what I'm saying?

806
00:55:57,870 --> 00:55:59,180
I do.

807
00:55:59,180 --> 00:56:01,820
I know what you dislike and fear, but-

808
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:03,790
You didn't get it.

809
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:07,590
Then, we can't do this.

810
00:56:31,650 --> 00:56:32,930
Where are you guys going?

811
00:56:32,930 --> 00:56:34,870
There's an agreement ceremony today.

812
00:56:34,870 --> 00:56:36,870
The one that's happening with the renewal project.

813
00:56:36,870 --> 00:56:39,630
Hana City is supporting it generously, right?

814
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:40,720
Yes.

815
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:44,160
Team Leader and Director did all the prep for it.

[Business Agreement for Global Tourism]

817
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:52,890
Hello.

818
00:56:52,890 --> 00:56:55,360
Good to see you.

819
00:56:56,570 --> 00:56:58,430
- Have a seat.
- Okay.

820
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:03,960
Chairwoman, you should step out for a moment.

821
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:15,500
We'll kick off the business agreement between

822
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:17,600
Hana City and Yongsung Department Store

823
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:20,030

Next is...

826
00:57:34,210 --> 00:57:36,220
I'm so sorry.

<i>What? What are they doing?</i>

828
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:44,440
Just one moment.

829
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:30,680
My name is Ban Ju Yeon

830
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:32,510
Yes.

831
00:58:32,510 --> 00:58:35,040
This is Yongsung Department Store's strategy team's

832
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:37,530
Director Ban Ju Yeon.
