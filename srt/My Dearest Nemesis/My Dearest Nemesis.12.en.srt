107
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:05,900
Because I've had nothing to be afraid of.

108
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,180
How do you think she feels?

109
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:14,000
Everyone is afraid before jumping into the ocean.

110
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,830
Even so...

111
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,690

<i>Yes, Team Leader.</i>

119
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,420
I'll do that, then.

120
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:53,160

123
00:07:58,810 --> 00:07:59,870
Yes, of course.

124
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:03,680
She's the only team leader to us.

125
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,630
She didn't even check your messages.

126
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:14,960
You treated her badly, didn't you?

127
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,130
That can't be.

128
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:17,360
She was probably moved, actually.

129
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,940
Why won't she read them if she was?

130
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,930
Do you want to...

131
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:23,320
shred documents again?

132
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,840
No.

133
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,640
I was mistaken...

134
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,190
She probably hasn't checked

135
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,730
since she was on the phone with me.

136
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:31,470
Check again. Let's see.

137
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:33,010
<i>Yes, Team Leader.</i>

138
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:34,940
<i>Yes, I saw the message you just sent.</i>

139
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,380
Hello.

<i>Don't worry and enjoy yourself.</i>

142
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,090
That was Team Leader Hye Ju, right?

143
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:53,090
It was Team Leader Su Jeong.

144
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:55,480
Really? Gosh.

145
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:00,850
I need to save energy for the exam.

146
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:02,450
Do you have to make me do this?

147
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:05,960
And tell him to move his stuff himself.

148
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,390
Here.

149
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:12,050
Is there more load to carry?

150
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:15,320
You're the load to carry. Seriously.

151
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:19,080
But why are you suddenly removing stuff?

152
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,150
Did you have another fight, by chance?

153
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,570
Not at all.

154
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:25,990
I'm trying to clean while I can.

155
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:28,550
It only gets dusty in the attic.

156
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:32,060
Yes, are you here?

157
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,330
Yes, just one moment.

158
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:34,680
Carry them downstairs.

159
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,050
I'll be right there.

160
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:38,680
<i>The customer is currently on another call.</i>

161
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,410
<i>You'll be connected to the voicemail...</i>

162
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,690
I hurt her feelings?

163
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,890
There's no way.

164
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,630
Director?

165
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,740
Chief?

166
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:13,210
It's an emergency.

167
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,980
So, what you told her last was,

168
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,140
"Leave"?

169
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:25,940
- "As early as tomorrow"?
- That's right.

170
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:29,340
You said you don't care when she returns.

171
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,400
That's also true.

172
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,280
Of course, you can't reach her.

173
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,580
She must be angry.

174
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:36,830
She's angry?

175
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:39,500
I was helping her make the decision easily.

176
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,860
Being too considerate can hurt someone, too.

177
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:46,100
Her boyfriend told her to leave alone so easily.

178
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,450
If she didn't feel hurt,

179
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:50,550
that'd be more strange, don't you think?

180
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,160
What do you mean?

181
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,110
I'd be going with her.

182
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:58,320
Sure, it'd be hard to leave together immediately.

183
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,350
I don't have a job there.

184
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:02,180
I need a job offer and

185
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:04,700
I need a place to live, too.

186
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:09,180
Is that how you said it?

187
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,640
That you'd be going together?

188
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,900
We're basically one now. Isn't that obvious...

189
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:23,170
<i>Noona is getting rid of all of your stuff.</i>

190
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:24,670
<i>Did you know?</i>

191
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,810
She must be furious.

192
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:28,600
I need to resolve this immediately.

193
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,490
I think...

194
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:34,010
you had better talk in person.

195
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:38,550
You sure are experienced.

196
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:46,280
Su Jeong, why are you so hard to reach?

197
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,330
I'm in front of your house now.

198
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:50,100
<i>Huh? You should be at work-</i>

199
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,530
I need to talk to you urgently.

200
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:54,150
Can you come out for a moment?

201
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:57,490
<i>I'm sorry. I'm not at home right now.</i>

202
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:58,690
Where are you?

203
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:00,530
I'll meet you there.

204
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,220
<i>Well, I'm at your place.</i>

205
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,880
<i>I'll meet you here, then.</i>

206
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:12,590
She already got rid of all of my stuff?

207
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,450
Su Jeong.

208
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:22,870
Su Jeong.

209
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,100
You made it.

210
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:36,320
I wasn't going to make you leave alone.

211
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,790
When I told you to go to the US,

212
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:40,290
I was thinking of going with you.

213
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,820
Of course. I see.

214
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:48,430
Did you know?

215
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:50,900
When I first heard you,

216
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,960
I thought you didn't mind being apart.

217
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,730
So, I felt sad and disappointed.

218
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:57,650
But I realized that couldn't have been the case.

219
00:12:57,650 --> 00:13:00,160
So, I wanted to talk to you more.

220
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,300
Why did you ignore me and move my stuff, then?

221
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:05,320
I couldn't tell you.

222
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,600
I wanted to surprise you.

223
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,610
Surprise me?

224
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:11,410
Because I'm grateful.

225
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:14,310
That someone cares about me so much.

226
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:16,090
Whether you want to leave together or not,

227
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:17,910
you made the decision for me.

228
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:21,040
So, I decorated the house with the stuff you like

229
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,330
and I wanted to cook something tasty

230
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:24,480
while waiting for you.

231
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,540
Come here for a moment.

232
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,780
Ta-da.

233
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,130
Su Jeong, this is...

234
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:37,020
Yes, it's the ship meal from "Pirate King."

235
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,330
It's so perfect.

236
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,600
The number of sausage and broccoli placement, too.

237
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:43,110
But I couldn't make the stew,

238
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:45,120
Hurry up and try it.

239
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,290
What do you think? Isn't it tasty?

240
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:57,130
I don't have a certificate like you,

241
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:59,190
but I know I can cook.

242
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:03,610
It's delicious. It's just the way I like it.

243
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:10,140
And I won't leave.

244
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,630
I'll stay at Yongsung.

245
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:15,220
Why? Because of your family?

246
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:17,650
I have no reason to leave.

247
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,560
You wanted us to leave because

248
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,990
I might not be acknowledged since we're dating.

249
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:29,860
I've worked so hard to be acknowledged by others

250
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:32,210
because I didn't want to be looked down on

251
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:36,060
and it was to prove that I'm not weak.

252
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:42,030
But I already have the people who trust me

253
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:44,980
and the ones who cherish and love me.

254
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:47,000
I even have someone

255
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,410
who loves me just the way I am, too.

256
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,650
I don't want to leave because of what

257
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:56,930
the strangers might think of me.

258
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:59,300
Of course, if Yongsung doesn't

259
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,920
give me the opportunity I deserve,

260
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,200
I'll go somewhere else.

261
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,210
But not now.

262
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:07,550
Okay.

263
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,990
Do as you'd like.

264
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,620
Let's finish it before it cools.

265
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:26,800
D-Did you call this delicious?

266
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:28,980
What...

267
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:31,680
What's wrong with it?

268
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:44,860
What are you doing, Su Jeong?

269
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:49,070
I'll become a nerd starting today.

270
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:52,570
That's not something you can just become.

271
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:54,500
Your blood is hot even if you try to avoid it

272
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,460
and you need to have flames in your heart.

273
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,810
Anything is possible.

274
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:01,860
She's too normal.

275
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,330
But why do you suddenly want to-

276
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:06,490
Instead of worrying about other people,

277
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:08,900
I'll do what truly makes me happy.

278
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,790
I realized I didn't have a proper hobby.

279
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:15,200
This isn't just a hobby. It's a lifestyle.

280
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,710
What did you say?

281
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:19,800
That's a good idea.

282
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,290
Anyway, it's nice to enjoy things together.

283
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:24,150
I'll start with the comic books.

284
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,110
I guess comic books won't do.

285
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:57,930
[Sin Won]

286
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,480
<i>Ha Jin,</i>

287
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,990
<i>it's me. Kim Sin Won.</i>

288
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:05,810
Sin Won, don't talk for a moment.

289
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:09,180
Do you not want to hear my voice any more?

290
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:12,670
No, no, no. It's not like that.

291
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:15,540
<i>I'm sorry, Ha Jin.</i>

292
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,950
<i>I didn't know I was...</i>

293
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:18,350
My gosh.

294
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:21,320
<i>such a little coward, either.</i>

295
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:24,190
Are you drunk, by chance?

296
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:26,820
<i>You extended yourself to me,</i>

297
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:29,980
but I walked backward out of fear.

298
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:32,240
<i>It's because I like you so much.</i>

299
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,340
Because I've never met

300
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:36,930
<i>a woman like you in my life.</i>

301
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:38,880
<i>I...</i>

302
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,260
This is it.

303
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,690
<i>hope...</i>

304
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,240
<i>I'm not too late.</i>

305
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,920
You're not too late.

306
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,430
Let's hang up for now and-

307
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:48,910
I love you,

308
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:51,300
<i>Ha Jin.</i>

309
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,920
<i>If you don't want to answer me...</i>

310
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,370
Me, too!

311
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:56,020
I love you, too!

312
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:59,120
So, hang up for now. Okay?

313
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,350
She says she loves me.

314
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:05,160
Good night.

315
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:21,100
<i>Congratulations, ma'am!</i>

316
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,560
Bravo!

317
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,500
- Congrats!
- Congrats!

318
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,340
Congrats!

319
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,520
Congrats!

320
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,330
Congrats!

321
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,850
<i>Me, too! I love you, too!</i>

322
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,400
<i>Are you up?</i>

323
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,580
<i>If you remembered something just now,</i>

324
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,810
<i>it wasn't a dream. Don't worry.</i>

325
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:01,810
<i>See you later.</i>

326
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:02,910
<i>I'll go to sleep now.</i>

327
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:04,740
<i>I love you.</i>

328
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:14,830
I'm visiting Mom since I'm free.

329
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:16,020
It's her birthday today.

330
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:18,380
<i>I remember it was around this time.</i>

331
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:21,390
<i>- Have a nice trip.</i>- Okay. Talk to you later.

332
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:26,900
You probably need to charge the car first.

333
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,170
What? Did you use my car without asking me?

334
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:32,910
We couldn't go on a drive with

335
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:35,410
my girlfriend's police car.

336
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:38,750
Geez, seriously.

337
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:44,920
Find an EV charger nearby.

338
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,750
<i>I found the EV chargers nearby.</i>

339
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:50,350
<i>Which one would you like to go to?</i>

340
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:11,100
[Jeong Eun Gyeong]
I'm here, Honey.

341
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,300
I brought the kids with me this time.

342
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:17,140
Dad, were you here without us again?

343
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,660
Seriously.

344
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:22,230
Happy birthday, Mom.

345
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:24,220
Happy birthday, Mom.

346
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:27,190
I haven't visited you since I was busy.

347
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:29,040
Is that why you didn't visit my dreams?

348
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,980
I miss you.

349
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,080
Mom, she's dating these days.

350
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,370
She isn't actually busy with work.

351
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:36,700
Hey, be quiet.

352
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,950
He's the same age as me, too.

353
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:40,390
Isn't that crazy, Mom?

354
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:43,510
It's been too long since I beat you, right?

355
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:44,930
Happy birthday, Honey.

356
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:47,470
We're all doing well. Don't worry.

357
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:49,770
I know you worry about Su Jeong a lot,

358
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:51,990
but I'll let her...

359
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:53,730
live freely from now on.

360
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:56,560
I'm free now, Dad.

361
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,320
No, Su Jeong.

362
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:02,290
I've been waiting to say this.

363
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:05,950
You don't have to worry about us so much anymore.

364
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:08,890
I want you to finally

365
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:11,510
stop feeling burdened

366
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:13,300
and do whatever you want to do.

367
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,550
I don't need your pocket money anymore.

368
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:17,460
Eat everything you want to eat

369
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,010
and wear everything you want to wear.

370
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:21,900
I've done my best because of you guys.

371
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:25,070
You were my motivation, not a burden. So-

372
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:26,880
Dad is rich now.

373
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,690
He really doesn't need the pocket money.

374
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:33,070
- What?
- This is all thanks to you.

375
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:35,470
What did I do?

376
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:39,220
Really?

377
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,450
Yes.

378
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:42,850
Wow. That's amazing, Dad.

379
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:44,970
How could that happen?

380
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:49,070
Wow, he looks just like Ju Yeon.

381
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,760
Director.

382
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,290
Hello, Father.

383
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:59,140
What brings you here?

384
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:01,570
You said you were visiting your mother.

385
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,850
That reminded me of my parents.

386
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:07,250
Are your parents here?

387
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:08,730
Yes.

388
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:24,350
[Ban Do Hyeong / Lee Jeong Hye]

389
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:28,580
We had the offline meeting that day.

390
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:31,000
That's right.

391
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,140
That's why I was happy to meet you.

392
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:36,790
It felt like a gift from my parents.

393
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:41,180
And you actually became a gift.

394
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:44,790
This is my first time

395
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:47,060
coming here with someone else.

396
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:51,120
I didn't get to come here that often.

397
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,840
I always had to come alone secretly.

398
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,750
I was worried my grandmother would find out

399
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,910
and everything felt like my fault.

400
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:06,080
This is my first time feeling at ease.

401
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,500
I got to bring them flowers, too.

402
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:14,880
Let's come here together from now on.

403
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,400
Whenever you'd like.

404
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,630
The project was a huge success.

405
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:27,170
The stock price went up, too.

406
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:29,210
Things are going very well.

407
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:32,820
The board members trust Director Ban, too.

408
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:35,870
He really is the best candidate.

409
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:37,420
In the next board meeting,

410
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:39,310
we'll discuss who your successor will be.

411
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:40,990
Later.

412
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:43,000
Let's talk again later.

413
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,710
Okay.

414
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,260
Ban Ju Yeon said he's no longer

415
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:51,370
interested in becoming the successor.

416
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:53,850
I knew he wouldn't be.

417
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,840
I don't understand.

418
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:00,170
Didn't you betray me because you thought

419
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:03,020
he'd be the new owner of the company?

420
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,660
No.

421
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,670
I helped him

422
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:09,120
because of my feelings on a humane level.

423
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,750
He wasn't even trying to be the successor.

424
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:14,460
He merely worked hard to be loved by me.

425
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,740
You helped a foolish person like him?

426
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:23,030
Do you know what makes a person weak?

427
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:24,270
Love.

428
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:26,490
It ruins you instantly.

429
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:28,610
That's why I was tough on him.

430
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:29,950
To make him stronger.

431
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:34,490
But he was able to endure that

432
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:37,270
because of love, too.

433
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:39,390
He didn't want to disappoint you

434
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:42,350
and wanted to be acknowledged by you.

435
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:43,940
That desire.

436
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:46,280
He was able to give up

437
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,220
on the position he wanted all his life

438
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:52,170
because of his feelings for Ms. Baek, too.

439
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:58,080
Love made Director Ban stronger.

440
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:03,080
That's why I don't find him foolish.

441
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:06,660
He's stronger than anyone else.

442
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:10,430
He's been treated harshly.

443
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,840
<i>Who's your grandmother?</i>

444
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,530
<i>I don't have a grandson like you.</i>

445
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:19,650
<i>He was forced to</i>

446
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:22,260
<i>be strong and not crumble.</i>

447
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,010
<i>I'll be better from now on.</i>

448
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:28,220
<i>I'll work harder as your grandson.</i>

449
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:34,490
The one who helped you endure sadness

450
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:37,030
was also Director Ban.

451
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,860
If you can...

452
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:43,380
finally see his love for you

453
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,510
clearly,

454
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:49,800
I hope you can apologize before it's too late.

455
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:52,270
For your own sake.

456
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:55,120
<i>After blaming your misfortunes on your grandson,</i>

457
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,840
<i>does that make you feel at ease?</i>

458
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,200
<i>And what I'm hoping to get back</i>

459
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,060
<i>isn't the successor position.</i>

460
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,460
<i>It's the Director's family.</i>

461
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,730
I'll go home now.

462
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:16,660
Chief, have you seen this?

463
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,310
Someone posted this last night.

464
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,640
It's hilarious.

465
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,560
<i>If you don't want to answer me...</i>

466
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,010
<i>Me, too!</i>

467
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:24,600
<i>I love you, too!</i>

468
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,500
<i>So, hang up for now. Okay?</i>

469
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,750
Oh, yes. I saw it earlier.

470
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:31,640
But that voice...

471
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,470
sounds just like yours.

472
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:38,350
A nice voice like that is rare.

473
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:39,570
Yes.

474
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:41,600
It's me.

475
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,170
Pardon?

476
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:45,470
Please promote the shop.

477
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:46,620
The food is good.

478
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,140
Well, then...

479
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:51,600
Whoa.

480
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,900
Ha Jin.

481
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:04,060
Thank you...

482
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:06,100
for taking me back.

483
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:08,530
I should be thanking you.

484
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:12,710
It was a love confession I'd never forget.

485
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:16,670
But there's a problem.

486
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,810
The customer video went viral.

487
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:21,680
Are you in trouble?

488
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,260
Yes.

489
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:29,960
It's a problem that I have too many customers.

490
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:55,550
[Chairwoman]

491
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:14,210
What brings you all the way here?

492
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:22,930
I...

493
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:26,320
am sorry.

494
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:29,890
To be honest,

495
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,130
I wished I were dead.

496
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,590
It shouldn't have been my son.

497
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:40,020
I should've died instead of him.

498
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:42,660
If I died instead,

499
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:45,960
I wouldn't have been in this much pain.

500
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:49,430
But I couldn't do that.

501
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:52,370
So, I blamed myself.

502
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:55,480
That's why...

503
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:59,760
I blamed you, too.

504
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:04,990
You did nothing wrong.

505
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:07,180
You lost your parents

506
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:11,150
and you needed love more than anyone.

507
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:16,140
But I couldn't love you.

508
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:21,290
I was your only family.

509
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:28,000
I know...

510
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:31,540
this is of no use now...

511
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:33,970
but I thought...

512
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:37,730
I should tell you this.

513
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,860
Thank...

514
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:44,160
Thank you...

515
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:47,280
for protecting me.

516
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,090
Grandmother.

517
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:25,720
That's wonderful. I'm so glad.

518
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:30,950
For that reason,

519
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:33,670
we need to cancel the contract.

520
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:35,020
The contract?

521
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:38,200
The confidentiality agreement we made.

522
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:42,410
I have no secrets to keep anymore

523
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:46,290
and you don't need me to secure your job.

524
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,860
You're right.

525
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:51,680
Do you agree to cancel the contract?

526
00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:00,220
Yes, I agree.

527
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:14,550
Where's Na Na?

528
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:20,860
I was wondering where you went. You were changing.

529
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:23,580
Yes. I thought I should try it myself.

530
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:24,690
What do you think?

531
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:26,000
It's pretty.

532
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,930
Right? It's really comfortable.

533
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:32,010
I like how the traditional patterns are mixed in.

534
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:35,110
The foreign tourists would like it, right?

535
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:36,710
Yes, I think so.

536
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:40,480
You remember we're having a team dinner, right?

537
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,840
Yes, of course.

538
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,670
We just need to choose a place now.

539
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:48,240
What kind of meat should we get, then?

540
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,880
Beef.

541
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:55,590
Let's get the top-quality Korean beef.

542
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,380
Nice. Gosh.

543
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:08,240
Thank you all for doing so great.

544
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,370
I'm in your care going forward as well.

545
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:12,210
- Yes.
- Yes.

546
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:15,140
I'm fine with water.

547
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:18,030
It's a special occasion. Not even one glass?

548
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:19,680
That's exactly why.

549
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:23,210
I want my hardworking girlfriend to drink freely.

550
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:26,220
Don't worry about later.

551
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:28,280
You don't have to do this.

552
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,720
It's a bit cringe.

553
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:32,170
I prefer it when they do a drinking competition.

554
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:34,780
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

555
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:42,200
Thanks for the meal, Director.

556
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,800
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

557
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,340
Where should we go for the second round?

558
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:48,490
I don't know. Any suggestions?

559
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:49,950
How's a karaoke?

560
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:51,450
Karaoke sounds good.

561
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:52,760
Karaoke?

562
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,850
- Let's go to a karaoke.
- Okay!

563
00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:56,330
Let's go.

564
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:05,380
♫ <i>Dancing little Catallena</i> ♫

565
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:08,030
♫ <i>I get sucked in without realizing</i> ♫

566
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:12,170
♫ <i>The proud Catallena</i> ♫

567
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:17,250
♫ <i>I'm melting. I'm melting.</i> ♫

568
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:18,940
♫ <i>I'm melting. I'm melting.</i> ♫

569
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:20,850
Nice!

570
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,580
<i>Fantastic singing skills.</i>

571
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:30,160
Good thing we came to a karaoke.

572
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,690
You think so?

573
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:37,350
Let's keep this going. The next song is...

574
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:39,170
["Confession"]

575
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:45,140
Who's singing this at a team gathering?

576
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:47,650
It's "Confession."

577
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,430
That was my song.

578
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,200
I was skipping the intro.

579
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,980
That's what I was trying to do.

580
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:25,110
Was it yours, Deputy?

581
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:27,630
It's okay. Just play it again.

582
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:29,290
Will you really sing that?

583
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:30,820
- Why not?
- But still...

584
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:32,100
Let's just move on to the next.

585
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,640
Yes, we lifted the mood.

586
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,370
A song is in a queue. Whose is it?

587
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:38,860
Why? I wanted to sing...

588
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:41,310
The song is already playing.

589
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,160
["Our Dream" by Coyote]

590
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,820
After this.

591
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:03,420
♫ <i>When I was a kid</i> ♫

592
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:10,460
♫ <i>I heard something I couldn't believe</i> ♫

593
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:16,760
♫ <i>Someone said they'll give me the world</i> ♫

594
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:21,440
♫ <i>It gave me a dream</i> ♫

595
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,450
<i>Ban Ju Yeon!</i>

596
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:27,140
♫ <i>I shake my head in disbelief</i> ♫

597
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:30,180
♫ <i>Shake, shake, shake</i> ♫

598
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:32,050
♫ <i>It's whispering to me</i> ♫

599
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:33,460
So cool!

600
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:35,700
♫ <i>It's me. It's me. It's me.</i> ♫

601
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:38,440
♫ <i>The world belongs to the one who dreams</i> ♫

602
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:41,000
So cool!

603
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,740
♫ <i>Be brave</i> ♫

604
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:46,360
♫ <i>You can do it</i> ♫

605
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,250
You said you won't drink.

606
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:56,030
I drank because I was upset.

607
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:58,200
Did you hate me singing

608
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:01,080
"Confession" again that much?

609
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,640
I thought you'd just let it go.

610
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:06,750
I'm a man who can hold grudges.

611
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:10,570
That's not something to brag about.

612
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:13,730
I noticed when they brought up the karaoke.

613
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:16,170
You were sweating and

614
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:18,810
you turned off the song.

615
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:22,150
We still had fun today.

616
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:26,110
I know, too.

617
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:28,780
That I looked terrible that day.

618
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:33,140
Thinking now, you were cute then, too.

619
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:35,210
You were really cute.

620
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:37,870
I'm not cute.

621
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:39,770
I'm cool.

622
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:45,550
Drink this. It's chocolate milk.

623
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:49,080
You try to make me feel better this way.

624
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:52,130
I'm not a child.

625
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:58,290
This won't work.

626
00:37:58,290 --> 00:38:00,510
What should I do, then?

627
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:24,010
He sleeps when he's drunk.

628
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:28,170
Why does he keep recording, anyway?

629
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:30,510
<i>Baek Su Jeong is on danger level one.</i>

630
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:31,730
<i>Be on alert.</i>

631
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:34,320
<i>Baek Su Jeong's danger level went up by two.</i>

632
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,650
<i>Very dangerous.</i>

633
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:38,790
<i>She must be eliminated.</i>

634
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:41,990
I really didn't like him at first.

635
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:45,730
<i>But why do I find Baek Su Jeong pretty?</i>

636
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:49,300
<i>She looked pretty even at that moment.</i>

637
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:51,060
<i>Baek Su Jeong.</i>

638
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,970
Come on. How cringe.

639
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:24,380
<i>Check the audio recording.</i>

640
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:32,690
<i>You're drunk and acting like a fool.</i>

641
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:35,310
<i>But you're cute even now...</i>

642
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:38,900
<i>How could he be so cool?</i>

643
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,820
<i>You heard that, right?</i>

644
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:44,350
<i>You aren't cute. You're cool.</i>

645
00:39:44,350 --> 00:39:46,510
<i>You're cool, Ban Ju Yeon.</i>

646
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:58,850
Gosh, I'm so stressed.

647
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:03,280
Su Jeong?

648
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:06,480
You're looking for a hobby. Why try so hard?

649
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,010
You're getting stressed, too.

650
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:11,710
Wanting to be good at everything is a flaw.

651
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:14,330
I'm not trying to show off or anything.

652
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:17,410
You like something when you enjoy it.

653
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:22,650
Instead of doing something with a result,

654
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:25,340
should we step out to get fresh air?

655
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:33,610
I love it.

656
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:35,520
I'm finally taking a break!

657
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,280
You're glad we came, right?

658
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,460
Yes.

659
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:41,420
Working is good, but you need to rest, too.

660
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:44,820
It's nice how empty it is here.

661
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:47,460
Is it normally this empty?

662
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:49,390
I rented the whole place.

663
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:50,450
What?

664
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:52,800
You rented this whole place?

665
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,370
Why are you shocked?

666
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:56,040
Hasn't it been obvious all this time?

667
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,760
Don't you know who I am?

668
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:00,880
So cute.

669
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:04,370
Take it easy, everyone.

670
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,880
Okay. I'll cook for you.

671
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:12,010
You want to cook here, too?

672
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:13,550
Let me do it. You should rest.

673
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:15,600
- Would you like to?
- Yes.

674
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:17,900
I'll do it.

675
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,360
Why? I'll do it.

676
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,900
I won't mix up sugar and salt this time.

677
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:23,070
No, let me do it.

678
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:24,900
But I'm good at housework.

679
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:26,670
Yes, let's just watch the fire.

680
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:28,370
Let Black Dragon do it.

681
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:29,960
Let's go.

682
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:50,220
You're better than I thought.

683
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:03,480
I don't think it'd work.

684
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,410
It's shaking.

685
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:08,720
I won!

686
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:09,830
That doesn't count.

687
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:11,910
It fell because you blew on it.

688
00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:14,100
You knocked it down yourself.

689
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:16,200
Accept the result.

690
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:18,080
Let's do it again.

691
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:20,170
Fine, let's. Do it-

692
00:43:21,650 --> 00:43:23,380
When did they leave?

693
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:28,090
The competition must've blinded us.

694
00:43:28,090 --> 00:43:29,250
I know.

695
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:31,580
We've always been like this.

696
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:34,850
Should we stop playing games?

697
00:43:34,850 --> 00:43:36,660
Yes.

698
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:38,450
You aren't cold, right?

699
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:40,500
I'm okay. I'm dressed properly.

700
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:44,210
Oh, right. Just one second.

701
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:02,520
This is for you.

702
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:05,660
I had to see the result since I started.

703
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:15,370
It looks nice on you.

704
00:44:15,370 --> 00:44:16,740
What do you think? Do I look nice?

705
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:17,990
Yes, you do.

706
00:44:17,990 --> 00:44:19,070
It's warm, right?

707
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:20,150
Yes.

708
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,780
Thank you.

709
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:29,090
It's the first snow.

710
00:44:30,490 --> 00:44:32,340
How pretty.

711
00:44:33,290 --> 00:44:34,900
I know.

712
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:37,190
The snow is...

713
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:39,660
and so are you.

714
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,550
How nice.

715
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:47,220
Watching the first snow

716
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:48,810
with my first love.

717
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:53,980
It's the first snow.

718
00:44:54,830 --> 00:44:57,470
I'm glad I get to enjoy it.

719
00:44:57,470 --> 00:44:59,650
I've been so busy lately.

720
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:01,010
I know.

721
00:45:01,610 --> 00:45:04,270
I'll enjoy it all I want.

722
00:45:04,270 --> 00:45:08,790
♫ <i>The day we met</i> ♫

723
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:10,460
Ha Jin.

724
00:45:11,870 --> 00:45:13,240
Yes?

725
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:17,050
If...

726
00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:19,820
If you find it hard to trust me,

727
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:24,490
just keep being suspicious of me.

728
00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:27,970
I'll continue to...

729
00:45:27,970 --> 00:45:29,930
prove myself, then.

730
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:34,530
That I'm someone you can trust.

731
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:40,230
As for anxious and unsettling feelings like that...

732
00:45:41,570 --> 00:45:44,440
let's erase them and stay together.

733
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:46,020

00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:25,310
Wow. Since Chief Kim is in charge,

914
00:58:25,310 --> 00:58:27,250
the photos look amazing.

915
00:58:27,250 --> 00:58:28,910
Right?

916
00:58:28,910 --> 00:58:31,800
Here's ramen to celebrate your promotion.

917
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:34,070
I made it extra spicy for that reason.

918
00:58:34,070 --> 00:58:36,040
Thank you.

919
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:38,750
Looks tasty.

920
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:44,770
Don't work too much because you got promoted.

921
00:58:44,770 --> 00:58:47,230
So, did you find a hobby?

922
00:58:47,230 --> 00:58:48,590
No.

923
00:58:48,590 --> 00:58:50,750
I might get one later,

924
00:58:50,750 --> 00:58:53,910
but I don't think I should force one.

925
00:58:53,910 --> 00:58:56,700
Eating your delicious ramen

926
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:58,870
and laughing with you is my joy in life.

927
00:58:58,870 --> 00:59:01,890
Yes, life doesn't have to be so grand.

928
00:59:01,890 --> 00:59:05,070
You just need to enjoy every moment.

929
00:59:05,070 --> 00:59:09,320
I was so lucky to meet you on the video game.

930
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:11,220
I would've been lonely without you.

931
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:12,520
You cutie.

932
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:14,540
I was lucky to meet you, too.

933
00:59:14,540 --> 00:59:16,370
It's very touching,

934
00:59:16,370 --> 00:59:18,480
but don't you smell something burning?

935
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:20,740
Gosh, the jjambbong!

936
00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:31,530
I'm home.

937
00:59:31,530 --> 00:59:33,700
Noona, Noona, Noona!

938
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:35,540
Gosh, stop being so gross.

939
00:59:35,540 --> 00:59:36,680
I got in.

940
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:39,310
I'm a firefighter who saves lives!

941
00:59:39,310 --> 00:59:41,130
What? R-Really?

942
00:59:41,130 --> 00:59:42,180
Yes.

943
00:59:42,180 --> 00:59:45,610
Hey! Good job! Good job!

944
00:59:45,610 --> 00:59:47,430
You did an amazing job.

945
00:59:47,430 --> 00:59:48,440
Go easy. Easy.

946
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:50,660
I guess he's not a dummy, Dad.

947
00:59:50,660 --> 00:59:52,250
Go easy. Go easy.

948
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:55,040
- Congrats!
- Spare me.

949
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:58,490
I should've celebrated with you yesterday.

950
00:59:58,490 --> 01:00:00,050
But the Chairwoman wanted to see me.

951
01:00:00,050 --> 01:00:02,160
You can congratulate him today.

952
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:03,910
Buy us something tasty instead.

953
01:00:03,910 --> 01:00:06,700
Of course. I made a reservation, too.

954
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:09,540
<i>Say yes! Say yes!</i>

955
01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:12,280

956
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:16,910
<i>Say yes! Say yes! Say yes!</i>

957
01:00:16,910 --> 01:00:19,600
Come on. Let's watch a little longer.

958
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:24,640
<i>Say yes! Say yes! Say yes!</i>

959
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:26,900
<i>Say yes!</i>

960
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:28,470
She accepted it.

961
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:45,710
Thinking now,

962
01:00:45,710 --> 01:00:48,560
I freed the Black Dragon in the end, right?

963
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:49,960
Yes.

964
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:53,060
Only you could've done it, Su Jeong.

965
01:00:53,060 --> 01:00:54,340
Because we're meant to be?

966
01:00:54,340 --> 01:00:56,120
Because we're meant to be.

967
01:01:01,630 --> 01:01:03,140
Well...

968
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:08,910
I was going to give it to you later, but...

969
01:01:44,830 --> 01:01:46,250
Would you...

970
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:48,830
accept it?

971
01:02:37,410 --> 01:02:39,110
So pretty.

972
01:02:41,310 --> 01:02:42,960
