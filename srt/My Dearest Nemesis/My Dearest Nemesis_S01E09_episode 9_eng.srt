1
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:14,310


2
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:17,790
   

3
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:20,420
   

4
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:23,160
   

5
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,010
   

6
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,730
   

7
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,950
   

8
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:34,920
   

9
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:49,010
   

10
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:55,770
What is...

11
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:59,030
this?

12
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:05,790
I gave it to...

13
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:10,350
my first love to confess my love.

14
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,410
It doesn't mean anything else.

15
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,140
I didn't want to forget my wound then.

16
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,710
That's why I kept it.

17
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:27,070
But...

18
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:30,100
why do you ask...

19
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,310
You're Black Dragon, aren't you?

20
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,070
Strawberry?

21
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,710
Didn't you know it was me?

22
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,980
I suppose you didn't know.

23
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:10,190
That's why we're in this mess.

24
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:23,070
Leave. I can't talk right now.

25
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,850
   

26
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:27,860
 What if they find out who the other person is? 

27
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:30,300
 I'm sure it'd be a huge shock. 

28
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:35,020
 Since they haven't found out, they might never know. 

29
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:39,810
 And Ju Yeon finally looks... 

30
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:42,050
 truly happy. 

31
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,850
Ouch.

32
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:07,190
Ha Jin, are you busy at work?

33
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,470
Should I come and help you?

34
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:11,000
You know I'm not busy.

35
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:15,640
Ha Jin, should I come to entertain you, then?

36
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,340
 You should just rest instead. 

37
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,740
You must be tired, following my schedule.

38
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:21,730
I'm not tired at all.

39
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,700
Being at home is more tiring.

40
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:27,530
 I have no energy because I can't see you. 

41
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,140
I actually want to discuss something.

42
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,620
Huh?

43
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:35,320
Black Dragon and Su Jeong.

44
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,480
What about them?

45
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,510
 Hey! Hey, beggar! 

46
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,970
 Hey! 

47
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:57,570
♫  Baek Su Jeong is a beggar  ♫

48
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:59,350
♫  She's a beggar  ♫

49
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:02,050
♫  She's a beggar  ♫

50
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,740
 Hey, how dare a beggar ignore me? 

51
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:15,050
 It's your fault! 

52
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,240
 Yong Jun. 

53
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,150
 Are you okay? Oh, no... 

54
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:22,420
 Did you two fight? 

55
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:27,010
 Can't you see he was injured? 
   

56
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:28,930
 What will you do 

57
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:31,280
 if his precious leg gets a scar? 

58
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,920
 I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 

59
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,610
 You think sorry is enough? 

60
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:37,020
 You need to teach your child well. 

61
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:40,320
 I heard Su Jeong's mom is at a hospital. 

62
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,020
 I feel bad about it, too. 

63
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,330
 It must be hard on your own. 

64
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:46,430
 But still. 

65
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:49,960
 You shouldn't completely neglect your child. 

66
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,330
 - Pardon? 
 - It sounds like 

67
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:55,300
 she often doesn't bring supplies and interrupts classes. 

68
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:58,070
 I heard she can't pay for lunch on time either. 

69
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,660
 Did you know she didn't bring lunch 

70
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:02,450
 to the picnic and forced everyone to share? 

71
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:04,890
 - Ma'am. 
 - Other moms complain 

72
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:06,910
 about her ruining the class mood. 

73
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:09,270
 And she caused trouble like this, too. 

74
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,050
 I'm sorry. 

75
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,960
 Let's go, Yong Jun. 

76
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:50,130
 Dad. 

77
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:51,490
 Yes. 

78
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:53,620
 I... 

79
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,270
 didn't do it. 

80
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,290
 Yes. 

81
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:02,540
 I should care for you more. 

82
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:04,490
 No. 

83
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:06,560
 I'm okay. 

84
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:12,400
 I decided to become strong on my own. 

85
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,710
 Honey! 

86
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:22,820
 No... 

87
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,600
 I decided to care for Baek Su Bin, too. 

88
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,710
 Because Dad can't afford to 

89
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:30,670
 and Mom is... 

90
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:33,070
 gone now. 

91
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:37,150
 Maybe that's why I was even more angry. 

92
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:41,340
 That you were the first person I wanted to rely on. 

93
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,610
 But in the end, 

94
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:46,580
 I couldn't rely on you either. 

95
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:50,160
 And I have to be alone. 

96
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:15,620
I hear the bagel sandwich is famous here.

97
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,140
We're here because they want to join our store.

98
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:21,570
Does it taste bad?

99
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:24,770
No, it's good.

100
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,710
Did something happen last night?

101
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:33,770
You look tired.

102
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:36,010
You don't seem to have an appetite either.

103
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:39,830
Was there an issue with the room you stayed in?

104
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,250
I didn't sleep very well.

105
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,710
I had a nightmare.

106
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:52,080
It was about things that weren't supposed to happen.

107
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,760
It still feels so vivid, as if it was real.

108
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,470
Gosh.

109
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,150
It must've been a terrible nightmare.

110
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:03,410
   

111
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:06,480
One moment, please.

112
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,290
 I don't like fashion styles like that. 

113
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:34,770
 I don't want to be anywhere near it. 

114
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:37,090
 How about now? 

115
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:38,910
 I don't care. 

116
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:41,380
 Because I like you. 

117
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:44,590
 Your video game avatar isn't real. 

118
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:46,500
 You're actually this pathetic person. 

119
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,800
 Stop walking around looking like that 

120
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,900
 and stay sealed forever, you little nerd! 

121
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,880
 If the same person hurt me 

122
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,990
 and also made me smile, 

123
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:02,390
 what am I supposed to do? 

124
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,110
Hey,

125
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,200
are you sick or something?

126
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,650
- Unni. 
 - Yes.

127
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:23,140
It's nothing. I'll let you start.

128
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,610
What did you want to say?

129
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:26,000
Huh?

130
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,580
The thing is...

131
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,420
Your director.

132
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:40,410
Are you still getting along with him?

133
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:43,240
Why do you ask?

134
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,810
So...

135
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,000
S-So, your director is...

136
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,930
The director is Black Dragon?

137
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:56,650
Huh? How did you—

138
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:57,850
How did you know?

139
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:59,670
Since when?

140
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:02,810
Last night.

141
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:09,550
You had to drag me out when I just got back from my business trip?

142
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:11,480
Brace yourself and listen.

143
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:15,680
We're going to my girlfriend's shop now.

144
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,900
Why would I go there?

145
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,280
The place is called "Sulo."

146
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:23,900
The owner there is your girlfriend?

147
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:28,450
Yes. When we get there,

148
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:30,840
your first love will be there.

149
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,590
Su Jeong?

150
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,500
Shit.

151
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:43,310
You knew?

152
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:44,910
S-Since when?

153
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:46,580
Last night.

154
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,960
Since last night.

155
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,210
Hey, a-are you okay?

156
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,900
Should we just not go? Huh?

157
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,760
Since when did you know?

158
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:06,420
The day you were bringing the director,

159
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,960
I saw you two together.

160
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,920
Yes, I knew it had to be then.

161
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,260
I thought about this a lot, too.

162
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:18,290
I thought finding out later would shock you more.

163
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:20,720
That's why I wanted to tell you today.

164
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,990
Are you okay, Su Jeong?

165
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:26,310
I'm not okay.

166
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:29,120
I'm totally not okay.

167
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,700
You dated Black Dragon, right?

168
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,500
That's the part that's not okay.

169
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,330
How could Black Dragon and I be an item...

170
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:39,890
Gosh, why didn't I know?

171
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:41,580
You should've told me sooner.

172
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,250
I wanted to.

173
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,710
But I didn't want it to affect your work.

174
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:48,500
And I didn't know you'd actually date.

175
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,620
Yes.

176
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,990
You did nothing wrong.

177
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:57,560
It's all my fault. My fault.

178
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,510
When I found out...

179
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:04,190
Black Dragon was an immature middle schooler.

180
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:08,810
What bothered me more than being deceived by a kid

181
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:12,770
was that I wasn't sure what I liked about him.

182
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:18,120
The person I liked and trusted was fake, you know.

183
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,890
I thought I knew him well this time.

184
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:24,230
If he's the Black Dragon who tricked me,

185
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:27,550
who did I like, exactly?

186
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:31,500
What will you do now, then?

187
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,760
I want to avoid him for now, but...

188
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,990
Hello.

189
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:52,210
Well...

190
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:55,080
I'm not sure what to say,

191
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:58,070
but I thought I should see you.

192
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:04,360
I wanted to see you. That's why I came.

193
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:15,500
So, you happened to meet at the shop

194
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:20,140
and found out we were Black Dragon and Strawberry who met in the game.

195
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:22,690
While trying to separate us,

196
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,710
you ended up together?

197
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:27,400
We ended up together by chance, too.

198
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:31,960
We didn't get together while trying to separate you.

199
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,420
That's not important here.

200
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:39,170
It means Chief Kim knew all about my past.

201
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,490
N-Not a lot. I learned a-a little.

202
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:43,430
A little.

203
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,190
- I'll go. 
  - Su Jeong! 

204
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:53,930
Wait, calm down a bit.

205
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:55,720
Could you sit down for a moment?

206
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,470
Should we?

207
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:10,660
If y-you don't mind, may I say one thing?

208
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:14,250
Since this happened anyway, I want the four of us to get along.

209
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:17,060
Let's let bygones be bygones.

210
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:20,670
And it happened when you were little.

211
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:26,560
You two will keep seeing each other, right?

212
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,510
- Yes. 
 - No.

213
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:36,650
Gosh.

214
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:38,460
I should start prepping for today.

215
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:42,670
Gosh, I should h-help her, too.

216
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:52,040
Let's talk outside.

217
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:55,950
- Wait— 
 - Su Jeong—

218
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:58,600
- Ju Yeon— 
 - Black Dragon—

219
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,390
Do you think...

220
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:12,150
you can continue to like me?

221
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:15,540
What do you mean by that?

222
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:18,690
You found out who I am.

223
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,770
Would you still be able to like me?

224
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:28,990
Do you think...

225
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:34,280
you won't be able to?

226
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:42,930
I think it'd be difficult.

227
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:48,670
I don't think I could.

228
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:50,720
Can you decide that so easily?

229
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,800
It's not easy. It's obvious.

230
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,030
No matter how much I think,

231
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:58,680
my answer would be the same.

232
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,450
- Ms. Baek— 
 - So, let's stop now.

233
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:11,520
Stopping now...

234
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:14,720
would be best for both of us.

235
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:21,050
What do you think happened to them?

236
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:26,630
Ju Yeon wants to keep seeing her, but Su Jeong doesn't want to.

237
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:30,660
Maybe she's more hurt by the past than we thought.

238
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,900
Rather than that,

239
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,550
if you hit a wall frequently,

240
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:39,570
you become good at breaking through the wall,

241
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:42,070
but you get to know the wall too well.

242
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:44,640
It could make your fear grow.

243
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,280
Su Jeong hit many different walls

244
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:51,440
often on her own.

245
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,000
She might not want to deal with a certain wall.

246
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:01,440
She doesn't want to dredge up the pain, I suppose.

247
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:24,460
   

248
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:55,840
 So, let's stop now. 

249
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:59,410
 Stopping now... 

250
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:02,560
 would be best for both of us. 

251
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:08,130
It was easy for her.

252
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:20,360
Team Leader Baek.

253
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:30,630
Come to my office right now.

254
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:47,340
Please...

255
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,360
sit there and wait.

256
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:30,730
Team Leader Baek.

257
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,810
Yes.

258
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:39,810
The next branch for the renewal project should be the Daejeon branch.

259
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:42,870
The inspection result looks good, too.

260
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:46,630
I'll prepare so it doesn't affect the schedule.

261
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:49,200
I didn't tell you to leave yet.

262
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,810
Wait.

263
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:56,640
We're not done talking.

264
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:29,800
Director, why are you making me sit here all day?

265
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:37,950
I told you. I need to talk to you.

266
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:40,570
Talk to me now, then.

267
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:41,720
Just because we broke up—

268
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,090
That's what you think.

269
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:47,380
I can't break up.

270
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:50,100
Why should we break up?

271
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,410
Do you have to ask?

272
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,930
Did you forget what the first love means to us?

273
00:23:57,930 --> 00:23:59,830
It's a bad memory.

274
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:03,400
We don't want to be reminded. How could we keep seeing each other?

275
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:08,080
Because I still like you.

276
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:12,020
You told me to keep liking what I like.

277
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:14,460
That's you.

278
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,910
How could I stop?

279
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,870
You said you liked me, too.

280
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:29,820
That was when I didn't know who you were.

281
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:44,530
Back then...

282
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,510
lying about my age...

283
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,890
I'm sorry.

284
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:55,370
It was my fault.

285
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:57,850
Could you...

286
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:00,700
Could you please forgive me?

287
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,770
Forget about everything...

288
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,200
and think of the Ban Ju Yeon now.

289
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:18,050
Why haven't you...

290
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,490
changed at all?

291
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:27,580
You were like this then, too.

292
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:30,000
You said you liked me.

293
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,600
But you left me behind as if everything was a lie.

294
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,680
See?

295
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:47,260
You haven't forgotten that I hurt you.

296
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:51,840
As you said,

297
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:58,050
I wish liking you was all a lie and a joke.

298
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:01,300
I wouldn't have gotten hurt

299
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:04,910
and wouldn't have said things that hurt a kid.

300
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:07,180
I could've comforted you

301
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:10,120
by saying we can meet when we're older.

302
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,300
I genuinely liked you.

303
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:17,400
That's how much I trusted you.

304
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,680
I was happy that I had someone to rely on.

305
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,850
But you were just a kid.

306
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:40,030
How could I like you again now?

307
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,260
I made it really spicy.

308
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:40,420
How is it?

309
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:43,820
I can't tell if it's spicy.

310
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:46,740
How strange. That can't be.

311
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:53,860
I broke up with him.

312
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:02,080
You don't open up easily.

313
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,850
You must've liked him a lot.

314
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:09,150
I know.

315
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:13,640
I guess I was very lonely.

316
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,260
After meeting Black Dragon...

317
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,210
at the offline meeting, I realized...

318
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:32,820
that I was really lonely.

319
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:36,360
That I was desperate.

320
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:42,770
I needed someone so much that...

321
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:46,250
I didn't realize he was a kid.

322
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,730
I think that's why I got tricked.

323
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:56,780
Like a fool.

324
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:00,660
I hate that so much.

325
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:06,090
You didn't just hate Black Dragon.

326
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,880
You hate yourself, too.

327
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,990
Yourself from back then.

328
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:30,200
Hyung,

329
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:34,210
have you been through a breakup?

330
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:35,590
What?

331
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:41,400
You must've had many since you dated a lot.

332
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:48,110
How did you repeat so many heartaches?

333
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:51,280
Ju Yeon, I think you're drunk.

334
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,750
When you start dating,

335
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:57,120
both people need to agree.

336
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,600
But why?

337
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:02,050
Why is it over when one person says,

338
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:05,550
"It's over" in the end?

339
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:07,030
I'm opposed to it.

340
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:09,200
I, Ban Ju Yeon,

341
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,490
will fight against this...

342
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:16,090
cruel breakup system.

343
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,480
No.

344
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:32,080
I actually can't.

345
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,740
Because I don't have the right.

346
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:35,940
What do you mean, the right?

347
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:38,590
I thought only I was hurting...

348
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:43,730
because only I was sincere.

349
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:46,850
I didn't know how disappointed she was in me...

350
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:53,450
and how hurt she was, thinking she was deceived.

351
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:58,980
I really was a clueless kid.

352
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:03,650
I'm the one who hurt her more.

353
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:07,960
Ju Yeon.

354
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:14,230
Leave.

355
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:37,540
 The one I really hated... 

356
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:41,230
 wasn't you. 

357
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,780
 It was me. 

358
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,610
   

359
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:25,400
An employee?

360
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,780
The rumor says a team leader.

361
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,550
   

362
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:30,750
- Look. 
 - Seriously...

363
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,020
Look.

364
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,840
Team Leader,

365
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,140
have you seen this, by chance?

366
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:38,630
   

367
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:40,030
What is this?

368
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:42,960
I saw the original photo, too.

369
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,800
I think this woman is Strategy Team's Baek Su Jeong.

370
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,140
There was a post

371
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:06,590
on an office worker site this morning.

372
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:09,200
 I think it started there. 
   

373
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,320
You were announced as a successor recently

374
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,450
and some employees even recognized

375
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:16,410
Team Leader Baek in the photo.

376
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:18,700
Even before the PR Team can handle it,

377
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:23,130
it spread on various social media and websites.

378
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:25,850
The rumor snowballed in the process.

379
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:28,250
I see.

380
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:33,670
Why did you meet Team Leader Baek's family?

381
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:35,210
I ran into them.

382
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:38,460
And I treated them to a meal to be nice.

383
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:39,860
I see.

384
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:42,970
That's what I thought.

385
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:46,440
You're in a tricky position over nothing.

386
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,050
I know.

387
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:50,090
How unfair to Ms. Baek.

388
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:56,310
Take care of it as soon as possible.

389
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:12,390
Team Leader Baek,

390
00:34:12,390 --> 00:34:14,000
I heard you're marrying the director.

391
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,840
- Is that true? 
 - Pardon?

392
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:19,030
I hear your wedding is at the Yongsung Hotel.

393
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:21,420
The hotel employees know all about it.

394
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:24,620
But why would the director date Team Leader Baek?

395
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:25,750
 And even marry her? 

396
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:28,390
 Why not? She's pretty. 

397
00:34:28,390 --> 00:34:29,600
 Yes. 

398
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,090
Being pretty is the best.

399
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:34,370
Gosh, I want to be pretty, too.

400
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:38,670
Excuse me, team leaders,

401
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:42,410
I thought Yongsung Department Store was No. 1 in the industry.

402
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:44,750
That's why I was proud to work here.

403
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,120
I gave my best, too.

404
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:49,090
But the team leaders of the No. 1 store

405
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:53,540
buys into an unconfirmed rumor and judges a female coworker's looks.

406
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,770
It's disappointing.

407
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:57,470
We were complimenting you.

408
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,360
Let's start the meeting.

409
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,130
And...

410
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:17,840
let's only talk about work at the office.

411
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:37,480
I know what you're thinking,

412
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,770
but the director and I aren't like that.

413
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:42,030
Yes. Of course not.

414
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:44,310
Pardon?

415
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:50,220
Na Na, what's wrong? Is something wrong?

416
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:52,350
It's not that.

417
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:55,200
No, it's just that...

418
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:59,430
I thought you might feel it's so unfair.

419
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:02,360
- Pardon? 
 - It makes no sense.

420
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,890
Why would you...

421
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:07,160
jump into hell at work with the director, even?

422
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:10,400
Seriously. They know nothing.

423
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,180
It's totally impossible.

424
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:16,020
But people are talking so mean.

425
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:19,060
It's because they haven't seen how much they hate each other.

426
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:21,730
They were so scary on the rooftop.

427
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:25,410
You must be frustrated by all this nonsense.

428
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:28,090
I'm okay.

429
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:31,030
- Don't cry, Na Na. 
 - Team Leader...

430
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:33,670
I know. They believe the way they want

431
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:35,920
just to entertain themselves. You know?

432
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,620
They know how to come up with sensational stuff.

433
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:39,560
They have no idea what Team Leader is like.

434
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,330
How long will this go on for?

435
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:42,760
I don't know.

436
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:45,180
It's a false rumor. They'll quiet down in a month.

437
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:47,920
Yes. They should.

438
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:52,080
I'll report them.

439
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,970
I took down all the articles.

440
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:58,920
We decided not to address it officially.

441
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:02,670
The PR team is handling the public opinions on the online communities.

442
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:04,970
That it's a baseless rumor.

443
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:11,610
Many didn't believe it, saying the successor

444
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:13,730
and an employee can't be dating.

445
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:17,030
I think things will quiet down in time.

446
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:28,600
You wanted to see me, Chairwoman.

447
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,170
Yes.

448
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:33,260
I don't mind your charade

449
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:36,090
but acknowledging their family events is enough.

450
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:39,740
Why do you create noise by not differentiating hierarchy?

451
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:42,340
You're giving people the wrong impression.

452
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:47,490
- Being excessive always causes trouble. 
 - I'm sorry.

453
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:50,580
Since you're known as the successor,

454
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:53,640
wherever you go and whomever you meet,

455
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:57,370
don't forget that the investors are watching you.

456
00:37:57,370 --> 00:37:59,800
If you are to grow the company,

457
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:03,710
meet people who suit you in the proper places.

458
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:06,340
Yes, I'll keep that in mind.

459
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:08,570
So...

460
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:11,020
will you just let this go?

461
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:13,650
They started talking over nothing already.

462
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:16,110
You think it won't happen again?

463
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:20,600
Next time, they'll be noisy over even smaller things.

464
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,640
Baek Su Jeong...

465
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,550
Find the right moment

466
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:27,980
and dismiss her without people noticing.

467
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:34,550
You have to pull the weed from the get-go.

468
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,270
I think that'd be difficult.

469
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,280
It'd be difficult?

470
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,360
Team Leader Baek...

471
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:51,790
is a crucial staff to the renewal project.

472
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:54,420
Dismissing her over a false rumor

473
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:57,710
would be our loss facing an important project.

474
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:00,570
It'd be difficult to replace her, too.

475
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:15,020
Okay.

476
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:18,590
Just leave her, then.

477
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:22,140
If she gets on my radar again,

478
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:25,300
I'll take action myself.

479
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:28,340
I'll let you go.

480
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:41,270
You knew about...

481
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:44,230
their get-together, right, Chief Kwon?

482
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:46,490
Yes, I did.

483
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:47,550
But...

484
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:51,180
you've also cared for the employees' families in the past.

485
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,940
I didn't think it'd be such an issue.

486
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:54,900
So, I didn't report it to you.

487
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,280
I'm sorry.

488
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,590
If you're sorry,

489
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:02,750
you should take responsibility, Chief Kwon.

490
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,740
Are you okay?

491
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:22,150
Everyone is talking about you two all day.

492
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:23,900
Why should I not be okay?

493
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:26,400
It's not true, anyway.

494
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,790
I haven't seen...

495
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:41,410
Director in his office since earlier.

496
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:46,410
He was probably summoned by the chairwoman.

497
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:47,540
He'll be okay.

498
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:49,990
He's good at resolving anything.

499
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:52,310
You don't have to worry.

500
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:56,020
I'm not worried.

501
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:03,690
I think she is worried.

502
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:09,320
I'll do something about all the businesses with a below 10% sales record.

503
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,310
- All of them? 
 - Yes.

504
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:14,080
We'll cancel the contract or come up with a plan.

505
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,230
I'm planning to do something quickly.

506
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:19,270
The renewal project is underway, too.

507
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:21,050
I don't know how it'll be in the long run,

508
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:24,450
but fixing a few major stores won't be enough.

509
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:27,770
To double the sales and possibly more,

510
00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:31,210
all branches need to improve the sales.

511
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,800
We'll get busy.

512
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,770
We should get busier.

513
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:38,150
That's a good idea.

514
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:42,090
We have to be extra careful right now.

515
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:02,890
Director.

516
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,720
What is it?

517
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:12,710
Well...

518
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:17,080
This isn't causing problems with the chairwoman, right?

519
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:20,320
I don't think it's any of your concern.

520
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:23,900
I'm directly involved. How can I not be concerned?

521
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:27,250
If she misunderstood, I'll explain myself.

522
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:29,090
I'll tell her there's nothing going on—

523
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:31,610
No. That's not necessary.

524
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:33,870
As you said, there's nothing going on.

525
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:36,220
It won't be an issue.

526
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,860
That's a relief, then.

527
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:41,190
Yes, it is.

528
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:45,270
So, let's not get personally involved from now on.

529
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:48,830
Okay.

530
00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:50,530
Finally...

531
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:54,470
everything seems to be back to normal.

532
00:42:55,690 --> 00:42:57,580
It's a relief.

533
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:37,570
♫  Stay  ♫

534
00:43:37,570 --> 00:43:39,900
 The song is innocent. 

535
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:43,100
 Start liking it again with me. 

536
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:48,700
♫  Until I don't recognize myself, stay  ♫

537
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:51,600
♫  Wait just a moment  ♫

538
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,500
The payment went through.

539
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,030
Miss?

540
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:56,690
Oh, yes.

541
00:43:56,690 --> 00:43:58,690
Thank you. Take care.

542
00:43:58,690 --> 00:44:03,830
♫  I own my memories, stay  ♫

543
00:44:03,830 --> 00:44:09,860
♫  Until I let you go, stay  ♫

544
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:14,770
♫  Even in my memories  ♫

545
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:21,900
♫  The small (the small) warmth (warmth)  ♫

546
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:28,410
♫  Let me (let me) cherish that, at least  ♫

547
00:44:28,410 --> 00:44:31,030
♫  I think I'll freeze  ♫

548
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:32,800
♫  I feel endlessly cold  ♫

549
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:38,470
♫  If you leave (if you leave), too (too)  ♫

550
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:41,770
 I don't need to ask to do this, right? 

551
00:44:41,770 --> 00:44:44,410
♫  The beauty is gone  ♫

552
00:44:44,410 --> 00:44:47,120
♫  I think I'm already dying  ♫

553
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:49,270
♫  It makes me feel disgusted  ♫

554
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:54,150
♫  Stay, my dear  ♫

555
00:44:59,410 --> 00:45:01,410
Are you home, my daughter?

556
00:45:01,410 --> 00:45:05,160
Gosh, why is it raining so much?

557
00:45:07,890 --> 00:45:09,820
Su Jeong.

558
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,340
Dad.

559
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:21,190
What's wrong, Su Jeong?

560
00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:23,410
Su Jeong, what is it?

561
00:45:23,410 --> 00:45:24,910
What's going on?

562
00:45:24,910 --> 00:45:27,430
I'm sorry, Dad.

563
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:33,580
I guess I wasn't such a strong person.

564
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:36,870
I thought I was strong.

565
00:45:39,390 --> 00:45:41,850
What's wrong...

566
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:51,560
Noona, is it because of that SOB?

567
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:53,360
Why? He wanted to keep it a secret.

568
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:55,860
Is he blaming you for the rumor now?

569
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:58,240
I'll kill that jerk.

570
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:00,880
No, it's not. It's not like that.

571
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:02,950
What do you mean, it's not like that?

572
00:46:02,950 --> 00:46:05,120
I...

573
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:07,990
I suggested breaking up.

574
00:46:08,930 --> 00:46:11,710
I broke up with him, Dad.

575
00:46:50,110 --> 00:46:52,400
We agreed to end it.

576
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:15,490
While I was checking the low-sales businesses,

577
00:47:15,490 --> 00:47:17,770
I noticed one of them stood out.

578
00:47:17,770 --> 00:47:20,300
Do you mean the clothing brand, "Bukayo"?

579
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:21,890
Yes.

580
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:35,320
They're one of the top sellers in another branch.

581
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:36,800
The discrepancy was severe.

582
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,920
I'll create a report just on that.

583
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:40,510
Submit it this morning.

584
00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:42,570
Don't make me ask you next time.

585
00:47:42,570 --> 00:47:45,340
Okay, I'll be more careful.

586
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:01,000
Team Leader.

587
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:05,000
I think the rumor will be gone in no time.

588
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:07,820
You look even more distant than before.

589
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:10,990
The rumor didn't make things more awkward, right?

590
00:48:11,830 --> 00:48:14,020
- No. 
 - Right?

591
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:16,800
That's good, then.

592
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:20,500
That's great.

593
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:22,570
We don't look close.

594
00:48:24,030 --> 00:48:25,800
   

595
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:30,790
 ­  

596
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:40,730
All right.­

597
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:47,030
Come on, I told you to sit.

598
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:48,520
You're making me feel bad.

599
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:49,960
It's okay.

600
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,900
I prefer to be close to you

601
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:55,000
like this than to sit down.

602
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,950
Thank you.

603
00:48:59,990 --> 00:49:02,380
How's Black Dragon?

604
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:05,820
He's only focusing on work.

605
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:08,650
I think he's overdoing it, but that's how he is.

606
00:49:08,650 --> 00:49:11,180
I can't tell if he's worse or not.

607
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:13,080
But I'm worried.

608
00:49:13,770 --> 00:49:15,490
Su Jeong is like that, too.

609
00:49:15,490 --> 00:49:17,230
She's always been all about work.

610
00:49:17,230 --> 00:49:20,420
The rumor spread when things were already rocky.

611
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:22,910
They can't move on overnight.

612
00:49:22,910 --> 00:49:24,550
It must bother them.

613
00:49:24,550 --> 00:49:26,900
Although they can't show it.

614
00:49:33,010 --> 00:49:35,620
Aren't you going home, Team Leader?

615
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:36,890
I should.

616
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:39,230
I'll go soon. Don't worry and go now.

617
00:49:39,230 --> 00:49:40,950
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow, then.

618
00:49:40,950 --> 00:49:42,920
- Get home safely. 
 - Thanks.

♫  Our bright night  ♫

648
00:52:24,970 --> 00:52:29,000
Are you really relieved to be back to normal?

649
00:53:07,530 --> 00:53:10,200
Have any of you seen the director today?

650
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:11,700
No, I haven't seen him.

651
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:13,240
Isn't he in his office?

652
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:14,910
He went home really late last night.

653
00:53:14,910 --> 00:53:16,500
I left after 10,

654
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:18,170
but he was still here.

655
00:53:18,170 --> 00:53:19,310
Really?

656
00:53:19,310 --> 00:53:20,710
Just one moment.

657
00:53:20,710 --> 00:53:24,510
He always keeps the messenger on.

658
00:53:24,510 --> 00:53:26,130
It's off.

659
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:28,060
Is he at a meeting?

660
00:53:28,060 --> 00:53:31,030
How strange. He always keeps it on.

661
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:34,980
   

662
00:53:48,390 --> 00:53:50,670
Are you okay?

663
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:56,690
   

664
00:54:00,490 --> 00:54:03,710
I need to get it approved today.

665
00:54:09,890 --> 00:54:11,810
Chief.

666
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:16,020
Is the director working offsite?

667
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:19,650
He couldn't come in because he's sick today.

668
00:54:19,650 --> 00:54:21,360
Is he very sick?

669
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:24,990
I'm not sure. I got a brief report as well.

670
00:54:24,990 --> 00:54:26,900
He would've come in if he could.

671
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:28,580
Since he's home,

672
00:54:28,580 --> 00:54:30,760
he must be very sick.

673
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:33,640
I'm worried. I wonder how sick he is.

674
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:35,870
He's been skipping meals lately, too.

675
00:54:35,870 --> 00:54:38,090
He's been working all day, all night.

676
00:54:38,090 --> 00:54:40,720
How could he be well?

677
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:43,780
The chairwoman will be upset if she finds out.

678
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:47,030
She'd be upset that he's sick?

679
00:54:48,250 --> 00:54:50,180
The health issues

680
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:52,640
for the owner's family lead to risks.

681
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:55,400
Excuse me, then.

682
00:55:54,590 --> 00:55:57,980
Wake up. Who are you to worry?

683
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:03,190
But I can worry as a human to another.

684
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:08,850
He's an adult. He'll figure it out.

685
00:56:08,850 --> 00:56:10,020
I'm sure he's fine.

686
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:11,580
 Will you be okay? 

687
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:14,110
 Our relationship could get exposed anytime 

688
00:56:14,110 --> 00:56:17,120
 and it could be problematic for your dream of 

689
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:19,220
 becoming Yongsung's successor. 

690
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:23,480
 I think I'd be okay... 

691
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:26,820
 as long as I have you. 

692
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:30,930
 As long as you like me. 

693
00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:42,300
The medicine... Give me everything.

694
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:45,060
He won't eat. He passed out from overworking.

695
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:47,290
Give me everything that could save him.

696
00:56:47,290 --> 00:56:49,270
 ­  

697
00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:11,640
Yes, Chairwoman.

698
00:57:16,310 --> 00:57:18,290
Director.

699
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:21,000
My gosh.

700
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,500
Director, are you okay?

701
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:43,680
He tried to go to work in this state?

702
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:52,040
I'm sorry.

703
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:57,280
I was sorry, then

704
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:59,270
and I am now.

705
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:03,840
I only thought about my pain.

706
00:58:04,770 --> 00:58:08,650
I forgot about the pain I inflicted.

707
00:58:09,850 --> 00:58:12,790
But it's the same this time, too.

708
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:21,340
What if I hurt him again?

709
00:58:26,770 --> 00:58:29,450
I wanted to become...

710
00:58:30,870 --> 00:58:34,350
your biggest and coolest secret.

711
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:01,730
Don't go.

712
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:17,950
I...

713
00:59:19,670 --> 00:59:23,830
thought I wanted someone to love me.

714
00:59:25,180 --> 00:59:27,680
Even if I didn't work for it

715
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:30,250
or try hard.

716
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:36,430
But...

717
00:59:39,250 --> 00:59:42,000
you gave me love like that.

718
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,890
Back then...

719
00:59:45,630 --> 00:59:47,510
and now, too.

720
00:59:50,690 --> 00:59:53,410
So, don't feel bad.

721
00:59:54,870 --> 00:59:57,300
Don't hate yourself either.

722
00:59:57,300 --> 00:59:59,540
You already...

723
01:00:04,290 --> 01:00:07,650
are the biggest and coolest secret of mine.

724
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:12,460
Because you're my first love.

725
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:32,070
I love you.

726
01:00:45,110 --> 01:00:47,190
I love you, too.

727
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:56,600
♫  Love is just like a miracle  ♫

728
01:00:56,600 --> 01:01:03,300
♫  It seems close to grasp, but I can't  ♫

729
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:10,510
♫  Even if our hearts touch each other's  ♫

♫  Things went by for many reasons  ♫

♫  In the end of the faint moments  ♫

732
01:01:26,990 --> 01:01:30,750
♫  You're becoming more prominent  ♫

733
01:01:30,750 --> 01:01:35,420
♫  We'll meet each other again someday  ♫

734
01:01:35,420 --> 01:01:38,580
♫  I'll be hoping for that  ♫

735
01:01:38,580 --> 01:01:42,240

01:02:33,540 --> 01:02:34,710

01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:42,690
   

741

742

745

♫  Can't be grasped like it was a dream  ♫

750
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:28,530
♫  As we think of each other  ♫

751
01:03:28,530 --> 01:03:32,150
 When Ms. Baek entered and left the director's house... 

752
01:03:32,150 --> 01:03:33,580
 Did Director get fired? 

753
01:03:33,580 --> 01:03:35,490
 You're just jobless, then. 

754
01:03:35,490 --> 01:03:36,450
 Jobless? 

755
01:03:36,450 --> 01:03:38,680
 I'm bad at being bad at things. 

756
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:40,460
 The things you've been doing alone... 

757
01:03:40,460 --> 01:03:42,220
 Do them with me from now on. 

758
01:03:42,220 --> 01:03:43,740
 Team Leader Baek Su Jeong... 

759
01:03:43,740 --> 01:03:45,170
 Take care of her discreetly. 

760
01:03:45,170 --> 01:03:46,310
 What's this, Team Leader? 

761
01:03:46,310 --> 01:03:48,130
 This makes no sense. 

762
01:03:48,130 --> 01:03:52,230
 Could you not tell Director for now? 

763
01:03:52,230 --> 01:03:54,600
 I'll make a choice, too. 

764
01:03:56,520 --> 01:04:01,320
♫  I hope we meet again someday  ♫

765
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:05,420
♫  I'll be hoping for that  ♫
