00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:03,280
I should call him and ask where he is.

370
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:31,560
♫ <i>Stay</i> ♫

371
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:36,890

374
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:57,820
Yo, buongiorno.

375
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,810
Nice to meet you all.

376
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:03,020
I'm...

377
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,810
Black Dragon.

378
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:18,050
And you?

379
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:20,720
Black Dragon?

380
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:26,630
Hi...

381
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:28,130
Strawberry.

382
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:35,480
Black Dragon was a middle schooler?

383
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,470
An elementary schooler?

384
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:38,120
Anyway, we were all fooled by him.

385
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,410
What should we do?

386
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:41,500
Strawberry, are you okay-

387
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:50,850
Okay. I paid in advance.

388
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:52,220
Have as much as you'd like.

389
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:54,640
Hey, you have no money-

390
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,100
Don't worry about that. Never.

391
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:01,000
By the way, if you were born in '06,

392
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,060
you must've done military service, right?

393
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,600
- Of course.
- What was your rank?

394
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:14,730
[Sgt. Frog]

395
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:16,380
Sergeant?

396
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:20,290
Sgt. Frog?

397
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:27,180
Why don't we go to a karaoke, then?

398
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:29,270
Karaoke, my foot.

399
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:41,250
♫ <i>What do I do?</i> ♫

00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:46,440

00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:49,700

413
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:34,690
I-It's because I left the military recently.

414
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,340
I put it on, so I don't look bad.

415
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,510
Shut up.

416
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:39,430
You're a middle schooler, aren't you?

417
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:41,940
No, Strawberry.

418
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,870
I'll... I'll explain everything-

419
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:45,700
Shut up, I said!

420
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:49,840
You liar and a scammer who was born yesterday.

421
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,450
Strawberry!

422
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,020
<i>Strawberry!</i>

423
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,460
Strawberry, please.

424
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,140
Strawberry!

425
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,410
Hold on.

426
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,270
Please hear me out.

427
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,570
Yes, you're right.

428
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:12,720
I'm 15.

429
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,720
- You jerk-
- I'm sorry I lied.

430
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,880
I didn't want to be made fun of.

431
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,520
So, I lied on a whim.

432
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:23,780
I couldn't tell you later because you seemed to

433
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,130
want someone older.

434
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:27,820
But why does that matter?

435
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:30,460
- What?
- Name and age.

436
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:32,420
We had a connection regardless of all that.

437
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:34,100
Hey, it's her.

438
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,180
Isn't that what matters?

439
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:38,620
<i>So cool!</i>

440
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,650
<i>He's so cool!</i>

441
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:46,320
We...

442
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,010
were meant to be.

443
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:50,000
My destiny.

444
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,730
Your name is Su Jeong*, too.
(Means "crystal")

445
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:56,430
Dragons like me like shiny jewels, apparently.

446
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:59,300
So, you, Su Jeong entering

447
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:02,850
Black Dragon's heart...

448
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:06,330
must've been destiny.

449
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:08,230
I'm trapped in dark loneliness.

450
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:10,770
The one who can free the Black Dragon

451
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:12,340
is only you.

452
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,820
My love.

453
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:22,990
My destiny.

454
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:24,590
Please...

455
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:26,230
grant me...

456
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:27,760
love...

457
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:30,390
and freedom.

458
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:43,620
<i>Say yes! Say yes!</i>

459
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:46,920
<i>Say yes! Say yes!</i>

460
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:50,460
<i>Say yes! Say yes!</i>

461
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:53,880
<i>Say yes! Say yes!</i>

462
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:57,270
<i>Say yes! Say yes!</i>

463
00:31:57,270 --> 00:32:01,440
<i>Say yes! Say yes!</i>

464
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:04,610
Okay.

465
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,300
Age doesn't matter.

466
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,150
The problem is you, Black Dragon.

467
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:14,380
Your existence.

468
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:16,710
Your existence itself disgusts me.

469
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:19,080
You're disgusting from head to toe.

470
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,210
You look pathetic, you can't hold a tune,

471
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:22,890
and you talk stupid, too.

472
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:24,680
Your video game avatar isn't real.

473
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:27,000
You're actually this pathetic person.

474
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,600
Stop walking around looking like that

475
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:34,470
and stay sealed forever, you little nerd!

476
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:52,080
My existence itself...

477
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:56,080
My existence itself is the issue.

478
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:08,070
It's time to go to the academy, sir.

479
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:13,000
Let go.

480
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,460
Let go!

481
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:17,070
How could you do this to me?

482
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:18,650
How...

483
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:21,750
Let go! Let go!

484
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:31,650
Su Bin! Su Bin!

485
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:33,310
What's wrong with her?

486
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:35,120
I don't know. So noisy.

487
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,070
She should be gaming instead.

488
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:40,330
<i>I guess elephants are herbivores, too.</i>

489
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:42,050
<i>Yes.</i>

490
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:52,060
<i>My first love, Black Dragon.</i>

491
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:55,140
<i>The darkest phase of my life.</i>

492
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:57,920
<i>I realized that day...</i>

493
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:00,920
<i>that if you try to lean on someone,</i>

494
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:03,840
<i>you can fall even harder.</i>

495
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:11,390
[2024]

496
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:16,130
<i>You play life solo, anyway.</i>

497
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:19,440
<i>So, instead of a healer,</i>

498
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,020
<i>I decided to become a killer.</i>

499
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:25,760
Gosh! Spare me, Su Jeong!

500
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,840
L-Let go of me first, okay?

501
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,280
Let go of me first.

502
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,210
I can't. You'll leave if I do.

503
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:33,630
I'll be good to you.

504
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:35,790
- I said I'll be good to you!
- Stop!

505
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:37,710
Don't do anything! Do nothing!

506
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:39,970
You call every morning and come over every weekend!

507
00:34:39,970 --> 00:34:42,110
Were you possessed by a workaholic ghost?

508
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:45,330
I've never met someone so impossible as you.

509
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:48,270
I didn't want to say this, but...

510
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:51,260
you got me hemorrhoids, and I can't walk.

511
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:54,610
I'm quitting because of you. Don't you know?

512
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:56,600
Is that all?

513
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,670
What? Hemorrhoids?

514
00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:00,980
Is that the only reason you're quitting?

515
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:06,130
This is why I'm going crazy.

516
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:09,310
I always end up with bosses like you.

517
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:12,900
- Don't go!
- Gosh, please stop.

518
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:15,660
I'll easily become

519
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:18,200
the president of Yongsung Construction.

520
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,380
Mr. Kim,

521
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:22,380
did you look into the chairwoman's grandson?

522
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:23,830
Yes.

523
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:25,330
His name is Ban Ju Yeon.

524
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:27,190
He's a Harvard Economics Department graduate

525
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:29,430
and he finished the master's degree. An elite.

526
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:31,690
There's no information beyond that.

527
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:32,930
That's it?

528
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:35,620
<i>He's thorough, and he's suspicious.</i>

529
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:38,140
<i>He doesn't seem to keep people around him.</i>

530
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:39,400
<i>He hasn't made a public appearance</i>

531
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,130
<i>since graduating middle school.</i>

532
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:42,800
People don't even know what he looks like.

533
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,920
So, you don't know what he's doing where, either?

534
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,080
According to my research,

535
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,260
he seems to be gathering information on projects

536
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:50,860
and directors under a fake identity.

537
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:53,040
<i>He's influential in appointments, too.</i>

538
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,530
<i>How about...</i>

539
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:58,740
the dismissal of the Yongsung Motors president?

540
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:03,050
He's very powerful.

541
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:07,320
Is it because he's the chairwoman's only grandson?

542
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,260
Grandson.

543
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,900
He's more like his dog.

544
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,400
The chairwoman's dog.

545
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,710
He says everything

546
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:15,770
the chairwoman says to become the successor.

547
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:18,350
It sounds like he's not a dog,

548
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:20,950
but a fierce wolf.

549
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:22,570
Anyway, good work.

550
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:24,050

00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,580
Pardon?

731
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:32,430
Are you crazy?

732
00:47:33,990 --> 00:47:36,340
How am I supposed to trust you?

733
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:39,270
Aren't you leaving? You were in a hurry.

734
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,120
Will you keep following me?

735
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:59,130
You should've said you were visiting

736
00:47:59,130 --> 00:48:00,260
someone at a hospital.

737
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:02,780
I think I told you I was in a hurry.

738
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:05,810
Why did you crash my car, then?

739
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:08,780
By the way,

740
00:48:10,210 --> 00:48:13,050
haven't we met somewhere?

741
00:48:13,050 --> 00:48:14,420
Pardon?

742
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:24,190
You're making a move on me right now?

743
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:26,640
Are you crazy?

744
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:30,050
Has this always worked? Huh?

745
00:48:41,550 --> 00:48:44,600
Excuse me! Excuse me! Hey!

746
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:49,730
What?

747
00:48:49,730 --> 00:48:52,040
Where did that bastard go?

748
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:53,690
Geez.

749
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:02,830
You're late.

750
00:49:04,010 --> 00:49:06,990
- I'm sorry.
- When my son died,

751
00:49:06,990 --> 00:49:08,380
he had just become the

752
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:11,820
director of the department store, too.

753
00:49:12,590 --> 00:49:14,640
Do you understand?

754
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:19,090
I gave you a good opportunity.

755
00:49:20,370 --> 00:49:22,470
This could finally prove...

756
00:49:22,470 --> 00:49:26,460
if you could replace my son.

757
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:32,340
I'll prove to you that I'm qualified to...

758
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:36,060
become Yongsung's successor.

759
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:38,740
Yes. Prove me.

760
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:40,270
Don't make any mistakes.

761
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:45,980
I won't forgive even a small mistake.

762
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:58,450
Chairwoman.

763
00:49:58,450 --> 00:50:00,230
I can't believe you came this far.

764
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:03,960
He was my employee. Of course, I had to come.

765
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,850
Chairwoman.

766
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:13,230
Gosh.

767
00:50:13,230 --> 00:50:14,930
My goodness.

768
00:50:14,930 --> 00:50:17,550
Your son is still young, too.

769
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:19,530
It's okay.

770
00:50:19,530 --> 00:50:21,530
We should overcome this.

771
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:24,240
<i>Ban Ju Yeon,</i>

772
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:25,570
stop crying.

773
00:50:25,570 --> 00:50:28,090
you don't even have the right to cry.

774
00:50:28,090 --> 00:50:29,920
You...

775
00:50:30,930 --> 00:50:33,210
killed my son.

Hit-and-run scammer.

791
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:35,430
You said you ripped his business card.

792
00:52:35,430 --> 00:52:37,510
I didn't know he'd just leave like that.

793
00:52:37,510 --> 00:52:40,460
It's a shame. He made a move on you, too.

794
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:42,900
How could he do that in that situation?

795
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:45,870
Seriously. He does have a good taste.

796
00:52:45,870 --> 00:52:47,640
He must've thought it was meant to be.

797
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:49,270
You should've let it happen.

798
00:52:49,270 --> 00:52:50,710
With that crazy scammer?

799
00:52:50,710 --> 00:52:54,220
Unni, he's really out of his mind.

800
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:55,540
He was wearing sunglasses at night.

801
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:58,760
I hate his style, too. He was like Black-

802
00:53:05,290 --> 00:53:08,430
Here. Eat this and feel better.

803
00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:13,560
Daebak. This is amazing, Unni.

804
00:53:14,430 --> 00:53:16,440
Can you just feed me like this?

805
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:18,000
You have no customers, either.

806
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,650
<i>That's why I'm giving it away.</i>

807
00:53:19,650 --> 00:53:21,310
<i>The fish is about to go bad.</i>

808
00:53:21,310 --> 00:53:23,730
You opened two months ago. You'd be okay, right?

809
00:53:23,730 --> 00:53:25,850
Just worry about yourself, Director Killer.

810
00:53:25,850 --> 00:53:27,640
How many days have you been working late?

811
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:29,000
Today is the last day.

812
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,610
A new director is coming tomorrow.

813
00:53:30,610 --> 00:53:32,230
A new director?

814
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:36,170
I swear I'll treat the new one well.

815
00:53:36,170 --> 00:53:39,090
I'll let him bury his bones in the office.

816
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:42,360
Yes, I can tell you mean it.

817
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:47,540
[Yongsung]

818
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:52,170
Finally, a proper first day at work.

819
00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:53,920
Will you go straight to the director's office?

820
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:56,570
No, let's look around for now.

821
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:59,430
You left just like that last night.

822
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:01,640
Do you know how shocked I was?

823
00:54:03,070 --> 00:54:04,160
Are you okay?

824
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:07,840
I'm not okay. I'm a bit annoyed.

825
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:09,800
You brought the car back safely, right?

826
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:12,880
Yes. I think it has a scratch on the back.

827
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:14,430
What?

828
00:54:14,430 --> 00:54:16,640
He said he only brushed it.

829
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:20,260
I should've punched him when he said nonsense. Geez.

830
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:22,890
Seriously.

831
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:33,840
Loud noises in the public space.

832
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:36,410
Employee training needed.

833
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:47,560
The menu needs to be diversified.

834
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:50,230
Urgently need more protein.

835
00:54:53,410 --> 00:54:56,960
The new director's coming today, right?

836
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,670
The director's office was empty.

837
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:00,640
I thought he came in.

838
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:02,820
I'm sure he'll see the higher-ups first.

839
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:06,010
Team Leader, you'll get along this time, right?

840
00:55:06,010 --> 00:55:07,510
I wish I could, too.

841
00:55:07,510 --> 00:55:10,960
I'm sick of the nickname "Director Killer," too.

842
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:13,740
I actually used to be a healer.

843
00:55:14,730 --> 00:55:17,690
A killer, you mean. A killer.

844
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:20,170
I-I'm so sorry.

845
00:55:20,170 --> 00:55:23,890
By the way, they could just hire a good director.

846
00:55:23,890 --> 00:55:25,510
They need to hire a proper person.

847
00:55:25,510 --> 00:55:27,440
I just couldn't work with them.

848
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:29,910
The company's HR system is at fault.

849
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:31,640
It's the system's fault.

850
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:33,540
Keep that in mind.

851
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:36,340
Look. There's no meat in the side dishes.

852
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:39,000
How are we supposed to work hard?

853
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,590
Openly criticizing the company.

854
00:55:40,590 --> 00:55:42,460
She could discourage the team spirit.

855
00:55:43,390 --> 00:55:45,010
You're working hard from day one.

856
00:55:45,010 --> 00:55:47,690
Tigers run fast, even when hunting for a rabbit.

857
00:55:47,690 --> 00:55:50,880
I need to do my best in a simple task, too.

858
00:55:59,310 --> 00:56:01,070
What's wrong?

859
00:56:01,070 --> 00:56:02,760
It's nothing.

860
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:05,730
I think I saw someone who shouldn't be here.

861
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:16,430
[Dear Chief Kim]

862
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:23,440
- Hello.
- Hello.

863
00:56:33,050 --> 00:56:36,320
Happiness comes eventually.

864
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:38,120
[Dear Chief Kim]

865
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:40,520
Is it already the marigold season?

866
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:43,460
Gosh, what do I do? I can't accept this.

867
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:46,660
The workspace is unruly. Needs to be improved.

868
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:47,760
Ban Ju Yeon?

869
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:49,490
I'm the director of the strategy team

870
00:56:49,490 --> 00:56:51,460
of Yongsung Department Store now.

871
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:54,720
Let's talk, Chief Designer Kim Sin Won.

872
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:57,310
Bbanjju!

873
00:56:57,310 --> 00:56:59,850
I warned you not to call me that.

874
00:56:59,850 --> 00:57:00,910
Especially in public.

875
00:57:00,910 --> 00:57:03,620
Why not? There's no one here.

876
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:07,450
So, you're the director of the department store.

877
00:57:07,450 --> 00:57:11,630
Did the chairwoman decide to make you the successor?

878
00:57:11,630 --> 00:57:12,950
This is only the beginning.

879
00:57:12,950 --> 00:57:14,150
Really?

880
00:57:14,150 --> 00:57:16,500
Hey, I should congratulate you.

881
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:17,710
I'm proud of you, little brother.

882
00:57:17,710 --> 00:57:19,130
Why am I your little brother?

883
00:57:19,130 --> 00:57:20,400
We aren't related at all.

884
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:24,480
Why? Because my mom thinks of you as her son.

885
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,760
And I've known you for over 20 years.

886
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:27,980
Can't you just be my brother?

887
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:29,500
No.

888
00:57:31,310 --> 00:57:34,370
I would've gotten you a gift if I had known.

889
00:57:34,370 --> 00:57:36,030
Welcome to Yongsung Department Store.

890
00:57:36,030 --> 00:57:37,430
How dare you regift me stuff?

891
00:57:37,430 --> 00:57:39,860
But my heart is sincere.

892
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:42,030
[Dear Chief Kim]

893
00:57:42,030 --> 00:57:44,490
Aren't you sick of seducing women?

894
00:57:44,490 --> 00:57:46,460
I don't seduce them.

895
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:49,110
All I do is exist.

896
00:57:51,030 --> 00:57:53,440
Come on. Don't be like that on your first day.

897
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:56,040
I don't care what you do outside,

898
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:57,150
but don't do this at work.

899
00:57:57,150 --> 00:57:58,960
Hey, there's nothing wrong with dating.

900
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:02,130
What you do isn't dating. It's NSFW.

901
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:05,680
Come on. Do you have to say that?

902
00:58:07,050 --> 00:58:08,530
I need to give you a personal order.

903
00:58:08,530 --> 00:58:09,900
Come to my office before you leave.

904
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:11,020
You're leaving like this?

905
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:14,650
My perfect shirt is getting ruined. I can't stay.

906
00:58:16,890 --> 00:58:18,820
Geez. Seriously.

907
00:58:19,610 --> 00:58:21,880
He was a little cuter as a kid.

908
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:23,950
I marked the typos.

Time to play office politics for once.

918
00:58:51,770 --> 00:58:53,530
I'll be right back.

919
00:58:54,690 --> 00:58:57,010
