1
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:14,040


2
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:17,750
   

3
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:20,510
   

4
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,100
   

5
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,850
   

6
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:27,840
   

7
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,000
   

8
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:34,970
   

9
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:48,970
   

10
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:51,340
   

11
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,320
Then...

12
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,210
well...

13
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:06,990
I'll let you go.

14
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:10,170
Okay. I'll go.

15
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,550
Okay.

16
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:41,780
- Why... 
 - I think...

17
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:44,290
I want to ask you something.

18
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:47,000
Really? What is it?

19
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,750
It's a bit awkward to talk here.

20
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:51,960
Should we walk?

21
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,660
I'm more than happy.

22
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:54,790
Ask me anything.

23
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:57,050
I'll answer any questions.

24
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:10,180
What did you want to ask me...

25
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:18,770
What should I do with your stuff?

26
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:21,140
I put it in my attic for now.

27
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:24,350
Shouldn't you get a space somewhere?

28
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:25,830
I'm not sure.

29
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,720
If I got one under my name,

30
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,140
the chairwoman might find out.

31
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,550
Oh, I see.

32
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:39,460
If you don't mind, can I leave them there?

33
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:42,360
I'd be relieved if they're at your place.

34
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,050
It'd be a good excuse to see you, too.

35
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,950
You say stuff like that so shamelessly.

36
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:26,500
I'll go inside, then.

37
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,740
I...

38
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:34,380
I have something to ask you, too.

39
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,310
Really?

40
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,650
Yes.

41
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:48,460
What did you want to ask me?

42
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:54,800
I guess you're very close to that lady.

43
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,960
Jin unni?

44
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,570
We've been close since we were young.

45
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,720
We met while playing a video game.

46
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,040
The game where you met your first love?

47
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:06,580
Yes.

48
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,970
What's the name of that game—

49
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:44,310
I suppose you're close to Chief Kim.

50
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,960
Yes, he's my mom's friend's—

51
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:53,570
Gosh, are you okay?

52
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:54,900
It was a motorcycle.

53
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,390
Yes.

54
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,820
Anyway, we were childhood friends, too.

55
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:10,050
Oh, I see.

56
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:11,950
Hold on.

57
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:16,420
Did you make him ask around about me, then?

58
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,740
I had no choice then.

59
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:22,700
You knew too much about my secret—

60
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,300
Are they gone?

61
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:36,320
Yes, the cat is gone.

62
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,580
It was a cat?

63
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:51,590
Maybe I overreacted.

64
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:53,400
A little?

65
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,630
Do we need to do this with not many people around?

66
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:58,430
We might run into my dad.

67
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,710
It won't hurt to be careful.

68
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:03,450
Getting caught by someone from work would be worse.

69
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:05,550
There are so many people at work, you know.

70
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:08,820
The HQ has 8,000 employees and 100,000, including the subsidiary companies.

71
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:12,020
You never know when and where you'd run into one. Don't you agree?

72
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,470
You convinced me.

73
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:15,100
Hold on.

74
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,320
- Let's go. 
 - No one's around?

75
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,740
Yes.

76
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:49,480
I really need to go now.

77
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,090
Get home safely. Call me when you arrive.

78
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:55,120
Okay. Good night.

79
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:27,170
Yes!

80
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:38,910
Peace?

81
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:42,930
Does it mean rock 'n' roll or something?

82
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,840
 I love you. 

83
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,770
He's crazy.

84
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:54,930
 That's what it means in sign language. 

85
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:00,860
Seriously. He knows how to make me laugh.

86
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:38,840
She knows how to drive me crazy.

87
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,940
   

88
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,040
Excuse me.

89
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,620
Yes, sir. Do you need something?

90
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,990
Alcohol? Water? Snacks?

91
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:55,280
Instead of those, can I have your number?

92
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,640
Pardon?

93
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:00,530
I'd like to see you somewhere else sometime.

94
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,950
   

95
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:12,190
I'm afraid that won't work.

96
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:13,580
Why not?

97
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:14,880
Because I'm a customer?

98
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,040
No. I don't care if you're a customer.

99
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,590
I'm just not attracted to you.

100
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:23,547
- Y-You're not attracted to me? 
 - No.

101
00:09:23,547 --> 00:09:27,510
Let me know if you need anything besides my number.

102
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,650
   

103
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,320
   

104
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:55,900
   

105
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,970
   

106
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:02,520
I probably won't run into her anymore.

107
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,640
Kim Shin Won.

108
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,010
- Long time no see. 
 - Yes.

109
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:15,150
Did we last meet at the latest reunion?

110
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:17,100
Are you here alone? Where's your girlfriend?

111
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,260
My girlfriend?

112
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,710
We broke up a while ago.

113
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:22,180
How many hours has it been?

114
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,820
Has it been at least 24 hours?

115
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,340
Stop joking.

116
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,220
I'll drop this off.

117
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,980
Did you hear about Ha Jin?

118
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:36,220
Her husband cheated and they got divorced.

119
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,900
Crazy! Are you serious?

120
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,340
I didn't think he'd do that.

121
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,290
They were a campus couple since they were freshmen.

122
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:44,580
I know. You never know with people.

123
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,550
I feel so bad for her.

124
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:47,770
I'm okay.

125
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:49,420
- Ha Jin. 
 - You came early.

126
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:53,080
Hey, I heard about your husband.

127
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,800
Are you really okay?

128
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,530
Yes, I'm okay.

129
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,260
I was angry at first,

130
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,620
but I have no feelings since we divorced.

131
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:03,400
- Ha Jin. 
 - What do you mean, you're okay?

132
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,320
You don't have to pretend in front of us.

133
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,650
She's right.

134
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:08,160
No, I mean it.

135
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,840
Divorce isn't a trivial matter.

136
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:13,350
Cheaters should be rooted out completely.

137
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:14,970
Hey, calm her down.

138
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:16,880
Hey...

139
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,480
Let's go. Let's go.

140
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:34,080
Huh? We meet here now?

141
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,970
Do you want to have some candy with me?

142
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,820
Running into you here is a bit...

143
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,730
Does it feel like we're meant to be?

144
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,340
Yes.

145
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:12,320
I was frustrated with my friends telling me to get married.

146
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,420
That's why I came up here. But you were here.

147
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,410
So, I guess...

148
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:20,460
I came here out of frustration, too.

149
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:24,820
Why? Did your friends tell you to get married, too?

150
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,150
Who'd say that to a recent divorcee?

151
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:31,230
Oh, yeah. That's right.

152
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:38,820
I dated my ex...

153
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:41,280
since I was a freshman for over 10 years

154
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,570
and we got married.

155
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:45,380
You were together for a long time.

156
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,120
Since we knew each other for a long time,

157
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,050
I thought I knew him well.

158
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:52,710
But I guess marriage was another story.

159
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:55,370
He cheated in less than six months.

160
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:57,100
After I moved to another province for him.

161
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,440
What a piece of trash.

162
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,340
I know.

163
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,320
That piece of trash.

164
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,800
I was really fine once I got rid of him.

165
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,620
But everyone keeps saying I can't be okay.

166
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:12,250
Should I pretend I'm not okay?

167
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:16,170
Don't bother if you're really okay.

168
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,900
I know.

169
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,670
I wish they believed me like you do.

170
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:24,910
I was frustrated with stuff like that, too.

171
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:30,070
I was sincere about everything, but they all say I wasn't.

172
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:34,580
You know how you felt better than anyone.

173
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,570
I know.

174
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:41,290
I know how I feel better than anyone.

175
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:47,500
I really...

176
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,550
have always been sincere.

177
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,600
Do you want to sleep with me?

178
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:37,600
You told me last time

179
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,920
that you could sleep with me one more time,

180
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:44,040
but you don't want to go out with me.

181
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,160
Do you still feel that way?

182
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,960
If I said yes, would you reject me?

183
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,600
Yes, I will.

184
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:01,730
You rejected me, but you kissed me back.

185
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:03,800
You should've pushed me away.

186
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,450
There's no way I can push you away.

187
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:10,000
Do you like me that much?

188
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,450
This is no good.

189
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:17,520
You'll have to date me seriously.

190
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:22,550
Follow me back, too.

191
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:25,760
Don't you want to?

192
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:33,300
I want to. Because I like you.

193
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,660
You said you had a meeting. What are you doing here?

194
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,260
I have time to see you briefly.

195
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:06,770
- There was no traffic? 
 - No. I got here fine.

196
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,660
Su Jeong.

197
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,940
When did you leave the house...

198
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,590
Director?

199
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,460
Dad.

200
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:25,780
What brings you here today, Director?

201
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,860
Well, the thing is...

202
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:30,550
How are you, Father?

203
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:31,980
I'm fine.

204
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:34,490
You saw me yesterday, so you know.

205
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:35,900
The packages...

206
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:38,920
The packages in my room belong to him.

207
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,940
It's the company's confidential documents.

208
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,330
I see.

209
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:43,800
It's because

210
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,190
Ms. Baek is an employee I trust the most.

211
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:48,190
That's why I'm storing them in your house.

212
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:50,710
Thank you for letting me.

213
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:53,130
We're just storing them.

214
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:54,910
By the way, why...

215
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:58,140
The document I need to check today

216
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:01,010
happened to be here. That's why I'm here.

217
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,520
It's the weekend, though.

218
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,330
I see.

219
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:18,770
You're a workaholic, too.

220
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:21,770
You sure are the leader of Yongsung.

221
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:25,100
Actually, Su Jeong is a serious workaholic, too.

222
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,720
She works late and on the weekends, too.

223
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,250
It's unbelievable.

224
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:32,820
But you must like her because she works so hard.

225
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,610
Yes, I...

226
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:37,810
like her.

227
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:39,220
Instead of standing here,

228
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:41,010
why don't you come inside?

229
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:43,200
- What are you doing, Su Jeong? 
 - Huh?

230
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,030
- W-Why... 
 - Help him inside.

231
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:47,180
I'll take this out first.

232
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,720
It'd be okay, right?

233
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,580
Come on in.

234
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,390
This is your room?

235
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:15,760
Yes.

236
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:29,420
Toggaengyi.

237
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:32,120
You've been keeping him safe.

238
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,800
Of course.

239
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:39,260
Don't you want the document?

240
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:41,030
You said you were looking for an important document.

241
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:43,000
Oh, the document.

242
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,680
I forgot. I need to find it now.

243
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,470
The key is... The key...

244
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:50,100
It was around here.

245
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:52,960
It was here somewhere.

246
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,740
Where...

247
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:58,200
I found it! The key.

248
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:01,880
Key point.

249
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,540
Come when you're done. I'll cut some fruit.

250
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,180
Okay.

251
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:29,470
Did you find the document?

252
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:31,880
Yes, I'm looking.

253
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,420
You've been trapped in here.

254
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,290
Keep this place safe for me.

255
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:54,260
You're the smartest one of them all.

256
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:10,310
Everything was stored well.

257
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:18,240
I'm curious about something.

258
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:22,150
What's this?

259
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:28,650
I-I'm not sure. What could that be...

260
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:31,840
Dad must be waiting. Come out and eat some fruit.

261
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,400
I'm home.

262
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,330
- Hey. 
 - Hey, hey!

263
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,980
G-Get out of here.

264
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:53,360
Please leave.

265
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,170
The bathroom doorknob is loose.

266
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:07,060
It sometimes opens even when it's locked.

267
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:09,590
It had to happen while you were in there.

268
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:11,170
I should fix it immediately.

269
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:13,020
I'll fix it later.

270
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:14,550
You must've been startled.

271
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:16,640
I was, but...

272
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,810
it's okay.

273
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:20,780
I didn't lose my dignity as a human.

274
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,100
Okay.

275
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,400
Have some.

276
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,430
Why did you come to our house?

277
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:34,270
He has an important document here.

278
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:35,470
He came to get it.

279
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:37,110
An important document?

280
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,530
Why didn't you take it and leave?

281
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:41,530
Why did you mark your territory?

282
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:44,260
- Mark my territory? 
 - You little—

283
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:52,330
Baek Su Bin,

284
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:54,890
why are you being rude to the guest?

285
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:57,520
Why didn't you loaf around—

286
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,050
in your apartment. Why are you here?

287
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:02,150
I'm visiting my house.

288
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:04,590
Stop petting me. My hair is falling out.

289
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:06,680
Director,

290
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,660
eat some. Here.

291
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,670
It's getting cold.

292
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:13,280
I'm sorry, but I have a meeting.

293
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,700
I'll get going now.

294
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,690
Still, just eat one.

295
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:20,280
Okay.

296
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,460
I'll get going now.

297
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,690
Thank you for inviting me in.

298
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:37,410
Oh, okay.

299
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:53,970
What are you doing? Stop.

300
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:58,360
Are you two dating already?

301
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,070
Why would you invite him here so soon?

302
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:01,240
That's out of line.

303
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:04,510
What are you saying? Didn't you hear Dad? He was here for a document—

304
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:09,060
I know. The fact that he has it here means you're serious.

305
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:10,370
You fooled Dad, too.

306
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:12,740
You agreed to date secretly or something?

307
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:13,940
Hey, you—

308
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:16,810
Sis, what if you get caught doing this?

309
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:20,610
Dad and I are fine, but what if your coworkers find out?

310
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:23,630
The director's family will find out eventually.

311
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:28,520
He might be sincere, but his family won't like you.

312
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:32,430
What if they splash water on you and throw an envelope at you?

313
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:35,470
Would you cry and say, "Let us be in love."

314
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:37,430
Like that?

315
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:40,450
Have you been watching dramas instead of studying?

316
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:41,930
We're not dating, I said.

317
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:44,100
That won't happen.

318
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,140
And even so,

319
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:48,320
it won't matter.

320
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,860
- You're crazy. 
 - Stop being silly and get out.

321
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:53,350
Okay.

322
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:55,490
I'm sure you'll figure it out.

323
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:57,880
But, Sis,

324
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:00,830
I really...

325
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:04,750
don't want you to get hurt.

326
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:08,420
I'm worrying about you right now.

327
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,150
I'm such a great little brother.

328
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,270
Gosh, who'd marry him?

329
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:37,450
Isn't he the successor or something of your company?

330
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:39,430
You showed me the photo last time.

331
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:41,880
Amazing. What's he doing here?

332
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,990
He must be here to get dessert.

333
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:46,790
The chaebols eat this dessert?

334
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:54,320
There are too many employees.

335
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,600
You said it'd be hard to get.

336
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,450
There are so many people in there.

337
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:02,810
I'm glad I ordered in advance.

338
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:04,650
Let's get going.

339
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:10,100
She's arriving in about five minutes.

340
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,670
Okay.

341
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:16,910
Chief Kwon,

342
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:22,900
you started at Yongsung 20 years and three months ago.

343
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:25,060
As expected.

344
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:27,400
That's exactly right.

345
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:33,700
In the meantime, my daughter is already in middle school.

346
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:36,300
Time really flies.

347
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,340
For that long period of time,

348
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:43,150
you've always been loyal to the chairwoman.

349
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:46,340
It must've been possible because you truly respect her.

350
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:48,820
I'm happy that you acknowledge that.

351
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:52,780
But on that day,

352
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:57,200
why did you tell me the chairwoman was visiting me?

353
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,400
You went against her word and helped me. Why?

354
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:04,840
I didn't know...

355
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:08,400
I was helping you, Director.

356
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,780
I didn't want

357
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:13,410
her next appointment to be delayed just in case.

358
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:15,560
That's why I called you.

359
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:18,120
But in the end,

360
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:21,440
something happened and it was delayed.

361
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:24,550
Director.

362
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:26,620
Yes.

363
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:30,260
I want someone who will continue her vision

364
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:32,930
to become Yongsung's successor.

365
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:35,410
And I've never met anyone

366
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:37,720
who resembles her as much as you do.

367
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,950
Not yet, at least.

368
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:42,700
So...

369
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:48,440
I hope you don't disappoint the chairman anymore.

370
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,570
Don't worry.

371
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:55,640
That won't happen.

372
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:07,040
She's the CEO of Arteta Asia.

373
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,300
I'm Ban Ju Yeon.

374
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:11,160
I've wanted to meet you sooner, but here we are.

375
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,670
This is...

376
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,680
for your daughter.

377
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:18,170
I can't say no to that.

378
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:21,870
My daughter wanted to try this while in Korea.

379
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,950
Here.

380
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:38,120
Thank you.

381
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,000
I'm a bit forgetful.

382
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,870
I can help you from now on, right?

383
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,550
That sounds good.

384
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:48,810
I didn't get to ask you yesterday.

385
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:50,930
You said you don't want a serious relationship.

386
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:53,410
Why did you change your mind?

387
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:56,260
Just because.

388
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:00,380
I realized there was no reason not to see you.

389
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:04,050
You like me and I like you, too.

390
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,030
I just don't want anything complicated.

391
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:11,570
Tied to a relationship, you hope, get disappointed,

392
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:13,170
deceive, and get hurt.

393
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:14,610
Isn't that awful?

394
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:16,490
If you're happy, that's good.

395
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:19,710
If you're not, forget it. That's what I want.

396
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:23,590
I thought that'd be possible with you.

397
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:25,840
You're right.

398
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:29,470
You date someone to be happy.

399
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:34,460
It's here.

400
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:37,150
Yes, I'm about to leave.

401
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:38,570
How about you, Baek Su Jeong?

402
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:41,280
I'm also on my way to work.

403
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:44,770
I'll get to see you at work soon.

404
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:47,800
 You know we have to be more careful at work, right? 

405
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,390
Did you forget?

406
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:52,600
I've practiced hiding my private life my whole life.

407
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,600
 I keep them guessing. 

408
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,790
We won't get caught. Don't worry.

409
00:28:57,790 --> 00:28:59,330
But I caught you.

410
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:03,230
That means we were meant to be.

411
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:05,030
 You said we were ill-fated. 

412
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:07,090
Anyway, you can't let it show.

413
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:09,180
I won't let it show.

414
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,380
Never.

415
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:12,430
I won't either.

416
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:14,260
Never.

417
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:25,750
Hello, Team Leader.

418
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:26,870
Hello.

419
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:28,980
Hello.

420
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,400
Team Leader.

421
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:06,410
How were things with your blind date?

422
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:08,450
Did you have a blind date?

423
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:10,540
- Excuse me? 
 - You seemed to like him.

424
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:12,300
Really?

425
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:19,100
Deputy Yang, you must be mistaken.

426
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,800
I rejected him. Totally.

427
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,330
I cut him off completely.

428
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:41,810
I suppose.

429
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:53,940
I guess not just any man would catch your eye.

430
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:56,470
I think an older man would suit you.

431
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:58,750
W-Why...

432
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,400
Because you're so sure of yourself,

433
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,590
someone older

434
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:06,900
who's generous and gentle would suit you.

435
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,380
Yes, yes.

436
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:11,930
And not someone who's too qualified either.

437
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:13,180
Why is that?

438
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:14,530
Think about it.

439
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:17,650
He needs to support your career.

440
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:20,150
If he obsesses over his reputation and success,

441
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:22,040
it'd be too tiring for you both.

442
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:25,080
Wouldn't it be nice if we were both good at our jobs?

443
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,950
I didn't want to say this because it's too obvious.

444
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:30,440
You know the guy in the cartoon you mentioned?

445
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:34,130
A guy like him who kisses you and says he forgot?

446
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:35,350
You can't date anyone like him.

447
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:37,160
That kind of a man is the worst.

448
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,440
Totally the worst.

449
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,230
What kind of main guy is that?

450
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:43,300
Don't read cartoons like that. It's bad for you.

451
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,170
I know. I know.

452
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:46,830
To be honest,

453
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:50,290
I just don't want you to date someone at work.

454
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:53,880
I don't want you to quit because of that.

455
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:58,240
Deputy, how could she date anyone at work?

456
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,370
She told me that office romance is like hell.

457
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:05,360
Hell at work. Right, Team Leader?

458
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,170
- Did I say that? 
 - Yes, hell at work.

459
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:10,060
That's good to hear, then.

460
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:12,350
There's no way she'd do that.

461
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:13,920
Hell?

462
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,180
Why did I say that?

463
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:33,290
Na Na, where's Deputy Yang?

464
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:34,430
He's been gone for a while.

465
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:37,110
Oh, he's at the director's office.

466
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,890
Well, Director?

467
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:11,530
Direct— Director!

468
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,070
Team Leader Baek,

469
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:49,330
who prints and copies like this these days?

470
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:51,320
It must be tiring.

471
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,910
It's for me.

472
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:55,220
It's for you, too.

473
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:58,840
I'll pick it up when you're done.

474
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,340
Okay.

475
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,600
Team Leader,

476
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,420
- this... 
 - Director!

477
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:18,080
How could you have no practical skills?

478
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,660
How do you not know how to make copies?

479
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:25,830
Look. Feed the paper like this,

480
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:27,630
press the button,

481
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:29,670
and the paper comes out.

482
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,310
The letters are black and the paper is white.

483
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:35,080
Go ahead and approve it.

484
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:37,410
Go.

485
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:39,680
Okay.

486
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:45,420
How will he survive in this world?

487
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:55,330
Team Leader, are you the Director Killer again?

488
00:34:55,330 --> 00:34:57,870
He's still the successor.

489
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:01,760
He still needs to know how to make copies.

490
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,390
He doesn't know how to do that?

491
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:06,270
No wonder. He didn't know how to shred either.

492
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:09,040
I had a hard time since he held onto me all morning.

493
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,320
Did he do that to you, too?

494
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,480
- Yes. 
 - Geez.

495
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,140
What a strange guy.

496
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:30,520
I was spooked earlier.

497
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:33,480
You know I wasn't actually yelling at you, right?

498
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:36,830
I know how to make copies.

499
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:39,490
I did it a lot when I was an intern and secretary.

500
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:40,990
I know. I know.

501
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:44,100
There's nothing you can't do, Director.

502
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:49,220
So, you get it.

503
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:54,250
My stomach...

504
00:35:55,010 --> 00:35:56,350
Yell at me right now.

505
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:57,580
Say you were upset earlier.

506
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:59,640
Yell at me and scold me.

507
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:02,750
How would you explain why we're here, then?

508
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:05,400
But still, how could I yell at you?

509
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,170
You used to be good at it.

510
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:08,970
Are they fighting again?

511
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:10,730
They seem close, too.

512
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:12,290
Seriously.

513
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:16,220
Director!

514
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:19,450
A boss shouldn't be offended by stuff like that.

515
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:22,900
You become a good boss by taking criticism.

516
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:26,100
Understand? I asked if you understand.

517
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:29,290
Here we go again.

518
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:32,130
I'm witnessing the legend right now, right?

519
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:34,690
Let's go downstairs before we get mixed up.

520
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:36,900
Yes. I think we'd better.

521
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,240
The office is dangerous. Let's hurry back.

522
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,100
You're...

523
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,810
too good at improvising.

524
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:54,740
Way too good.

525
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:57,460
I had no choice.

526
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,830
I was just pretending.

527
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:01,850
Are your feelings hurt?

528
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,440
Why are you so good at getting angry?

529
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,270
Do you get angry when you see me?

530
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:10,770
Why? Because I'm not older than you

531
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:13,220
and I'm not the caring type?

532
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:15,400
Why worry about a comment like that?

533
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,580
No.

534
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:20,290
Didn't you prefer an older man, too?

535
00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:23,190
At the farm, you mentioned the age difference.

536
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:24,830
You said I can't be your boyfriend

537
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:28,170
and you don't think of me as a man.

538
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:30,120
That's what you said.

539
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:33,020
That was...

540
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:39,190
To be honest, my first love was younger than me.

541
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:41,860
That's why I didn't want a younger man.

542
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,630
Because of the bad memory.

543
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:48,140
So annoying.

544
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,910
How can I make you feel better?

545
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:54,370
You can do me a favor.

546
00:37:54,370 --> 00:37:56,060
Should I get you chocolate milk?

547
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:59,060
Or should I go to an arcade with you?

548
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:01,080
What am I, a child?

549
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,600
Then...

550
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:08,110
You can't ask me to kiss you or anything.

551
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:12,510
You're into that, huh?

552
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:15,300
- What did you say? 
 - Why would I ask that?

553
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:18,620
It's not like that. Don't worry.

554
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:21,160
I'll tell you when I think of something.

555
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:23,110
Okay, then.

556
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:31,800
I don't need a favor to do stuff like this.

557
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:44,640
   

558
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:53,270
So, this is the favor he's asking for?

559
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:55,610
 These are characters from my favorite comic books. 

560
00:38:55,610 --> 00:38:58,660
 Their names are easier to memorize than dog names. 

561
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,940
   

562
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:06,630
He's so jealous.

563
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:16,990
 I memorized all of them. 

564
00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:22,060
She memorizes quickly.

565
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:27,880
Let's go.

566
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,640
What's all this?

567
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,390
Is today a special day?

568
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:38,500
How could I eat all this...

569
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:41,720
Su Jeong, I have a boyfriend.

570
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,890
All of a sudden?

571
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:45,960
When, where, and how did you meet him?

572
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:48,100
He was my customer

573
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:51,200
and we happened to connect physically and mentally

574
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,560
very strongly, I guess?

575
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,050
You said you weren't interested in dating.

576
00:39:58,050 --> 00:40:02,140
But it's someone you know well.

577
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:04,440
Me? Who is it?

578
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,170
Kim Shin Won.

579
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:07,410
What?

580
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:10,260
From our design department?

581
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:11,800
Yes.

582
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,280
No way.

583
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,940
How could you and he...

584
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:16,390
You're actually dating him?

585
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:18,970
No, he's a player.

586
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:22,170
Are you talking about me, by chance?

587
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,260
Chief Kim, w-why are you over there?

588
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,600
Because I'm her boyfriend.

589
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,560
You can put it all the way in there.

590
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:34,600
Okay, got it.

591
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:41,570
I think he's a servant, not a boyfriend.

592
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:45,810
 You were mistaken. 

593
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:47,810
He'd be a player if he cheated.

594
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:51,500
He tends to start and end relationships cleanly.

595
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:53,870
I fell for that side of you.

596
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:56,070
You see through me with no mistakes.

597
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:57,700
Like this.

598
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,960
I see.

599
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,670
A close friend of yours told me that.

600
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:04,640
So, I thought it was true.

601
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:07,070
Anyway, you can't cheat. Never.

602
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:09,070
Of course, I won't.

603
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:12,800
By the way, who's the close friend of mine?

604
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:17,770
Well, I thought you were close to Director Ban.

605
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:20,350
How did you know we were close?

606
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:22,380
Most people seem to know already.

607
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:26,310
Really. I tried to hide it, but I guess it shows.

608
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:30,970
So, how are things with you and the director?

609
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:34,450
Well, there's nothing much to tell.

610
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:36,370
We just get along.

611
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:39,760
You don't have a special relationship?

612
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,790
Gosh, don't worry, Ha Jin.

613
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:48,370
Ju Yeon would never date his coworker.

614
00:41:48,370 --> 00:41:50,900
He'd be in trouble if the chairwoman found out.

615
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:53,540
- Really? 
 - Yes.

616
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:56,950
And Ju Yeon is a bit cold to people.

617
00:41:56,950 --> 00:41:58,600
If he dated someone,

618
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:02,000
I think a cute and loving woman would be good.

619
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,700
Someone sweet enough to tolerate his personality.

620
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:07,480
That's exactly the opposite of Su Jeong.

621
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:10,240
Right? The exact opposite of Team Leader Baek.

622
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,840
I know.

623
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:25,020
   

624
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:28,870
Yes, Director.

625
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:30,840
Are you off work?

626
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:33,350
Okay, then.

627
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:35,390
Let's go on a date after work tomorrow.

628
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:37,290
Movie, famous restaurant, or a cafe.

629
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:39,470
I heard most people want to do that.

630
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:42,070
 Do you have a place you want to go to? 

631
00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:44,680
I'm like that, too.

632
00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:48,860
Thinking now, I don't like crowded places.

633
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:50,990
 I'd like somewhere quiet. 

634
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:52,830
- Really? 
  - Yes. 

635
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:54,630
I'm surrounded by people at work.

636
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:56,820
Why go to another crowded place?

637
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:59,430
Oh, I know where I want to go.

638
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:04,810
Hey, hey. Did you see Yongsung's successor?

639
00:43:04,810 --> 00:43:06,420
What?

640
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:07,970
He's young, too.

641
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:09,750
I'm so jealous.

642
00:43:10,610 --> 00:43:12,960
I should be more careful.

643
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:15,380
   

644
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:18,970
We signed all the companies to join our food section.

645
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:22,670
We can start the remodeling in time.

646
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:24,020
Okay.

647
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:27,010
Team 2 couldn't sign on one company.

648
00:43:27,010 --> 00:43:30,230
We're still negotiating the terms.

649
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:31,520
But we're finishing up.

650
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,840
Wrap it up as soon as possible.

651
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:35,630
Yes, we will.

652
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:39,030
Sales Team 1 must be happy.

653
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:42,390
Team Leader Baek took care of the hardest part.

654
00:43:43,170 --> 00:43:46,480
You know we worked hard, too.

655
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,300
If Team Leader Baek didn't step in,

656
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:50,800
we would've taken care of it another way.

657
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,830
- Is that so? 
 - Do you have time to chit-chat?

658
00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:56,500
I don't.

659
00:43:57,340 --> 00:43:58,860
Strategy Team,

660
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:01,160
how's the Botanic House show coming along?

661
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:03,230
We hired a performer.

662
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:05,260
Besides the performance, I thought about

663
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:07,690
how to use it for regular events, too.

664
00:44:07,690 --> 00:44:09,450
I'll sum it up and report to you.

665
00:44:09,450 --> 00:44:11,160
Okay, sounds good.

666
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:13,980
That's all for the meeting.

667
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:23,200
 Okay, sounds good. I like you. 

668
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:26,450
 I wanted to say that, but I had to hold it in. 

669
00:44:26,450 --> 00:44:28,480
 See you on our date later. 

670
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:32,220
You're so good at your job, Team Leader Baek.

671
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:35,560
Are you happy to do everything alone?

672
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:39,080
I'm asking because I'm really curious.

673
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:41,840
Did you sleep with Director Ban?

674
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:43,480
What did you say?

675
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,680
You seem way too close.

676
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,900
He always says, "Sounds good. Good job."

677
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:50,960
I don't think he says that to anyone else.

678
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:53,110
I guess I'm the only one who works this hard.

679
00:44:53,110 --> 00:44:54,630
No.

680
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:56,850
You've always worked hard.

681
00:44:56,850 --> 00:44:58,410
But why is he the only one

682
00:44:58,410 --> 00:45:01,480
who likes someone as harsh and dogged as you?

683
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:05,410
Didn't you seduce him because he's the successor?

684
00:45:05,410 --> 00:45:06,600
You sure you didn't sleep with him?

685
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:09,880
I said we aren't like that.

686
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:11,430
Really?

687
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:14,400
Never mind, then.

688
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:19,340
Next time, could you make sure to make these types of comments in front of the others?

689
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:22,510
I need a witness to sue you for defamation.

690
00:45:22,510 --> 00:45:25,570
I can only tolerate so much nonsense.

691
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:47,010
These are the coolest clothes I own.

692
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:10,690
What's with the outfit...

693
00:46:10,690 --> 00:46:12,130
I had no choice.

694
00:46:12,130 --> 00:46:13,710
It was too risky

695
00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:16,850
to dress in my style in case I got caught.

696
00:46:17,850 --> 00:46:19,710
But still.

697
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:23,020
You look like you're going to work, not a date.

698
00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:28,450
That's why I prepared this.

699
00:46:28,450 --> 00:46:29,950
Prepared what?

700
00:46:34,070 --> 00:46:35,980
Get changed.

701
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,610
This is where you wanted to come?

702
00:46:49,610 --> 00:46:51,600
It's quiet and remote.

703
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:55,040
I knew you were into being intimate.

704
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,340
You're the one who's actually into that.

705
00:46:57,340 --> 00:47:00,190
You kept kissing me first.

706
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:02,460
I know.

707
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:04,480
We don't want to go somewhere crowded

708
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:07,350
and stick out. That's why we're here.

709
00:47:07,350 --> 00:47:11,950
You must've wanted to go to a restaurant, cafe,

710
00:47:11,950 --> 00:47:14,380
a movie theater, and so on, too.

711
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:18,140
No, I came here because I wanted to.

712
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:20,760
People go on dates by the Han River often.

713
00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:23,150
And...

714
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:27,080
we can hold hands like this here.

715
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:48,920
Do you like this song?

716
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:50,400
Yes.

717
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:51,980
Do you want me to skip it?

718
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:53,750
No.

719
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:56,370
I used to like this song, too.

720
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:59,620
Why is it in the past tense?

721
00:48:01,410 --> 00:48:03,910
Because I can't like it anymore.

722
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:10,090
Does this have to do with your first love, too?

723
00:48:12,470 --> 00:48:14,250
Yes, I suppose.

724
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:17,050
You must've liked him a lot.

725
00:48:17,050 --> 00:48:20,120
He takes up too much space in your life.

726
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:22,800
That's how awful it was.

727
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,290
You don't have to worry.

728
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:31,820
The past is nothing but the past.

729
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:34,040
The song is innocent.

730
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:39,000
Start liking it again with me.

731
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:43,740
Okay.

732
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,640
♫  I was already abandoned  ♫

733
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:52,060
♫  It makes me feel disgusted  ♫

734
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:54,460
♫  Hey  ♫

735
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:59,850
♫  For quite a while  ♫

736
00:48:59,850 --> 00:49:05,760
♫  You've been inside my heart  ♫

737
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:10,730
♫  Think of it as your home  ♫

738
00:49:16,310 --> 00:49:18,390
What's so funny?

739
00:49:21,790 --> 00:49:24,940
Are you seeing someone?

740
00:49:26,110 --> 00:49:27,500
The menu, please!

741
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:28,860
The menu is here.

742
00:49:29,570 --> 00:49:33,140
I'm not even the chairwoman. Why try to hide it?

743
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:34,720
Be honest with me.

744
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:38,060
I'll always support your relationships.

745
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:40,130
I fully support it.

746
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:46,250
Look at you.

747
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:47,470
You aren't denying it.

748
00:49:47,470 --> 00:49:50,010
Are you really seeing someone?

749
00:49:50,010 --> 00:49:52,270
- Yes. 
 - With whom—

750
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:55,070
Who stole your heart?

751
00:49:55,070 --> 00:49:56,900
Don't try to find out too much.

752
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:58,490
You'd get hurt.

753
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:01,360
Is she pretty?

754
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:03,340
How shallow.

755
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:05,150
I guess she isn't.

756
00:50:05,150 --> 00:50:07,020
Of course, she's pretty.

757
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,750
She's pretty.

758
00:50:15,050 --> 00:50:16,550
 She's pretty. 

759
00:50:16,550 --> 00:50:18,160
 Everything about... 

760
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:20,940
 Strawberry is pretty. 

761
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:25,860
Everything about her is pretty.

762
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:29,670
She really likes me

763
00:50:29,670 --> 00:50:32,350
and I like her, too.

764
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:38,290
Is it Team Leader Baek Su Jeong?

765
00:50:41,550 --> 00:50:44,590
Don't make ridiculous assumptions.

766
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:54,590
I hear the radish kimchi is amazing here.

767
00:50:54,590 --> 00:50:57,460
It is Team Leader Baek.

768
00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:02,240
The food section is the highlight of this project,

769
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,440
but to boost the sales more,

770
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:07,080
we have to remodel the Luxury Wing, too.

771
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:10,840
Since the luxury brands have strong identities,

772
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:13,540
it's difficult to remodel the interior.

773
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:15,350
Especially Arteta.

774
00:51:15,350 --> 00:51:18,170
If Arteta, the core of Luxury Wing, doesn't change—

775
00:51:18,170 --> 00:51:20,330
There's no need to worry.

776
00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:22,690
I already met them and took care of it.

777
00:51:22,690 --> 00:51:25,240
- Pardon? 
 - I met with them over the weekend.

778
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:27,920
I worked on this for a long time.

779
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:30,080
The client I didn't get to meet at the party

780
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:32,240
is the CEO of their Asia branch.

781
00:51:33,870 --> 00:51:36,990
Since when did you think about this?

782
00:51:36,990 --> 00:51:40,320
I've been thinking since the project started.

783
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:42,550
I needed Arteta to participate to do aggressive PR

784
00:51:42,550 --> 00:51:45,650
and allow for a major image change, too.

785
00:51:48,530 --> 00:51:50,550
You're...

786
00:51:50,550 --> 00:51:52,850
impressed with me now, aren't you?

787
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:57,190
- I'm not. 
 - I think you are.

788
00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:00,360
I swear I'm not.

789
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:02,600
Let's just say you are.

790
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:12,450
Because I wanted to impress you.

791
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:24,290
♫  The moment I hold your hand  ♫

792
00:52:24,290 --> 00:52:26,940
♫  It's all right, it's so high  ♫

793
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:28,940
♫  I can't hide my feelings  ♫

794
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:31,330
♫  I'll work up my courage and tell you  ♫

795
00:52:31,330 --> 00:52:33,090
♫  My first love is calling me  ♫

796
00:52:33,090 --> 00:52:34,440
♫  I've been waiting  ♫

797
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:37,090
♫  It feels like I'm flying  ♫

798
00:52:37,090 --> 00:52:39,720
♫  Even after a long time  ♫

799
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:44,000
♫  Say you'll join me  ♫

800
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,200
Move. We're at work.

801
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:48,020
You peeped at me...

802
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:50,620
when I was undressed at work, too.

803
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:55,650
Do you know how startled I was?

804
00:52:55,650 --> 00:52:57,340
You have a dragon tattoo on your back.

805
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:58,880
You were like a thug...

806
00:52:59,630 --> 00:53:01,010
I mean,

807
00:53:01,010 --> 00:53:03,590
you were dressed weirdly and talked meanly.

808
00:53:03,590 --> 00:53:06,040
Yet you were in the director's office.

809
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:09,310
I don't like fashion styles like that.

810
00:53:09,310 --> 00:53:10,890
I don't want to be anywhere near it.

811
00:53:10,890 --> 00:53:12,580
How about now?

812
00:53:14,140 --> 00:53:16,060
I don't care.

813
00:53:18,430 --> 00:53:20,820
Because I like you.

814
00:53:22,330 --> 00:53:24,500
Since when did you like me?

815
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:28,320
- Pardon? 
 - You must've hated me at first.

816
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:31,890
What side of me did you start liking?

817
00:53:33,650 --> 00:53:36,720
Do you usually ask questions like this so directly?

818
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:38,050
I don't know what usually happens.

819
00:53:38,050 --> 00:53:39,990
Since this is my first time.

820
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,010
But I want to know.

821
00:53:44,130 --> 00:53:46,500
So I can work on it.

822
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:48,820
So that you'll continue to like me.

823
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:53,170
Hurry.

824
00:53:56,380 --> 00:53:59,460
Come on. Tell me.

825
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:08,420
I noticed you were good at your job.

826
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:13,330
And you don't dislike me for being intense.

827
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:16,750
Can I record this?

828
00:54:16,750 --> 00:54:19,570
Why would you record this?

829
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:22,330
And?

830
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:25,900
And...

831
00:54:27,810 --> 00:54:30,340
your password is funny.

832
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:34,490
I started finding you a bit cute.

833
00:54:34,490 --> 00:54:35,730
What did you say?

834
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:39,220
It was supposed to be cool, not cute.

835
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:41,920
Say that again. Did you call me cute just now?

836
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:42,920
Not cool?

837
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:45,360
Come on. You can be cute, too.

838
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:47,220
No.

839
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:49,100
I'll give you another chance.

840
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:50,450
You're cute.

841
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:53,280
You're cute.

842
00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:00,930
That was a long report.

843
00:55:00,930 --> 00:55:02,170
Yes.

844
00:55:02,170 --> 00:55:04,250
He needs to go on a business trip later.

845
00:55:04,250 --> 00:55:06,870
So, I had to report everything in advance.

846
00:55:11,930 --> 00:55:14,490
I suppose. I heard we're setting up

847
00:55:14,490 --> 00:55:17,910
a cafe and a stage in the Botanic House.

848
00:55:17,910 --> 00:55:21,390
You must've needed time to talk over that.

849
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:25,350
Yes, that, too.

850
00:55:25,350 --> 00:55:26,790
Well, then...

851
00:55:35,350 --> 00:55:39,540
Ju Yeon and Su Jeong...

852
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:41,660
seem to be dating.

853
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:47,840
Ju Yeon said he started seeing someone.

854
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:49,970
No matter how much I think,

855
00:55:49,970 --> 00:55:53,290
there's no one but Ms. Baek.

856
00:55:53,290 --> 00:55:55,780
- If so— 
 - But...

857
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:59,140
I think it'd be fine if they kept dating.

858
00:55:59,140 --> 00:56:02,250
What if they find out who each other is?

859
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:04,860
I'm sure it'd be a huge shock.

860
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:07,170
Since they haven't found out,

861
00:56:07,170 --> 00:56:09,780
they might never know.

862
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:12,220
And Ju Yeon...

863
00:56:12,220 --> 00:56:17,850
finally looks truly happy.

864
00:56:17,850 --> 00:56:19,960
I can't bring myself to...

865
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:24,180
break them up.

866
00:56:35,090 --> 00:56:36,230
I printed it.

867
00:56:36,230 --> 00:56:38,240
Thank you.

868
00:57:32,810 --> 00:57:35,260
   

869
00:57:37,390 --> 00:57:39,880
Yes, Director. Are you done with the appointment?

870
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:42,920
Yes, I'm at the hotel now.

871
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:44,210
You must be tired.

872
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:46,030
 I miss you. 

873
00:57:46,930 --> 00:57:48,540
We've been apart for a day.

874
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:50,330
We'll meet tomorrow evening.

875
00:57:50,330 --> 00:57:53,150
But what if I want to see you right now?

876
00:57:54,030 --> 00:57:55,930
Try to hold out.

877
00:57:57,810 --> 00:58:01,120
I suppose you don't miss me that much.

878
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:02,410
 You have things to do tomorrow. 

879
00:58:02,410 --> 00:58:05,420
 I don't want you to push it because of me. 

880
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:08,170
Of course, I miss you, too.

881
00:58:11,420 --> 00:58:14,380
There's a comic book I want to read right now.

882
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:16,660
 Its first copy came out in 1996. 

883
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:18,880
You can't even find that on the internet.

884
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:20,620
- Pardon? 
  - I can't hold out. 

885
00:58:20,620 --> 00:58:22,360
 I need to read that right now. 

886
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:25,780
But it's at your place.

887
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:28,060
 I'll be right there. 

888
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:30,130
It's not you.

889
00:58:30,130 --> 00:58:32,620
I'm getting my comic book.

890
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:37,790
All right. I'll find it for you.

891
00:58:37,790 --> 00:58:39,330
Okay.

892
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:00,610
What a huge head.

893
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:16,230
   

894
00:59:26,030 --> 00:59:28,620
He acted like he didn't like it.

895
00:59:28,620 --> 00:59:31,200
But he kept it so dearly.

896
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,860
Is it kind of ugly?

897
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:44,270
Where could the comic book be?

898
01:00:30,130 --> 01:00:31,800
Su Jeong.

899
01:00:36,450 --> 01:00:39,200
Why are you out? I said to come out when I called.

900
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:42,880
Did you miss me too much?

901
01:00:47,590 --> 01:00:54,610


902
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:58,040
 You're the only one who can free 

903
01:00:58,040 --> 01:00:59,880
 the Black Dragon. 

904
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:03,390
 Please grant me love... 

905
01:01:03,390 --> 01:01:05,270
 and freedom. 

906
01:01:13,030 --> 01:01:14,760
Why is this...

907
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,240
You're Black Dragon, aren't you?

908
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:50,810
   

909
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:54,200
   

910
01:01:55,600 --> 01:02:00,890
♫  The showering stars and the round moon  ♫

911
01:02:00,890 --> 01:02:03,890
♫  I whisper in the river  ♫

912
01:02:03,890 --> 01:02:06,320
♫  Draw me now  ♫

913
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:09,210
♫  We glow under the moonlight  ♫

914
01:02:09,210 --> 01:02:11,540
♫  The moon goes out  ♫

915
01:02:11,540 --> 01:02:14,600
♫  Even in dark nights  ♫

916
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:18,730
♫  It'd shine on you by the window  ♫

917
01:02:18,730 --> 01:02:21,230
 I guess I was very lonely again. 

918
01:02:21,230 --> 01:02:23,410
 You said you liked me, too. 

919
01:02:23,410 --> 01:02:26,050
 I didn't know who you were then. 

920
01:02:26,050 --> 01:02:27,760
 I'm sorry. 

921
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:29,820
 Could you take it easy on me? 

922
01:02:29,820 --> 01:02:31,050
 There was a post 

923
01:02:31,050 --> 01:02:33,460
 on an office worker site this morning. 

924
01:02:33,460 --> 01:02:36,080
 Team Leader Baek, I heard you're marrying the director. 

925
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:37,970
 - Is that true? 
 - Baek Su Jeong. 

926
01:02:37,970 --> 01:02:40,440
 Remove her from the company discreetly. 

927
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:42,820
 It's not easy. It's expected. 

928
01:02:42,820 --> 01:02:45,380
 So, let's call it quits.
