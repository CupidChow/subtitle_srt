1
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:55,054
CASTAWAY DIVA

2
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:57,307
What in the world are you covering?

3
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:01,019
I guess the headline will be

4
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:03,813
"The Two-faced Domestic Abuser."

5
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:06,274
Who's the domestic abuser?

6
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:08,485
It's a secret.
I need to protect my source.

7
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:10,904
I'll be home late.

8
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:28,129
EPISODE 6

9
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:26,688
I…

10
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,732
I have something to ask you.

11
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:33,403
By any chance,

12
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:37,198
do you know a boy named Jung Ki-ho?

13
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:42,120
Jung Ki-ho?

14
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:44,330
No, I don't.

15
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,207
Who is he?

16
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,626
Well, he's…

17
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:53,298
We were in the same class
back on Chunsam Island.

18
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:57,802
He once said
the same exact thing as you just said.

19
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:01,347
If you wish for something
with all your heart--

20
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:04,017
One way or another,
it'll come true one day?

21
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,019
So that's why.

22
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:10,148
Come on.
That's what all moms tell their kids.

23
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:13,651
Is that so?

24
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:14,611
Of course.

25
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:18,197
They say their wishes will come true.
Would you tell them they won't?

26
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:22,911
What are you still doing here?

27
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:24,913
It's nothing. Let's go upstairs.

28
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:25,997
Let's go.

29
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:31,169
Slowly and carefully.

30
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:32,337
Careful, now.

31
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:34,964
One, two.

32
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:36,633
One, two.

33
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:01,324
That's me.

34
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:04,661
But why is Bo-geol in the photo too?

35
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:09,832
Who is it?

36
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:16,339
It's me.

37
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:19,842
Let's get out of here.

38
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:22,762
You.

39
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:25,598
You know, don't you?

40
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:28,351
Why are you and Mom there too?

41
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:30,520
Is he my--

42
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:35,733
No.

43
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:38,820
Is he our father?

44
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:43,533
Answer me!

45
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,290
Let's talk once we get out.
I'll explain everything.

46
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:53,835
Everything?

47
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:58,089
Yes, everything.

48
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:31,873
Where the hell is he?

49
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,209
Jung Ki-ho!

50
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:39,380
Where is he?

51
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:49,474
Open up.

52
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:53,686
Open the door!

53
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:55,480
Open up this instant.

54
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:04,238
These rotten brats.

55
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,374
-Father!
-Father!

56
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:18,586
Honey!

57
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:21,255
What's wrong? Let's just talk it out!

58
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,257
Mom!

59
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:25,510
Come here!

60
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:27,136
-Bong-wan!
-Chae-ho!

61
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,222
-Honey, stop it!
-Come here, you brat!

62
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:30,348
Please, don't!

63
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:32,100
Honey, please stop.

64
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:36,354
Your homeroom teacher called, Ki-ho,

65
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:38,481
and said they found this in your locker.

66
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:40,358
How could a cop's son steal money?

67
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:43,277
He didn't steal it. He saved it.
For a birthday gift.

68
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:46,614
He secretly worked part-time
to buy you a birthday gift. Right?

69
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:48,407
I see!

70
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,993
We're so proud of Ki-ho. Right, dear?

71
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,161
Chae-ho!

72
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:55,665
What did I say I hated the most?

73
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:58,876
It was making up ridiculous lies!

74
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,961
Father.

75
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:01,879
I saved up to run away.

76
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:04,215
-What are you talking about?
-That's not true.

77
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:05,299
It's not true.

78
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,051
Run away?

79
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:09,554
I'm a cop.

80
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:12,098
A cop who chases
culprits that steal billions

81
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:14,142
to the ends of the earth to catch them!

82
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,896
You wouldn't exist if it weren't for me.

83
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,440
If it weren't for me,

84
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:24,527
you would've all starved to death
in the streets! If it wasn't for me--

85
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,362
You should've just disappeared!

86
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,451
Then, we would've been happy.

87
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,581
What did you say?

88
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,833
Even if we were in the streets

89
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:41,002
and even if we starved to death,

90
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:43,838
we would've been a lot happier!

91
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,145
Bong-wan!

92
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:03,774
That's when you hurt your head.

93
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:07,111
You were unconscious for quite some time.

94
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:16,162
Are you awake?

95
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:18,789
Do you recognize me?

96
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,793
You'd lost all your memory
when you woke up.

97
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:23,878
It's me. Mom.

98
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:28,549
Mom said it was a gift from God.

99
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:33,596
She said God felt sorry for giving
such a terrible father to a kind boy,

100
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,516
and that's why your memory was erased.

101
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:39,936
She said we should fill up
that empty space with fond memories.

102
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:42,522
That's why everything was fabricated.

103
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,025
My memory, name,

104
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:48,945
and our father.

105
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:52,698
Right.

106
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,368
You all suffered so much just for me.

107
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:57,578
That wasn't necessarily the case.

108
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:03,376
We could forget thanks to you.

109
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:09,840
Because the person who wanted
to erase those days the most wasn't you.

110
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:12,134
It was me.

111
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:17,223
Let's get

112
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,058
our names back.

113
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:20,142
No, we can't.

114
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,061
If Father finds out, he'll look for us--

115
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:23,354
Let him.

116
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:24,605
I dare him to hurt us.

117
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,024
-Woo-hak.
-Listen.

118
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:29,485
We were young back then, so Father--

119
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:31,279
No.

120
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:34,657
So that man could beat us.
But we're adults now.

121
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:36,993
I can handle him on my own.

122
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:40,371
Please don't do this.

123
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:42,873
Why do you keep saying no?
Why must we hide?

124
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:44,917
Let's put him behind bars.

125
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,919
We can get our names back

126
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,921
and tell Mok-ha that we found Ki-ho.

127
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:51,257
-Why can't we do that?
-If we do that…

128
00:09:57,513 --> 00:09:59,348
our entire family will be destroyed.

129
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,021
What do you mean?

130
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:08,566
Ki-ho.

131
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:11,360
How long…

132
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:15,448
can a secret remain a secret?

133
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:26,334
If we cover the secret

134
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:30,212
under layers of lies…

135
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:36,427
can we keep the secret

136
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,388
from surfacing?

137
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:54,403
Goodness. The drought this spring
just won't end.

138
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:04,413
I truly hope

139
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:07,375
this peaceful moment

140
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,002
granted to us by the secret

141
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:12,880
will pass slowly.

142
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:15,883
I hope

143
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:18,427
it will last

144
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,514
for a long time.

145
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:28,229
SECRETS VS. LIES

146
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,416
My goodness!

147
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:32,960
What's wrong?

148
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,592
Gosh.

149
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:42,428
I was dreaming.

150
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,306
What kind of dream?

151
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:47,808
A boar

152
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,686
was chasing me.

153
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:52,563
Really?

154
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:56,233
Do they consider that a pig dream too?

155
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:06,577
Gosh.

156
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:08,996
Mom! Dad!

157
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:11,040
Bo-geol! Let's eat!

158
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,046
Did you make all of this yourself?

159
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:20,216
Yeah. The soup will get cold,
so eat before you shower.

160
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,634
Dad likes a lot of broth.

161
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:24,303
Mom and Bo-geol like
lots of ingredients, right?

162
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:25,596
What's the matter with you?

163
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:28,849
Whatever it is, no.

164
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:31,185
What do you mean?

165
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:34,230
This is unlike yourself.
So it's one of two things.

166
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:37,149
Either you got yourself
in trouble or you're planning to.

167
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,068
My answer is no. No matter what.

168
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:41,820
Come on. Let's just let him. Go ahead.

169
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:42,988
It's okay.

170
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:45,032
I don't know what it is, but it's okay.

171
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:46,617
You can't say yes without knowing.

172
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,370
It's obvious. He got in trouble,
or it's about stocks.

173
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,080
I won't allow it.

174
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:52,957
We're dirt poor.

175
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,959
Let's just hear him out.

176
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:57,044
What is it?

177
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,631
Do you need a lot of money?
You can tell me.

178
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:06,595
I made it for no reason.

179
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,765
I'm just grateful for everything.

180
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:19,567
-Woo-hak.
-When you act all nice,

181
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,026
don't you know you scare us?

182
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:24,572
No, I didn't. I should do better then.

183
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:27,908
Preparing breakfast once
for us won't cut it.

184
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,994
You should clean and do laundry too.

185
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:32,037
And stop buying the same clothes as me.

186
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:35,124
You're really milking it, aren't you?

187
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,003
All right.

188
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,007
Let's eat.

189
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,760
Come in.

190
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:53,225
Where's Woo-hak?

191
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:54,351
He just left.

192
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:00,149
What is it? Are you worried
he really got in trouble?

193
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:02,610
No, that's not why.

194
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:07,907
Yesterday,

195
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:11,452
Mok-ha asked me…

196
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:15,748
if I knew Jung Ki-ho.

197
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,167
What?

198
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:21,754
I must've said something by mistake.

199
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,465
I thought you should know.

200
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:31,055
What if she finds out who we are?

201
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,141
Mom,

202
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,143
do you remember

203
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:39,647
when Mok-ha almost got hurt
at Seoul Station?

204
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:40,731
Yes, I do.

205
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,484
Some bad person followed her there.

206
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:44,652
That was…

207
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,076
Father.

208
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:53,744
Father?

209
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:00,876
That man?

210
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:04,421
How did he know?

211
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:06,924
He must've seen the news.

212
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:18,143
That's why

213
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:20,062
we must protect her.

214
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:22,523
Yes.

215
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:24,608
We should.

216
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,071
Mok-ha wanted

217
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:31,532
to become a singer.

218
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,994
What if he sees her?

219
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:36,787
We can protect her.

220
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:39,665
We can.

221
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:47,339
I just placed the order for your albums.

222
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:53,012
I received pre-orders for the re-release
through the distributor,

223
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:55,180
and the demand is pretty high.

224
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:59,393
Yoon Ran-joo, you've still got it.

225
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,270
Well…

226
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:02,980
I've always had it.

227
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:07,484
They'll be distributed
next week at the earliest.

228
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:12,823
We can estimate the sales
with a "no refund" policy.

229
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:15,409
So I'll keep you updated.

230
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:20,414
You were always so quick
with taking care of business.

231
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:25,419
Just make sure to promote your albums
the best you can once they're released.

232
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:29,548
Seeing as you're stating the obvious,
it's time to hang up.

233
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:32,634
Keep me updated on the number of sales.

234
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:53,322
How may I help you?

235
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:56,784
Is Mok-ha home?

236
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:58,368
Yes.

237
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,262
You met Ki-ho?

238
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,264
Yeah.

239
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,391
You met him?

240
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,561
In person?

241
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:25,813
Yes.

242
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:27,314
He's happily married.

243
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:32,152
He wanted me to thank you
for remembering him.

244
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:34,363
Are you sure it was him?

245
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:40,452
He wanted you to have this.

246
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:41,620
He said you'd know.

247
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:51,046
Here's your music video.

248
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:53,757
It's him, right?

249
00:18:58,387 --> 00:18:59,304
It is

250
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,431
Ki-ho.

251
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:07,062
Did you tell him
his father was looking for him?

252
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:09,106
Yes.

253
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:10,190
He's aware of it.

254
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:13,193
He said don't worry
and just become a singer.

255
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:15,654
He said he'd be rooting for you from afar.

256
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:18,490
From afar?

257
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:20,617
Yes.

258
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:22,119
From afar.

259
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:30,252
You kept talking about Ki-ho,
so I thought he was some great guy.

260
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:32,045
But he was just so-so.

261
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,255
I guess he fell off.

262
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:36,091
Right, you don't know what that means.

263
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,969
It's when someone turns out
to be less than appealing.

264
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:40,721
-That's what it means.
-I understand.

265
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:42,681
I get it.

266
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,017
What?

267
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:47,728
Thanks.

268
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:49,938
I understand now.

269
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:53,650
Sure.

270
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:02,534
Mok-ha!

271
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:08,165
President Hwang said the pre-orders
for my album are off the charts.

272
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:09,249
What?

273
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,376
Is that the song arrangement
for this week?

274
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,544
No.

275
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:15,756
This is my video Ki-ho took
for the fan video contest

276
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:17,633
fifteen years ago.

277
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,760
Goodness. Where did you get it?

278
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:22,721
Woo-hak gave it to me.

279
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:24,723
He said he got it from Ki-ho.

280
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:27,559
Ki-ho? Did he really find Ki-ho?

281
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:33,482
Whether he actually found Ki-ho or not,

282
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:35,734
I'm not really sure.

283
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:38,695
What do you mean?
You said Reporter Kang met him.

284
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:39,821
Where does he live?

285
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:43,367
Apparently, he's married

286
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,452
and living happily somewhere.

287
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,208
I didn't think about that.

288
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:54,461
So that's why he didn't look for you.

289
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:56,838
Ran-joo.

290
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:00,300
Back on Chunsam Island,

291
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:02,803
there was something Ki-ho said to me.

292
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:05,722
He said his mother used to say it to him.

293
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,768
"If you wish for something
with all your heart,

294
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:14,398
one way or another,
it'll come true one day."

295
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,276
"And it'll happen in an unexpected way."

296
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:18,860
Hey.

297
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,445
That's not right.

298
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:23,615
No matter how desperate you are,
you can't love a married man.

299
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:25,784
It'd be a disaster.
It's a terrible thing to do!

300
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:30,872
But Ms. Song from the salon
said the exact same thing.

301
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:37,421
I thought you were planning
on seducing a married man.

302
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:42,092
What? Ms. Song said the same thing?

303
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,637
The same thing Ki-ho's mother used to say?

304
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,142
Is this a coincidence?

305
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:55,814
Woo-hak and Producer Kang were the ones
who found me on the deserted island.

306
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:57,649
And their mother

307
00:21:57,733 --> 00:22:01,778
said the exact same thing
Ki-ho's mother used to always say.

308
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,490
What are the odds of that?

309
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:08,368
If it's not a coincidence,

310
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,454
are you saying

311
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,957
one of them is Ki-ho?

312
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:19,171
That's not very likely.

313
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:22,924
What exactly is the probability

314
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:26,678
of that being likely?

315
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:36,063
REASONS FOR CHANGING ONE'S NAME

316
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:38,982
HOW TO REGISTER FAMILY RELATIONS

317
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:45,822
CHANGING ONE'S IDENTITY

318
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,747
Hey, Kang Woo-hak
with coverage on the Han River.

319
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,041
Yes, sir?

320
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:59,127
A strange car crash occurred there.

321
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:01,838
-Look into it if it's intriguing.
-Yes, sir.

322
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:04,174
What's with you?

323
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:05,675
Sorry?

324
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:07,677
Why are you so obedient?

325
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:09,888
"Get some grunt
to cover those news briefs."

326
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:11,098
"Is it even worth it?"

327
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:12,766
"Why are you only picking on me?"

328
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:14,976
That's what you always say.

329
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,061
No, sir.

330
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:18,647
I should obey my superiors
and do as they say.

331
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,191
Are you sick?

332
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,903
What's wrong? You're making me worried.

333
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:28,198
So this really is how people think me.

334
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:29,908
I should do better then.

335
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:32,661
What kind of crash was it?

336
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:36,289
Hornets don't cause accidents.

337
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:37,457
People do!

338
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:39,918
We're just saying what happened.

339
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:42,087
Hornets got into the car,

340
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:45,298
and he crashed while trying
to shoo them away. That's what we mean.

341
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,343
Are you telling me

342
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:51,805
hornets flew into his car
in the middle of Seoul?

343
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:53,723
It's pretty rare,

344
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:56,351
but it does happen occasionally.

345
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:01,940
Hello. My name's Kang Woo-hak.
I'm a reporter with YGN.

346
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:07,154
Goodness, I'm so glad you're here!

347
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:10,198
Now that there's a reporter present,

348
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,450
why don't you properly explain
what happened?

349
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:14,536
But we already explained everything.

350
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,538
We searched the car and the scene.

351
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:18,623
But we couldn't find the memory card.

352
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:23,044
It seems he drove without one in place.

353
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:25,672
That's exactly what I don't understand.

354
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:30,051
My husband is an insurance broker.

355
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:32,053
He may forget about me, his wife,

356
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:35,348
but he'd never forget to insert
a memory card into his dashcam.

357
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:39,811
Someone deliberately removed it.

358
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:43,440
I'm sure of it!

359
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,861
I'm certain.

360
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:49,696
Who in the world would do that?

361
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:51,907
The one who caused the accident!

362
00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:00,081
On the 4th, at 9:00 p.m.,

363
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:04,628
a man in his 30s was driving through
an underpass in Gangjung-gu, Seoul

364
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:07,756
when the vehicle suddenly lost control
and crashed into a pillar.

365
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:10,717
The driver, Han,

366
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,929
is in critical condition
and has yet to regain consciousness.

367
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:15,305
The police believe

368
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:18,183
Han crashed while he was trying
to chase away hornets

369
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:19,601
that entered the vehicle.

370
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:22,938
They are looking for witnesses
to investigate the cause of the crash.

371
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:25,315
For YGN News, I'm Kang Woo-hak.

372
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:54,135
My eyes fix

373
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:57,055
Upon the blue world

374
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:59,266
Take me

375
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:01,476
Into that dream

376
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:04,437
In every place

377
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:06,731
And in every moment

378
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:11,987
Perhaps I was the one
Who saw you as the light

379
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:14,823
You're in the wind

380
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:17,492
That brushes past me

381
00:26:17,575 --> 00:26:21,121
You envelope me in your blue scent

382
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:26,251
I don't want the blue wind to stop

383
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:28,878
The icon of reclimbing the charts.

384
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:30,088
The legendary diva.

385
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:32,215
Yoon Ran-joo is with us
in the studio today.

386
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:33,133
Welcome.

387
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:35,760
-Thank you for inviting me.
-It's our honor.

388
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:39,264
We get a lot of requests
for your songs these days.

389
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:41,516
The way they're topping
the charts is astounding.

390
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:43,852
You've sold a lot of albums too, right?

391
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:48,648
Yes, I have 40,000 albums left to sell
to reach 20 million in total.

392
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:51,276
-That's what I've heard.
-I see.

393
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,737
At this rate,

394
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,656
I think you'll easily reach
that goal in a month.

395
00:26:57,907 --> 00:27:02,120
I'd be grateful, but the challengers
become more fearsome every week.

396
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:04,664
Goodness, you're too humble.

397
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:10,378
I don't want the blue wind to stop

398
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:15,383
I lit the stars in the night sky for you

399
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:20,180
I just want the time with you, no ends

400
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:25,435
I remember how your gaze embraced me

401
00:27:25,518 --> 00:27:28,021
So you're on Heyday Again.

402
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:30,732
-This week's your fourth challenge, right?
-Yes.

403
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:32,984
Did you hear who your opponent is?

404
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:34,444
No, not yet.

405
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:36,654
I wonder which year
I'll be competing against.

406
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:38,531
I know though.

407
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,867
Really? Which year?

408
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,619
Do you want to watch the preview?

409
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:43,995
I secretly got my hands

410
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:46,039
on this week's preview for Heyday Again.

411
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:47,290
That'd be great.

412
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:48,375
Show me.

413
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:50,043
Here you go.

414
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:52,462
To stop Yoon Ran-joo's
four-week winning streak,

415
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:56,383
an incredible star
has made their way to Heyday Again.

416
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:59,010
What kind of singer do you want to be?

417
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,848
My wish

418
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:07,060
is to become the next Yoon Ran-joo.

419
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:12,690
She was called
"The next Yoon Ran-joo" in 2008.

420
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:16,152
She's the 21st century's top diva
who skyrocketed to fame.

421
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:17,904
Eun Mo-rae!

422
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,575
A match between the legend, Yoon Ran-joo,

423
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:26,246
and Eun Mo-rae,
the top diva of the 21st century.

424
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:29,541
Catch it live on Friday,
April 21, at 9 p.m.

425
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:32,544
on Heyday Again.

426
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:48,268
Eun Mo-rae isn't the top diva
of the 21st century.

427
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:49,352
Exactly!

428
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:52,522
She's just one lucky girl
who received too much success

429
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:54,399
for her character and talent.

430
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:55,984
And how does this make any sense?

431
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:58,153
What's the premise of Heyday Again?

432
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:00,780
"The present you must beat the past you,

433
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:04,409
and then, you'll enjoy another heyday."

434
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:06,494
Exactly. Eun Mo-rae isn't my past self.

435
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,830
Being the next Yoon Ran-joo
doesn't mean she's me.

436
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:10,081
Tell me about it.

437
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:12,792
Why would they change
the show's format just for her?

438
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:14,961
What's so great about her?

439
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:16,921
She is that great.

440
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:18,840
If we can have her on our show,

441
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:20,341
not only can I change the format

442
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:23,136
but also everyone on the show
except for me. Right?

443
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:24,262
-Totally.
-Yes.

444
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:26,806
Yeon-kyung, I would even replace myself.

445
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,266
Don't you agree?

446
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:29,350
What?

447
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:31,853
Yes, you're right.

448
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:37,192
This isn't right.

449
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:38,359
At the very least,

450
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:41,613
you should've asked us
before making this decision.

451
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:44,991
-Goodness.
-Gosh!

452
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:46,743
-Hello.
-Please sit down.

453
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:50,371
Would you like coffee?
We have green tea too.

454
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:53,458
Dong-min, we can't serve
canned coffee to our precious guest.

455
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:54,667
Here. Hurry on.

456
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:56,002
My apologies.

457
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:57,962
What will it be?
Iced Americano? Iced latte?

458
00:29:58,046 --> 00:29:59,547
Iced latte, please.

459
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:00,673
Iced latte.

460
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:03,051
I didn't know you were here.

461
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:04,469
This is great.

462
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:07,222
I thought maybe I had to
meet you separately.

463
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:09,307
We can talk right now.

464
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:22,821
Thank you for making
such a difficult decision.

465
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:24,697
It wasn't that hard.

466
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:28,409
You never suggest things for no reason.

467
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:29,953
Of course, there is a reason.

468
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:32,080
To be honest…

469
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:35,542
"We need to stop Ran-joo
from topping the charts again."

470
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:38,336
"We must protect our shares
and keep control away from her."

471
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:40,004
"We're in the same boat."

472
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:42,924
They're not these simple reasons, right?

473
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,010
But they are.

474
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:50,431
Is that so?

475
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:54,269
How disappointing.

476
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:04,737
But that's your problem, not mine.

477
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:08,157
It's also your problem.

478
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:12,912
Ran-joo wants to help
a rookie become a singer.

479
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:14,664
A rookie?

480
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:16,165
Who is it?

481
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:17,584
Do you remember the name

482
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:19,752
Seo Mok-ha?

483
00:31:23,923 --> 00:31:24,924
Goodness.

484
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:26,509
Here you go.

485
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:27,969
Thank you.

486
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:32,432
Ms. Eun said

487
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:37,395
she would appear on the show
under one condition.

488
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:39,188
What could it be?

489
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:40,982
I'd love to hear what it is.

490
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:44,319
Before I tell you, please keep this quiet.

491
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:45,528
Of course.

492
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:47,030
Should we write up a memorandum?

493
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:49,324
"A compensation
of 300 million won if leaked."

494
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:50,992
You can just give me your word.

495
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:54,704
For the live broadcast,

496
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:56,748
Ms. Eun would like to

497
00:31:57,874 --> 00:31:59,334
sing live lip-sync.

498
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:07,425
Live is live. Lip-syncing is lip-syncing.

499
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:09,636
Those two don't go together.

500
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:11,137
It means you pre-record the song

501
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,306
and lip-sync to it
during the live broadcast.

502
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:15,767
It's understandable.

503
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:19,312
If she makes a mistake while live
because she's nervous…

504
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:23,274
We can't edit a live show,
so why not edit it beforehand?

505
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:24,984
Well…

506
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:29,906
This is unprecedented.

507
00:32:29,989 --> 00:32:33,660
But I think we can do that
since it's Eun Mo-rae.

508
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:34,869
What's your take on this?

509
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:37,246
I'm all for it.

510
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,582
Ms. Eun is a global star.

511
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:40,500
She's right.

512
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:43,336
I believe we should do this
to boost national prestige.

513
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:44,420
That's right.

514
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:47,090
What's your take on this, Producer Kang?

515
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:51,260
I agree with you all.

516
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:55,223
Hold on.

517
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:58,893
One will sing with AR
while the other will do it live.

518
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,979
That's not fair!

519
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:03,189
We should play by the rules.

520
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:04,816
Is that so?

521
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:06,567
Then, should we play by the rules?

522
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:08,861
Fair and square?

523
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:13,741
I got the advantage
of knowing your secret.

524
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:15,994
So why would I waste it in one go?

525
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:24,585
Thank you.

526
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:03,207
I'm a bit afraid.

527
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:05,835
This world is all about balance.

528
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:09,297
We have two superstars on our show,
Yoon Ran-joo and Eun Mo-rae.

529
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:11,507
This means we'll have bad luck too.

530
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:13,718
Jeez, don't jinx it.

531
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:16,429
If this episode flops, it's all on you.

532
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:18,806
Eun Mo-rae will win for sure.

533
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:22,268
Her fan club has 300,000 members,
and on social media,

534
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:23,978
-she has 40 million followers.
-What?

535
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,521
I'm telling you!

536
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:27,607
We can't assume anything.

537
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:31,944
They seem to be archenemies.

538
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:34,322
This episode is going to be a total hit.

539
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:35,782
Let's just hope that's the case.

540
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:39,368
We just need to sit back and enjoy.

541
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:41,079
Why don't we enjoy ourselves already?

542
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:43,164
How about tteokbokki for lunch?
It's on me.

543
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:45,083
No, let's have something light.

544
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:48,669
Knowing that Eun Mo-rae will be
on our show, I'm not even hungry.

545
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:54,133
So could you please give me back my card?

546
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:55,802
You're so cheap.

547
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:58,054
-What?
-Nothing.

548
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:09,982
That trash can is used for venting.

549
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:12,485
I've kicked it a few times too.

550
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:23,329
Why do you keep changing your tune?

551
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:28,626
Whether it's ignoring or comforting me,

552
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:30,211
just stick to one.

553
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:32,505
Stop confusing me.

554
00:35:57,822 --> 00:36:00,074
Based on your throat stroboscopy,

555
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,993
the surgery was a success.

556
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:04,120
Your throat isn't swollen at all.

557
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:06,247
So what's the problem?

558
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,374
That's your job as a doctor.

559
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:15,006
I can't really hit the high notes.

560
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:17,800
It takes too much time
and effort for me to sing.

561
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:22,221
What do you mean? I saw you on TV,
and you hit the high notes just fine.

562
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:24,182
How do I put it?

563
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:27,935
There's a subtle difference
that only I can detect.

564
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:29,729
That's psychological.

565
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:31,689
Everything is fine physically.

566
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:32,899
Psychological?

567
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:35,151
Some people lose their voices

568
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:37,820
when they feel too stressed or pressured.

569
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:41,949
Does your fame stress you out?

570
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,868
I'm not famous.

571
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:47,622
Give me your autograph since you're here.

572
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:49,832
You're so popular nowadays.

573
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:54,003
No one should know I was here.

574
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:55,213
All right.

575
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:57,924
Also, I heard that this time,

576
00:36:58,007 --> 00:36:59,884
you're going up against Eun Mo-rae.

577
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:01,636
-Can you get her autograph--
-Hey!

578
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:06,766
Look, Seong-chan is a fan of hers.

579
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:08,726
He bought 16 of her albums

580
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:10,811
to collect her photocards.

581
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:13,314
Seong-chan is so foolish.

582
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:15,942
You know her albums
are wrapped in PVC, right?

583
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:17,276
They're not recyclable.

584
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:19,195
He's still a kid.

585
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:22,406
He and the other fans
are going to choose her

586
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:23,908
in the upcoming voting.

587
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:25,409
What a commotion.

588
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:29,956
I am stressed indeed.

589
00:37:31,457 --> 00:37:33,125
It already feels stifling.

590
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:03,364
This is ridiculous.

591
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:06,409
You want me to release
a digital single instead of an album?

592
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:09,829
We'll start off with digital singles.

593
00:38:09,912 --> 00:38:11,914
We'll later put them into an album--

594
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:13,374
Don't fool me with your words.

595
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:16,294
That nobody Mo-rae's releasing one,
so why aren't we releasing mine?

596
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:20,589
-It's not that we aren't. We can't.
-"We can't"?

597
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:23,551
We invested two billion won
into your album last year,

598
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:25,094
and we lost of 1.1 billion.

599
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:28,764
We spent 90 million on Mo-rae's single
and profited 1.2 billion.

600
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:30,766
What would you do if you were me?

601
00:38:31,517 --> 00:38:33,644
You've been evaluating me
based on numbers?

602
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:36,564
If I had, I wouldn't have released
your 16th album!

603
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:39,442
We've been suffering a loss
since your 15th album!

604
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:47,283
This is as far as my loyalty goes.

605
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:49,618
You should thank Mo-rae

606
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:53,414
for helping you at least release
your digital single.

607
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:57,626
You're no longer
RJ Entertainment's cash cow.

608
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,422
It's the nobody Mo-rae.

609
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:10,473
I asked you for too many autographs.

610
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:12,767
I'm sorry. You must be tired.

611
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,143
Not at all.

612
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:19,023
Please let me know if you need more.

613
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:20,107
Thanks.

614
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:25,237
I heard you'll be competing
against Ran-joo on Heyday Again.

615
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:27,156
Competing?

616
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:29,116
That's too harsh.

617
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:30,868
It's just us here.

618
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:32,703
What will you be singing?

619
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:37,458
Isn't that Yoon Ran-joo's debut song?

620
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:39,877
Yes.

621
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:42,338
I really loved

622
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:45,257
that song.

623
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:50,262
I still love you

624
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:53,140
I think I know now

625
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:54,642
What do you think?

626
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:57,436
She's not as good as Seo Mok-ha,

627
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,854
but she's not bad.

628
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:01,690
What did you say?

629
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:04,151
I want to do a remake

630
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:06,821
of your debut song, "Open Your Eyes."

631
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:09,532
Don't. Choose some other song.

632
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:13,494
I'm even thinking
about making it my lead single.

633
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:16,205
Don't you have any self-respect?

634
00:40:16,288 --> 00:40:18,541
Why would you use
my song as your lead single?

635
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:22,670
Well…

636
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:25,005
I just want to be like you

637
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:26,424
and follow your steps--

638
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:28,342
Follow my steps? You're already ahead.

639
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:29,427
Ran-joo.

640
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:30,678
It's true.

641
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:31,887
She's the cash cow

642
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:33,389
of our agency.

643
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:37,268
Forget it.

644
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,353
I'm against it too.

645
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:42,815
It's your first album.
Let's go with an original song.

646
00:40:48,904 --> 00:40:49,905
Hold on.

647
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:54,410
Why do you dislike me?

648
00:40:54,493 --> 00:40:55,911
It's not that I dislike you.

649
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:57,746
You just don't suit that song.

650
00:41:00,332 --> 00:41:01,834
Then, who does?

651
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:03,544
Maybe Seo Mok-ha?

652
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:05,129
Why are you bringing her up?

653
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:07,089
You said I was her substitute.

654
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:09,049
I did? When?

655
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:13,387
You never said it outright.

656
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,931
But you said it with your eyes
thousands of times.

657
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:19,393
"She's not as good as Seo Mok-ha."

658
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:22,938
"She won't do
since she's just Seo Mok-ha's substitute."

659
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:27,568
I don't suit your song,
because I'm her substitute.

660
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:30,029
But it suits Mok-ha!

661
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:34,158
Right?

662
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:37,912
Yeah.

663
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:39,747
Now that I think of it,

664
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:42,082
I think she'll fit the song.

665
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:51,759
What do you think? Do you like it?

666
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:54,595
Goodness.

667
00:41:57,932 --> 00:41:59,433
How refreshing.

668
00:42:01,393 --> 00:42:02,520
You're the best.

669
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:05,022
Ms. Cha.

670
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:07,149
Will you do my makeup for the live show?

671
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:08,567
You bet.

672
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,758
Are you done cleaning up?

673
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:34,677
I just need to throw this away.

674
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,012
Let me throw it away for you.

675
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:39,223
-But--
-It's heavy.

676
00:42:39,306 --> 00:42:41,850
-Thank you.
-Can you take a seat here?

677
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:43,227
Sure.

678
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:51,235
I've worked
with countless people in the past.

679
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:52,486
But I've never seen anyone

680
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:55,739
as dexterous and smart as you.

681
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:57,283
Goodness.

682
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:59,159
Thank you.

683
00:42:59,785 --> 00:43:00,869
I'm home.

684
00:43:01,453 --> 00:43:02,621
Did you have dinner?

685
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:03,831
Yes, I did.

686
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:05,541
Can you take down the blankets?

687
00:43:05,624 --> 00:43:06,917
I completely forgot.

688
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:08,002
Okay.

689
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:12,506
You're a bright girl.

690
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:15,926
I know you can become
a hairdresser if you study hard.

691
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:19,805
I know you want to become a singer,

692
00:43:19,888 --> 00:43:21,181
but I'm sure you know.

693
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:23,892
They don't give people
your age a chance that easily.

694
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:26,270
They almost never do.

695
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:29,607
But…

696
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:32,693
You were rooting for me

697
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:35,070
up until recently.

698
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:39,325
You said I'd be a singer one day
if I wished for it with all my heart.

699
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:41,035
Well, you know.

700
00:43:42,077 --> 00:43:43,954
We easily root for strangers.

701
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:46,457
But we become realistic
when they become close to us.

702
00:43:47,082 --> 00:43:49,126
I care about you much more now.

703
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:51,003
Do you understand?

704
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:54,006
There's no age limit for hairdressers.

705
00:43:54,089 --> 00:43:56,008
And you can start late too.

706
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:58,802
I started way past 30 and look at me.

707
00:43:59,428 --> 00:44:01,930
I was able to run
my own salon in ten years.

708
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:17,029
Forget what she said

709
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:19,239
about becoming a hairdresser.

710
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:25,579
You're definitely not him.

711
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:28,832
What?

712
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:34,672
You see,

713
00:44:36,131 --> 00:44:37,466
up until recently,

714
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:42,179
I thought you could've been Ki-ho.

715
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:46,100
But looking at your eyes,

716
00:44:46,725 --> 00:44:47,726
I know for sure now.

717
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:50,521
You're definitely not

718
00:44:51,146 --> 00:44:53,148
Jung Ki-ho.

719
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:57,027
That's right. I'm not him.

720
00:45:02,991 --> 00:45:04,493
But why not?

721
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:10,874
I'm not trying to argue or anything.

722
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:12,376
I'm just…

723
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:14,420
I'm just curious.

724
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:15,921
How did his eyes look?

725
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,385
Then, I'll leave this island

726
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:23,679
with you.

727
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:27,182
He was unwavering and determined.

728
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:32,396
He had a strong and reliable gaze.

729
00:45:33,605 --> 00:45:35,983
I could rely on him.

730
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:40,404
Are you saying I seem weak and unreliable?

731
00:45:41,613 --> 00:45:42,614
That's right.

732
00:45:43,115 --> 00:45:45,868
You're wishy-washy and confusing.

733
00:45:45,951 --> 00:45:49,204
You're a mutt crying in front of a puddle,
not knowing what to do.

734
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:51,373
You're weak and pathetic.

735
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:54,209
At times, it feels like you're on my side.

736
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:56,962
Then, you suddenly act so distant.

737
00:45:57,045 --> 00:45:59,715
At times, you say what's on your mind.

738
00:45:59,798 --> 00:46:02,217
Then, you suddenly become
a tight-lipped coward.

739
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:05,053
I have no idea what you're thinking about.

740
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:06,555
You talk very well.

741
00:46:06,638 --> 00:46:07,848
Did you just realize that?

742
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:10,642
Then, why didn't you say anything
to Park Yong-gwan?

743
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:15,022
He was obviously being unfair,
so why didn't you confront him?

744
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:16,899
That was because…

745
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:23,155
I had my reason.

746
00:46:23,238 --> 00:46:24,114
What reason?

747
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:26,116
An unavoidable reason.

748
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,367
I can't tell you.

749
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:29,328
Is that so?

750
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:32,664
I also have one. An unavoidable reason.

751
00:46:34,833 --> 00:46:36,001
Goodness.

752
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:41,006
BROTHERS SALON

753
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:57,689
Why do you keep saying no?
Why must we hide?

754
00:46:57,773 --> 00:46:59,525
We can get our names back

755
00:46:59,608 --> 00:47:01,735
and tell Mok-ha that we found Ki-ho.

756
00:47:01,818 --> 00:47:03,904
-Why can't we do that?
-If we do that…

757
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:10,619
our entire family will be destroyed.

758
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,163
What do you mean?

759
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:18,835
What is it?

760
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:21,547
Did we start anew
because we did something bad?

761
00:47:24,132 --> 00:47:25,884
We had no other choice.

762
00:47:27,302 --> 00:47:28,262
We do have other choices.

763
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:30,681
We'll change our names
and social security numbers.

764
00:47:30,764 --> 00:47:32,849
The law will protect us.

765
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:35,686
There was no law like that back then.

766
00:47:37,437 --> 00:47:38,689
No matter what we did,

767
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:42,776
he could find us back then
just for being our father.

768
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:52,119
Young-ju, it's me.

769
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:54,288
I just met with Ki-ho's father.

770
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:57,958
I'm afraid he'll reach out to Mok-ha
just to find Ki-ho. What do we do?

771
00:47:58,041 --> 00:48:00,627
Do you think
we should tell Ki-ho about this?

772
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:02,546
Why is he so determined to find him?

773
00:48:02,629 --> 00:48:04,256
He's already moved on and happy.

774
00:48:06,174 --> 00:48:07,676
He's moved on and happy?

775
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:15,267
What should we do?

776
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:18,312
Shouldn't we reach out
to Mok-ha and let her know?

777
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:25,170
HAIRDRESSER EXAMS 101

778
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:04,543
You're still awake?

779
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:06,086
Yes.

780
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:09,673
Have you suddenly become Ran-joo's fan?

781
00:50:09,756 --> 00:50:12,092
I've been playing this song on repeat.

782
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:14,094
It makes me happy when I hear it.

783
00:50:14,177 --> 00:50:15,178
Care to listen?

784
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:17,931
Sure.

785
00:50:21,893 --> 00:50:22,894
So…

786
00:50:23,395 --> 00:50:25,814
How does her voice sound compared to mine?

787
00:50:28,608 --> 00:50:31,611
Do you need some comfort or honesty?

788
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:33,697
The latter.

789
00:50:34,406 --> 00:50:36,241
She's definitely a singer.

790
00:50:36,324 --> 00:50:38,243
I feel her emotions through her voice.

791
00:50:40,412 --> 00:50:43,373
Are you saying my voice
doesn't have any emotions?

792
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:45,375
It does.

793
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:47,669
But experience is something you gain.

794
00:50:47,753 --> 00:50:50,046
Ran-joo sounds different
from her past self too.

795
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:51,339
That's experience.

796
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:53,091
Is that so?

797
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:55,385
In that case,

798
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:57,387
will I be able to sing like her

799
00:50:57,929 --> 00:50:59,097
once I gain some experience?

800
00:50:59,181 --> 00:51:00,390
Of course.

801
00:51:01,016 --> 00:51:04,019
You don't need a lot either.
It's a very fine difference in skill.

802
00:51:04,102 --> 00:51:06,730
I can tell the difference,
but most people can't.

803
00:51:12,694 --> 00:51:14,321
You have an odd way…

804
00:51:16,782 --> 00:51:18,116
of comforting others.

805
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,201
Is that so?

806
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:21,828
This song will make you feel even better.

807
00:51:22,954 --> 00:51:26,124
I want to fill up your crystal heart

808
00:51:30,378 --> 00:51:32,589
I'll follow you as my light

809
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:35,550
You're gonna be my universe

810
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:38,136
You sound pretty similar.

811
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:39,805
You're gaining experience.

812
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:45,685
Don't worry
I won't resent you

813
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:48,021
Once we walk side by side

814
00:51:48,814 --> 00:51:52,901
I'll confess my love for you

815
00:51:52,984 --> 00:51:57,948
I don't want the blue wind to stop

816
00:51:59,115 --> 00:52:03,036
I lit the stars in the night sky for you

817
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:07,916
I just want the time with you, no ends

818
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:13,547
I remember how your gaze embraced me

819
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:20,887
Beautiful teardrops

820
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:24,307
I want to fill up your crystal heart

821
00:52:28,603 --> 00:52:30,689
I'll follow you as my light

822
00:52:30,772 --> 00:52:34,860
You're gonna be my universe

823
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:01,011
What are you doing?

824
00:53:01,761 --> 00:53:03,513
Practicing self-affirmations.

825
00:53:03,597 --> 00:53:05,307
I'm a wave.

826
00:53:06,182 --> 00:53:09,686
I'm a humongous wave
that'll sweep Eun Mo-rae away.

827
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:16,109
Sit down and try it.

828
00:53:16,192 --> 00:53:18,194
It may seem corny, but it really works.

829
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:21,197
Sit down

830
00:53:21,698 --> 00:53:23,116
and close your eyes.

831
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,827
Tell yourself that you're strong

832
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:28,872
and that your opponent is weak.

833
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:31,791
I'm a wave.

834
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:38,256
I'm Seo Mok-ha from a deserted island.

835
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:44,512
Eun Mo-rae is the boar that found its way

836
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:47,140
onto the deserted island.

837
00:53:48,141 --> 00:53:50,644
What? I thought that was just a dream.

838
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:07,661
YOU ARE MY FUTURE

839
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:09,412
MO-RAE, YOU SHINE BRIGHTLY

840
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:10,497
MO-RAET'S GO!

841
00:54:20,006 --> 00:54:20,924
Bo-geol!

842
00:54:21,007 --> 00:54:23,760
Where's Yeon-kyung?
There's a meeting with the camera staff.

843
00:54:23,843 --> 00:54:25,178
She's not picking up.

844
00:54:27,055 --> 00:54:28,264
Hello? Yeon-kyung?

845
00:54:31,017 --> 00:54:32,018
Who is this?

846
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:35,355
What? An ambulance?

847
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:37,232
What? What do you mean?

848
00:54:38,566 --> 00:54:39,985
They said her appendix burst.

849
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:43,071
How is she right now?

850
00:54:43,154 --> 00:54:45,365
The patient is on her way to the hospital

851
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:46,866
and can't pick up the phone.

852
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:48,201
I can. Let me see it.

853
00:54:48,284 --> 00:54:50,203
-Sure.
-I can talk.

854
00:54:52,706 --> 00:54:53,957
Who is this?

855
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:55,208
Hey, Producer Kang.

856
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:56,918
Take charge

857
00:54:58,003 --> 00:54:59,462
of today's show.

858
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:03,633
Make sure to cater to Eun Mo-rae.

859
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:06,594
Hey, I'm the executive producer.

860
00:55:06,678 --> 00:55:07,846
If you leave out

861
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:10,557
my name in the credits, you're dead…

862
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:12,726
-I'm dying here.
-Okay.

863
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:14,102
I won't.

864
00:55:14,185 --> 00:55:16,146
Don't worry about us. Bye.

865
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:20,942
I knew things were looking up
too much for her lately.

866
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:22,569
I'll be in the monitoring room.

867
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:24,154
Send me the filming plans.

868
00:55:24,237 --> 00:55:25,238
All right.

869
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:27,657
Good luck.

870
00:55:45,091 --> 00:55:47,594
Her fans are just like her.

871
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:50,346
They're so extreme and lack manners.

872
00:55:51,556 --> 00:55:53,892
How am I supposed to walk through them?

873
00:55:53,975 --> 00:55:56,770
Should we just go
to the basement parking lot?

874
00:55:57,979 --> 00:55:58,980
Should we do that?

875
00:56:03,109 --> 00:56:05,570
You're filming today, right? Good luck.

876
00:56:05,653 --> 00:56:07,405
We have 30,000 more albums to go.

877
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:14,871
I'm a wave.

878
00:56:21,294 --> 00:56:22,879
I'll just cut through them.

879
00:56:22,962 --> 00:56:23,963
Okay.

880
00:56:30,178 --> 00:56:31,471
I'm a wave.

881
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:36,768
It's Yoon Ran-joo!

882
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:40,105
Hello.

883
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:42,107
You're so pretty.

884
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:44,234
You're so pretty, Ran-joo.

885
00:56:45,026 --> 00:56:46,611
You're still in your heyday.

886
00:56:47,612 --> 00:56:48,863
-Hello.
-Hello.

887
00:56:48,947 --> 00:56:51,449
Long time no see, Ran-joo. Go on in.

888
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:53,910
Ran-joo, you're the best!

889
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:55,745
You can do it!

890
00:56:58,081 --> 00:56:59,374
You're the best!

891
00:57:01,459 --> 00:57:02,877
I love your latest song.

892
00:57:02,961 --> 00:57:04,379
You're the best, Ran-joo!

893
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:16,724
I'll go now.

894
00:57:16,808 --> 00:57:17,809
Hold on.

895
00:57:18,476 --> 00:57:20,103
Ran-joo is still posing.

896
00:57:21,312 --> 00:57:22,439
Exactly.

897
00:57:51,342 --> 00:57:53,178
-Eun Mo-rae!
-Eun Mo-rae!

898
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:56,181
-Eun Mo-rae!
-Eun Mo-rae!

899
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:57,265
I'm sorry.

900
00:57:58,183 --> 00:58:00,059
I arrived too early, didn't I?

901
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:02,061
I should've come out after you went in.

902
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:03,146
I know.

903
00:58:03,688 --> 00:58:04,689
You're too early,

904
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:06,733
and she's too late.

905
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:13,072
Why are you guys so horrible with timing?

906
00:58:13,823 --> 00:58:16,576
-Yes, Ran-joo?
-Say hello. This is Eun Mo-rae.

907
00:58:17,285 --> 00:58:18,411
She's Seo Mok-ha.

908
00:58:25,126 --> 00:58:26,127
Ms. Seo Mok-ha.

909
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:29,797
Hello.

910
00:58:32,217 --> 00:58:33,760
Hello. It's nice to meet you.

911
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:36,095
You should thank her
instead of greeting her.

912
00:58:36,554 --> 00:58:38,723
If she'd come on time,
you wouldn't be here.

913
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:44,729
Smile. They're taking photos of you.

914
00:59:08,586 --> 00:59:10,588
Eun Mo-rae edited her voice quite a bit.

915
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:21,224
No one can beat this.

916
00:59:21,307 --> 00:59:22,976
Not even Mariah Carey.

917
00:59:26,688 --> 00:59:27,689
Bo-geol.

918
00:59:28,314 --> 00:59:30,650
We just checked
Eun Mo-rae's live lip-sync file.

919
00:59:31,609 --> 00:59:33,570
Shouldn't both contestants come

920
00:59:33,653 --> 00:59:35,196
to the projection room and check?

921
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:36,781
Okay, I'll go up now.

922
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:51,462
Goodness.

923
00:59:51,546 --> 00:59:55,174
I must've gone
to the wrong room. I'm sorry.

924
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:56,551
Ms. Seo.

925
01:00:03,725 --> 01:00:05,393
What is it?

926
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:07,812
I was always curious.

927
01:00:08,479 --> 01:00:10,690
Do you also agree with Ran-joo?

928
01:00:11,691 --> 01:00:13,610
About what?

929
01:00:13,693 --> 01:00:16,613
About that fan video contest 15 years ago.

930
01:00:17,572 --> 01:00:21,701
Had you come on time,
you would've taken my spot.

931
01:00:25,079 --> 01:00:27,749
Do you think it was that easy
for me to become a star?

932
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:49,729
I'm Seo Mok-ha from a deserted island.

933
01:00:51,397 --> 01:00:55,360
Eun Mo-rae is the boar that found its way

934
01:00:56,027 --> 01:00:57,320
onto the deserted island.

935
01:00:59,238 --> 01:01:01,824
What? I thought that was just a dream.

936
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:09,499
No.

937
01:01:09,999 --> 01:01:11,334
Goodness.

938
01:01:11,918 --> 01:01:14,087
So you were on that island with a boar?

939
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:15,296
How did you run away?

940
01:01:24,055 --> 01:01:27,016
There was no place I could run away to.

941
01:01:28,101 --> 01:01:29,185
Then, what did you do?

942
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:44,867
Running away isn't always the best option.

943
01:01:47,453 --> 01:01:49,080
So I…

944
01:02:12,645 --> 01:02:13,771
just caught it.

945
01:02:18,151 --> 01:02:19,318
Why aren't you answering me?

946
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:22,989
Do you think it was that easy for me?

947
01:02:26,075 --> 01:02:27,535
Of course not.

948
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:29,746
However,

949
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:33,374
you do seem

950
01:02:34,667 --> 01:02:36,335
extremely anxious.

951
01:02:37,378 --> 01:02:39,380
Me? Anxious?

952
01:02:39,464 --> 01:02:41,215
If you were confident,

953
01:02:41,299 --> 01:02:43,217
you wouldn't use a cheap trick

954
01:02:43,301 --> 01:02:44,302
like live lip-syncing.

955
01:02:45,636 --> 01:02:46,637
Don't you agree?

956
01:02:46,721 --> 01:02:47,764
Seo Mok-ha!

957
01:02:49,724 --> 01:02:50,767
You must be insane.

958
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:53,895
No, I'm not.
I'm finally thinking straight!

959
01:02:54,729 --> 01:02:59,066
If you sing live and beat Ran-joo today,

960
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:01,611
then I'll acknowledge it.

961
01:03:01,694 --> 01:03:04,697
"I wouldn't have been able
to take her spot

962
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:07,200
even if I had come on time."

963
01:03:08,367 --> 01:03:11,329
I'll accept it right away.

964
01:03:11,412 --> 01:03:13,956
-How dare you talk--
-Can Ms. Eun and Ms. Yoon

965
01:03:14,499 --> 01:03:16,334
come to the projection room, please?

966
01:03:26,093 --> 01:03:28,137
BROTHERS SALON

967
01:04:09,887 --> 01:04:12,014
Goodness. Thank you.

968
01:04:12,098 --> 01:04:13,933
What? Woo-hak!

969
01:04:15,142 --> 01:04:17,395
Please don't tell your mom, okay?

970
01:04:17,478 --> 01:04:19,063
I smoke every now and then too.

971
01:04:19,146 --> 01:04:20,690
Not me.

972
01:04:20,773 --> 01:04:22,191
It's my first time in a year.

973
01:04:22,275 --> 01:04:24,318
All right. I won't tell her.

974
01:04:28,781 --> 01:04:29,782
But Dad.

975
01:04:30,283 --> 01:04:31,284
What?

976
01:04:31,367 --> 01:04:32,493
I have a favor to ask.

977
01:04:32,577 --> 01:04:33,786
Sure. I'm all ears.

978
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:36,414
Do you need money?
Is there something you want to buy?

979
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:38,624
-Dad.
-Yes?

980
01:04:40,585 --> 01:04:41,919
I've regained my memory.

981
01:04:43,421 --> 01:04:44,422
What?

982
01:04:45,298 --> 01:04:46,299
So…

983
01:04:47,091 --> 01:04:48,342
please be honest with me.

984
01:05:10,573 --> 01:05:12,658
Do you think Ms. Yoon will win today?

985
01:05:14,035 --> 01:05:16,829
I don't think so. I know she'll win.

986
01:05:17,955 --> 01:05:19,165
You're certain.

987
01:05:19,248 --> 01:05:22,793
That's right.
I prefer things to be black and white.

988
01:05:24,003 --> 01:05:25,004
Me too.

989
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:37,016
No, Ran-joo.

990
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:45,149
By the way, where's Yeon-kyung?

991
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:46,943
Well…

992
01:05:47,026 --> 01:05:48,527
She called in sick,

993
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:50,363
so I'll be directing the show today.

994
01:05:50,446 --> 01:05:51,530
I see.

995
01:05:52,073 --> 01:05:53,991
I look forward to working together.

996
01:05:54,075 --> 01:05:56,577
Did Producer Hong keep you up to date?

997
01:05:56,661 --> 01:05:59,455
Yes. She told me to cater to you.

998
01:06:00,498 --> 01:06:02,083
Does that mean this script

999
01:06:02,166 --> 01:06:04,502
is based on our live lip-sync?

1000
01:06:05,127 --> 01:06:06,379
Correct.

1001
01:06:16,681 --> 01:06:19,350
Your parts will be based
on this script. However…

1002
01:06:22,186 --> 01:06:23,562
you'll both perform live.

1003
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:29,443
Producer Kang.

1004
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:37,201
I know our names are fake.

1005
01:06:37,910 --> 01:06:39,704
So tell me how we got them.

1006
01:06:39,787 --> 01:06:40,788
Hey.

1007
01:06:41,747 --> 01:06:43,207
Who said they were fake?

1008
01:06:43,290 --> 01:06:45,126
They're our real names.

1009
01:06:45,918 --> 01:06:47,753
They really are.

1010
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:49,505
You're my biological child.

1011
01:06:50,673 --> 01:06:52,258
You're my son, okay?

1012
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:56,929
I know you had no choice. So please.

1013
01:06:58,347 --> 01:06:59,932
Please tell me the truth.

1014
01:07:02,018 --> 01:07:03,686
I'm a reporter, Dad.

1015
01:07:16,073 --> 01:07:19,535
Let's say you had
no choice but to lip-sync.

1016
01:07:20,161 --> 01:07:22,079
And I understand that you want

1017
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:23,998
to show your best side to your fans.

1018
01:07:25,041 --> 01:07:26,208
But this is a contest.

1019
01:07:26,834 --> 01:07:30,671
It's not fair for one side to sing live
and the other to lip-sync.

1020
01:07:32,923 --> 01:07:34,091
What is this?

1021
01:07:34,175 --> 01:07:36,844
We already talked this through
with Producer Hong.

1022
01:07:36,927 --> 01:07:39,138
I'm the producer in charge today.

1023
01:07:43,476 --> 01:07:45,561
Are you a some kind of thug or what?

1024
01:07:46,645 --> 01:07:48,022
What are you doing?

1025
01:07:53,277 --> 01:07:54,278
I'm out.

1026
01:07:55,529 --> 01:07:56,697
Wait, Mo-rae!

1027
01:08:01,202 --> 01:08:02,286
Look, Producer Kang!

1028
01:08:02,369 --> 01:08:04,205
There are a lot of reporters outside.

1029
01:08:05,623 --> 01:08:08,584
I'll have to explain to them
why Ms. Eun won't be appearing.

1030
01:08:09,168 --> 01:08:10,169
What should I say?

1031
01:08:11,337 --> 01:08:14,590
Should I be honest and say
she wasn't confident enough to sing live?

1032
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:17,718
Since we're talking about being fair,

1033
01:08:18,511 --> 01:08:20,221
those two are--

1034
01:08:20,304 --> 01:08:21,430
Yes, you two.

1035
01:08:21,931 --> 01:08:24,391
I won't allow you to lip-sync.

1036
01:08:30,397 --> 01:08:34,068
What? Hold on. Lip-sync?

1037
01:08:34,151 --> 01:08:35,903
I have never lip-synced--

1038
01:08:47,873 --> 01:08:49,208
Enough with the lies now.

1039
01:08:50,501 --> 01:08:52,962
I get you had good intentions
and no other choice.

1040
01:08:53,045 --> 01:08:54,463
But a lie is a lie.

1041
01:08:55,756 --> 01:08:57,174
If you keep it up,

1042
01:08:57,675 --> 01:09:00,386
your weakness will grow
and you'll have to stay silent.

1043
01:09:01,929 --> 01:09:03,931
And eventually, it'll be out of control.

1044
01:09:09,311 --> 01:09:12,773
So if Ms. Yoon wins this match…

1045
01:09:19,572 --> 01:09:21,532
I want you to go up on stage, Ms. Seo.

1046
01:09:28,664 --> 01:09:32,084
Go up and be honest

1047
01:09:32,626 --> 01:09:34,837
about who has been singing

1048
01:09:36,297 --> 01:09:37,298
all this time.

1049
01:10:00,821 --> 01:10:03,782
CASTAWAY DIVA

1050
01:10:39,610 --> 01:10:42,321
What do you think we should do?

1051
01:10:42,404 --> 01:10:44,782
You have a knack for turning
an opportunity into a risk.

1052
01:10:44,865 --> 01:10:47,368
You can turn it back into an opportunity.

1053
01:10:48,035 --> 01:10:51,121
I'm pretty much rolling out
the red carpet for Seo Mok-ha's debut.

1054
01:10:51,205 --> 01:10:54,375
I have something
to apologize to the viewers for.

1055
01:10:54,458 --> 01:10:55,459
I'll never steal your stage.

1056
01:10:55,542 --> 01:10:58,462
Today is your stage, not mine.

1057
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:02,258
-Without any worries or concerns.
-Has this ever happened to you?

1058
01:11:02,341 --> 01:11:05,344
When your heart is about to burst
just by thinking about something?

1059
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:07,888
I'll begin now. Get ready.

1060
01:11:08,389 --> 01:11:09,431
Action.

1061
01:11:11,976 --> 01:11:13,852
