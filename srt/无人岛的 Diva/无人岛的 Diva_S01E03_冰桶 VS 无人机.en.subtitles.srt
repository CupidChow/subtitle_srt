00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,971
CASTAWAY DIVA

2
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:47,328
COOLER BOX VS. DRONE

3
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:50,540
What resource stands out
the most in the 21st century?

4
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:52,166
-Petroleum?
-Petroleum.

5
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,251
"Petroleum"?

6
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:54,335
-Food?
-Food.

7
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:57,755
Sure, they're important too.

8
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,550
But those resources
have always been around.

9
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:03,261
This resource is intangible.

10
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:05,221
Attention?

11
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:06,723
"Attention."

12
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,599
Attention is expensive.

13
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,896
Attention can earn you money.

14
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:17,275
The more followers on social media
and views on YouTube you get,

15
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:18,484
the more albums you sell.

16
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:21,904
The industry based on this very attention

17
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,615
is the entertainment industry.

18
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:29,245
ARTIST

19
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:34,375
The problem is attention
is limited like any other resource.

20
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:39,714
It moves around
and disappears after some time.

21
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:43,301
To my dear beloved fans,

22
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,512
I trust that you'll forgive me

23
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,265
for making such a foolish decision.

24
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:52,935
Once bright and shining,

25
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:56,981
I'm going to end my now weary life.

26
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:02,320
Most people want to see
a bud bloom into a flower.

27
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:05,281
They lose interest once it withers.

28
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,367
Then, what should
an entertainment agency do?

29
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:09,744
LAP BLANKET

30
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:13,790
That's right. It needs to plant
the next seeds before the flower withers.

31
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:18,002
Discovering the next resource
based on an artist in their prime…

32
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:21,047
Honing this process

33
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,966
is the core driving force
that will sustain an agency.

34
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,261
We at RJ Entertainment
have successfully mastered this.

35
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,138
And without any investment,

36
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,724
we've grown up to this point
solely based on our sales.

37
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:34,227
RJ Entertainment is preparing to take

38
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,479
a new leap forward
in this era of globalization.

39
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:39,440
To aid us in this new leap forward,

40
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:45,363
we will now reveal
our newly rebranded corporate identity.

41
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:05,424
Your call cannot be connected.
You will be redirected to voicemail--

42
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,158
Great work, sir.

43
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:31,367
You too.

44
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,458
LAP BLANKET

45
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:45,506
Did you read everything?

46
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:50,845
Can you tell the PR team
to check for any typos?

47
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:55,600
I don't want to be humiliated
by typos just before I die.

48
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:57,768
What is it this time?

49
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:00,188
I mean…

50
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:03,858
This is what the rice cooker
said to me this morning.

51
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:06,986
"Your delicious rice is now ready to eat."

52
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:11,115
Even the rice cooker can do its job,
so what does that make me?

53
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:13,868
I'm a singer with no gigs.

54
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:15,495
I have an empty schedule.

55
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:19,207
So what's the point in living
if I'm worth less than a rice cooker?

56
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:23,044
I'd rather go viral
and go down in a blaze of glory.

57
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,255
That's why I wrote my note before I died.

58
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,632
You won't go viral.

59
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:28,841
Election coverage will bury it.

60
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:31,719
I'll tell our people
to find you some gigs.

61
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:33,137
Gigs?

62
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:35,097
TV shows will be difficult,

63
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,307
so maybe local events.

64
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,059
President Lee!

65
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:42,021
I can't believe you!
You want me to do local events again?

66
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,482
People online still ridicule me by posting

67
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:49,487
that photo of me singing to two people
at that marinated crab event!

68
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,447
You want another photo like that?

69
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,658
Are you trying
to make me look like a fool?

70
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,868
-Ran-joo.
-Jeez.

71
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:57,537
I heard you live in a semi-basement.

72
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,832
Who told you that?

73
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,960
The head of the fan club contacted--

74
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,346
Did you tell President Lee?

75
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,224
Yes, we did.

76
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:21,060
Your rent is overdue,
the deposit has run out,

77
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:22,853
and you're not working at all.

78
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:24,939
I sent him an e-mail out of frustration.

79
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:27,858
"Washed-up artists appear on TV
all the time nowadays."

80
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:30,236
"Put her on a talk show
or a reality show."

81
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:31,612
Hey!

82
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:35,533
What did you guys say when I said
I wanted to be on a reality show?

83
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:38,953
"You need to remain mysterious, Ran-joo."

84
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:40,621
And when it came to talk shows,

85
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:43,708
you said, "They'll ridicule you
for any foolish things you say."

86
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,960
Are you my fans or in-laws?

87
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:48,296
And what are you saying now?

88
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:50,673
-That I should take any gig?
-I mean…

89
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:53,426
We didn't know you'd be this jobless.

90
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:54,385
She's right.

91
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:55,469
Come on, guys!

92
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:58,264
You said you met at my fan club.

93
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:01,434
You said you got married
and had your daughter thanks to me.

94
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:04,478
You said you loved me.
How could you have a change of heart?

95
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:07,440
Ran-joo.
We stayed by your side until the end.

96
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:09,734
He put all the mean comments in a PDF file

97
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:11,611
and sent it to your agency.

98
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,863
And she protected your fan club

99
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:14,947
until the end.

100
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,533
We didn't change.

101
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:19,535
You did.

102
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,038
We can't do this anymore.

103
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,540
-We quit being your fans.
-We quit.

104
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:27,918
Please move out
if you can't pay rent right away.

105
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:29,420
-Let's go.
-Okay.

106
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:31,631
Gosh. Guys.

107
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:33,424
Don't come in.

108
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:34,508
Hey.

109
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:43,059
You're the best, President Lee.

110
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,686
You got me a gig despite being busy.

111
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:46,771
Thank you.

112
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:49,982
I was just drunk.

113
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,567
You know me.

114
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,528
I'm not myself when I'm drunk.
It's the liquor talking.

115
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:57,323
Just forget everything that I said.

116
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:02,161
I know how hard you try.

117
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:05,414
I'm the problem here.

118
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,547
I'm sorry for all this hassle.

119
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:15,966
You have to drive
for a long while because of me.

120
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:18,386
I'm okay.

121
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,931
You should take a nap.
We have three to four hours to go.

122
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,226
I like this van.

123
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:26,435
Is it your team's car?

124
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:30,648
Yes.

125
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:31,774
President Lee told me

126
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:34,860
you shouldn't look shabby
for your gig, so I went the extra mile.

127
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:37,029
I'm so grateful.

128
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,781
Ran-joo.

129
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:41,867
You can't smoke in here.

130
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,995
Our artist hates it
when the vans smell like cigarettes.

131
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,748
Okay. Sorry.

132
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:55,256
By the way,
what's that suitcase in the back?

133
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,092
Are you going on a trip after the gig?

134
00:11:58,175 --> 00:11:59,176
A trip?

135
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,180
That sounds great.

136
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:13,566
-Yoon Ran-joo!
-Yoon Ran-joo!

137
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,401
This can't be.

138
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:18,195
-Yoon Ran-joo!
-Who prepared all this?

139
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,572
-Yoon Ran-joo!
-Yoon Ran-joo!

140
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:22,074
-Ran-joo, behind you.
-Yoon Ran-joo!

141
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:26,871
-Yoon Ran-joo!
-Yoon Ran-joo!

142
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:29,832
-Yoon Ran-joo!
-Yoon Ran-joo!

143
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:37,715
I hope one day in the near future

144
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:43,345
We can share the same dream as we walk

145
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:47,558
Together

146
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:49,059
AMAZING PERFORMANCE

147
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:50,603
YOON RAN-JOO STILL GOT IT

148
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:03,073
You two-timers.

149
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:06,285
You had all forgotten about me.

150
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:08,787
You had abandoned me.

151
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,469
So why?

152
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,013
Why the hell are you applauding me now?

153
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,900
I can't end it now.

154
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:44,031
I can't give up.

155
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:03,384
What's your name?

156
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:05,344
My name is Seo Mok-ha.

157
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:11,433
Goodness.

158
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:18,816
Yoon Ran-joo still got it.

159
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,402
New clips are appearing as we speak.

160
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:24,071
Yeon-kyung, have you seen Ran-joo's video?

161
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:26,699
This is incredible.

162
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:28,325
This wasn't pre-recorded, was it?

163
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:29,243
She sang live.

164
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:31,161
She sings better than in her prime.

165
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,751
Can you book her for our show right now?

166
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,003
You bet we can.

167
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:40,588
She'll be totally down for it.

168
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,381
Yes.

169
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:43,549
Okay.

170
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,178
-Add her in the script.
-Okay.

171
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:50,139
I can't believe this.

172
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,516
She doesn't do TV shows?

173
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,476
That's right.

174
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,686
Why not?

175
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,480
I don't think you know.

176
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,983
-Our show is about--
-No, I do.

177
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,276
It's Heyday Again.

178
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:04,737
It's the most popular variety show.

179
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,780
All the songs on that show top the charts.

180
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:08,157
So you do know. But why…

181
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,410
Ms. Yoon

182
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,579
suffers from stage fright.

183
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:15,080
What are you talking about?

184
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:18,125
We just watched her performance.
She tore up the stage.

185
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,461
She can only handle a small audience.

186
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:23,130
She seemed to more than just handle it.

187
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:25,007
Can I meet with her?

188
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,926
-I'd like to talk--
-I'm sorry.

189
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,010
Well…

190
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:29,803
She's having a meet-and-greet.

191
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:30,888
I apologize.

192
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:32,222
A meet-and-greet?

193
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:33,724
In there?

194
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:35,309
Yes.

195
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:45,319
How did you survive
on a deserted island for 15 years?

196
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:46,612
It must've been so tough.

197
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,658
It's nothing compared
to how much you went through.

198
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,494
How could your agency do this to you?

199
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:57,665
How dare they banish you
to this kind of place?

200
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,167
I haven't met a fan in a while.

201
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:03,796
You see…

202
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:06,966
In case we'd meet,

203
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:09,885
there's something
I've always wanted to ask you.

204
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:11,512
What is it?

205
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,265
Do you remember

206
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:19,186
the video I had sent you back then?

207
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:21,480
Of course, I do.

208
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:25,609
How was my singing?

209
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:27,111
You were the best.

210
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:30,239
I even went so far
as to wait at Seoul Station for you.

211
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:31,532
You did?

212
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,450
You were there?

213
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:34,994
Of course.

214
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:36,912
I waited for a long time.

215
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:41,041
Ran-joo…

216
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:45,546
How great would it have been
had we met then?

217
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:46,630
I know.

218
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:49,633
If we had, then you would've been

219
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:52,302
RJ Entertainment's top singer
instead of Eun Mo-rae.

220
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:53,971
Eun Mo-rae?

221
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:59,018
You mean the Eun Mo-rae?

222
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,274
Who is that?

223
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:09,403
There's this girl
that we chose as your substitute.

224
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:11,363
She's much more famous than I am.

225
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:13,949
What do you think?

226
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,910
She's not as good as Seo Mok-ha,
but she's not bad.

227
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:21,790
It's okay

228
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:22,708
Come close to me…

229
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,084
I handpicked her,

230
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:27,046
produced, and styled her.

231
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:29,923
Whisper the words

232
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:33,177
You couldn't wait to tell me

233
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:36,180
With your sweet voice

234
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:38,724
I love you

235
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:43,187
I still remember you
Even from the other side of the world

236
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,188
So you're saying that…

237
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:45,105
Can you believe it?

238
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:46,899
…had Mok-ha showed up then,

239
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:49,902
that she would've become a superstar
like Eun Mo-rae?

240
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:50,986
Perhaps.

241
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,865
It's so unfair, isn't it?

242
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:56,575
That barely cuts it.

243
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:59,495
Can't we do something about this?

244
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:00,996
Of course not.

245
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:03,832
We can't turn back time.

246
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:15,219
You prepared all those balloons yourself.
Thank you so much.

247
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:17,638
It made me feel nostalgic.

248
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:19,264
Ran-joo,

249
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:23,018
if only one fan of yours
remains on this earth,

250
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,645
then it'll be me.

251
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:26,230
And if you don't have any fans,

252
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:29,399
that just means I'm long dead and gone.

253
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:31,527
You see, Ran-joo,

254
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,904
I'll do anything for you.

255
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:35,614
Those balloons?

256
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:37,658
I could blow tens of thousands of them.

257
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:39,451
It'll be a cakewalk.

258
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:40,953
So Ran-joo,

259
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:42,079
stay strong!

260
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:43,372
Okay.

261
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:44,665
I'll stay strong.

262
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:46,750
Thank you. I can do it.

263
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:47,835
-Okay.
-Bye.

264
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:49,419
-Okay!
-Thanks!

265
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:51,171
-Stay strong, Ran-joo!
-Thanks!

266
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:52,881
You can do it!

267
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,550
You got this!

268
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:01,306
You don't know Eun Mo-rae, do you?

269
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,891
She's on the Billboard charts.

270
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,685
I bet she's the richest singer in Korea.

271
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:06,478
Aren't you mad at this situation?

272
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:08,689
Of course. I'm fuming.

273
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:09,857
Exactly.

274
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,733
Had you made it to Seoul Station,

275
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:12,901
that would be your spot.

276
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,444
No, it would've been Ran-joo.

277
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:16,947
-What?
-Not me.

278
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:18,991
I'd never steal Ran-joo's place.

279
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:22,619
What a rude brat.

280
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,873
I'll make her pay
if I ever cross paths with her.

281
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:28,792
No.

282
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,337
That's not it.

283
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:35,090
There's that guy
who neglected Ran-joo to this point.

284
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:38,093
What was his name? Lee Seo-jun.

285
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:42,848
I'm going to teach him a lesson first.

286
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:43,974
Darn it!

287
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,185
My poor Ran-joo.

288
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:48,770
My heart breaks for her.

289
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,233
Are you seriously worried
about Ran-joo now?

290
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:55,360
Of course. I'm her fan.

291
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:00,199
Seeing you like this…

292
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:01,617
No.

293
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:04,536
Jung Ki-ho would be fuming
had he witnessed this.

294
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:07,372
What did you just say?

295
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:08,707
I'm dropping a truth bomb.

296
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,210
It's my duty
as a reporter to state the truth.

297
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,711
No.

298
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,505
Jung Ki-ho is the cause of all this.

299
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:16,882
Hey.

300
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:19,051
He should've stopped your father
at all costs.

301
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:22,679
He should've held on
even if he'd be beaten to death.

302
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:25,432
I still love you

303
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:29,561
I think I know now

304
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:32,189
You and I

305
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:34,816
He should've sent you
to Ran-joo at all costs!

306
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:38,779
What kind of weak guy
can't hang on for that long?

307
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:40,239
That's enough!

308
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,993
No one else is to blame for my sad fate.

309
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:47,496
It was my choice,

310
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:49,706
so I'll deal with it!

311
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:51,875
So don't you dare bad-mouth Ki-ho!

312
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,418
Then do something about it!

313
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:55,545
Don't just stand here! Go get Ran-joo!

314
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:58,674
Put things back
to how they were 15 years ago!

315
00:20:58,757 --> 00:20:59,591
Badger her!

316
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:02,135
Badgering her won't change anything.

317
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:05,013
She's already struggling as is.
Why should I worsen it?

318
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:10,936
What?

319
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:24,491
Hey, can you drive me back to Seoul?

320
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:25,909
-What?
-What?

321
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:28,578
The manager and this car
belong to Eun Mo-rae.

322
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:30,372
He needs to go pick her up now.

323
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:31,456
What?

324
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,792
Yong-gwan, I'll take the Deodeok Wine.

325
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:35,419
Okay.

326
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,802
BROTHERS SALON

327
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:46,680
Okay.

328
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,268
We should look for Ms. Yoon first.

329
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:54,354
We have no choice
but to persuade her in person.

330
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,148
Yes.

331
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:57,274
Okay, bye.

332
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,249
What are you doing here?

333
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,171
You bought the same jacket as me too?

334
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,714
Bo-geol.

335
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:22,090
What?

336
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:24,176
As a music show producer,

337
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:26,762
what are your thoughts
on the music industry

338
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:29,264
where singers like her
with inferior talent can succeed?

339
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:32,350
What are you talking about?
Eun Mo-rae is talented.

340
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:33,477
You're no different.

341
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:36,354
You've been corrupted like everyone else.

342
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:38,190
Were you assigned
to report on culture now?

343
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:40,442
Is the new piece about K-pop?

344
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:41,443
Did you know?

345
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:44,279
Eun Mo-rae passed
the audition in Mok-ha's stead.

346
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:46,323
This is about Mok-ha again?

347
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:48,867
Had I clung onto her father
a bit longer 15 years ago,

348
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,368
that would've been Mok-ha.

349
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:51,953
You're getting too engrossed again.

350
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:53,747
I told you. You're not Jung Ki-ho.

351
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:54,831
Hey.

352
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,291
Have you heard Mok-ha sing?

353
00:22:56,374 --> 00:22:58,960
She's amazing.
Give her a listen, and you'll understand.

354
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:04,382
Now I get why people grab
their necks when they're mad.

355
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:05,926
The veins are about to burst.

356
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:07,594
Hey!

357
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:09,971
Mok-ha deserves to tour
the world on a private jet.

358
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,974
She doesn't deserve to live
in someone else's rooftop.

359
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:21,233
You know what this is, right?

360
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,026
Of course, I do!

361
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:28,156
You won this trophy for topping the charts
12 weeks in a row on Music Best in 1999.

362
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:31,827
I'm the only singer with this trophy,

363
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,495
and no one else will have one.

364
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:34,871
Of course.

365
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:38,750
Then, they started giving Golden Cups
for winning five weeks in a row.

366
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:42,796
I got so many goosebumps back then
when I watched you perform.

367
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:44,798
Is that so?

368
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:47,843
You want to get those goosebumps again?

369
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:50,345
I do!

370
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:53,014
I'm ready for the goosebumps!

371
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:59,604
I want to trap you in my dreams

372
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:04,693
I want to put you inside my maze
Never let me down

373
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:06,278
I lock eyes with you

374
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:08,363
And I hide my heart from you

375
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:11,241
All night until the sun rises

376
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:12,367
I chant a spell

377
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:14,619
You'll be so confused

378
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:15,954
You won't be able to run away

379
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:20,417
You'll keep missing me more and more

380
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,960
You won't understand what's happening

381
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:24,212
You won't be able to escape

382
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:27,465
This is what happens
When a witch falls in love

383
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:29,843
How do you feel?

384
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:31,219
Come and tell me

385
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:33,054
Do you feel excited?

386
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:35,182
Are you about to go crazy?

387
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:39,060
We are the witches, witches, witches
Witches, witches born again

388
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:43,690
With my special magic
I want to make you mine

389
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:47,194
Bo-geol, hear me out first.

390
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:48,111
Let me…

391
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:52,991
Let me explain.

392
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:08,798
It's nice to meet you.
I'm Bo-geol, Woo-hak's younger brother.

393
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:14,679
Right. Of course, I know.

394
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:16,640
You even bought me those shoes.

395
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:20,393
And she's…

396
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:22,979
I'm Yoon Ran-joo.

397
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:24,814
I'm honored to meet you.

398
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:29,361
You look familiar though.
Have we met before?

399
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:31,821
I'm not sure.

400
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:35,033
He gets that a lot.
He has common facial features.

401
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:36,451
I'll let you rest.

402
00:25:38,411 --> 00:25:40,288
What? Okay.

403
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,042
Hey.

404
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:49,047
Hey, Bo-geol.

405
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:56,471
They both seem like good people.

406
00:25:57,305 --> 00:25:58,306
They are.

407
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,891
If it weren't for them,

408
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:01,851
I'd still be trapped on that island.

409
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:05,730
You're so strong.

410
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:07,774
If that was me,

411
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:09,567
I wouldn't have even lasted a year.

412
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:11,569
I would've given up and ended my life.

413
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:16,950
I did consider doing that.

414
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:18,785
Seriously?

415
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:24,708
Not in my first year though.
It was around the sixth year

416
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:27,002
after I was stranded there.

417
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:34,092
FIVE

418
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:48,606
TWO

419
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:51,026
A thought crossed my mind one day.

420
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,946
"On this island, I might live

421
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:57,282
a futile life and die

422
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:00,160
without anyone knowing."

423
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:28,563
So…

424
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:35,987
I jumped into the ocean
with the intention of ending my life.

425
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:42,077
Really?

426
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,203
Who saved you?

427
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,331
It was a deserted island.

428
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:47,999
There must've been no one else.

429
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:50,377
It wasn't a person.

430
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:53,713
It was a cooler box.

431
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:55,507
A cooler box?

432
00:27:56,424 --> 00:27:57,384
Yes.

433
00:27:57,467 --> 00:28:00,345
It was floating in the water.

434
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:02,389
It was probably

435
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:05,392
thrown away by a fisherman.

436
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:07,143
What was inside?

437
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,231
Ramyeon.

438
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:12,774
What?

439
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:14,150
Inside,

440
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:16,694
there was one packet of ramyeon.

441
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:19,906
And it was long expired.

442
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:22,158
Did you eat it?

443
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:25,036
I did.

444
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:39,050
It was my first ramyeon in six years.

445
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:27,098
That taste

446
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:28,767
is something

447
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:30,852
I'll never forget.

448
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:40,653
That's when I suddenly thought,

449
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:42,280
"That was seriously

450
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:44,199
so close."

451
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:47,285
"Had I decided to die
five minutes earlier,

452
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,996
then I would've died
without tasting this."

453
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:54,542
That's why I decided to live

454
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:57,003
and wait for another cooler box.

455
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:00,507
So?

456
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,008
Did you get another one?

457
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:03,927
No.

458
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:07,013
But I still found myself waiting.

459
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:09,599
"Five more minutes."

460
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,018
"Five more minutes."

461
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:15,146
And after some time,

462
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:19,359
that drone or whatever you call it came.

463
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:21,402
Excuse me!

464
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:27,492
Then, those two men came.

465
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:32,121
Then, I got to meet you.

466
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:34,541
And found out I was ridiculously lousy.

467
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,043
What are you talking about?

468
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:38,336
You're not lousy at all!

469
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:47,637
I have vocal nodules.

470
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:54,185
Neither President Lee nor my mom knows.

471
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:56,604
I'm only telling you.

472
00:30:58,898 --> 00:31:00,108
Ran-joo.

473
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:03,236
I even got surgery without anyone knowing,

474
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:04,863
but my voice never came back.

475
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:08,491
I started losing gigs,
because I sounded awful live.

476
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,453
I lost all of my fans,

477
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:15,540
and every news article said
I was washed up.

478
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:20,628
I was thinking of ending everything.

479
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:22,130
Then, you came into my life.

480
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:24,716
It was perfect timing.
You were my cooler box.

481
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:30,638
Ran-joo.

482
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,061
If I wait, will a drone
also come for me one day?

483
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:43,610
Of course.

484
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:45,904
There's no doubt about it.

485
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:48,239
It'll definitely come.

486
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:53,161
I'm craving a drink.

487
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:55,747
Have you tried alcohol before?

488
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:58,416
No, I haven't.

489
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:00,543
That's great.

490
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:09,719
I'll show you.

491
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:12,931
It's Deodeok Wine.

492
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:20,146
"I'm honored to meet you"?

493
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:22,398
What was I supposed to say? I'm annoyed?

494
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:24,943
You hated when I mentioned Mok-ha.

495
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:27,445
You wanted her out of your room.
You said to ignore her.

496
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:29,155
But you insisted on letting her in.

497
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:32,241
You said that was smooth
and perfect reasoning.

498
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:33,826
You were right.

499
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:36,621
That's why I decided to let her in.

500
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:39,457
I was wrong then, but I'm right now?

501
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,541
Yes.

502
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,962
Since I let her use
the rooftop like you wanted,

503
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:45,588
do me a favor in return.

504
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:47,090
What is it?

505
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:49,008
Stop talking about Jung Ki-ho.

506
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:53,721
Just forget about your past
or what happened 15 years ago.

507
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:57,684
Most people yearn for the past,

508
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,812
but I'm told to forget mine.

509
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:04,941
Woo-hak.

510
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:07,443
It must be a traumatic memory

511
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:09,570
from the way you're reacting.

512
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:13,658
Mr. Jung, this is enough.

513
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:15,827
You don't need the whole life insurance.

514
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,829
Just take the indemnity insurance.

515
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:19,497
No, I want that too.

516
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:23,042
I don't spend my salary
on anything anyway.

517
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,462
Why buy it when you don't have any kids?

518
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:28,006
What are you talking about?

519
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:30,508
I have Ki-ho.

520
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:32,760
Gosh.

521
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:35,930
Sir, you know what?

522
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:38,891
I travel 4,000 km a month in that car.

523
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:42,353
It's safe to say
I've traveled all over this country.

524
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:46,441
If Ki-ho was still alive,
I would've spotted him

525
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:48,109
as his closest friend.

526
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:51,029
You probably couldn't recognize him

527
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:53,656
since it's been 15 years.

528
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,119
Despite being his father,

529
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:02,957
even I can't imagine
what he'd look like now.

530
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:06,169
Look.

531
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:08,296
I know this might sound heartless.

532
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:12,592
But you should just consider
that insolent kid dead and forget him.

533
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:18,723
They found Mok-ha alive.

534
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:22,894
Did you see the news?

535
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:27,273
Of course.

536
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:29,942
She was on a deserted island for 15 years.

537
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:36,032
If Ki-ho's still alive,
he must've seen her on the news too.

538
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:37,784
Come on, Mr. Jung.

539
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:40,536
If he did, he would look for her.

540
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:54,133
If you ever get in touch with Mok-ha,

541
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:57,053
promise me

542
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:59,430
you'll let me know, Dae-woong.

543
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:05,436
Okay. Don't worry about it.

544
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:12,944
Thank you.

545
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:17,865
See you soon.

546
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:20,576
Okay, I'll visit you sometime.
Get home safely.

547
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:22,411
Goodbye, sir.

548
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:35,758
YOUNG-JU

549
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:39,762
Young-ju, it's me.

550
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:41,973
I just met with Ki-ho's father.

551
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:45,893
I'm afraid he'll reach out to Mok-ha
just to find Ki-ho. What do we do?

552
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:48,688
Do you think
we should tell Ki-ho about this?

553
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:52,233
Why is he so determined to find him?
He's already moved on and happy.

554
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:54,652
What should we do?

555
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:58,072
Shouldn't we reach out
to Mok-ha and let her know?

556
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,222
Where am I?

557
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:27,518
What is this?

558
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:31,981
Goodness, our dear VIP finally woke up.

559
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:33,649
I'm making dried pollack soup.

560
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:35,276
"VIP"?

561
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,570
I made some honey water. Have some.

562
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:39,155
Thank you.

563
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:41,115
Goodness, are you up?

564
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,661
I chose a song to sing at my audition.

565
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:46,746
"Audition"?

566
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:50,082
I could totally relate to these lyrics.

567
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:52,543
I think you wrote
and composed it, my dear mentor.

568
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:53,628
"Mentor"?

569
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:55,838
Why am I your mentor?

570
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:27,203
Seo Mok-ha!

571
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:29,205
Seo Mok-ha!

572
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:41,300
Our dear Seo Mok-ha!

573
00:37:42,134 --> 00:37:43,302
Hold on.

574
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:45,763
Let's hold an awards ceremony.

575
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:47,431
-An awards ceremony!
-We must!

576
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:49,934
-Here's the trophy!
-Trophy.

577
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:51,602
The Grammy Award goes to…

578
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:54,772
-Goodness!
-Mok-ha Seo!

579
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:56,274
Here's her bouquet!

580
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:59,193
Here's your bouquet.

581
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:03,864
Goodness, I can't believe this.

582
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:11,664
I'd like to dedicate this honor

583
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:16,210
to the person who helped me
win this Grammy Award.

584
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:20,339
-To Yoon Ran-joo, my friend--
-Hey!

585
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:23,342
That's no way to address me.

586
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:26,095
-You're a Grammy-award winning singer.
-A singer!

587
00:38:26,178 --> 00:38:29,432
From now on, call me your mentor!

588
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:35,104
I dedicate this to my mentor,
Yoon Ran-joo!

589
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:42,695
This is the money I earned
after performing at the Deodeok Festival.

590
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:46,741
-So? Is that enough rent money?
-Rent?

591
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:53,998
Goodness. Of course, it is.

592
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:56,876
-It's more than enough.
-Of course, it should be.

593
00:38:56,959 --> 00:39:01,714
Why? Because I'm Yoon Ran-joo, the VIP.

594
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:06,927
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

595
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:08,262
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

596
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:13,476
Yoon Ran-joo is here!

597
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:24,070
"Eun Mo-rae."

598
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:26,906
I'll bring her down.

599
00:39:26,989 --> 00:39:28,949
-Hey, Mok-ha.
-Yes?

600
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,534
Listen up.

601
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:34,455
If I sell a total

602
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:36,916
of 20 million albums…

603
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:38,000
Yes?

604
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:42,129
Then, half of RJ Entertainment's shares
will become mine.

605
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:43,214
Oh, my.

606
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:46,258
When that happens,

607
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:49,720
as the major shareholder…

608
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:50,805
Major shareholder!

609
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:52,306
-Hold on.
-Goodness.

610
00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:55,935
I'll turn you, Mok-ha,

611
00:39:56,852 --> 00:40:01,399
into a global star!

612
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:03,651
Oh, yeah!

613
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:09,031
I'm your

614
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:14,453
Cooler box

615
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:17,998
I'm your

616
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:27,675
Your drone

617
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:30,761
You're good.
You were born to be a global star.

618
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:34,473
-Drone.
-Hey, let's call him.

619
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:36,559
Let's call him.

620
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:38,436
Call? Who?

621
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:40,229
Who?

622
00:40:40,312 --> 00:40:41,981
Who are we calling?

623
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:43,065
Hold on.

624
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:49,738
Hey, President Lee. Hi!

625
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:54,452
President Lee, this is Seo Mok-ha.

626
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:56,871
She was the original winner.

627
00:40:56,954 --> 00:41:00,624
Eun Mo-rae is a fake! Do you know that?

628
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:02,626
I'm the original!

629
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,879
So Lee Seo-jun!

630
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:08,132
Book a room for her audition right now
and just you wait!

631
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:09,675
Got that?

632
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:11,051
You just wait.

633
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:15,806
-You're dead meat, RJ Entertainment!
-That's right!

634
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:20,603
-You're dead meat!
-You're dead meat!

635
00:41:25,107 --> 00:41:26,859
RECENTS
LAP BLANKET, P-DRAGON

636
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:30,571
I think you released this song

637
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:32,490
while I was stranded on that island.

638
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:35,159
-What if I sang "That Night"--
-Wait.

639
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:38,454
-What?
-I…

640
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:40,331
I'll be right back.

641
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:42,625
Where are you going?

642
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:43,709
Your honey water…

643
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:44,668
It's okay.

644
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:47,463
-You should have some.
-Goodness, our VIP.

645
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:48,881
I'm okay.

646
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:51,592
Your delicious rice is now ready to eat.

647
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:53,802
Please stir well.

648
00:41:55,971 --> 00:42:01,060
Ran-joo lost her mind
and made trouble again.

649
00:42:01,143 --> 00:42:04,605
Can you please stop drinking?

650
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:09,860
You crazy drunk!

651
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:12,613
Why did you have to act out
and cause this mess?

652
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:15,908
Jeez, this is driving me crazy.

653
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:19,370
Come on, Ran-joo.

654
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:22,706
Why the hell are you whining
when you're the one who got drunk?

655
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:26,168
Do you know why your life is like this?

656
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:27,753
Darn it.

657
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:31,423
Of course, I do.

658
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:33,884
I always dig my own grave,

659
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:37,221
and then I blame others,
so that's why my life's like this.

660
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:39,306
I'm aware of that.

661
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,559
Why do you even have a brain?

662
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:43,394
Is it just for show?

663
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:45,688
Don't you ever use it to think?

664
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:47,898
Gosh! Unbelievable!

665
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:49,316
This is driving me nuts.

666
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:55,155
How can I fix this?

667
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:57,866
I don't even deserve to live.

668
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:09,420
LAP BLANKET

669
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,930
President Lee, what is it?

670
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:22,433
What was that video call last night?

671
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:28,105
Were you just drunk or did you mean it?

672
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:29,356
Well…

673
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:32,985
I guess it's half and half.

674
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:39,158
No, I definitely meant all of that.

675
00:43:39,241 --> 00:43:40,451
Look.

676
00:43:40,534 --> 00:43:44,747
Do you remember that fan video contest
when I was still at Sugar Agency?

677
00:43:50,919 --> 00:43:52,463
Goodness.

678
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:55,299
Goodness, thank you.

679
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:59,011
I know we were
an inconvenience last night.

680
00:43:59,094 --> 00:44:00,804
I hope it won't be for too long.

681
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:02,306
What do you mean?

682
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:03,557
Being an inconvenience.

683
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:22,910
I listened to her sing,
and she's very talented.

684
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:24,828
She sings with ease but sounds so strong.

685
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:26,997
She has perfect pitch
and great lung capacity.

686
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:29,208
Her singing is incredible.

687
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:31,210
No.

688
00:44:31,293 --> 00:44:32,753
She must be calling President Lee.

689
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:34,254
When did you get here?

690
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:36,090
I thought she was still a teenager.

691
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:42,888
I'm really sorry.

692
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:46,100
I know this sounds ridiculous.

693
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:47,893
But I was so excited to meet a fan

694
00:44:47,976 --> 00:44:50,312
I made this ludicrous promise while drunk.

695
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:53,607
So can't you just pretend
like you're auditioning her?

696
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:56,402
Just pretend.
I'm not asking you to accept her.

697
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:59,029
Please, sir.

698
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:00,906
She could've died on that island.

699
00:45:00,989 --> 00:45:03,200
Don't you pity her?

700
00:45:03,283 --> 00:45:04,743
This is her wish,

701
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:07,788
so let's grant it for her. Okay?

702
00:45:15,337 --> 00:45:16,463
Hello, sir.

703
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:18,674
What's my schedule for tomorrow afternoon?

704
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:20,884
Can I make time for an audition?

705
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:23,429
You have a meeting
with Front Investment at 2:00 p.m.

706
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:25,305
and one with Tusto at 4:00 p.m., so…

707
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:31,437
How does 3:45 p.m. sound?

708
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:33,397
I'll only have 15 minutes.

709
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:36,066
That'll be more than enough.

710
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:37,484
Thank you so much!

711
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:41,113
I promise to never cause
a problem like this ever again.

712
00:45:41,196 --> 00:45:42,739
Thank you so much.

713
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:45,826
What a relief.

714
00:45:58,338 --> 00:45:59,756
She didn't have to do that.

715
00:46:02,634 --> 00:46:03,969
Just think about yourself.

716
00:46:04,052 --> 00:46:06,680
This is your hard-earned big break.

717
00:46:06,763 --> 00:46:08,265
Just focus on making it.

718
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:12,019
Fifteen years ago,

719
00:46:12,686 --> 00:46:15,022
I liked her
because of how much she lacked.

720
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:19,193
She lacked worries, gloominess,

721
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:20,611
and concerns.

722
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:26,241
But she seems to be full of them now.

723
00:46:28,076 --> 00:46:29,578
What did she go through

724
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:32,498
to become pathetic like that?

725
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:38,045
What broke her down like that?

726
00:46:40,547 --> 00:46:43,884
MUSIC BEST PLATINUM 1ST PLACE
1999, 12 WEEKS IN A ROW, YOON RAN-JOO

727
00:46:54,394 --> 00:46:56,480
Are you ready to shine, Seo Mok-ha?

728
00:46:57,356 --> 00:46:58,482
What?

729
00:46:58,565 --> 00:47:03,028
Your audition date is set.
It's tomorrow at 3:45 p.m.

730
00:47:03,111 --> 00:47:05,155
Are you serious?

731
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:09,826
President Lee called me first.

732
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:11,745
He wants you to audition right away.

733
00:47:11,828 --> 00:47:15,165
I was drunk when I told him,
but he still listened.

734
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:17,543
That shows how much he respects me.

735
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:19,461
You're right.

736
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:21,338
He's a great man.

737
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:24,049
Yes, and he's smart as well.

738
00:47:24,132 --> 00:47:26,510
He has a good ear for songs
and a good eye too.

739
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:30,847
I guarantee he'll want
to sign a contract with you right away

740
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:32,683
as soon as he hears you sing.

741
00:47:33,767 --> 00:47:38,063
He's not the type to do this,

742
00:47:39,147 --> 00:47:43,318
but if he considers
your age an issue, just let it slide.

743
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:45,195
Don't get all worked up, okay?

744
00:47:46,446 --> 00:47:47,447
Okay.

745
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:50,617
What do you think?
I treat my fans very well, right?

746
00:47:54,871 --> 00:47:58,083
Why would you go this far
for someone like me?

747
00:47:59,751 --> 00:48:00,752
Are you crying?

748
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:03,964
I'm just so grateful.

749
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:09,219
You are more incredible

750
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:11,096
than I thought you were.

751
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:18,729
Here.

752
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:22,941
I'm grateful that you appreciate me.

753
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:25,694
My dear mentee,
do well tomorrow if you feel that way.

754
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:35,287
Okay. Make a wish and blow it out.

755
00:48:37,122 --> 00:48:41,418
All right. I'll blow it out at once.

756
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:52,554
JAE-SIK'S MARINATED CRAB

757
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:54,931
Mok-ha came by this restaurant?

758
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:56,350
Yes.

759
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:59,603
She asked about what happened to your son.

760
00:49:03,565 --> 00:49:05,442
Did you get her number?

761
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:07,027
No.

762
00:49:07,861 --> 00:49:11,281
But we got the business card
of the guy with her, right?

763
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:13,659
Hold on. Where did I put it again?

764
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:17,621
What guy?

765
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:22,167
He said he was a reporter or something.

766
00:49:22,709 --> 00:49:26,672
He was one impudent scumbag.

767
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:29,591
That young man gave us
a really rude glare,

768
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:32,969
trying like the devil to defend Mok-ha.

769
00:49:34,971 --> 00:49:36,056
I thought

770
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:38,141
he was her husband.

771
00:49:41,978 --> 00:49:43,397
"Kang Woo-hak"?

772
00:49:44,731 --> 00:49:46,650
YGN KANG WOO-HAK

773
00:50:02,624 --> 00:50:05,252
HEYDAY AGAIN

774
00:50:06,753 --> 00:50:10,674
The public loves that video
of Yoon Ran-joo at the Deodeok Festival.

775
00:50:10,757 --> 00:50:14,052
The song she sang is on the music charts.
Currently in 67th place.

776
00:50:14,928 --> 00:50:15,929
Thank you.

777
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:18,473
As soon as I heard her sing,

778
00:50:18,557 --> 00:50:20,308
I decided to spend my entire budget

779
00:50:20,392 --> 00:50:23,145
to hire an orchestra
and pull out the red carpet for her.

780
00:50:23,228 --> 00:50:25,272
Because her voice was worth it.

781
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,483
I'm truly grateful to hear that.

782
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:30,277
But the thing is,

783
00:50:31,153 --> 00:50:32,654
Ran-joo has stage fright.

784
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:35,532
No way. That's great.

785
00:50:35,615 --> 00:50:38,368
She can overcome that fear
on our show. Right?

786
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:41,830
Everyone needs to hear her sing.
Deodeok Festival?

787
00:50:41,913 --> 00:50:45,250
It's a shame that she's performing
at such local events.

788
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:48,170
Right, it is. It's heartbreaking too.

789
00:50:50,255 --> 00:50:52,674
I tried to persuade her numerous times.

790
00:50:52,758 --> 00:50:55,510
I told her to strike
while the iron was still hot

791
00:50:55,594 --> 00:50:57,596
and said you were willing
to accommodate her.

792
00:50:58,096 --> 00:50:59,306
But she still won't do it.

793
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:01,558
When was this?

794
00:51:03,268 --> 00:51:04,519
This morning.

795
00:51:06,646 --> 00:51:09,691
Her agency wants her to be active, right?

796
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:12,903
Of course.

797
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:16,615
Even our president
asked me to persuade her.

798
00:51:17,532 --> 00:51:18,909
Why would he be against it?

799
00:51:18,992 --> 00:51:21,411
Being on this show
guarantees you'll sweep the charts.

800
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:25,248
I even stopped by her house today.

801
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:28,502
Her house?

802
00:51:30,545 --> 00:51:31,671
Yes.

803
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:34,925
To be honest, I'm not even her manager.

804
00:51:35,008 --> 00:51:37,177
But I went over
despite my team's schedule.

805
00:51:38,011 --> 00:51:40,222
And it turned out I did that for nothing.

806
00:51:46,311 --> 00:51:47,312
That's hot.

807
00:51:50,398 --> 00:51:52,692
People want to book her left and right.

808
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:55,946
I'm going through so much
just for helping her out.

809
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:57,322
Good work.

810
00:51:58,824 --> 00:52:00,116
We have six months left.

811
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,285
Hold them off until then.

812
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:06,248
I'll compensate you handsomely if you do.

813
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:16,466
YOON RAN-JOO, GUEST SINGER
AT DEODEOK FESTIVAL STILL GOT IT

814
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:20,887
HER SONG IS STILL JUST AS GOOD

815
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:48,415
What?

816
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:53,587
Ran-joo, did you know
they changed the agency's name?

817
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:58,383
No, but I like this new name better.

818
00:52:58,466 --> 00:53:00,677
I didn't like
how they used my name anyway.

819
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:03,096
It made them look complacent and tacky.

820
00:53:03,597 --> 00:53:04,806
Let's go. We'll be late.

821
00:53:14,941 --> 00:53:17,777
I like that. Let me see your face.

822
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:19,279
You look so pretty.

823
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:22,240
Listen up. The audition will be
15 minutes at the longest.

824
00:53:23,491 --> 00:53:24,659
No, make that ten minutes.

825
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:26,745
The first ten seconds
will decide everything.

826
00:53:26,828 --> 00:53:29,164
So don't plan on singing the entire song.

827
00:53:29,247 --> 00:53:31,249
Rather, sing the chorus first--

828
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:33,585
Say hello. Smile.

829
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:38,256
-Hello, sir.
-I'm sorry for being late.

830
00:53:38,798 --> 00:53:41,718
Ran-joo, it's been ages
since we last saw each other.

831
00:53:41,801 --> 00:53:44,304
Right? We'd only talked on the phone.

832
00:53:45,221 --> 00:53:47,349
You must be Seo Mok-ha.

833
00:53:47,432 --> 00:53:48,808
-I am.
-It's nice to meet you.

834
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:50,226
Likewise, sir.

835
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:52,354
Are you here alone?

836
00:53:52,437 --> 00:53:55,231
Where's the Rookie Development team
and the cameramen?

837
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:58,276
I'll just cut to the chase
since I don't have much time.

838
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:00,362
I'm not here because of the audition.

839
00:54:00,445 --> 00:54:02,364
What do you mean, Seo-jun?

840
00:54:02,447 --> 00:54:04,407
-Yesterday, we--
-I apologize.

841
00:54:04,991 --> 00:54:06,743
She had asked me to play along,

842
00:54:06,826 --> 00:54:08,745
but I don't think this is right.

843
00:54:09,245 --> 00:54:10,830
I already know my decision,

844
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:13,875
so what's the point?
It'll just be a waste of time.

845
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:15,168
Have you already

846
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:17,879
made up your mind?

847
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:20,048
But I haven't performed yet.

848
00:54:20,131 --> 00:54:21,299
Mok-ha.

849
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:24,344
Can you wait outside?
I need to have a word with him.

850
00:54:29,724 --> 00:54:30,725
Okay.

851
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:48,743
How could you do this?

852
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:51,079
You should at least let her sing
since she's here.

853
00:54:51,162 --> 00:54:52,414
I'm sure she's good.

854
00:54:52,497 --> 00:54:55,750
She caught your eye after all.

855
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:57,293
So what?

856
00:54:57,377 --> 00:54:58,837
You said she was 31.

857
00:55:02,048 --> 00:55:05,635
You know singers tend to age quicker.

858
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:07,971
We double their current ages these days.

859
00:55:08,054 --> 00:55:09,514
That means

860
00:55:09,597 --> 00:55:12,100
she's over 60 years old.

861
00:55:12,183 --> 00:55:15,729
A trainee in her sixties?
It just doesn't make any sense.

862
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:18,314
I understand,
but you should still listen--

863
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:19,482
Look. How about this?

864
00:55:19,566 --> 00:55:21,943
I'll propose something
that's perfect for her.

865
00:55:22,694 --> 00:55:23,695
Instead of a singer,

866
00:55:24,529 --> 00:55:26,448
how about she becomes your manager?

867
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:36,434
She's too old to be a singer,
but she can still be your manager.

868
00:56:36,518 --> 00:56:39,354
She was stranded on an island
while on her way to meet us.

869
00:56:39,437 --> 00:56:42,273
She barely made it out alive
to pursue her dream.

870
00:56:42,357 --> 00:56:43,566
But what? My manager?

871
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:45,443
Age is crucial to singers.

872
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:46,736
Ki-ho.

873
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:49,030
Have you heard of the term "truth bomb"?

874
00:56:49,114 --> 00:56:51,950
They coined it while I was stranded.

875
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:55,370
It means to attack someone with the truth.

876
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:58,706
I didn't get it at first,

877
00:56:59,374 --> 00:57:02,085
but I totally do now.

878
00:57:02,752 --> 00:57:05,213
Swearing or shouting at someone

879
00:57:05,296 --> 00:57:08,383
doesn't bring them down.

880
00:57:09,425 --> 00:57:11,803
It's stating the facts. The truth.

881
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:16,015
I can't even argue since they're right.

882
00:57:16,891 --> 00:57:19,185
I have no choice but to just take it.

883
00:57:20,061 --> 00:57:22,480
Of course. I know that very well.

884
00:57:22,564 --> 00:57:24,065
That's why I feel bad but--

885
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:25,150
I'll be frank.

886
00:57:26,526 --> 00:57:28,278
I'm sick and tired

887
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:30,864
of picking up after you.

888
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:35,285
I finally understand why

889
00:57:35,368 --> 00:57:36,411
she's fallen so much.

890
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:40,790
She's been assaulted
with the truth for the past 15 years.

891
00:57:42,083 --> 00:57:43,168
But you know what?

892
00:57:43,918 --> 00:57:45,378
Why does that obnoxious man

893
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:48,214
only say things that dispirit her?

894
00:57:49,632 --> 00:57:51,092
Does he hate her?

895
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:53,303
Or…

896
00:57:53,928 --> 00:57:57,056
If I sell a total

897
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:59,476
of 20 million albums…

898
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:00,393
Yes?

899
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:04,647
Then half of RJ Entertainment's shares
will become mine.

900
00:58:08,026 --> 00:58:09,110
He's afraid.

901
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:29,214
Okay, let's think realistically.

902
00:58:29,297 --> 00:58:31,299
She lacks experience and education.

903
00:58:31,382 --> 00:58:33,426
I'm making this offer despite the risk.

904
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:34,761
So that girl who's lacking

905
00:58:34,844 --> 00:58:36,137
is becoming my manager.

906
00:58:37,388 --> 00:58:40,058
You don't want this then?
Should I take this offer back?

907
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:44,270
Don't do that! I accept!

908
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:45,855
I'll do it!

909
00:58:46,397 --> 00:58:47,524
I'll be her manager.

910
00:58:48,733 --> 00:58:52,403
You're very persuasive, sir.

911
00:58:52,487 --> 00:58:55,573
You sure know how to give
someone a reality check.

912
00:58:55,657 --> 00:58:56,866
I truly apologize

913
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:59,494
for wanting to become
a singer despite my age.

914
00:58:59,994 --> 00:59:00,995
Mok-ha, you--

915
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:03,790
I truly apologize to you too.

916
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:06,417
It must've been a nuisance
to deal with me.

917
00:59:06,501 --> 00:59:08,044
I'll repay this kindness

918
00:59:08,586 --> 00:59:11,631
by working hard as her manager.

919
00:59:14,759 --> 00:59:15,760
I love your spirit.

920
00:59:15,843 --> 00:59:17,095
You're down-to-earth too.

921
00:59:17,178 --> 00:59:19,180
I have a meeting with some investors,

922
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:22,016
so let's formally introduce ourselves
next time.

923
00:59:23,768 --> 00:59:24,936
Goodbye, Ran-joo.

924
00:59:25,937 --> 00:59:27,438
Goodbye, sir.

925
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:34,195
You have a knack
for making me look ridiculous.

926
00:59:34,279 --> 00:59:36,739
Did you come to become
a manager and give up singing?

927
00:59:36,823 --> 00:59:39,325
I will never give up my dream.

928
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:41,619
Then, why would you
throw away this opportunity?

929
00:59:41,703 --> 00:59:42,704
Come on.

930
00:59:44,289 --> 00:59:47,375
That man, Lee Seo-jun. In my eyes,

931
00:59:48,126 --> 00:59:50,628
he isn't someone
who'd give others opportunities.

932
00:59:51,296 --> 00:59:54,632
He's extremely petty.

933
00:59:54,716 --> 00:59:57,093
An utter coward!

934
00:59:57,176 --> 00:59:58,094
What?

935
00:59:58,845 --> 01:00:00,138
You didn't know, did you?

936
01:00:01,306 --> 01:00:04,183
You probably didn't,
because he always mistreated you.

937
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:08,187
But I can see through him.

938
01:00:09,063 --> 01:00:10,940
That scumbag

939
01:00:11,024 --> 01:00:13,568
is terrified of you.

940
01:00:16,237 --> 01:00:17,405
You don't believe me?

941
01:00:19,115 --> 01:00:20,450
Then, see for yourself.

942
01:00:32,670 --> 01:00:33,713
Mok-ha--

943
01:00:40,428 --> 01:00:41,721
Why are you here?

944
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:42,805
What about you?

945
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:45,224
Today is Mok-ha's audition.
So I was curious.

946
01:00:46,225 --> 01:00:47,560
Same goes for me.

947
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:50,480
-What's your deal?
-What?

948
01:00:50,563 --> 01:00:52,065
It's strange.

949
01:00:52,148 --> 01:00:54,901
You let her stay at the rooftop,
and now, you're here?

950
01:00:55,818 --> 01:00:56,819
Don't tell me…

951
01:00:57,904 --> 01:00:59,113
Never mind.

952
01:00:59,697 --> 01:01:00,698
Are you interested?

953
01:01:01,449 --> 01:01:02,450
Yes, I am.

954
01:01:02,533 --> 01:01:03,451
What?

955
01:01:03,534 --> 01:01:04,911
In Yoon Ran-joo.

956
01:01:06,412 --> 01:01:09,290
I see. Yoon Ran-joo.

957
01:01:10,249 --> 01:01:11,250
Right.

958
01:01:13,461 --> 01:01:14,587
You're into older women?

959
01:01:15,296 --> 01:01:16,631
It's for my show.

960
01:01:16,714 --> 01:01:19,717
Yeon-kyung wants me to book her.
This is just for work.

961
01:01:20,218 --> 01:01:21,219
I see.

962
01:01:21,719 --> 01:01:24,263
I'm doing this for my article too. Mok-ha.

963
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:26,140
How did the audition go?

964
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:27,767
Where's Yoon Ran-joo?

965
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:28,851
Right.

966
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:30,353
You two.

967
01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:31,979
Help me out, will you?

968
01:01:36,818 --> 01:01:37,819
Mok-ha!

969
01:02:03,344 --> 01:02:06,180
It's 1,210,022.

970
01:02:07,014 --> 01:02:09,934
And 990,239.

971
01:02:11,310 --> 01:02:13,896
And 1,490,967.

972
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:15,565
Did you bring it?

973
01:02:16,858 --> 01:02:18,693
Why do we need to add these numbers?

974
01:02:18,776 --> 01:02:19,777
Go on.

975
01:02:21,279 --> 01:02:24,157
This is RJ Entertainment's
current financial situation.

976
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:27,118
Our sales figures, as of 2021…

977
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:35,209
Hello.

978
01:02:36,002 --> 01:02:37,712
I'm Yoon Ran-joo.

979
01:02:37,795 --> 01:02:39,255
Excuse me.

980
01:02:39,338 --> 01:02:40,339
Ran-joo.

981
01:02:42,717 --> 01:02:45,845
-This is an important meeting.
-I know. That's why I'm here.

982
01:02:46,554 --> 01:02:48,598
You're considering investing in RJ, right?

983
01:02:49,265 --> 01:02:51,100
Ran-joo, let's talk outside--

984
01:02:51,976 --> 01:02:54,437
Do they know what we agreed on?

985
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:56,189
About the shares

986
01:02:56,272 --> 01:02:57,482
worth 17 trillion won.

987
01:02:58,107 --> 01:02:59,901
Yoon Ran-joo.

988
01:03:04,071 --> 01:03:07,867
If we subtract 19,915,269

989
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:11,412
from 20 million,

990
01:03:12,038 --> 01:03:13,498
that'll be 84,731.

991
01:03:14,582 --> 01:03:15,958
We just need to sell

992
01:03:16,042 --> 01:03:18,920
that many of her albums

993
01:03:19,003 --> 01:03:21,172
for the total sum

994
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:24,884
to be exactly 20 million.

995
01:03:25,468 --> 01:03:26,636
And then?

996
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:28,638
Once I sell 20 million albums,

997
01:03:28,721 --> 01:03:31,474
half of RJ Entertainment's shares
will become mine.

998
01:03:34,727 --> 01:03:36,020
That agreement

999
01:03:36,521 --> 01:03:37,980
will expire in merely six months.

1000
01:03:38,064 --> 01:03:39,273
That's enough time.

1001
01:03:39,357 --> 01:03:42,068
You barely sold 20,000 albums
in the past ten years.

1002
01:03:42,151 --> 01:03:43,361
So how will you do that?

1003
01:03:43,945 --> 01:03:45,029
Do you think I can't?

1004
01:03:45,613 --> 01:03:47,156
I beg to differ.

1005
01:03:50,743 --> 01:03:51,953
All right.

1006
01:03:52,036 --> 01:03:54,163
I'll give Mok-ha an audition.

1007
01:03:54,247 --> 01:03:56,290
Or I could let her become a trainee--

1008
01:03:57,959 --> 01:03:59,335
I just realized you don't wear

1009
01:03:59,418 --> 01:04:01,212
prescription glasses.

1010
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:03,840
"You"?

1011
01:04:06,008 --> 01:04:07,677
You must've wanted to look smart.

1012
01:04:08,177 --> 01:04:10,179
Hey, Yoon Ran-joo!

1013
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:13,099
Mok-ha was right.

1014
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:14,433
You're

1015
01:04:14,934 --> 01:04:16,352
a coward.

1016
01:04:31,075 --> 01:04:32,076
You?

1017
01:04:32,159 --> 01:04:32,994
A manager?

1018
01:04:33,077 --> 01:04:33,911
Yes.

1019
01:04:33,995 --> 01:04:36,205
I'm going to do as much legwork as I can

1020
01:04:36,289 --> 01:04:40,418
and help her sell
a total of 20 million albums.

1021
01:04:40,501 --> 01:04:42,837
Once she's the major shareholder
of RJ Entertainment,

1022
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:45,172
then I can have my audition.

1023
01:04:45,256 --> 01:04:46,257
Aren't I right?

1024
01:04:47,425 --> 01:04:48,426
Manager comes first

1025
01:04:48,968 --> 01:04:49,927
and then the audition?

1026
01:04:50,511 --> 01:04:51,762
Correct.

1027
01:04:51,846 --> 01:04:53,389
When will you start your job?

1028
01:04:55,182 --> 01:04:56,517
As of right now.

1029
01:04:56,601 --> 01:04:57,602
That's great.

1030
01:05:03,566 --> 01:05:05,985
Yoon Ran-joo didn't have a manager,

1031
01:05:06,068 --> 01:05:07,528
so I didn't know when to do this.

1032
01:05:11,616 --> 01:05:13,492
YGN VARIETY SHOW PRODUCER KANG BO-GEOL

1033
01:05:17,079 --> 01:05:18,122
What is it?

1034
01:06:12,134 --> 01:06:13,386
Goodness!

1035
01:06:13,469 --> 01:06:14,762
Goodness, Ran-joo!

1036
01:06:15,262 --> 01:06:16,263
Ran-joo!

1037
01:06:16,347 --> 01:06:18,683
I'm your manager now.

1038
01:06:19,266 --> 01:06:21,102
So don't you worry about a thing

1039
01:06:21,185 --> 01:06:24,522
and only focus
on taking care of your throat.

1040
01:06:24,605 --> 01:06:28,317
Just trust me and keep going forward.

1041
01:06:29,026 --> 01:06:31,529
How could I?

1042
01:06:31,612 --> 01:06:33,572
A singer who's lost her voice

1043
01:06:33,656 --> 01:06:36,283
and her manager who has no connections.

1044
01:06:36,367 --> 01:06:38,244
I feel so hopeless about the future.

1045
01:06:38,786 --> 01:06:39,787
Goodness.

1046
01:06:39,870 --> 01:06:40,871
Ran-joo.

1047
01:06:40,955 --> 01:06:42,957
I have great connections.

1048
01:06:43,708 --> 01:06:45,418
I already booked you for something.

1049
01:06:45,501 --> 01:06:48,129
Did you now? What is it? Busking?

1050
01:06:49,964 --> 01:06:56,137
I don't know if you've heard
of YGN's Heyday Again.

1051
01:06:56,220 --> 01:06:57,430
You booked me?

1052
01:06:57,513 --> 01:06:58,389
How?

1053
01:06:59,348 --> 01:07:00,808
I just found out

1054
01:07:01,434 --> 01:07:03,602
that a close friend of mine worked there

1055
01:07:03,686 --> 01:07:05,479
as a producer.

1056
01:07:05,563 --> 01:07:07,523
He begged me

1057
01:07:07,606 --> 01:07:10,568
to put you on his show.

1058
01:07:10,651 --> 01:07:13,112
I told him I'd ask you about it first.

1059
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:15,031
"Kang Bo-geol"?

1060
01:07:17,616 --> 01:07:19,493
That guy upstairs who looked jobless?

1061
01:07:20,077 --> 01:07:22,163
Exactly. That's him.

1062
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:26,125
So he was a producer.

1063
01:07:26,208 --> 01:07:29,295
No wonder. Is that why he looked familiar?

1064
01:07:29,378 --> 01:07:30,379
What do you say?

1065
01:07:30,463 --> 01:07:33,257
Do you like this new gig that I booked?

1066
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:40,473
Ran-joo, I looked into it a bit.

1067
01:07:41,348 --> 01:07:45,269
Many singers overcame
their vocal nodules with a straw.

1068
01:07:45,352 --> 01:07:47,521
Put this in your mouth
instead of cigarettes

1069
01:07:47,605 --> 01:07:48,773
from now on.

1070
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:54,236
By the way, what song
should you sing on the show?

1071
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:56,489
There are so many songs to choose from.

1072
01:07:56,572 --> 01:07:59,283
Should we go with "Someday"
since it's trending online?

1073
01:08:01,202 --> 01:08:03,871
I've tried the straw method before.
It didn't do much.

1074
01:08:04,955 --> 01:08:05,956
Ran-joo.

1075
01:08:06,457 --> 01:08:09,126
This is a rare chance for you.
You shouldn't give up--

1076
01:08:09,210 --> 01:08:12,213
I won't give up performing
on stage. Never.

1077
01:08:14,256 --> 01:08:15,257
However,

1078
01:08:15,841 --> 01:08:17,009
you do the singing.

1079
01:08:18,594 --> 01:08:19,762
Sing "That Night."

1080
01:08:21,055 --> 01:08:21,889
What?

1081
01:08:21,972 --> 01:08:23,849
You did it at the Deodeok Festival.

1082
01:08:24,433 --> 01:08:25,518
Let's do it again.

1083
01:08:26,852 --> 01:08:29,605
It'll benefit both of us.

1084
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:31,941
Well…

1085
01:08:32,566 --> 01:08:35,653
Ran-joo, that's still a bit…

1086
01:08:37,196 --> 01:08:38,197
Don't you want

1087
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:40,574
to find Ki-ho?

1088
01:08:44,203 --> 01:08:46,872
How do you know Ki-ho?

1089
01:08:47,498 --> 01:08:50,334
The lyrics of "That Night"
are from his words.

1090
01:08:51,502 --> 01:08:52,711
From Ki-ho?

1091
01:08:53,379 --> 01:08:55,381
Did you meet him before?

1092
01:08:56,465 --> 01:08:57,466
Yes.

1093
01:08:58,092 --> 01:09:01,387
It was more than a decade ago.

1094
01:09:07,268 --> 01:09:08,602
There's Ran-joo!

1095
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:10,229
-Ran-joo!
-Ran-joo!

1096
01:09:10,938 --> 01:09:13,691
He visited my house.

1097
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:16,569
I thought he was a fan at first,

1098
01:09:17,236 --> 01:09:18,445
but I was wrong.

1099
01:09:24,034 --> 01:09:27,872
I was curious, so I asked why he came.

1100
01:09:28,873 --> 01:09:29,957
That's when he said…

1101
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:31,041
Here.

1102
01:09:32,209 --> 01:09:33,252
If this girl

1103
01:09:34,461 --> 01:09:36,422
ever visits you one day,

1104
01:09:37,339 --> 01:09:39,049
please call out her name.

1105
01:09:40,509 --> 01:09:41,886
Seo Mok-ha.

1106
01:09:44,096 --> 01:09:45,097
"Seo Mok-ha."

1107
01:09:46,265 --> 01:09:48,642
Please remember that name.

1108
01:09:50,352 --> 01:09:52,479
Please hear her out.

1109
01:09:56,901 --> 01:09:58,110
Please help her.

1110
01:09:59,528 --> 01:10:00,779
Please give her a chance.

1111
01:10:02,448 --> 01:10:03,449
And…

1112
01:10:04,617 --> 01:10:05,618
please…

1113
01:10:07,578 --> 01:10:08,579
give her a hug.

1114
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:15,794
Goodness.

1115
01:10:16,503 --> 01:10:18,797
He asked me to give you a hug.

1116
01:10:24,929 --> 01:10:27,097
His request sounded

1117
01:10:27,723 --> 01:10:29,058
so desperate

1118
01:10:30,059 --> 01:10:31,560
that I wrote a song about it.

1119
01:10:31,644 --> 01:10:34,021
If you heard it,
I thought maybe you'd come find me.

1120
01:10:35,189 --> 01:10:36,607
But you never did.

1121
01:11:08,681 --> 01:11:12,351
So I'm still waiting for you

1122
01:11:14,812 --> 01:11:19,692
Like sand and sunlight

1123
01:11:19,775 --> 01:11:23,654
You escape through my fingers

1124
01:11:24,154 --> 01:11:29,368
Like the moment two clock hands meet

1125
01:11:29,910 --> 01:11:33,455
Our time together was too brief

1126
01:11:33,539 --> 01:11:38,210
Countless days and nights

1127
01:11:38,961 --> 01:11:43,257
The sun rose and fell a thousand times

1128
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:47,928
But I'm still waiting there

1129
01:11:48,595 --> 01:11:52,808
On the night of July 1

1130
01:11:55,185 --> 01:11:59,898
I will wait for you
No matter how long it takes

1131
01:12:00,482 --> 01:12:04,653
At the end of your long journey

1132
01:12:04,737 --> 01:12:10,159
I'll lend you my shoulder to let you rest

1133
01:12:10,242 --> 01:12:13,620
And give you this song

1134
01:12:13,704 --> 01:12:16,790
So I'm still waiting for you

1135
01:12:26,508 --> 01:12:31,055
My long night has passed

1136
01:12:32,139 --> 01:12:35,684
And morning has finally dawned

1137
01:12:36,268 --> 01:12:40,773
I wonder when you look at the sky

1138
01:12:41,482 --> 01:12:45,194
Do you ever think about me?

1139
01:12:45,778 --> 01:12:50,324
Countless days and nights

1140
01:12:50,991 --> 01:12:55,120
The sun rose and fell a thousand times

1141
01:12:55,204 --> 01:12:59,958
But I'm still waiting there

1142
01:13:00,709 --> 01:13:04,755
On the night of July 1

1143
01:13:04,838 --> 01:13:09,843
I will wait for you
No matter how long it takes

1144
01:13:09,927 --> 01:13:14,390
At the end of your long journey

1145
01:13:14,473 --> 01:13:19,144
I'll lend you my shoulder to let you rest

1146
01:13:19,895 --> 01:13:23,315
And give you this song

1147
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:26,610
So I'm still waiting for you

1148
01:13:27,319 --> 01:13:31,573
Like the countless stars in the sky

1149
01:13:32,157 --> 01:13:36,328
Countless days I wait for pass

1150
01:13:36,995 --> 01:13:41,875
Those days I've dreamed of

1151
01:13:42,584 --> 01:13:46,839
When they finally come to me

1152
01:13:46,922 --> 01:13:51,969
I will wait for you
No matter how long it takes

1153
01:13:52,052 --> 01:13:56,306
At the end of your long journey

1154
01:13:56,390 --> 01:14:01,854
I'll lend you my shoulder to let you rest

1155
01:14:01,937 --> 01:14:04,481
And give you this song

1156
01:14:05,482 --> 01:14:08,694
So I'm still waiting for you

1157
01:14:14,867 --> 01:14:18,745
So I'm still waiting for you

1158
01:14:27,087 --> 01:14:29,840
CASTAWAY DIVA

1159
01:15:00,412 --> 01:15:02,039
Are you that desperate to find him?

1160
01:15:02,122 --> 01:15:02,956
Where the hell is he?

1161
01:15:03,540 --> 01:15:04,917
I hurt my head in an accident.

1162
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,252
So I don't remember anything
before high school.

1163
01:15:07,336 --> 01:15:10,589
You need to beat me at all costs.

1164
01:15:10,672 --> 01:15:12,508
That'll be the start of everything.

1165
01:15:12,591 --> 01:15:14,468
If you win…

1166
01:15:15,802 --> 01:15:17,804
I'll prove to the world I was right.

1167
01:15:18,263 --> 01:15:19,973
-Thanks to us!
-Thanks to us!

1168
01:15:20,557 --> 01:15:21,642
Mok-ha.

1169
01:15:22,267 --> 01:15:23,560
I think we can find Ki-ho.

1170
01:15:24,144 --> 01:15:26,688
You're Ki-ho, right?

1171
01:15:30,859 --> 01:15:32,861
