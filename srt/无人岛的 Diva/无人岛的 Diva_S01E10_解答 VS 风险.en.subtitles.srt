1
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:55,054
CASTAWAY DIVA

2
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:56,556
Here.

3
00:00:58,224 --> 00:00:59,851
What is this?

4
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,312
MEDICINE

5
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:04,439
Please take good care of Bo-geol.

6
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:07,275
Oh, dear.

7
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,445
Goodness, well…

8
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:12,280
Well, you see…

9
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:14,157
He's not hurt too badly.

10
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:16,409
And so…

11
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:19,245
He wasn't trying
to hide it from you. But he…

12
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:21,498
Come on. I know he was trying to hide it.

13
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:22,582
I'll play dumb.

14
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:29,714
Do you know Jung Bong-wan well, right?

15
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:34,177
Yes. Well, I do know him a little.

16
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:38,389
Is he…

17
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:41,267
better-looking than me?

18
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:43,102
Goodness.

19
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:44,938
He can't hold a candle to you.

20
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:47,273
Yes. I knew it.

21
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:59,244
He won't give up, will he?

22
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,581
No.

23
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:08,253
If we report him,
our identities will be exposed.

24
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:11,881
But if we don't,
we'll keep living in fear.

25
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:15,135
I don't know what to do.

26
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:21,432
What would you do if you were me?

27
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:22,600
Goodness.

28
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,520
What would I know?

29
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:31,901
But Mr. Kang.

30
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:35,363
Ki-ho… I mean,

31
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:40,535
Bo-geol said this to me once.

32
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:42,370
Enough with the lies now.

33
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:45,915
I get you had good intentions
and no other choice.

34
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,125
But a lie is a lie.

35
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:50,295
He said the more we lied,

36
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,423
the more our weakness would grow.

37
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:57,010
He said it'll get out of control.

38
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:01,931
Well,

39
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,392
was that a good enough answer?

40
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:07,812
Thanks.

41
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:13,026
So there was a solution after all.

42
00:03:17,196 --> 00:03:18,781
I'm sorry, Mr. Kang.

43
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:40,595
-Dad.
-Hey, Woo-hak.

44
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,308
You said you were learning
flower arrangement.

45
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:46,935
Have you been buying them?

46
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:49,437
Yes. You see…

47
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,647
Why did you lie?

48
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:53,942
Where have you been instead all this time?

49
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,824
Woo-hak. We need to talk.

50
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,285
Why do you keep lying?
You're making me nervous.

51
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,080
Woo-hak.

52
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:10,250
I…

53
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:13,336
confessed to the police

54
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,838
about committing identity theft.

55
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,216
What?

56
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,804
I've used this as an excuse
to visit the police for questioning.

57
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:25,598
Dad.

58
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:30,728
I came clean before it was too late.

59
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:35,066
But why?

60
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,568
Why did you do that?

61
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:39,988
As people say,

62
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:42,907
the more you hide your crime,
the bigger the price.

63
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,451
Before it gets any bigger…

64
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:48,663
we should pay for our crime.

65
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:55,295
Do you know Ms. Shin
from the butcher's shop?

66
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:56,212
Yes.

67
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:59,424
She wants your autograph.

68
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:01,259
On this candy box?

69
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:02,218
Yeah.

70
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,554
These are why
she's been coming here for six years.

71
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,807
Sign this one for me.

72
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:09,934
Goodness!

73
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,644
This came out really nice!

74
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:14,147
Can you print me one too?

75
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,189
Okay.

76
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:18,901
I'll tell my husband to print one more
once he comes back from his class.

77
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,411
I'm sorry. We're closed for…

78
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:48,181
You haven't changed at all.

79
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:51,142
You're exactly the same.

80
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:53,770
How did you find this place?

81
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:56,564
I'd been dying to know
how all of you were doing.

82
00:05:58,149 --> 00:05:59,484
Weren't you ever curious

83
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:01,319
about how I was doing?

84
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:04,572
Get out.

85
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:06,532
I can't do that.

86
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:10,328
After all I went through to find you?

87
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,998
Where's Ki-ho?

88
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:15,875
He's not here.

89
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:18,836
Where are you?

90
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:21,339
Then, I'll wait.

91
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:26,385
I'm almost there.
I'll arrive in four minutes.

92
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:30,139
Bo-geol. Remember that dumpling soup
we had last time?

93
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,391
The one you had to wait
in line an hour for.

94
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:34,560
Is that place still open right now?

95
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:40,566
Mr. Jung.

96
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:43,194
Ki-ho won't be coming.

97
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:45,696
So you were here too.

98
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:47,198
Yes.

99
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:50,618
He's on a business trip
and won't be returning today.

100
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,550
Okay. I'll go buy some.

101
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:18,479
So I was right.

102
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:23,151
You were living
with them all along, Mok-ha.

103
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,657
Why did you lie to me?

104
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:50,136
You look very happy,

105
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,181
Jae-kyung.

106
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:57,768
Why did you come here?

107
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:01,022
Do I need a reason to see my wife?

108
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,275
I'd like you to leave.

109
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:09,030
I'm going to call the police if you don't.

110
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:13,367
Call them.

111
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:16,287
Let's ask them once they arrive.

112
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,539
I came here looking for my family,

113
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:20,291
and we'll see if it's illegal or not.

114
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,297
Then, the police will investigate…

115
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:29,467
your real identities.

116
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:36,724
What do you want?

117
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:37,850
Come home.

118
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,230
It's the same house as before.

119
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:46,108
Bring Chae-ho and Ki-ho too.

120
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:49,153
Then, I'll sweep your sins

121
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,323
under the rug.

122
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:58,746
Hello? Is this the police?

123
00:08:58,829 --> 00:08:59,956
Mok-ha.

124
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:04,168
This is Brothers Salon
on Hyeseo-ro in Gangjung-gu.

125
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:05,753
Mok-ha, you little…

126
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:06,837
Don't come near me!

127
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,590
The man who stalked me

128
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,592
is now at my workplace

129
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,219
and causing a scene.

130
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:20,351
You have no idea what you're doing.

131
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:23,563
Goodness. He's even threatening me now.

132
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,189
Please hurry!

133
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:28,484
Well done.

134
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,403
I'll go to the police

135
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:32,196
and report all of you.

136
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:33,864
Be my guest.

137
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,537
Honey, you should leave.

138
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,372
Woo-hak, go outside.

139
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:43,291
"Honey"?

140
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:45,751
But reporting us won't make a difference,

141
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:47,878
because I've already confessed.

142
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:52,633
It was you.

143
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,719
You seduced my wife

144
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:58,764
-and took my sons away from me!
-No, Mr. Jung!

145
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,308
Mok-ha!

146
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,734
You son of a…

147
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:41,474
Woo-hak, stop. Don't do it!

148
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,267
Honey!

149
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:44,352
Stop!

150
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:47,480
Don't do it!

151
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,482
You must be…

152
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:52,401
Chae-ho.

153
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:53,986
Shut up.

154
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,491
You've grown well,

155
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:00,951
my son.

156
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,581
Shut up!

157
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,541
No, Woo-hak! That's enough!

158
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:08,542
Let me go!

159
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,002
Stop!

160
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:11,629
No! Let go. Don't!

161
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:13,172
-Let me go!
-Woo-hak!

162
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:14,340
-Let go!
-Woo-hak!

163
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:15,549
Don't!

164
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,010
Woo-hak!

165
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:19,512
-Woo-hak!
-Let me go!

166
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:20,554
No!

167
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,056
Woo-hak!

168
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:07,184
Hey.

169
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,066
What happened?

170
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,151
Are you okay?

171
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:17,278
Yeah.

172
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:23,492
Woo-hak hurt his shoulder a bit
and went to the hospital.

173
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:25,578
I just got a call from him.

174
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,329
He's all right.

175
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:31,542
Everyone is fine.

176
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:39,341
It's all over now.

177
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,100
Mok-ha!

178
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:00,821
He's good to go.

179
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:01,906
Thank you.

180
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,259
Ki-ho.

181
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:07,263
After seeing your father,

182
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:11,058
I finally understood why you hid the past

183
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:13,185
from your brother.

184
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:16,146
Your father

185
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:18,107
doesn't deserve anything.

186
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:21,026
He doesn't deserve to be remembered.

187
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:24,071
He doesn't deserve to be happy.

188
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,324
He deserves nothing.

189
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:30,995
He's no better than a stranger.

190
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:34,623
So now…

191
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:37,668
don't waste

192
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,754
any emotions

193
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:42,840
or time

194
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:45,801
on your father.

195
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:49,722
It's not worth being angry at him either.

196
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,351
So just…

197
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,854
forget about him.

198
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:00,107
Just like how you erased him

199
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:02,693
from your brother's memory,

200
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:05,529
erase him completely

201
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:09,199
from your memory too.

202
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:51,450
FORENSICS

203
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:13,138
Try to keep them back!

204
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:23,440
-Weren't two of them kids?
-Yes, it's so sad.

205
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:24,441
Goodness.

206
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:25,859
They must've been dead so long

207
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:29,154
-that their bones became stark white.
-Right.

208
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,824
We said you can't come in!

209
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:34,201
-Tell them to back off!
-Please step back!

210
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:36,036
Just keep them back!

211
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:39,498
It's been at least 20 years,
given the amount of corrosion.

212
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:42,459
Was there anything
that could help identify them?

213
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,420
We found ID cards and a suicide letter.

214
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:48,173
We'd need to investigate further,
but they may have all committed suicide.

215
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:51,010
-Keep them back!
-Kang Sang-doo was the father.

216
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,594
Song Ha-jung was the mother.

217
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:55,347
We think the child skeletons
belong to their kids.

218
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:58,142
Kang Woo-hak and Kang Bo-geol
were their names.

219
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:04,773
The remains of a family
that had gone missing in 2002

220
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,900
in Woldo, North Chungcheong Province

221
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:09,611
were found with their car
in Lake Pacheong on the 30th.

222
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:13,282
After identifying the deceased,
authorities discovered

223
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:16,493
a family in Gangjung-gu, Seoul
had stolen their identities

224
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,412
-for the past 15 years…
-Mom!

225
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:20,080
…leaving many in disbelief.

226
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:23,876
Lee, who turned himself
in for committing identity theft,

227
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:27,087
was working in an office in Woldo-eup
in 2007 when he met Yang

228
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:30,382
who had run away after being
a victim of domestic violence.

229
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:33,469
To protect Yang and her two sons,

230
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:36,055
he claims he stole the identities
of the missing family

231
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:38,599
and they pretended to be a family.

232
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:42,686
The police
are currently investigating the case

233
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:45,939
based on the statements
given by Lee and his family.

234
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:47,149
-Ahn Dong-min.
-Meanwhile,

235
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,151
the sons of the accused family

236
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:53,030
are currently working
as a reporter and TV show producer.

237
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:57,618
Some have expressed concerns
about the authenticity of their work.

238
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:59,745
Neither the brothers nor their employers

239
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:01,830
have released any statements,

240
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:05,000
and it seems it will take time
before the controversy subsides.

241
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,085
TEMPORARILY CLOSED

242
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:15,344
I was right.

243
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,387
I wasn't sure, but it really was them.

244
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:19,098
Unbelievable.

245
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,850
How could they fake identities
for over a decade?

246
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,936
I heard she ran away from her husband.

247
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,896
Domestic abuse, apparently.

248
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:28,774
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

249
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:45,916
I bet they were having an affair.

250
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:47,960
-Goodness.
-I asked her last time

251
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:49,545
about how they met.

252
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:53,549
She said it was love at first sight,
because he was gentle and handsome.

253
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:57,886
So she did cheat.
It was definitely an affair.

254
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,556
I pity her ex-husband.

255
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,724
Then, what about their kids?

256
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,977
Those ingrates abandoned their own father.

257
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,895
And I'd been going there for six years.

258
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,689
That's so terrifying.

259
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,152
Ma'am.

260
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:14,820
Here.

261
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:16,780
What is this?

262
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:19,366
I heard you asked
Ms. Song for my autograph.

263
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:22,536
Did I?

264
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,082
Can I ask you something?

265
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:29,293
Sure.

266
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:35,132
A woman who remembers what candy
her regular customer of six years likes.

267
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,217
And her customers making false rumors

268
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:40,137
to turn her into an adulterer
and her sons into ingrates.

269
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:43,223
Which do you think is more terrifying?

270
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:45,142
I'd say the latter.

271
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:49,563
If I'd been a regular here for six years,

272
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:53,108
I would've wondered what hurt
her leg so bad to make her limp.

273
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:56,153
I would've wondered why she had
to change her name and run away.

274
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:59,990
I would've felt so bad
about how desperate she must have been.

275
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:03,660
Instead of hurting her
by spreading false rumors,

276
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,662
if I'd known her for six years,

277
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:08,457
I would've tried to support her!

278
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:15,005
I…

279
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:17,799
I didn't spread any rumors.

280
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,093
I didn't mean what I said.

281
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:23,931
Why is she so upset?
She's not even their family.

282
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:28,185
I guess birds of a feather
do flock together.

283
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:29,686
Goodness.

284
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:39,404
ANSWERS VS. RISKS

285
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:46,328
Bo-geol.

286
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,960
Mom. Dad. Can you help me?

287
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,713
-I can help.
-Goodness.

288
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:58,966
No, I can do it by myself.

289
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:01,593
-Come here. Let me do it for you.
-No, I can do it.

290
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:03,679
Just stay still.

291
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:16,358
If it weren't for you,

292
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,652
I would've been hurt.

293
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:20,821
Thanks.

294
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:24,324
If it weren't for you,
I would've done something I regretted.

295
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:26,743
So we're even.

296
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:42,050
Woo-hak.

297
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,344
It seemed like

298
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:47,097
you knew a few things about the law.

299
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:48,598
I do.

300
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:50,767
I started as a legal journalist.

301
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:55,355
Then, in regards to identity theft,

302
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:58,775
is there a way to be found innocent?

303
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,781
No, that'd be difficult.

304
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:06,908
What should we do?

305
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:09,286
Is there absolutely no way?

306
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:13,498
When you're questioned,

307
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,917
giving an honest statement would help.

308
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:17,419
Me?

309
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,588
To show extenuating circumstances…

310
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:20,797
Let me confirm the dates.

311
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:23,467
"It was difficult to be protected
by the law back then."

312
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:27,429
"We had change our identities
to run away from domestic violence."

313
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:29,348
We must make this appeal in court.

314
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:30,515
…entire body had bruises.

315
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:34,478
To do that, we have to prove
our father was a violent man.

316
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:36,480
Right.

317
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:41,777
That's why we need someone
not in our family who's witnessed

318
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,029
and suffered from his abuse
to give a statement.

319
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:46,114
Like you.

320
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:50,327
So please don't be lenient with him.

321
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:54,039
Don't feel any pity
or sympathy for him either.

322
00:22:57,417 --> 00:22:58,418
I don't have any.

323
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:00,879
I don't feel that way at all.

324
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:15,143
Here you go.

325
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:19,773
When I got your text to come here,

326
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:22,442
I knew Lady Luck was on my side.

327
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:25,654
If it had been some random detective,

328
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:28,281
explaining my story
would've been a headache.

329
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:30,492
Is that so?

330
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:34,579
But Bong-wan,
you have so many charges against you.

331
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:37,374
You refused to be evicted,
committed assault,

332
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:39,584
committed property damage…

333
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:41,545
How is the other investigation going?

334
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:43,505
I heard they found

335
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,423
the original family's remains.

336
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:48,343
I'm sure the investigation team
will take care of that case.

337
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:50,178
Now, let's begin the questioning.

338
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:52,139
You're wrong.

339
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:55,267
That investigation
should precede this one.

340
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:57,519
Once the police say
those people are my family,

341
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:59,521
I won't be charged with anything.

342
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:01,857
You stalked Ms. Seo Mok-ha.

343
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,024
Did she say that?

344
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,234
That I stalked her?

345
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:06,987
Seo Mok-ha's an accomplice too.

346
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:09,656
She helped them,
knowing they stole identities.

347
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:14,870
Bong-wan.

348
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:18,290
This is my last piece of advice
to you as a former colleague.

349
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:22,085
If you keep up this attitude
both here and in court,

350
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:23,461
it won't do you any good.

351
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:26,089
It's clear as day that you broke the law.

352
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:28,925
Nothing will change
even if they turn out to be your family.

353
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:32,053
They're my wife and kids!

354
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:34,681
They're mine, not that bastard's!

355
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:38,059
Why is it illegal for me to see my family?

356
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:42,939
Because they don't want to see you.

357
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:46,693
Despite being family,
if the victims don't want to see you,

358
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:49,070
you can still be punished
for refusing eviction,

359
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:50,488
committing assault, and stalking.

360
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:51,406
So Bong-wan,

361
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:54,242
show some remorse and be more careful.

362
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:57,871
Do this again, and I'll have to
request an arrest warrant.

363
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:00,832
Do you understand,

364
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:02,584
Mr. Jung Bong-wan?

365
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:16,264
What can we do

366
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:19,017
to put Mr. Jung behind bars?

367
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:22,938
Look.

368
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:26,316
There's no point in asking me.

369
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:29,569
As I said, once the case
is handed over, I'm out of the loop.

370
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:32,781
You should visit the detective in charge.

371
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,991
I did.

372
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:37,452
And they've barely made progress.

373
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:39,496
There's video proof of Mr. Jung

374
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:42,249
breaking into the car with the hornets,

375
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:44,542
but they said I needed
more solid evidence.

376
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:47,087
How can I do that
when I don't know what it means?

377
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:48,588
Don't you think so?

378
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:51,716
They just want to be sure
before arresting him.

379
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,344
If they present some mediocre evidence,

380
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:56,554
nothing might even come of it.

381
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:57,639
Unbelievable.

382
00:25:58,181 --> 00:26:00,141
So what exactly do they want?

383
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:02,894
Oh, dear.

384
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:05,021
What could it be?

385
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:08,692
Maybe the victim's statement?

386
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:14,531
I truly wish we could do that.

387
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:17,534
But Dae-woong…

388
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:21,496
is still unconscious.

389
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:31,464
Gosh, President Lee.
I loved your approach shot.

390
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:33,341
Have you been taking lessons?

391
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,093
Lessons?

392
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:38,138
I've been too busy preparing IR documents.

393
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:40,557
-Four glasses of beer, please.
-Sure.

394
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:42,642
I read through them.

395
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:45,687
But we still consider
Ms. Yoon's shares issue

396
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:47,063
as a risk.

397
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:50,191
I told you that was taken care of.
Do you not believe me?

398
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,819
If you're investment,
you don't trust people.

399
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:53,903
You trust documents.

400
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:57,407
We trust the documents,
so that's why we're here today.

401
00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:01,661
We're also concerned how she appeared
on TV to claim her shares.

402
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,289
I guess we'll have to
show you the proof then.

403
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:05,373
I understand.

404
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:07,917
Hello, President Lee.

405
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:09,627
Fancy seeing you here.

406
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:14,591
It's been a long time.

407
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:18,553
Yes. Enjoy the rest of your round.

408
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:20,347
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

409
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:25,143
Who is he?

410
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:29,731
I recognize his face,
but I don't remember who he is.

411
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:31,483
That happens to us often as well.

412
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,903
It's flustering to meet people
in places like this.

413
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,377
My goodness.

414
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,503
My nose is bleeding.

415
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:54,798
This rarely happens.

416
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:56,132
What's the matter?

417
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:57,092
Are you okay?

418
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:58,176
I have a nosebleed.

419
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:00,929
Here.

420
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:02,514
Goodness.

421
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:05,392
It must be
because I pulled an all-nighter.

422
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:08,728
The last time this happened was
when I worked on Yong-gwan's album.

423
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:10,814
Are you seriously happy about this?

424
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:12,982
It just shows that I'm working hard.

425
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:14,692
It's okay. I'll take over now.

426
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:21,241
You still haven't signed
the termination form yet?

427
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:24,744
I'll sign it soon, so don't worry.

428
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:26,704
I just have something to check.

429
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:27,789
Check?

430
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:31,251
I learned a lesson thanks to someone.

431
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:33,503
No matter how safe it seems, always look

432
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:35,630
before you leap.

433

CRIMINAL LAW PRECEDENTS

434
00:28:58,361 --> 00:28:59,362
Bo-geol.

435
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:00,989
Yeah?

436
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:03,616
If Mok-ha hadn't stopped me that day…

437
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:08,037
do you think I would've done it?

438
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:22,719
Did you get a text too?

439
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,765
THIS IS DETECTIVE KIM JI-HUN
FROM GANGJUNG POLICE STATION

440
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:29,142
Yeah. It's our turn now.

441
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:30,685
What should I tell them?

442
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:33,271
Just be honest.

443
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:36,566
"I lost my memory.
I didn't know about the identity theft."

444
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:37,817
Because it's true.

445
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:40,737
-What about you?
-Me?

446
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:47,160
I'll have to say that I knew
but still feigned ignorance.

447
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:50,246
You could end up behind bars.
Say you didn't know either

448
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:52,415
and you thought we just changed names.

449
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:54,542
Then, it could end with just fines.

450
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:58,588
-Hello?
-Don't ignore me.

451
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:00,840
It's me. Yoon Ran-joo.

452
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:03,134
I had something to ask.

453
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:05,303
Yes, I'm listening.

454
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:09,224
Remember when Mok-ha said
she wanted to give up and disappeared?

455
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:11,309
Yes.

456
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:13,144
Was that

457
00:30:14,395 --> 00:30:16,564
because of you?

458
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:19,192
Yes.

459
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,738
Can you spare me some time right now?

DAFFODIL

463
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:49,866
Hey, you made it.

464
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,216
Why…

465
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:55,056
Why did you want to see me here?

466
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:58,351
Because I wanted to show you this place.

467
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:09,862
When President Hwang told me
to become a singer…

468
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:17,245
You can't decide her future
based on superstition.

469
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:18,579
He and my mom

470
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:21,040
brought me all the way here
from Chunsam Island.

471
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:27,630
The owner of this bar
was a very well-known fortune teller.

472
00:33:28,756 --> 00:33:31,843
I don't know if she had
a good ear or a good eye.

473
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:33,428
But anyway,

474
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:37,306
she knew exactly whether or not
you'd make it as a singer.

475
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:40,518
Ma'am, please take a look at her.

476
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:42,311
Does she have potential?

477
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:47,358
Her teacher and I
will have to bet our lives on her.

478
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:50,903
So we need to be sure of her potential.

479
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:54,157
We don't want to waste our time and money.

480
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:02,123
Do you see those autographs?

481
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,296
They all came here

482
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:10,548
and bought this.

483
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:13,259
Those who didn't buy one
never became famous.

484
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:15,094
So what do you say?

485
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,055
Do you want one too?

486
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:24,187
How much can you give me?

487
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:27,190
You need to pay me more than they did.

488
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:28,608
You can't have it otherwise.

489
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:34,864
Say 100,000 won.

490
00:34:40,953 --> 00:34:41,954
So how much?

491
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:51,547
Goodness, look at you.

492
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:55,843
You can bet your life on her.

493
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:01,182
She'll be performing
on stage until she's 60.

494
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:02,725
Do you mean that?

495
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:04,811
I knew it.

496
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:06,729
I'll dedicate my entire life to you.

497
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:20,535
What a liar.

498
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:25,248
Until I'm 60, my foot.

499
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:28,543
How much did you say you'd give her?

500
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:33,131
All the money I had.

501
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:36,551
And all the money I'd make.

502
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:42,557
I guess your lie was a bit excessive too.

503
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,016
It wasn't a lie.

504
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:46,811
I truly meant it.

505
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:49,480
That was how desperate I was.

506
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:52,191
That's why I want to ask you.

507
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:54,360
How serious are you?

508
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:56,445
How desperate are you?

509
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:02,827
I'll decide based on your reply

510
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:05,538
whether to produce your album or not.

511
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,249
You want

512
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:10,459
to produce my album?

513
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:12,753
-You don't want that?
-No, that's not why.

514
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:13,838
I'd love that.

515
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:15,923
I truly want that.

516
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:18,134
You can't give up midway
like Yong-gwan did.

517
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:19,969
You can never give up.

518
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:21,429
Okay.

519
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:22,471
You bet I won't.

520
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:24,098
I'll never give up.

521
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:25,474
You did once.

522
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,020
That was because…

523
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:34,775
I won't do it again. Ever.

524
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:36,402
Then,

525
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:39,113
can you cut ties…

526
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:41,741
with Producer Kang's family?

527
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:43,951
Sorry?

528
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,663
See? You can't even answer me.

529
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:49,457
You said you'd never give up.

530
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:51,834
Well…

531
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:54,462
Ran-joo, that's--

532
00:36:54,962 --> 00:36:56,088
I saw the news.

533
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:59,383
And Producer Kang
briefed me on everything.

534
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,802
I know that he's Jung Ki-ho.

535
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:04,597
You know everything?

536
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:06,557
Yes.

537
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,061
I also know you had no choice.

538
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:13,606
My heart breaks for you.

539
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:16,275
But others don't know that.

540
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:19,153
You think they'll understand everything?

541
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:22,114
"So that's why he committed
identity theft. Poor him."

542
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:23,783
You think they'll be supportive?

543
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:26,702
He's nothing but a criminal to them.

544
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:28,746
Getting involved with him

545
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:31,666
will create a scandal for you
and pose a risk for me.

546
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:35,503
But Ran-joo, isn't that something

547
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:40,007
we should worry about
once I actually become a singer?

548
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:43,261
That issue hasn't even come up yet.

549
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:45,888
I don't think we should worry in advance.

550
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,849
I think we're getting ahead of ourselves.

551
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:50,643
You think this won't become an issue?

552
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:53,646
I'm totally certain it will.

553
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:00,278
I'm giving up my shares
and pride to give my all to you.

554
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:02,238
But you think I'm getting ahead of myself.

555
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:05,449
How can I trust you
when you can't even trust yourself?

556
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:06,367
No.

557
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,786
No one in this world
would be able to trust you.

558
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:12,290
I can't give you a lot of time.

559
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:14,792
Give me an answer by tomorrow.

560
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:52,663
Do you think you're a hero or something?

561
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:54,582
If I knock, then what?

562
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:56,208
Then, I'll leave this island

563
00:38:57,793 --> 00:38:58,794
with you.

564
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:03,632
I'll take you to Yoon Ran-joo
without your father knowing.

565
00:40:10,866 --> 00:40:12,910
SUGAR AGENCY

566
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:16,122
SUGAR AGENCY LEE SEO-JUN

567
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:40,563
I thought no one was moving in
since it was empty for months.

568
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:42,064
Are you the one moving in?

569
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:43,691
No.

570
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:45,734
Thank you.

571
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:37,953
Thank you.

572
00:42:23,165 --> 00:42:24,708
How serious are you?

573
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:26,627
How desperate are you?

574
00:42:27,169 --> 00:42:29,255
I'll decide based on your reply

575
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:31,840
whether to produce your album or not.

576
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:43,727
If you keep worrying about the future,

577
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:46,230
then you'll end up

578
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:50,359
with just as many regrets down the road.

579
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,695
From now on, I'm going to do

580
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:54,989
whatever I want in that moment.

581
00:46:13,812 --> 00:46:15,189
Goodness, you startled me!

582
00:46:17,357 --> 00:46:18,442
Did you go somewhere?

583
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:20,277
Or are you going somewhere?

584
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:23,155
To the convenience store…

585
00:46:23,238 --> 00:46:24,156
I mean,

586
00:46:24,698 --> 00:46:29,495
I'm going to go practice…
No. What was it again?

587
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:37,586
Are you leaving?

588
00:46:44,927 --> 00:46:46,595
Yes, I am.

589
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:49,598
I'm leaving.

590
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:54,144
You told me to make
my autograph worth 3.2 billion won.

591
00:46:55,687 --> 00:46:57,564
Then, staying here

592
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:59,024
isn't the answer.

593
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:01,860
It'll only hold me back.

594
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:04,404
I was stranded on an island for 15 years,

595
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:07,032
so I already have
tons of things holding me back.

596
00:47:07,115 --> 00:47:09,284
I can't afford any scandals
on top of that.

597
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:14,790
What's the matter?

598
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:17,000
Are you shocked?

599
00:47:19,044 --> 00:47:20,546
This is the true me.

600
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:24,800
I'm a thug who even ate
her bird friend's eggs.

601
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:32,057
I've been pretending
all this time to be nice.

602
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:34,935
But I'm going to be honest from now on.

603
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:39,022
I'm in no position
to mind manners. Don't you agree?

604
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:52,304
I looked for a place
as soon as I found you on the island.

605
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:57,976
But Woo-hak brought you
to our rooftop without telling me.

606
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:02,356
I thought you'd never use it,
but here you are.

607
00:49:13,533 --> 00:49:14,785
The towels are in there.

608
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:17,579
You can control the AC
and heating with that.

609
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:20,582
You can also see who's outside
when they ring the doorbell.

610
00:49:23,335 --> 00:49:24,586
What are you doing?

611
00:49:30,175 --> 00:49:31,677
If you do this,

612
00:49:32,844 --> 00:49:35,430
then I'll really seem
like the most disloyal

613
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:37,099
and disrespectful jerk ever.

614
00:49:38,266 --> 00:49:41,019
Even if I cut you out of my life

615
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:42,938
and gave it 100% to work like a dog,

616
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:44,648
no one knows if I'll become a singer.

617
00:49:45,857 --> 00:49:46,858
So if you do this--

618
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:48,318
That's what I want as well.

619
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:51,655
Cut ties with our entire family.

620
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:54,408
Work like a dog and become a singer.

621
00:49:54,908 --> 00:49:55,909
But…

622
00:50:01,373 --> 00:50:02,374
instead of 100%,

623
00:50:02,999 --> 00:50:04,292
just give it 99%.

624
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:06,128
Save that 1%.

625
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,588
Or it'll be stifling.

626
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:14,928
If you feel like you've hit a wall

627
00:50:15,011 --> 00:50:17,556
and can barely keep your head above water,

628
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:23,103
then come to the rooftop,
and it'll be vacant for you.

629
00:50:27,065 --> 00:50:29,443
If your father becomes violent again,

630
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:31,111
don't go to the police station.

631
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:32,696
Come to me.

632
00:50:35,824 --> 00:50:37,492
Why…

633
00:50:39,327 --> 00:50:41,204
are you always telling me to come?

634
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:54,009
Only come if it doesn't work out.

635
00:50:54,092 --> 00:50:55,302
But try not to.

636
00:50:56,803 --> 00:50:58,930
If you make it and move to a bigger house,

637
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:02,100
that's the best I can hope for.

638
00:51:09,107 --> 00:51:10,150
Take care.

639
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:17,843
MENTEE

640
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:28,228
Hello?

641
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:32,440
Okay.

642
00:53:00,635 --> 00:53:02,470
Tell Mok-ha to come down for breakfast.

643
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:03,555
Okay.

644
00:53:04,055 --> 00:53:05,891
Mok-ha won't be coming down anymore.

645
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:10,270
What do you mean?

646
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:13,273
She moved out.
She's busy preparing for her debut.

647
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:17,694
She wanted me to thank you
for taking care of her.

648
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:19,946
Wait…

649
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:22,490
Even still,

650
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:24,993
she should've said goodbye to us.

651
00:53:25,076 --> 00:53:26,536
I told her not to.

652
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:30,040
We'd all break down and cry.
It'd be pathetic.

653
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:36,463
Don't bother. I told her not to pick up.

654
00:53:37,297 --> 00:53:38,298
Until when?

655
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:42,636
Forever?

656
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:46,056
Yes.

657
00:53:49,267 --> 00:53:50,477
Who are you to do that?

658
00:53:51,102 --> 00:53:53,855
Who said you could cut ties?
Why did you decide on your own?

659
00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:55,190
No, he did well.

660
00:53:55,273 --> 00:53:56,316
Dad.

661
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:58,234
It's best to cut ties now.

662
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:00,236
We've got too much on our plates.

663
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:01,821
We'll only be a burden to her.

664
00:54:02,989 --> 00:54:04,616
You did well.

665
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:11,081
Woo-hak.

666
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:12,791
I'll go.

667
00:54:24,552 --> 00:54:25,720
Are you okay?

668
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:28,139
Yes.

669
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:29,224
I'm all right.

670
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:40,295
Woo-hak.

671
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:44,466
At first, I really thought
I was Jung Ki-ho.

672
00:55:48,344 --> 00:55:50,055
That's when I started to like her.

673
00:55:53,266 --> 00:55:56,019
I wouldn't have done so
had I known it was Bo-geol.

674
00:55:57,312 --> 00:55:58,313
I know.

675
00:56:00,273 --> 00:56:02,150
You should've told me from the start.

676
00:56:04,235 --> 00:56:05,695
"Your name is Jung Chae-ho."

677
00:56:07,655 --> 00:56:10,158
You should've told me
so I wouldn't have liked her.

678
00:56:10,241 --> 00:56:11,993
Why was I the only one in the dark?

679
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:14,496
I'm sorry.

680
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:20,168
I tried to stop liking her
once I learned the truth.

681
00:56:21,294 --> 00:56:22,545
But it didn't work.

682
00:56:25,965 --> 00:56:28,676
I tried all I could,
but I couldn't stop my feelings.

683
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:38,770
It just didn't work, Dad.

684
00:56:50,323 --> 00:56:51,324
It's okay.

685
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:56,454
I'm sorry.

686
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:01,334
I'm so sorry.

687
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:09,843
Are you leaving now?

688
00:57:10,343 --> 00:57:11,344
Yes.

689
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:15,515
What's that?

690
00:57:16,349 --> 00:57:18,810
I'm sorry for being so late.
I finally signed it.

691
00:57:18,893 --> 00:57:19,978
Really?

692
00:57:20,603 --> 00:57:23,648
You look awfully happy.
Is it that much of a relief?

693
00:57:26,025 --> 00:57:27,652
Did you stay up all night again?

694
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:29,612
Can you tell?

695
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:30,697
Very much so.

696
00:57:31,698 --> 00:57:34,325
Get used to it.
This is how I'll look for some time.

697
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:38,204
Is Mok-ha's album
more important than the shares?

698
00:57:38,788 --> 00:57:40,498
Yes. At least for now.

699
00:57:40,582 --> 00:57:42,750
Is she really that great?

700
00:57:44,919 --> 00:57:46,379
It's not about that.

701
00:57:49,048 --> 00:57:50,550
She was the beginning

702
00:57:51,176 --> 00:57:52,635
for both our relationship

703
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:54,137
and RJ Entertainment.

704
00:57:55,388 --> 00:57:56,639
I'm aware of that.

705
00:57:56,723 --> 00:57:59,851
That was the sweetest decision
I had ever made.

706
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:02,395
I didn't care

707
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:04,439
about money or the future.

708
00:58:07,442 --> 00:58:09,736
I just don't want to regret that decision.

709
00:58:12,238 --> 00:58:14,908
I want both Mok-ha and us

710
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:16,159
to have a happy ending.

711
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:22,207
I'll be home late today.

712
00:59:02,163 --> 00:59:03,164
Mok-ha.

713
00:59:08,336 --> 00:59:09,712
Mok-ha, it's the other way.

714
00:59:21,015 --> 00:59:22,976
This song has a 6/8 time signature.

715
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:24,352
Being on rhythm is crucial.

716
00:59:24,435 --> 00:59:25,436
Are you ready?

717
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:28,731
Yes, I'm ready.

718
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:31,192
Let's begin.

719
00:59:40,994 --> 00:59:46,541
The cold days…

720
00:59:46,624 --> 00:59:49,377
No, you sound too stiff.
This isn't a children's song.

721
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:52,797
It's not "the cold days,"
but "the cold days."

722
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:54,090
Get into a rhythm.

723
00:59:55,049 --> 00:59:58,094
The cold…

724
00:59:58,177 --> 00:59:59,762
That sounds perfect.

725
00:59:59,846 --> 01:00:01,598
Get into a smooth rhythm

726
01:00:01,681 --> 01:00:03,933
and the words should stay connected.

727
01:00:04,017 --> 01:00:05,852
-Okay.
-Okay? Let's do that again.

728
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:07,979
-Let's start from the beginning.
-Okay.

729
01:00:08,062 --> 01:00:10,273
Mok-ha, bring out the emotions.

730
01:00:19,782 --> 01:00:22,994
The cold days

731
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:27,874
Pass by

732
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:31,169
Now you are…

733
01:00:31,252 --> 01:00:32,128
That's it.

734
01:00:32,211 --> 01:00:34,047
-I love it.
-It's great.

735
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:43,931
I'm on a path I didn't want to take

736
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:48,019
So it breaks my heart

737
01:00:48,102 --> 01:00:52,565
But I won't forget
Our beautiful memories…

738
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:54,025
Can you sign this, please?

739
01:00:54,984 --> 01:00:55,902
Okay.

740
01:00:55,985 --> 01:01:00,156
Even though we'll be apart for now

741
01:01:00,698 --> 01:01:04,619
Please don't cry in secret

742
01:01:04,702 --> 01:01:08,081
Cherish our memories...

743
01:01:08,164 --> 01:01:09,791
With lots of images of the ocean.

744
01:01:09,874 --> 01:01:11,918
In your heart...

745
01:01:12,001 --> 01:01:13,544
It's so pretty.

746
01:01:14,295 --> 01:01:18,216
As long as we're in the same world

747
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:22,637
I'll be content with that

748
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:27,392
Someday

749
01:01:27,475 --> 01:01:32,271
Somewhere

750
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:36,651
It may have been short-lived

751
01:01:36,734 --> 01:01:41,030
But our love was beautiful

752
01:01:41,114 --> 01:01:45,702
Although this pain can't be erased

753
01:01:45,785 --> 01:01:51,124
Please don't forget it

754
01:01:55,878 --> 01:01:56,963
I'll be off now.

755
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:00,049
Hey.

756
01:02:04,887 --> 01:02:06,097
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

757
01:02:08,307 --> 01:02:12,645
I'll cherish it in my heart

758
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:17,191
As long as we're in the same world

759
01:02:17,275 --> 01:02:21,070
I'll be content with that

760
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:24,991
Someday

761
01:02:25,783 --> 01:02:29,829
Somewhere

762
01:02:30,413 --> 01:02:35,042
Even though we'll be apart for now

763
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:44,051
Please don't cry in secret

764
01:03:03,821 --> 01:03:05,490
Can you remove this sheet music, please?

765
01:03:17,668 --> 01:03:19,045
Did Mok-ha record here too?

766
01:03:19,128 --> 01:03:20,129
Yeah.

767
01:03:20,213 --> 01:03:21,923
She'll be coming in often.

768
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:24,634
How is she?

769
01:03:25,426 --> 01:03:27,178
I know you have a good ear.

770
01:03:27,261 --> 01:03:28,346
She's great.

771
01:03:28,429 --> 01:03:31,390
Her breathing and vibration are excellent.

772
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:33,226
She's great at bringing out emotions.

773
01:03:33,309 --> 01:03:35,770
She barely needed any editing.
We ended early.

774
01:03:35,853 --> 01:03:36,729
She's that good?

775
01:03:36,813 --> 01:03:37,688
I'm telling you.

776
01:03:37,772 --> 01:03:39,899
I knew as soon as I heard her

777
01:03:39,982 --> 01:03:42,026
why Ms. Yoon bet her all on Mok-ha--

778
01:03:42,109 --> 01:03:44,570
Unless you wanted me to hear this,

779
01:03:46,072 --> 01:03:47,782
could you turn off the mic before talking?

780
01:03:53,788 --> 01:03:54,872
I'm sorry.

781
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:03,339
Oh, dear. She heard everything.

782
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:11,013
Mo-rae is spending 400 million won

783
01:04:11,097 --> 01:04:13,266
to rent a virtual set
for her new music video.

784
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:15,560
But our budget
isn't even one-fourth of that.

785
01:04:17,103 --> 01:04:20,147
My music video
doesn't have to be that grand--

786
01:04:21,482 --> 01:04:23,359
I said I won't condone that attitude.

787
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:26,445
I believe you're the best
and will make you the best.

788
01:04:26,529 --> 01:04:29,740
So don't discourage me
by saying you want something subpar.

789
01:04:30,283 --> 01:04:32,743
"I will achieve
only the best at all costs."

790
01:04:32,827 --> 01:04:34,203
That's what I want to hear.

791
01:04:35,162 --> 01:04:35,997
Okay.

792
01:04:37,790 --> 01:04:40,877
I asked them to wait five hours
before they took the set apart.

793
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:43,838
Yong-gwan went through hoops
to persuade the director.

794
01:04:43,921 --> 01:04:45,047
Goodness.

795
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:47,758
He didn't have to do that for me--

796
01:04:48,551 --> 01:04:49,385
Ran-joo.

797
01:04:50,136 --> 01:04:52,471
I will achieve only the best at all costs.

798
01:04:52,555 --> 01:04:54,932
You need to be
in your best condition by then.

799
01:04:55,016 --> 01:04:56,225
Okay.

800
01:04:56,809 --> 01:04:57,894
This won't do.

801
01:04:57,977 --> 01:04:59,145
Go wash your face.

802
01:05:23,836 --> 01:05:25,922
We need to film everything in five hours.

803
01:05:26,005 --> 01:05:28,341
Don't be late and don't get sick.

804
01:05:28,424 --> 01:05:30,134
Don't get any pimples either. Got it?

805
01:05:31,844 --> 01:05:32,929
Okay.

806
01:05:42,396 --> 01:05:44,315
You're finally releasing your album.

807
01:05:52,615 --> 01:05:53,658
Hold still.

808
01:05:55,368 --> 01:05:56,410
Like this.

809
01:05:56,994 --> 01:05:58,579
Ever since that day,

810
01:05:59,497 --> 01:06:02,750
Ran-joo always kept
these words in her mind.

829
01:07:24,790 --> 01:07:25,791
Oh, no.

830
01:07:27,376 --> 01:07:29,420
Please pick up.

831
01:07:30,087 --> 01:07:31,297
Please…

832
01:07:32,298 --> 01:07:33,591
Hello?

833
01:07:34,175 --> 01:07:36,218
This is Yoon Ran-joo.

834
01:07:36,302 --> 01:07:37,970
I'm sorry for calling so late.

835
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:40,681
Could you please confiscate
my mom's phone?

836
01:07:42,224 --> 01:07:44,935
No, we have no choice.
You have to take it from her.

837
01:07:45,019 --> 01:07:47,188
Don't let her read the news at all costs.

838
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:50,566
Okay. Thank you.

839
01:08:05,331 --> 01:08:07,708
MENTEE

840
01:08:12,546 --> 01:08:14,090
Hey, it's me.

841
01:08:14,757 --> 01:08:15,841
Where are you?

842
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:20,012
Stop them from posting any follow-ups
and take the current articles down.

843
01:08:20,096 --> 01:08:22,890
Tell them we'll explain tomorrow
at the press conference.

844
01:08:23,390 --> 01:08:24,308
Okay.

845
01:08:24,767 --> 01:08:25,851
How about 10:00 a.m.?

846
01:08:26,644 --> 01:08:28,354
Main conference room at 10:00 a.m.

847
01:08:29,730 --> 01:08:31,649
How did this article get out?

848
01:08:32,274 --> 01:08:34,735
We should handle this first
and track the source later.

849
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:38,280
Should I tell the PR Team
to write the statement?

850
01:08:38,364 --> 01:08:39,490
I'll write it myself.

851
01:08:40,533 --> 01:08:41,617
What will you write?

852
01:08:42,118 --> 01:08:43,202
The truth.

853
01:08:44,078 --> 01:08:46,372
"I wanted to sell 20 million albums
for the shares."

854
01:08:46,455 --> 01:08:48,290
"My voice was ruined
but I had to perform."

855
01:08:48,374 --> 01:08:51,335
"A fan found me after 15 years,
and she sang amazingly."

856
01:08:51,418 --> 01:08:53,379
"I thought I could use her
to my advantage."

857
01:08:53,462 --> 01:08:55,172
"So I let her perform. I'm sorry."

858
01:08:55,256 --> 01:08:56,924
I'll admit everything and apologize.

859
01:08:57,007 --> 01:08:58,300
Ran-joo.

860
01:08:58,384 --> 01:08:59,927
If that's the truth,

861
01:09:00,427 --> 01:09:01,637
then this is also true.

862
01:09:02,221 --> 01:09:04,306
"I was ecstatic to learn
about her shares."

863
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:07,893
"I begged her to help me debut
so she could get half of the shares."

864
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:10,146
"That's why I pretended
to be her and sang."

865
01:09:11,105 --> 01:09:12,106
What do you think?

866
01:09:12,648 --> 01:09:15,025
I believe mine makes more sense.

867
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:17,695
Hey, come here.

868
01:09:24,702 --> 01:09:26,120
Can't you see what's going on?

869
01:09:26,203 --> 01:09:28,664
I've created a risk and a scandal for you.

870
01:09:28,747 --> 01:09:31,667
I told you we had to take care
of these things immediately.

871
01:09:33,210 --> 01:09:36,088
Risks. Scandals.

872
01:09:37,339 --> 01:09:39,508
If I keep cutting people out,

873
01:09:40,050 --> 01:09:41,260
who's going to be left?

874
01:09:41,927 --> 01:09:45,014
-Will there even be anyone?
-Enough with that nonsense.

875
01:09:45,556 --> 01:09:48,142
-If you give up your dream--
-I never said I would.

876
01:09:48,642 --> 01:09:49,560
I won't.

877
01:09:49,643 --> 01:09:50,644
You are giving up!

878
01:09:51,061 --> 01:09:52,897
You're going to give up for my sake!

879
01:09:53,689 --> 01:09:55,608
Don't you worry.

880
01:09:56,275 --> 01:09:58,569
I won't go that far for you.

881
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:05,659
I'm going to see it through at all costs.

882
01:10:06,452 --> 01:10:07,536
So please stop saying

883
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:11,540
that you'll leave for my sake.

884
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:15,836
You told me

885
01:10:16,587 --> 01:10:19,548
the fortune teller said
you'd be performing until you're 60.

886
01:10:22,009 --> 01:10:22,843
Right?

887
01:10:32,269 --> 01:10:34,355
When I was stranded
on the deserted island,

888
01:10:35,105 --> 01:10:37,399
I didn't know how to swim.

889
01:10:38,567 --> 01:10:41,403
So for quite a while,

890
01:10:41,487 --> 01:10:43,989
I looked for food only on land.

891
01:10:46,825 --> 01:10:48,244
Back then, the island

892
01:10:48,827 --> 01:10:50,829
was the answer,

893
01:10:51,830 --> 01:10:54,583
and the ocean was a risk.

894
01:10:57,044 --> 01:10:59,546
When I ran out of food on land,

895
01:11:00,881 --> 01:11:03,300
the final solution the island offered

896
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:06,262
was seagull eggs.

897
01:11:08,055 --> 01:11:09,139
I was in pain.

898
01:11:28,867 --> 01:11:31,829
It was all or nothing.

899
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:34,498
Do or die.

900
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:37,001
I made up my mind

901
01:11:38,377 --> 01:11:39,795
and jumped into the water.

902
01:12:03,902 --> 01:12:05,738
All or nothing.

903
01:12:06,947 --> 01:12:08,866
The prosecutor wants to cross-examine?

904
01:12:08,949 --> 01:12:11,368
Yes, they'll question
Bong-wan and our family.

905
01:12:12,953 --> 01:12:14,705
We can say no if we want to.

906
01:12:15,748 --> 01:12:16,749
What should we do?

907
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:22,838
We're okay with it.

908
01:12:23,380 --> 01:12:25,132
-But Mom--
-Let's do it.

909
01:12:30,346 --> 01:12:31,472
Tell them we'll do it.

910
01:12:32,514 --> 01:12:35,517
Do or die.

911
01:12:43,275 --> 01:12:44,193
Mr. Han Dae-woong.

912
01:12:44,777 --> 01:12:46,195
Mr. Han, are you awake?

913
01:12:47,363 --> 01:12:48,864
And then, before you know it,

914
01:12:49,907 --> 01:12:51,492
you'll learn how to swim…

915
01:12:56,914 --> 01:12:58,624
and you might be able to

916
01:12:58,707 --> 01:13:00,209
catch a ton of fish.

917
01:13:05,422 --> 01:13:06,715
Are you serious?

918
01:13:08,926 --> 01:13:10,260
Let's become

919
01:13:11,178 --> 01:13:12,388
the best

920
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:15,766
at all costs.

921
01:13:31,281 --> 01:13:34,201
CASTAWAY DIVA

922
01:14:14,908 --> 01:14:16,285
When is the interview?

923
01:14:16,869 --> 01:14:18,203
If your son choked you,

924
01:14:18,829 --> 01:14:19,788
that's parental abuse.

925
01:14:19,872 --> 01:14:21,457
Leave the press conference to Ran-joo.

926
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:23,208
Just act like you've cut ties for now.

927
01:14:23,292 --> 01:14:25,544
How could you treat me like trash?

928
01:14:26,253 --> 01:14:28,422
The prosecutor's office sent us a notice.

929
01:14:30,090 --> 01:14:34,261
Do you not know why
you were named Yoon Ran-joo?

930
01:14:34,803 --> 01:14:36,263
I still have those feelings too.

931
01:14:36,346 --> 01:14:39,683
No matter what the ruling may be,
I won't give up on you.

932
01:14:39,766 --> 01:14:41,685
That's all you need to know.

933
01:14:47,191 --> 01:14:49,193
