1
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:55,054
CASTAWAY DIVA

2
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:02,020
Who is it?

3
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:11,196
Who is it?

4
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:19,496
Who--

5
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:21,790
Father.

6
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:23,833
It's me.

7
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:34,928
I'm Ki-ho.

8
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:59,160
Remember what you said before?

9
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:03,540
You wanted to spend just one day
in peace away from your dad.

10
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:06,459
Yeah, I remember.

11
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:08,294
So how was it?

12
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:11,047
Your first day without your father?

13
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:21,224
On the coast of the deserted island,

14
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:24,978
he'd washed ashore.

15
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,566
He had passed away.

16
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:33,695
You must've been terrified.

17
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:35,530
No.

18
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:41,035
I was sad.

19
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:46,791
Ki-ho.

20
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:50,378
How did you get here?

21
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:14,485
Father.

22
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,157
You haven't changed at all.

23
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:27,999
You betrayed me the same way 15 years ago.

24
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:33,087
And you're doing it again?

25
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:36,591
You haven't changed either.

26
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,470
Are you going to beat me again?

27
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,222
Because I have a reason to!

28
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:48,269
My own son stabbed me in the back,

29
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:51,272
so how can I let him go?

30
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,944
What kind of father would do that?

31
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:01,991
After all I did…

32
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,869
to take care of you all!

33
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:07,163
How could you?

34
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:17,465
Die, you bastard!

35
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:20,343
You son of a bitch!

36
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:24,931
Since my father's life

37
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:27,392
was so unfortunate,

38
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:29,894
I was sad.

39
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:34,065
What was so unfortunate?

40
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:36,192
He tormented you so much.

41
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:40,280
When he was in middle school,

42
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:42,490
he lost his parents.

43
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:44,867
And at 20, he began working
on a fishing boat.

44
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,829
With money he saved
after ten years on the boat,

45
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:49,622
he opened his own restaurant.

46
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:54,961
But he always got into fights
with customers who didn't want to pay

47
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,380
and got beat up.

48
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,843
All he could rely on was alcohol.

49
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:04,637
And alcohol

50
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:07,724
stoked his anger.

51
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:10,643
And he took his anger

52
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,354
out on you.

53
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:20,486
So…

54
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,448
when I saw he had passed away,

55
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:26,534
I cried my eyes out.

56
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,456
"Poor him."

57
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,834
"He lived

58
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,170
such a sad life."

59
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:55,938
"He should've lived a happier life."

60
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,860
"Why did he have to live
such a life and torment me?"

61
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:05,656
"Why did he have to

62
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:07,950
take out his anger…

63
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,372
all on me?"

64
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,923
I wanted to take back
my family who abandoned me,

65
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:24,801
so I've kept this house the whole time!

66
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:27,637
To leave you all insurance money,

67
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,640
I invested all my paychecks into it!

68
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,686
You should've lived a happier life.

69
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:41,901
You should've forgotten
about this ungrateful bastard who left you

70
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:43,486
and lived a good life!

71
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,405
Look at yourself.

72
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:48,658
Why are you living like this?

73
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:52,203
You all must be happy.

74
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:55,498
You must be so happy that you pity me.

75
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:56,999
Am I right?

76
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:05,675
That's right.

77
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:08,678
We're happy. So please!

78
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,849
Forget about us and live your life.

79
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:31,451
I can't do that.

80
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:33,786
I've finally found you.

81
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:35,997
If you ever come near us,

82
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,125
I'll call the cops.

83
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,209
For what?

84
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:42,962
I'm just a father looking for his family!

85
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:49,093
Because I have a reason to!

86
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:53,055
My own son stabbed me in the back,

87
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:55,850
so how can I let him go?

88
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:00,771
But that's not all.

89
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:05,651
For the past 15 years…

90
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,782
I've collected evidence
of your physical and verbal abuse.

91
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:19,373
I've installed CCTV cameras
inside and outside our house.

92
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,048
So don't come.

93
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:30,343
The moment you come near our house,

94
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,596
I'll take all this evidence…

95
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,016
and go straight to the police station.

96
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,936
How dare you, Ki-ho?

97
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,148
You bastard!

98
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,489
I didn't let you hit me
because I was weak.

99
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:54,825
I just needed evidence.

100
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,914
It was you at Seoul Station, wasn't it?

101
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,794
The one who ran off with Mok-ha.

102
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,342
You better stay away from her.

103
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:14,262
If you don't…

104
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:19,016
I won't hold back then.

105
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:00,993
Happy?

106
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:05,206
How could they be happy?

107
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:40,426
You heard that, right?

108
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,095
No need to reach 20 million anymore.

109
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,638
Forget about the shares too.

110
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:47,933
Wait.

111
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:50,603
Are you really going to give up like this?

112
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:53,397
Doesn't it feel like such a waste?

113
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:55,900
Isn't it unfair? Don't you feel upset?

114
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:57,234
So you do understand.

115
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,613
When you said you were giving up,

116
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:02,948
that's exactly how I felt.

117
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:08,871
A long time ago,

118
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:12,249
there was someone like you.

119
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,835
He was too old to debut,

120
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:19,381
and his weaknesses
were far greater than his strengths.

121
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:20,966
But he was talented,

122
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,511
so I bet my all on him.

123
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,097
Why do you want to give up now?

124
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:29,725
You've already spent

125
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,394
too much money on me.

126
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:35,523
He was kind just like you.

127
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:39,276
That's why you need to keep trying!

128
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,529
Don't you know that if you give up here,

129
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:43,280
that money really will go to waste?

130
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,408
He was weak just like you.

131
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:51,038
So I'm going to give up first
this time around.

132
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:56,085
I'm not weak, Ran-joo.

133
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:58,254
I mean…

134
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:00,756
If you give up,

135
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:04,426
making it this far because of you
would be for nothing.

136
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:07,221
You're my dream.

137
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:08,931
My role model.

138
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:12,309
That's the saddest part.

139
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:14,436
You couldn't dream

140
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:16,939
to be bigger than me.

141
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:20,901
Let's stop playing around

142
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:22,695
and go our separate ways.

143
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:26,073
Goodbye. I wish you all the best.

144
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:30,995
-Ran-joo.
-Don't you get it?

145
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:32,329
I no longer…

146
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,000
Here.

147
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,878
Your mother told me to give you this.

148
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:48,554
What is this?

149
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:50,306
I don't know.

150
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:52,308
The moment we met,

151
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:55,519
she told me to give it to you.

152
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:01,317
Goodbye.

153
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:48,572
Darn it.

154
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,541
Bo-geol.

155
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:02,461
-Hey, Woo-hak.
-What?

156
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:04,421
What happened to your face?

157
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:05,714
Well…

158
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:07,633
I fell down some stairs.

159
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:09,843
I drank a bit too much.

160
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:12,388
Alcohol? But you never drink.

161
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,390
I had dinner with my colleagues.

162
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,433
A damn company dinner.

163
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,143
Can you give me a ride?

164
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:29,822
Ran-joo cut ties with you, didn't she?

165
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:31,490
She will soon.

166
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,867
She'd adore and dote on you.

167
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:35,953
Then, she'll suddenly cut ties
and disappear.

168
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,455
That's her specialty.

169
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:44,753
Hey, look.

170
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,841
You're the deserted island girl, right?

171
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:49,925
From Heyday Again.

172
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:51,760
Yes.

173
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,887
-No way! Take our photo!
-You were great.

174
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:55,472
Let's take a picture. Say cheese.

175
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:57,349
-Cheese.
-Heart.

176
00:16:57,975 --> 00:17:00,561
-Heart.
-Don't you know what a cheek heart is?

177
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:02,771
She's from a deserted island,
so I guess not.

178
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,023
Cheek heart.

179
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:05,816
-Like this.
-All right.

180
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:09,028
Thank you.

181
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:10,446
How are they? Let me see.

182
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,989
They don't look that great.

183
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:14,867
She's not that friendly.
She won't be famous for long.

184
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,160
She's going to hear you.

185
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:17,494
I know people like her.

186
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:19,496
-If you take photos like that--
-Excuse me.

187
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:28,839
Gosh, I feel dizzy.

188
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:31,800
How much did you drink?
Should I take you to the hospital?

189
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,218
It's not that bad.

190
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:38,432
I have no control
over my body when I'm drunk.

191
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:42,895
You're not the type to drink like I do.

192
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,064
Look.

193
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:46,565
I'm not upset or anything.

194
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:48,400
I just don't understand.

195
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:53,197
You were all smiles
when you first approached me.

196
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,239
What?

197
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:56,658
Isn't that Mok-ha?

198
00:17:57,951 --> 00:18:00,204
-What?
-But when you were leaving,

199
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:02,915
why would you bad-mouth me
in such a mean way?

200
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:05,667
Why act differently and make it confusing?

201
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:08,045
What's her deal?
We shouldn't have taken the photo.

202
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:09,713
It's because this is the way

203
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,757
you treated your fans. Okay?

204
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:15,511
What's the problem?

205
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:16,720
Well…

206
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:19,515
Well, you see…

207
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,350
It's not really a problem.

208
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:24,978
It's not a problem.

209
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:27,689
-Let's go.
-Where are you going?

210
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:31,193
-We're late. Don't just stand there.
-Right. We're late.

211
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,031
Are you okay?

212
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:37,533
Yeah.

213
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,618
Oh my gosh!

214
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:42,329
Goodness. What happened to your face?

215
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:43,872
What happened?

216
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:46,750
I drank too much

217
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,670
and fell down the stairs.

218
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:51,880
What?

219
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,090
Goodness!

220
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:54,967
Are you serious?

221
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:57,886
Yes. I'm dizzy.

222
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,180
She was absolute garbage.

223
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:01,890
People like that should never be famous.

224
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,642
Post it anonymously.

225
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:06,311
Yeah, let's do it for real.

226
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:09,481
I should expose how nasty she is
so she comes crashing down.

227
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,066
-Was her name Seo Mok-ha?
-Yes.

228
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,026
Cover our faces with stickers.

229
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,778
-Right.
-Why would you cover them?

230
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:15,988
Who do you think--

231
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:17,447
Who are you?

232
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:20,200
Why hide and be scared
to expose her nastiness?

233
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:23,829
You should reveal your name and face
so I can do the same when I comment.

234
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:27,082
"I was passing by and witnessed it all."

235
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:30,377
"They demanded a selfie
but were offended she didn't smile enough,

236
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,795
so they uploaded this."

237
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:35,591
Let's just go.

238
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,051
I was going to post it online,

239
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:39,136
but I didn't.

240
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:41,805
And I won't. Happy?

241
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,015
Then, delete it.

242
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:50,480
There.

243
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:51,773
Empty the trash can too.

244
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,361
That was fast.

245
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:58,780
-There.
-Okay.

246
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:04,453
Have a good night.

247
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,214
Just how much did you drink
to hurt yourself like this?

248
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:20,302
A bottle of soju?

249
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:24,473
What was that?

250
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:25,557
Lousy.

251
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,684
Quit acting.

252
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:28,769
Who hit you?

253
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:35,150
By any chance,

254
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,945
did Mr. Jung hit you?

255
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:39,738
What?

256
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:42,491
Is that true? Did you go see him?

257
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:51,625
Are you crazy?

258
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,877
Why would you go see that man?

259
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:58,966
I went to him
and let him hit me on purpose

260
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:00,175
for evidence.

261
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:03,136
Are you planning
to use that to report him?

262
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:06,098
No, I just warned him.

263
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:09,518
I told him

264
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:13,939
if he ever came here,
I'd hand this straight to the police.

265
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:16,191
What if he says, "Be my guest."

266
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,609
"I'll do what I want."

267
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:21,780
Reputation is important to our father.
He'd never let himself become a criminal.

268
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:23,657
I'd say he's more than capable.

269
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:25,200
He's not like that.

270
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:27,077
I know him well.

271
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:28,578
You and your memory.

272
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:31,790
You'll trust that flimsy memory
of yours and sit back?

273
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:32,958
Don't worry.

274
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:36,420
If I'm wrong…

275
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:41,550
I'll take responsibility.

276
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,845
"Responsibility"? How?

277
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:53,061
That's enough.

278
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:55,105
He's hurt.

279
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:56,565
Just let it go for today.

280
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:58,984
Please. Okay?

281
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:07,135
Ki-ho.

282
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:08,929
I'm not too confident.

283
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:13,892
I said I'd take responsibility.

284
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:22,484
But I'm not sure I can, Mok-ha.

285
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:34,579
If I see my father again…

286
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:40,377
I'm afraid…

287
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:43,338
of what I'll do…

288
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,260
to him.

289
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:57,686
Don't worry.

290
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:00,814
You'll never

291
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:03,108
see him again.

292
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:07,904
Nothing will happen.

293
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:10,866
But…

294
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:12,409
But what if--

295
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,666
There are no what-ifs.

296
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:22,460
Never.

297
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:24,337
It won't ever happen.

298
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:39,978
You went through…

299
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:43,732
so much today.

300
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:48,195
Now,

301
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:51,865
it's all over.

302
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:55,202
It's okay.

303
00:24:58,371 --> 00:24:59,372
Really.

304
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:02,375
It's okay.

305
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:26,316
Those words Mok-ha said
weren't of comfort.

306
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,735
They were words of resolve,

307
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:31,112
but I realized it too late.

308
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:37,994
CONSOLATION VS. RESOLUTION

309
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:02,519
Ran-joo.

310
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,232
Mom.

311
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:09,943
Mom.

312
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:12,570
Do you recognize me?

313
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:14,406
Of course, I do.

314
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:17,701
You're Yoon Ran-joo, my daughter.

315
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:21,079
Mom.

316
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:26,084
Hey, Mom.

317
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:33,300
How did the concert go?

318
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:35,135
Concert?

319
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:39,639
Right.

320
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:42,851
It went well.

321
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:45,729
All the tickets were sold out.

322
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:47,147
I knew it.

323
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:49,816
I really need to make it

324
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:52,569
to your next concert.

325
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:56,406
All right.

326
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:59,868
I'll tell them to save a VIP seat.

327
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:03,079
So take care of yourself, okay?

328
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:04,372
Okay.

329
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:08,460
Don't let

330
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:12,422
President Lee find out about it.

331
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:13,923
What?

332
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:15,550
Find out about what?

333
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:18,970
What?

334
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:21,431
What you just said.

335
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:23,892
What shouldn't he find out?

336
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:28,980
What did I say?

337
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:43,495
FOUR SEASON NURSING HOME

338
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:44,662
I'll take those, Ran-joo.

339
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:49,709
I hope you weren't busy when I called.

340
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:51,378
I came because I was done.

341
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:56,132
I'm sorry about this.

342
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:58,635
It's not like I can pay you
for working overtime.

343
00:27:58,718 --> 00:27:59,928
Give me the guitar.

344
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:18,196
Where should I take you?

345
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:20,657
To President Lee's house.

346
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:26,996
Okay.

347
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:34,212
I told Mo-rae

348
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:36,756
to be careful or she could end up like me.

349
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,552
And guess what she said.

350
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:44,848
That was harsh.

351
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:47,767
She was offended by what I said.

352
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:49,269
Unbelievable.

353
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:51,521
I was the one who picked her.

354
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:54,649
She shouldn't have said that.

355
00:28:58,111 --> 00:28:59,988
"That ungrateful brat."

356
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:04,409
That's what I told myself.

357
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:08,663
But on second thought, she's right.

358
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:10,832
That's why she succeeded.

359
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,460
Because she was an ingrate.

360
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:15,670
Mok-ha needs to be like her.

361
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:18,923
That's the only way she'll succeed.

362
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:20,967
Come on. What are you talking about?

363
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:22,510
Don't be absurd.

364
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:26,055
If she continues
to put others before herself…

365
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:30,852
she'll end up like you.

366
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:54,375
I'll take them.

367
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:10,308
Thanks, Yong-gwan.

368
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:11,392
Have a good night.

369
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:14,604
Let's go.

370
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:36,876
Excuse us.

371
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:52,517
Excuse me.

372
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,522
I'll keep the door open,
so take your time.

373
00:30:58,356 --> 00:31:00,984
This is my album.
Could you please give it a listen?

374
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,405
Thank you.

375
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:07,657
Thank you so much.

376
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:14,330
Look at this.
He wrote the music and lyrics himself.

377
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:15,415
Someone like him…

378
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:22,881
There's a reason why
he still hasn't made it.

379
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:26,509
He just never had a good producer.
Let me produce his music.

380
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:33,683
His marketability is
much lower than Mo-rae's.

381
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:34,726
But he's talented.

382
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:36,769
This industry's about business, not art.

383
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:37,896
Fine then.

384
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:39,480
I'll just pay for his album.

385
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,204
When I just see you smile

386
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:01,711
My heart skips a beat

387
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:07,884
Even when I sit by the window

388
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:11,763
And feel the wind

389
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:16,309
I think of you

390
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:24,317
If I said that I liked you
I was afraid it wouldn't seem serious

391
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,987
If I said that I loved you

392
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:31,699
I was afraid it would cross the line

393
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:35,787
So I just take one step…

394
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:44,379
-Eun Mo-rae!
-Eun Mo-rae!

395
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:45,922
-Eun Mo-rae!
-Eun Mo-rae!

396
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:51,844
I'm sorry.

397
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:53,846
I'm no longer sure of myself.

398
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:55,390
Good thinking.

399
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:56,683
Then, are you interested

400
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:58,768
-in becoming a manager?
-President Lee.

401
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:00,103
I am.

402
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:02,480
Thank you, sir.

403
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:11,299
Did you mean what you said over the phone?

404
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:13,134
About terminating your contract?

405
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:15,136
Yes.

406
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:19,307
Then, can I tell the legal team
to prepare a termination form?

407
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:20,600
Yes.

408
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:23,811
You're more interested in the contract,

409
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:26,564
while Maru is more interested
in greeting me.

410
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:30,902
Did something happen?

411
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:33,905
No.

412
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:46,042
SUGAR AGENCY HWANG BYUNG-GAK
RJ ENTERTAINMENT LEE SEO-JUN

413
00:35:09,899 --> 00:35:10,733
ARTIST 2

414
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:11,776
It's Ms. Seo.

415
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:14,862
Pick it up.

416
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:22,578
Hello, Ms. Seo.

417
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,290
Hello, sir.

418
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:28,543
Well…

419
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:33,840
About your offer from last time…

420
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:36,467
Is it still valid?

421
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:39,262
Yes, it's still valid.

422
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,754
What should I apply on you?

423
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:15,548
Let's go with some cream.

424
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:25,308
Goodness.

425
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:27,894
It smells so nice.

426
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:30,438
Once you debut,

427
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:32,398
you'll need an everyday skincare routine.

428
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:34,984
Everything's high definition now,

429
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:37,195
so you need to care
for your skin like your voice.

430
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:39,447
Okay.

431
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:45,244
Gosh, you're so pretty.

432
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:49,081
You have such gentle hands.

433
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:50,291
I'm good, aren't I?

434
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:52,126
Yes.

435
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:54,837
How pretty.

436
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:58,799
It feels so moist.

437
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:40,216
I'm sorry I didn't prepare much.

438
00:37:42,134 --> 00:37:44,720
Don't be ridiculous.
This is more than enough.

439
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:47,723
In my prime, I used to have
this same meal minus the kimchi.

440
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:49,183
A low-sodium diet.

441
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:08,119
Ran-joo?

442
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:19,672
Hey, what brings you here?

443
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:22,717
I can't let my parents see me like this.

444
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,553
Let's have breakfast together.

445
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:28,014
Sure.

446
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,977
Their dumpling soup is really good.

447
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:36,022
-I had to wait in line for almost an hour.
-For an hour?

448
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:38,566
Jeez, it'll all end up as poop anyway.

449
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:41,360
Why did you waste
all that money and time on this?

450
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:43,863
Don't ruin my appetite by saying that.

451
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:45,698
Let's see.

452
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,409
Gosh, this is huge.

453
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,453
Goodness.

454
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:51,704
Right, spoons.

455
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:08,054
Where's Bo-geol?

456
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:09,513
He left early this morning.

457
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:12,850
He's so busy these days
that I barely get to see him.

458
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:15,478
-Honey.
-Yes?

459
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:17,355
Starting this week,

460
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:20,149
I'm learning flower arrangement
at the cultural center.

461
00:39:20,232 --> 00:39:21,233
Flower arrangement?

462
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:22,443
-Yes.
-All of a sudden?

463
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:24,987
I've been fond of flowers lately.

464
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,114
Maybe it's like menopause.

465
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:29,742
I'll eat at the rooftop.

466
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:31,702
Mok-ha doesn't like eating alone.

467
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:34,705
Then, tell her to come down
and join us. Okay?

468
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:43,089
You know what?

469
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:44,256
I've made up my mind.

470
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:47,593
Jeez, there he is.

471
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:51,639
You can do it.

472
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:53,599
I can do it.

473
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:56,811
-Do you think it'll be okay?
-Of course.

474
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:05,361
At least she's not eating alone.

475
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,589
In that uniform, you look
like more of an officer than me.

476
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:29,927
That's not a compliment.

477
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:39,603
What's this?

478
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:41,147
Can you run the fingerprints?

479
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:45,609
What are you doing?
You know I can't do that.

480
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:49,738
I heard you're identifying
fingerprints of phishing scammers.

481
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:52,908
Run these too while you're at it.

482
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:54,910
I can't do that.

483
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:57,204
I can't take these kinds of requests.

484
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:01,750
This is a tip-off, not a request.

485
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:03,377
A tip-off?

486
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:06,255
What's the charge?

487
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:09,425
Identity theft.

488
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:16,140
Do the police have the CCTV footage
of the car that caught on fire?

489
00:41:16,223 --> 00:41:19,477
Yes, but they won't give it
because they're still investigating.

490
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,271
Look for dashcam footage
from the other parked cars then.

491
00:41:22,354 --> 00:41:24,064
-Yes, sir.
-Okay, bye.

492
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:35,868
Who's in that building?

493
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:37,912
Jung Bong-wan is the security guard there.

494
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:40,122
What did you just say?

495
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:41,624
Jung Bong-wan

496
00:41:41,707 --> 00:41:43,209
is Ki-ho's father.

497
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:49,882
Are you saying
the last person my husband met

498
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:53,010
was Ki-ho's father?

499
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:54,678
What's wrong?

500
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:57,056
Did they have bad blood or something?

501
00:41:57,139 --> 00:41:58,307
You see…

502
00:41:58,390 --> 00:41:59,975
He's our friend's father.

503
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:04,063
He's been giving my husband
a hard time so he can find him.

504
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,691
When was the accident again?

505
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:08,817
April 4.

506
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:11,195
April 4…

507
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:21,038
JUNG BONG-WAN STAKE-OUT
APRIL 3 TO APRIL 4

508
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,961
MONDAY, APRIL 4, 7 A.M.

509
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:46,647
SECURITY OFFICE

510
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:57,283
JEONGSAN BUILDING

511
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:14,842
April 4.

512
00:43:15,342 --> 00:43:17,052
April 4…

513
00:43:25,477 --> 00:43:26,687
-Sir.
-What?

514
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:29,148
Is it possible to restore
deleted dashcam footage?

515
00:43:29,231 --> 00:43:31,400
Well, I guess it depends.

516
00:43:32,192 --> 00:43:33,944
Why? You need to restore something?

517
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:35,404
Yes. How long will it take?

518
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:39,617
That also depends.

519
00:43:40,909 --> 00:43:43,037
What's inside?

520
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:46,540
Do you remember that car crash
caused by hornets?

521
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:48,709
I told you to cover that.

522
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:51,253
The dashcam could've recorded the culprit.

523
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:53,297
What? That'd be an exclusive.

524
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:54,673
Hold on.

525
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:57,301
I know an excellent data-restoring place.

526
00:43:57,718 --> 00:43:58,719
Found it.

527
00:44:02,348 --> 00:44:05,225
I'd like the legal team
to prepare Ms. Seo's contract.

528
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:07,186
-And Ms. Yoon's termination form.
-Yes, sir.

529
00:44:07,269 --> 00:44:10,189
And the list of the artists
who'll perform at the showcase?

530
00:44:10,272 --> 00:44:12,399
It'll be done by the end of this week.

531
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:14,943
I want all the team managers
to be there that day.

532
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:19,114
Many of our investors are attending,
so please prepare thoroughly.

533
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:20,324
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

534
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:24,495
Right. Should I add Ms. Seo to the list?

535
00:44:25,537 --> 00:44:26,914
Yes, please do.

536
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:29,166
Which composer should we match her with?

537
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:32,169
Would that be necessary?

538
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,255
There's a lot of unclaimed songs
in our archive.

539
00:44:35,964 --> 00:44:37,966
Let her pick one of them.

540
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:39,843
Well…

541
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:40,928
Okay.

542
00:44:42,971 --> 00:44:45,057
He wanted us to prepare thoroughly,

543
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:47,601
but he wants her to pick
a song from the archive?

544
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:51,063
What kind of nonsensical command is that?

545
00:44:51,146 --> 00:44:52,981
Aren't all those songs trash?

546
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:56,110
Of course. They've been rotting
for four or five years now.

547
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:58,404
That means he doesn't care much about her.

548
00:44:58,487 --> 00:45:01,824
Then, why would he recruit her
when things are so hectic right now?

549
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:05,744
Welcome. President Lee is waiting for you.

550
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:08,122
Okay. Thank you.

551
00:45:24,721 --> 00:45:26,765
My high notes still sounding raspy.

552
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:28,809
How can I make them clear?

553
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:29,810
Clear?

554
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:31,770
Like Seo Mok-ha's voice?

555
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,608
I didn't ask you for an example.

556
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:39,653
Don't force yourself
to do something you can't.

557
00:45:39,736 --> 00:45:41,613
She has way more lung capacity.

558
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:44,032
Is it from living on that island?

559
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:46,160
Excuse me.

560
00:45:47,035 --> 00:45:49,788
If you really want to
sing like her, practice that.

561
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:52,332
You said you want to hit the high notes.

562
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:53,792
Don't be ridiculous.

563
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:56,712
Why would you bring her up
and spoil my honest will

564
00:45:56,795 --> 00:45:59,006
to improve my weakness?

565
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:02,676
Then, let's try again
with that will of yours.

566
00:46:02,759 --> 00:46:05,012
Okay? Are you ready?

567
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:15,689
You're early.

568
00:46:20,986 --> 00:46:21,987
Hey.

569
00:46:24,531 --> 00:46:27,284
This was where you had to be?

570
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:29,453
Yeah. You too?

571
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:38,879
Thank you for choosing us.

572
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:41,381
My pleasure.

573
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:44,676
Let's do our best to help each other grow.

574
00:46:45,844 --> 00:46:46,845
Okay.

575
00:46:47,554 --> 00:46:49,056
Okay. This way.

576
00:46:58,023 --> 00:47:01,151
You declined my offer
in this very spot not too long ago.

577
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:02,819
So why the change of heart?

578
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:06,490
Someone told me

579
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:09,576
that she couldn't trust me
because I was weak.

580
00:47:11,411 --> 00:47:13,789
To show her how strong I am,

581
00:47:13,872 --> 00:47:15,499
I thought I should make

582
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:18,460
the boldest decision ever.

583
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:22,172
That's why I made this decision.

584
00:47:22,756 --> 00:47:23,840
The boldest decision ever?

585
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:25,259
I see.

586
00:47:25,759 --> 00:47:26,760
I like it.

587
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:40,399
Our agency's songs are in this archive.

588
00:47:40,899 --> 00:47:42,276
Once I grant you access,

589
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:43,986
you can open them on your phone.

590
00:47:44,444 --> 00:47:45,696
Did you download the app?

591
00:47:45,779 --> 00:47:46,989
Yes.

592
00:47:47,072 --> 00:47:48,657
What do you want as your username?

593
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:51,743
Well…

594
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:54,204
-Can it be in Korean?
-Yes.

595
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:56,999
Then, I'll go with "Deserted Island."

596
00:47:57,082 --> 00:47:59,042
Deserted Island.

597
00:48:02,504 --> 00:48:03,672
Do you see the list?

598
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:06,216
Yes, I do.

599
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:09,386
The composers' usernames
are written under their songs.

600
00:48:09,469 --> 00:48:12,014
You can send arrangements ideas
once you choose a song.

601
00:48:12,097 --> 00:48:13,932
I see. Okay.

602
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:16,727
Goodness, there are so many.

603
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:19,938
This is a real treasure chest.

604
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:24,067
Right. A treasure chest.

605
00:48:24,901 --> 00:48:27,696
Can I listen to all of them
before choosing one?

606
00:48:28,363 --> 00:48:30,073
All of them?

607
00:49:05,525 --> 00:49:07,653
TREE

608
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:14,993
AN ERASER IN MY HEAD

609
00:49:50,987 --> 00:49:51,988
What is this song?

610
00:49:54,908 --> 00:49:56,118
I love it.

611
00:49:57,202 --> 00:49:59,079
Composed by "Stagnant Water"?

612
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:12,217
Hello, my name is Seo Mok-ha.

613
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,803
I love your song.

614
00:50:15,303 --> 00:50:17,681
May I sing it at the showcase?

615
00:50:26,064 --> 00:50:27,733
NO

616
00:50:30,152 --> 00:50:31,361
Why not?

617
00:50:34,781 --> 00:50:36,116
BECAUSE YOU'RE OBNOXIOUS

618
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:37,159
"Obnoxious"?

619
00:50:38,618 --> 00:50:39,619
Obnoxious…

620
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:49,921
Do you know me?

621
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:54,885
VERY WELL

622
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:56,553
What?

623
00:50:58,847 --> 00:50:59,848
Who is this?

624
00:51:03,059 --> 00:51:04,060
Who is it?

625
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:06,938
They know you and dislike you?

626
00:51:07,022 --> 00:51:08,106
Yes.

627
00:51:09,357 --> 00:51:10,442
You're wrong.

628
00:51:10,525 --> 00:51:11,693
They don't know you.

629
00:51:11,777 --> 00:51:15,155
They can't help but like you
if they knew you.

630
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:16,990
It's a hater.

631
00:51:17,073 --> 00:51:18,617
You have a hater now.

632
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:19,618
A hater?

633
00:51:19,701 --> 00:51:20,619
You know.

634
00:51:20,702 --> 00:51:23,455
Losers who are jealous of successful stars

635
00:51:23,538 --> 00:51:24,748
become their haters.

636
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:27,751
Mok-ha, don't give them the time of day.

637
00:51:27,834 --> 00:51:29,836
Okay? Eat up.

638
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:33,548
You should pick some other song.

639
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:36,009
No, I'm totally in love with it.

640
00:51:36,092 --> 00:51:39,429
I'll look for Stagnant Water
or whoever they are at RJ Entertainment.

641
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:42,474
I'll find them,
and do my best to persuade them.

642
00:51:42,557 --> 00:51:44,726
Send me the song.
I'll give it a listen too.

643
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:46,186
Really?

644
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:49,689
Right. Woo-hak,
would you like to listen to it too?

645
00:51:50,398 --> 00:51:51,399
No thanks.

646
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:54,611
Okay.

647
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:01,243
Right.

648
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:05,747
Hey, I need to go first.

649
00:52:06,248 --> 00:52:08,083
Flower arrangement class
is starting early.

650
00:52:08,166 --> 00:52:10,210
Starting early?
I didn't know they did that.

651
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:12,879
Me neither.
Can you guys clean the table for me?

652
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:14,881
-Okay. Goodbye.
-Bye.

653
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:15,882
-Bye.
-Bye.

654
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:17,259
Bye.

655
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:22,347
Does that mean he arranged those flowers

656
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:24,140
instead of buying them?

657
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:25,433
It's a masterpiece.

658
00:52:25,517 --> 00:52:26,518
Yes.

659
00:52:26,601 --> 00:52:29,312
Maybe we should close our salon
and open a flower shop.

660
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:36,403
So how do I send the song to you?

661
00:52:37,279 --> 00:52:38,864
Here. I'll do it for you.

662
00:52:40,115 --> 00:52:41,491
Let's see.

663
00:53:00,218 --> 00:53:01,219
Hello.

664
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:03,597
You're Seo Mok-ha, right?

665
00:53:04,222 --> 00:53:05,515
I loved your performance.

666
00:53:06,391 --> 00:53:07,392
Right.

667
00:53:07,475 --> 00:53:08,768
Thank you.

668
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:11,813
I heard you survived
on a deserted island for 15 years.

669
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:13,648
You're my role model.

670
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:15,567
Me?

671
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:16,651
Yes.

672
00:53:17,402 --> 00:53:20,322
I've been a trainee here
for the past decade.

673
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:23,575
One day, I'll be able to
debut just like you, right?

674
00:53:23,658 --> 00:53:24,576
Well…

675
00:53:24,659 --> 00:53:25,994
Of course.

676
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:30,707
Goodness.

677
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:33,793
-Thank you.
-Bye.

678
00:53:37,255 --> 00:53:38,715
What are you doing here?

679
00:53:40,008 --> 00:53:43,762
Well, I'm looking for someone.

680
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:47,182
Kids like them are just hopeless.

681
00:53:47,265 --> 00:53:49,893
You see a lot of trainees
like them in this industry.

682
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:54,439
They confuse false hope with tenacity
and think holding out is the best thing.

683
00:53:55,607 --> 00:53:58,610
In this business, moderate talent
is pretty much a disaster.

684
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:02,739
Disaster, my foot.

685
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:04,950
It's true.

686
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:07,953
They're not just wasting their own time.

687
00:54:08,036 --> 00:54:10,580
They're wasting the time
and money others invest in them.

688
00:54:11,247 --> 00:54:12,958
Then, they end up regretting it.

689
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:16,419
They think,
"Giving up requires courage too."

690
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:18,922
Are you trying to tell me something?

691
00:54:19,714 --> 00:54:21,383
Those are just your insecurities.

692
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:24,427
And as for you,

693
00:54:25,303 --> 00:54:27,347
your life's working out
just as you planned.

694
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:30,725
Hold on.

695
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:34,229
Is that a compliment
or are you just jealous?

696
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:39,776
-What?
-If you're ridiculing me for succeeding,

697
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:42,278
does that mean you're jealous?

698
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:49,119
I'll be on my way now.

699
00:54:51,997 --> 00:54:53,456
This is why I don't like you.

700
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:56,251
You're so obnoxious.

701
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:05,385
Don't tell me you're--

702
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:06,469
That's right.

703
00:55:07,762 --> 00:55:08,930
I'm Stagnant Water.

704
00:55:11,016 --> 00:55:12,642
And I'll never give you my song.

705
00:55:13,768 --> 00:55:14,769
Goodness.

706
00:55:15,228 --> 00:55:16,354
I'm sorry!

707
00:55:16,438 --> 00:55:17,564
Too late.

708
00:55:20,066 --> 00:55:21,067
A long time ago,

709
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:23,611
there was someone like you.

710
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:26,281
He was kind just like you.

711
00:55:27,115 --> 00:55:28,742
He was weak just like you.

712
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:31,327
He was too old to debut.

713
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,955
Judging by your words,

714
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:37,584
it looks like your life
has always worked out

715
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:39,544
the way you wanted it to.

716
00:56:15,371 --> 00:56:17,665
WITH A SMALL BAG ON MY SHOULDER

717
00:56:22,921 --> 00:56:24,839
DOWN WINDING ROADS AND UP STEEP HILLS

718
00:56:36,601 --> 00:56:38,728
WHEN IT GETS DARK

719
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:46,319
YOU SHINE OVER ME AS YOU FOLLOW

720
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:55,203
Mok-ha, let's have breakfast.

721
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:27,068
Hello.

722
00:57:27,986 --> 00:57:29,696
What brings you all the way here?

723
00:57:30,738 --> 00:57:32,949
Do you remember me?

724
00:57:33,032 --> 00:57:35,452
Of course, Producer Kang Bo-geol.

725
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:38,371
No, we met much before that.

726
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:39,581
It was a snowy day.

727
00:57:40,165 --> 00:57:41,291
A snowy day?

728
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:42,959
Yes.

729
00:57:44,043 --> 00:57:45,795
If this girl ever visits you one day,

730
00:57:45,879 --> 00:57:47,338
please call out her name.

731
00:57:48,089 --> 00:57:49,090
Seo Mok-ha.

732
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:54,429
Don't tell me…

733
00:57:56,097 --> 00:57:57,140
Are you Jung Ki-ho?

734
00:57:58,183 --> 00:57:59,184
I am.

735
00:58:00,977 --> 00:58:04,939
Thank you for doing me that favor.
I should've thanked you sooner.

736
00:58:05,023 --> 00:58:08,067
Goodness. How is this--

737
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:09,819
Does Mok-ha know?

738
00:58:10,737 --> 00:58:12,155
Yes, she found out recently.

739
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:15,617
My goodness.

740
00:58:18,036 --> 00:58:20,872
It's shameless,
but I came to ask you for another favor.

741
00:58:37,305 --> 00:58:39,516
Go to your left,
and I'll do the same. Okay?

742
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:43,937
Your lyrics are terrible.

743
00:58:44,479 --> 00:58:45,313
What?

744
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:47,774
So…

745
00:58:49,901 --> 00:58:52,820
I changed them
to something a little better.

746
00:58:54,739 --> 00:58:56,241
If you like the new lyrics,

747
00:58:56,324 --> 00:58:59,285
please allow me to sing your song.

748
00:59:01,621 --> 00:59:02,622
Hey.

749
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:05,750
Come to your senses already.

750
00:59:05,833 --> 00:59:08,211
That archive is like a trash can.

751
00:59:09,587 --> 00:59:12,715
It's the gutter where songs go
when other artists reject them.

752
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:14,634
Picking a song from there

753
00:59:14,717 --> 00:59:16,261
means you're nothing special.

754
00:59:17,262 --> 00:59:19,222
All of us…

755
00:59:20,598 --> 00:59:22,517
We're all worthless! Okay?

756
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:29,148
Couldn't you have picked that up

757
00:59:29,941 --> 00:59:31,568
before I had to say that to you?

758
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:41,327
I meant it when I said

759
00:59:41,953 --> 00:59:43,538
giving up required courage.

760
00:59:43,621 --> 00:59:44,872
I said that for your sake--

761
00:59:44,956 --> 00:59:45,915
Giving up

762
00:59:46,499 --> 00:59:47,709
requires courage too?

763
00:59:52,046 --> 00:59:53,214
If that was the case…

764
00:59:54,716 --> 00:59:56,175
then I wouldn't be here right now.

765
00:59:57,468 --> 01:00:00,430
On that deserted island,

766
01:00:01,681 --> 01:00:03,099
I would've been long dead by now.

767
01:00:08,688 --> 01:00:11,107
What if you're still a nobody
after ten years?

768
01:00:12,525 --> 01:00:13,693
Wouldn't you regret it?

769
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:16,613
Well…

770
01:00:17,405 --> 01:00:19,365
I'll probably regret it a little.

771
01:00:23,661 --> 01:00:26,414
But I'd regret it even more
if I never even try.

772
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:31,419
At least for ten years,

773
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:34,714
I'd be doing what I love the most.

774
01:00:37,175 --> 01:00:38,676
So…

775
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:41,262
if you truly do care about me,

776
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:45,683
then please give it a listen.

777
01:00:55,735 --> 01:00:57,320
Aren't you afraid of failing?

778
01:00:57,403 --> 01:00:58,613
Come on.

779
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:03,493
They say failure is the mother of success.

780
01:01:04,118 --> 01:01:06,996
I'll just take it as learning
a lesson from another mother

781
01:01:08,081 --> 01:01:09,165
and move on.

782
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:12,710
You must have several mothers.

783
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:17,131
Is that a yes?

784
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:20,718
Does this mean I can sing your song?

785
01:01:23,012 --> 01:01:24,138
Whatever.

786
01:01:24,222 --> 01:01:25,223
Do as you please.

787
01:01:25,765 --> 01:01:26,891
I don't care anymore.

788
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:30,561
Thank you, Yong-gwan!

789
01:01:32,647 --> 01:01:33,940
That little…

790
01:01:57,004 --> 01:01:59,507
Seeing you here again makes me nostalgic.

791
01:02:02,593 --> 01:02:04,429
I hope you don't get the wrong idea.

792
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:08,599
I didn't come here
so we could rekindle things.

793
01:02:13,104 --> 01:02:15,356
I'm still your artist
until the contract ends.

794
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,316
I want to enjoy the perks
while I have them.

795
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:18,651
Can I have some wine?

796
01:02:19,235 --> 01:02:20,236
Sure.

797
01:02:24,198 --> 01:02:25,742
Right. When is the showcase?

798
01:02:25,825 --> 01:02:27,285
Next Friday.

799
01:02:28,828 --> 01:02:31,831
That's about ten days from now.

800
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:37,086
Did you take a look
at the termination form?

801
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:42,300
Yes, but can I sign it after the showcase?

802
01:02:42,383 --> 01:02:44,177
After the showcase?

803
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:46,888
I want to add a few terms to the form.

804
01:02:49,223 --> 01:02:50,892
Sure. That's fine.

805
01:04:14,642 --> 01:04:15,726
It's slow and boring.

806
01:04:16,227 --> 01:04:17,228
What did you say?

807
01:04:17,311 --> 01:04:19,480
I haven't even started
and you discourage me?

808
01:04:19,564 --> 01:04:20,565
Of course.

809
01:04:21,315 --> 01:04:22,525
I gave it a listen,

810
01:04:23,025 --> 01:04:24,652
and this version has no chance.

811
01:04:24,735 --> 01:04:26,195
You'll lose them from the start.

812
01:04:26,988 --> 01:04:27,947
Really?

813
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:30,449
So I arranged the song.

814
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,661
Who arranged it? You?

815
01:04:34,704 --> 01:04:36,038
I'm a music show producer.

816
01:04:37,373 --> 01:04:38,374
Look at you.

817
01:04:40,585 --> 01:04:43,337
I sped it up a bit to medium tempo.

818
01:04:43,421 --> 01:04:44,463
I see.

819
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:47,592
I made this verse sound a bit dreamlike.

820
01:04:48,092 --> 01:04:49,093
As for the chorus…

821
01:04:49,176 --> 01:04:53,180
As for the chorus, I added
some strong bass and snare drums

822
01:04:53,264 --> 01:04:54,891
to make it sound more upbeat.

823
01:04:54,974 --> 01:04:55,808
What do you think?

824
01:04:57,310 --> 01:04:59,770
This is easy to explain
since you produce a music show.

825
01:04:59,854 --> 01:05:03,065
If the one who arranged the song
explained it to her in person,

826
01:05:03,149 --> 01:05:04,525
Mok-ha would love it even more.

827
01:05:04,609 --> 01:05:05,526
No.

828
01:05:06,027 --> 01:05:09,363
Then, she'll put me first again
and go on about 20 million albums.

829
01:05:10,448 --> 01:05:11,991
You don't want that either.

830
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:14,201
Just say that you arranged it.

831
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:17,288
Okay.

832
01:05:18,706 --> 01:05:20,708
What is a vocal chop?

833
01:05:20,791 --> 01:05:23,794
It's when you use
someone's voice as an instrument.

834
01:05:23,878 --> 01:05:25,922
The first two bars are vocal chops.

835
01:05:26,714 --> 01:05:30,635
Then, you start on three. Okay?

836
01:05:31,510 --> 01:05:33,804
Okay. I think I get it.

837
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:36,182
-I'll play the song.
-Okay.

838
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:46,484
Two, three. Cue.

839
01:05:47,735 --> 01:05:50,404
With a small bag on my shoulder

840
01:05:50,488 --> 01:05:52,531
I walk along with the clouds

841
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:58,412
I lie with the blue sky as my blanket
And sing with the dancing trees

842
01:05:58,496 --> 01:06:01,374
Even if the clouds in the sky

843
01:06:01,457 --> 01:06:04,919
Start to rain down on me

844
01:06:05,002 --> 01:06:08,506
Who cares?
It doesn't matter

845
01:06:08,589 --> 01:06:15,012
Down winding roads and up steep hills

846
01:06:15,096 --> 01:06:19,767
Wherever it is
I want to walk there

847
01:06:19,850 --> 01:06:24,021
Until the end

848
01:06:24,105 --> 01:06:26,983
I don't need

849
01:06:27,066 --> 01:06:31,362
Any hidden treasures

850
01:06:32,571 --> 01:06:34,907
At my destination

851
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:37,743
Because they

852
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:42,873
Are found on the path
I'm walking on right now

853
01:06:45,626 --> 01:06:50,673
I write down my pure feelings
And turn them into a paper boat

854
01:06:50,756 --> 01:06:56,637
I hope it reaches somewhere
And turns that place pure too

855
01:06:56,721 --> 01:06:59,265
Even if the clouds in the sky

856
01:06:59,348 --> 01:07:00,975
Start to blow winds…

857
01:07:01,058 --> 01:07:03,060
What if you're still a nobody
after ten years?

858
01:07:03,144 --> 01:07:04,311
Wouldn't you regret it?

859
01:07:04,812 --> 01:07:07,398
Well… I'll probably regret it a little.

860
01:07:08,315 --> 01:07:10,943
But I'd regret it even more
if I never even try.

861
01:07:11,777 --> 01:07:13,237
At least for ten years,

862
01:07:13,946 --> 01:07:16,699
I'd be doing what I love the most.

863
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:22,246
Until the end

864
01:07:22,329 --> 01:07:24,290
I don't need

865
01:07:24,957 --> 01:07:29,462
Any hidden treasures

866
01:07:30,546 --> 01:07:33,090
At my destination

867
01:07:33,174 --> 01:07:35,676
Because they

868
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:40,890
Are found on the path
I'm walking on right now

869
01:07:43,267 --> 01:07:46,145
On every leaf and wild flower

870
01:07:46,228 --> 01:07:52,443
The sunlight shines
On this beautiful street

871
01:07:52,526 --> 01:07:54,695
When it gets dark…

872
01:07:54,779 --> 01:07:55,905
Have you made up your mind?

873
01:07:57,031 --> 01:07:57,907
On what?

874
01:07:57,990 --> 01:08:00,242
The line you wanted to add
to your termination form.

875
01:08:05,998 --> 01:08:10,002
Until the end

876
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:12,546
I don't need

877
01:08:13,130 --> 01:08:17,676
Any hidden treasures

878
01:08:18,844 --> 01:08:21,430
At my destination

879
01:08:21,514 --> 01:08:23,641
Because they

880
01:08:23,724 --> 01:08:27,686
Are found on the path

881
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:31,649
Until the end

882
01:08:33,150 --> 01:08:39,740
Riding on rainbows, baby
Above the clouds and over the hills

883
01:08:40,491 --> 01:08:44,370
I'll gift you a magical day

884
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:51,085
Wouldn't you like to come with me?

885
01:09:02,138 --> 01:09:03,389
Let me produce

886
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:05,391
Seo Mok-ha's album.

887
01:09:42,428 --> 01:09:44,889
Here's the link
to my showcase performance.

888
01:09:44,972 --> 01:09:47,600
Getting a lot likes is apparently good,

889
01:09:47,683 --> 01:09:49,059
so please like the video.

890
01:09:50,186 --> 01:09:51,604
I already did as soon as…

891
01:10:05,784 --> 01:10:06,827
I see.

892
01:10:07,328 --> 01:10:08,454
There he is.

893
01:10:08,537 --> 01:10:09,830
I'll call you after I ask.

894
01:10:09,914 --> 01:10:11,081
Kang Woo-hak.

895
01:10:11,165 --> 01:10:13,125
The dashcam footage has been restored.

896
01:10:13,626 --> 01:10:16,003
They sent it to your email, so go check.

897
01:10:16,086 --> 01:10:17,087
Yes, sir.

898
01:10:22,384 --> 01:10:25,721
They said it was such a pain
to get this restored.

899
01:10:26,388 --> 01:10:28,057
So? Do you see the culprit?

900
01:10:28,182 --> 01:10:29,475
One minute.

901
01:10:35,189 --> 01:10:37,191
Wait. What is he doing?

902
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:39,610
Is he breaking into the car?

903
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:44,615
JEONGSAN BUILDING

904
01:10:48,035 --> 01:10:49,036
Hey.

905
01:10:49,536 --> 01:10:51,205
Let's air this exclusive tonight.

906
01:10:51,288 --> 01:10:52,748
Give me a one-minute report.

907
01:10:53,249 --> 01:10:56,418
-I should report him first.
-What? The exclusive comes first!

908
01:10:56,961 --> 01:10:58,837
Kang Woo-hak! Hey!

909
01:10:59,546 --> 01:11:01,131
Enjoy.

910
01:11:01,215 --> 01:11:02,549
-Thank you.
-My pleasure.

911
01:11:04,218 --> 01:11:06,637
So tell me.
Did you identify the fingerprints?

912
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:08,222
I did.

913
01:11:09,556 --> 01:11:12,351
But I can't tell you
since it's personal information.

914
01:11:14,144 --> 01:11:14,979
Hey.

915
01:11:19,149 --> 01:11:20,651
I told you this was a tip-off.

916
01:11:22,861 --> 01:11:24,196
I looked into him,

917
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:26,198
and he had a clean record.

918
01:11:27,533 --> 01:11:30,119
On what grounds
did you think it was identity theft?

919
01:11:33,664 --> 01:11:35,374
They're my son Ki-ho's fingerprints.

920
01:11:36,709 --> 01:11:37,710
What?

921
01:11:37,793 --> 01:11:39,503
Didn't someone else's name pop up?

922
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:41,130
That can't be--

923
01:11:41,213 --> 01:11:44,133
I couldn't care less
about their information nor do I need it.

924
01:11:44,216 --> 01:11:45,718
If Ki-ho's name didn't show up,

925
01:11:46,218 --> 01:11:47,886
it means he changed his identity.

926
01:11:50,514 --> 01:11:51,932
If you don't catch him…

927
01:11:53,892 --> 01:11:54,893
then I will.

928
01:12:02,568 --> 01:12:03,736
Goodness.

929
01:12:03,819 --> 01:12:06,196
What's wrong with the weather?

930
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:07,823
It's blazing hot all the time.

931
01:12:07,906 --> 01:12:08,907
Tell me about it.

932
01:12:09,450 --> 01:12:11,744
I wouldn't mind a nice, big shower.

933
01:12:12,244 --> 01:12:14,872
The reservoir is going to
dry up at this rate.

934
01:12:14,955 --> 01:12:15,998
Exactly.

935
01:12:19,084 --> 01:12:20,085
Hold on.

936
01:12:20,919 --> 01:12:22,004
What's that?

937
01:12:22,713 --> 01:12:23,714
What's what?

938
01:12:23,797 --> 01:12:26,675
That white thing underwater.

939
01:12:27,176 --> 01:12:28,552
Don't you see it?

940
01:12:29,428 --> 01:12:31,347
Yeah, I see it too.

941
01:12:32,014 --> 01:12:34,141
What could that be?

942
01:12:34,224 --> 01:12:36,268
It looks like a car.

943
01:12:36,352 --> 01:12:37,353
A car?

944
01:12:38,062 --> 01:12:39,063
Yeah.

945
01:12:41,065 --> 01:12:44,151
So this man broke in
and put the hornets in the car?

946
01:12:44,234 --> 01:12:46,278
Correct. Then, the accident occurred.

947
01:12:46,362 --> 01:12:47,780
Jeez.

948
01:12:47,863 --> 01:12:48,864
If that's true,

949
01:12:49,365 --> 01:12:51,825
then it's bodily injury,
not just a car accident.

950
01:12:51,909 --> 01:12:53,494
It'd be a serious charge.

951
01:12:53,577 --> 01:12:55,537
I heard the victim's still unconscious.

952
01:12:56,163 --> 01:12:57,623
-Officer Min.
-Yes, sir.

953
01:12:57,706 --> 01:12:59,500
Write up a crime report right now.

954
01:12:59,583 --> 01:13:00,584
Yes, sir.

955
01:13:02,044 --> 01:13:03,670
When will you arrest him?

956
01:13:03,754 --> 01:13:07,341
It'll go to the Criminal Affairs Division
so they can investigate first.

957
01:13:07,883 --> 01:13:08,967
It'll take some time.

958
01:13:23,315 --> 01:13:24,566
Hello, ma'am.

959
01:13:26,151 --> 01:13:27,403
Is my flower bouquet ready?

960
01:13:27,486 --> 01:13:28,570
Of course, it is.

961
01:13:29,238 --> 01:13:32,366
Gosh, this one is the prettiest.
How much is it?

962
01:13:32,449 --> 01:13:34,660
That'll be 60,000 won
since you're a regular.

963
01:13:35,369 --> 01:13:36,578
I take cards too.

964
01:13:36,662 --> 01:13:39,081
I prefer cash. Here you go.

965
01:13:39,164 --> 01:13:40,165
Okay.

966
01:13:40,249 --> 01:13:42,292
All right, then.

967
01:13:42,376 --> 01:13:43,710
-Thank you.
-No problem.

968
01:13:53,470 --> 01:13:54,513
Dad.

969
01:13:54,930 --> 01:13:56,390
Hey, Woo-hak.

970
01:14:00,185 --> 01:14:02,229
You said you were learning
flower arrangement.

971
01:14:02,938 --> 01:14:04,106
Have you been buying them?

972
01:14:04,189 --> 01:14:06,733
Yes. You see…

973
01:14:06,817 --> 01:14:07,901
Why did you lie?

974
01:14:08,902 --> 01:14:11,071
Where have you been instead all this time?

975
01:14:16,243 --> 01:14:17,077
Woo-hak.

976
01:14:17,536 --> 01:14:18,537
We need to talk.

977
01:14:33,886 --> 01:14:35,053
Where are you?

978
01:14:36,597 --> 01:14:37,598
I'm almost there.

979
01:14:37,681 --> 01:14:38,891
I'll arrive in four minutes.

980
01:14:46,815 --> 01:14:47,816
Bo-geol.

981
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:50,194
Remember that dumpling soup
we had last time?

982
01:14:50,277 --> 01:14:52,279
The one you had to wait
in line an hour for.

983
01:14:53,322 --> 01:14:55,240
Is that place still open right now?

984
01:14:58,911 --> 01:15:00,621
Okay. I'll go buy some.

985
01:15:33,278 --> 01:15:34,279
So I was right.

986
01:15:37,366 --> 01:15:39,535
You were living
with them all along, Mok-ha.

987
01:15:44,039 --> 01:15:46,166
Why did you lie to me?

988
01:15:50,712 --> 01:15:57,010
SONMAT DUMPLING SOUP

989
01:16:12,651 --> 01:16:13,652
Don't worry.

990
01:16:15,696 --> 01:16:19,241
You'll never see him again.

991
01:16:21,034 --> 01:16:23,704
Nothing will happen.

992
01:16:57,613 --> 01:16:58,780
You look…

993
01:17:01,450 --> 01:17:02,784
very happy,

994
01:17:04,828 --> 01:17:05,829
Jae-kyung.

995
01:17:10,459 --> 01:17:13,128
Why did you come here?

996
01:17:29,853 --> 01:17:32,731
CASTAWAY DIVA

997
01:18:13,146 --> 01:18:15,065
You must be Chae-ho.

998
01:18:15,941 --> 01:18:19,194
The remains of a family
that had gone missing were found.

999
01:18:20,737 --> 01:18:22,864
You want to produce my album?

1000
01:18:22,948 --> 01:18:24,741
I'll decide based on your reply.

1001
01:18:24,825 --> 01:18:26,034
Can you cut ties

1002
01:18:26,868 --> 01:18:28,036
with Producer Kang's family?

1003
01:18:28,620 --> 01:18:29,830
Seo Mok-ha's an accomplice too.

1004
01:18:29,913 --> 01:18:31,915
She helped them,
knowing they stole identities.

1005
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:33,166
Can't you see what's going on?

1006
01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:35,877
I told you we had to take care
