1
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:55,054
CASTAWAY DIVA

2
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:59,517
Being hospitalized for four months
must've been tough.

3
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:00,727
Are you okay now?

4
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,062
Of course not.

5
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:05,231
Taking a flight of stairs
is like hiking up Hallasan Mountain.

6
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:06,649
I've lost a lot of muscle.

7
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:08,777
Goodness.

8
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,404
As if you had any muscles
to lose to begin with.

9
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:13,782
You have more body fat than a pig does.

10
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:17,619
Were you just asleep
for four months straight then?

11
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:18,995
You didn't have any dreams?

12
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:21,331
Dreams? I did have one.

13
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:25,919
Young-ju said she'd kill me
in my dreams if I actually died

14
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:27,712
and kept threatening me.

15
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:28,797
Goodness.

16
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:31,508
How can you kill me if I'm already dead?

17
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:34,636
She kept saying ridiculous things,
so that's why I woke up.

18
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:37,889
Jeez, you fool.

19
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:40,975
I visited you every day
and whispered threats into your ears.

20
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:42,477
I said the same exact thing.

21
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,103
Goodness. Are you serious?

22
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:45,563
Then, it wasn't a dream?

23
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:47,524
That's so fascinating.

24
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:49,859
I guess he really could hear you.

25
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:53,988
You woke up
because she threatened you, right?

26
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:55,323
I guess so.

27
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:59,452
She has you wrapped around her finger.

28
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:02,122
Exactly, Ms. Song. This is my life.

29
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:04,499
I'm more scared of my wife than of death.

30
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:06,501
I had never imagined

31
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:08,670
these two would end up together.

32
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:11,506
-How did it happen?
-Woo-hak, what's taking so long?

33
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:12,841
I asked him out first.

34
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:13,925
Goodness.

35
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,637
Stop crying and explain it clearly.

36
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:19,848
What did you say?

37
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:21,766
Yeah.

38
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:24,519
Okay.

39
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:29,899
What?

40
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:32,026
Dad.

41
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:33,570
Dad!

42
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:35,655
Please save him.

43
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:37,949
Please save my dad.

44
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:39,450
Dad.

45
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:41,161
Dad, can you hear me?

46
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,204
Damn it.

47
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:45,748
Dad!

48
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:47,375
Dad.

49
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,379
Please save my dad.

50
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:53,423
Please wait here, sir.

51
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:52,357
Jae-kyung.

52
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,195
Chae-ho.

53
00:03:58,029 --> 00:03:59,030
Ki-ho.

54
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:05,328
You'll now have to live
under those names forever.

55
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,416
And I have a final gift for you three.

56
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:20,009
Woo-hak, are you okay?

57
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:22,887
If he and I both die,

58
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:25,098
-Dad is…
-Jae-kyung…

59
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:29,143
-You will never be able to divorce me…
-Please sit down.

60
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,023
or get married to him either.

61
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:38,152
Ki-ho and Chae-ho.

62
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:42,365
You will also live
with my surname forever.

63
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:45,118
-Let me see the blood vessels.
-Yes, Doctor.

64
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:46,202
Suction.

65
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,080
And that scoundrel will die…

66
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,126
as Lee Uk, not Kang Sang-doo.

67
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:56,838
Mr. Jung Bong-wan!

68
00:04:56,921 --> 00:05:00,717
Then, he'll be recorded as someone
without any surviving family or friends.

69
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,884
Mr. Jung.

70
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:03,928
Mr. Jung…

71
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,306
Excuse me, sir. Mr. Jung.

72
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:13,521
Damn it.

73
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:15,273
Call 911.

74
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:19,485
I'll be recorded
as Yang Jae-kyung's husband

75
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:22,822
and Jung Ki-ho and Jung Chae-ho's father.

76
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,492
RESTRICTED AREA
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

77
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:32,040
I failed to be a good father while alive.

78
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,084
Now, I can fulfill my role in death,

79
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,045
so I'm thankful.

80
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,848
You must know something
since you're smart.

81
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:50,975
Is there really no way?

82
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:53,394
There is

83
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,313
no way.

84
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:58,232
If Mr. Kang passes away now,

85
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,110
he won't have
any surviving family or friends

86
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:04,906
since he never registered
his marriage with Ms. Song.

87
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:07,158
Then, what will happen
to Ki-ho and his brother?

88
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:26,344
Yes, it's him.

89
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:29,222
Mr. Jung Ki-ho.

90
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:32,433
Here.

91
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:51,911
TO JAE-KYUNG, CHAE-HO, AND KI-HO

92
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:59,252
FROM YOUR FATHER, JUNG BONG-WAN

93
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:25,736
They have no choice either…

94
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:30,283
but to live under Mr. Jung's surname.

95
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:37,373
What kind of damn law is that?

96
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,500
Mr. Kang is alive.

97
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:43,546
He just needs to pull through.

98
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:44,630
Right?

99
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,591
That's right.

100
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:50,303
He'll survive, get his real name back,
and marry Ms. Song.

101
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:53,514
Then, he can adopt
Ki-ho and Chae-ho as his sons.

102
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,865
HYESEO HOSPITAL

103
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:13,910
Dad.

104
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:16,204
You're the only father I have.

105
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:18,581
It's just you.

106
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:21,042
So wake up.

107
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:23,503
Please.

108
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:36,933
In the past,

109
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:41,729
the word "father" to Ki-ho

110
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,566
was a nightmare.

111
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:47,985
But you…

112
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:53,616
helped him learn
the true meaning of that word.

113
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:58,663
So you have to pull through.

114
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:04,627
You can't let Mr. Jung
take away your place

115
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:07,380
as their father.

116
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:10,424
Right?

117
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:22,645
Dad.

118
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:25,523
Can you hear me?

119
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:30,987
I love you, Dad.

120
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:37,243
I said I love you.

121
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:40,496
Can you hear me?

122
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:46,586
What should I do?

123
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,505
I really hope you can hear me.

124
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:52,383
Dad.

125
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,265
Dad.

126
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:26,208
I think Chae-ho will believe us
if he sees a wedding photo.

127
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,210
Right. We need one.

128
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:30,546
I'm sorry

129
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,007
for asking you to do this.

130
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,425
No, it's okay.

131
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:37,470
I'm grateful.

132
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,056
Sorry?

133
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,140
I was an orphan,

134
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:43,851
so I was alone my entire life.

135
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:47,021
But you've given me three family members.

136
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:50,483
So I'm the one who's grateful.

137
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:56,197
All right, let's begin.

138
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:58,157
Wait.

139
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,950
Can you look more affectionate?

140
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:02,328
Try linking arms.

141
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,748
Can the bride tilt
her head toward the groom?

142
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:09,293
Yes, that's good.

143
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:10,836
All right. Here we go.

144
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,463
One, two.

145
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,594
We should've gotten matching rings.

146
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:20,846
It's okay.

147
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:24,433
This was more
than I could ever ask for anyway.

148
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:28,396
Now that we're done,
he'll never be able to find you.

149
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:35,152
It was my lifelong wish
to break up with him.

150
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:39,573
They say if you wish
with all your heart, it'll come true.

151
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:44,745
But I had no idea it would happen
in such an unexpected way.

152
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:51,252
Please stay by my side until the end.

153
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:56,340
That's my new wish now.

154
00:11:58,175 --> 00:12:00,970
Let's stay together…

155
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:06,100
at all costs.

156
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:10,271
You have to pull through no matter what.

157
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:13,983
I want to

158
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:18,279
live as your wife.

159
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,156
Okay?

160
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:21,949
Honey.

161
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:25,494
That's my wish.

162
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:38,466
Honey.

163
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:41,469
Can you hear me, honey?

164
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:43,304
Can you hear me?

165
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:46,599
Honey!

166
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:47,892
Honey!

167
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,352
Thank you, honey!

168
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:55,357
Thank you so much!

169
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:18,005
My life and death situation
made me realize…

170
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:27,890
APPLICATION FOR MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE

00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,564
All of my cherished memories…

172
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:41,737
were made after I met my family.

173
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:55,876
Mr. Jung Bong-wan.

174
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:01,006
You may have enjoyed
such happy moments had you been wiser.

175
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:05,219
Just as I've done all along,

176
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,389
I will continue to make

177
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:11,058
beautiful memories with my family.

178
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,696
I'm grateful
that my best revenge against you

179
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:26,782
is my family's happiness.

180
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,411
I'll cherish every moment

181
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,456
that we'll share in the future.

182
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:47,720
Jung Bong-wan.

183
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:51,849
I hope you…

184
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:54,685
rest in peace.

185
00:14:54,768 --> 00:15:00,399
DECEASED: JUNG BONG-WAN
NO SURVIVING FAMILY OR FRIENDS

186
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:05,487
COINCIDENCE VS. FATE

187
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:16,957
-Seo Mok-ha!
-Seo Mok-ha!

188
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:20,294
-Seo Mok-ha!
-Seo Mok-ha!

189
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:23,505
-Seo Mok-ha!
-Seo Mok-ha!

190
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:27,217
-Seo Mok-ha!
-Seo Mok-ha!

191
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:30,846
-Seo Mok-ha!
-Seo Mok-ha!

192
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:34,308
-Seo Mok-ha!
-Seo Mok-ha!

193
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,327
No, don't wake up.

194
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:57,373
Don't wake up.

195
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:08,509
Darn it.

196
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:10,052
It's the end.

197
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:20,562
Why does my dream always end there?

198
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:26,568
Jeez.

199
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:42,793
Goodness.

200
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:25,085
YOU WERE THE BRIGHTEST LIGHT

201
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:26,295
This stop is

202
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:28,213
Bujin Distribution Center.

203
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:58,452
Goodness, you're strong.

204
00:17:58,869 --> 00:17:59,953
She sure is. Gosh.

205
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,292
Gosh, she's so strong.

206
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,544
-Thank you.
-Thank you for the coffee.

207
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:08,754
Hey, young lady.

208
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:10,422
Come and have some coffee too.

209
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:11,507
Okay.

210
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:20,057
You're so strong for your size.

211
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:21,809
For me,

212
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:24,728
it's impossible to lift
sacks of rice or cat litter.

213
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:27,815
I've chopped down trees
and built a house on my own before.

214
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:29,483
This is nothing.

215
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:34,988
Seeing as how you work quickly,
you'll make a lot of money.

216
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:36,115
-Really?
-Yes.

217
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,200
Then, I should be even quicker.

218
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:41,161
Goodness, you're so eager to make money.

219
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:42,412
Of course.

220
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:45,958
I need to be if I have to
provide for four people.

221
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:49,545
Four? You have to support
four family members?

222
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:50,629
That's right.

223
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,006
Two guys who got fired from their jobs

224
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,217
and a married couple
whose business was closed.

225
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,135
That makes four.

226
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:58,720
They're not my family per se.

227
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:02,015
But they've taken care of me until now,

228
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:06,145
so I think of them as my family.

229
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:13,861
I love you, sir.

230
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:16,155
What's the matter with you?

231
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,367
You waited for me and took me back.

232
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:22,244
Thank you, sir. I love you.

233
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,288
That's enough. You're being gross.

234
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:27,082
You don't need to thank or love me.

235
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,501
You were proven innocent,
so get back to work.

236
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:33,213
Those covering the Han River are dying,
trying to cover your absence.

237
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:34,298
Right away?

238
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:37,342
It'll take some time
since I've changed my name.

239
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,303
I need to apply for a new ID badge too.

240
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,016
I already got one for you.

241
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:45,767
Happy?

242
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:50,105
That's your name, right?

243
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,690
LEE CHAE-HO

244
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:53,734
Yes.

245
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:56,111
Lee Chae-ho…

246
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:57,779
Lee Chae-ho.

247
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:00,991
It's going to take some time
to get used to it.

248
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:02,743
Likewise.

249
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:04,244
Let's work hard.

250
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:08,916
LEE KI-HO

251
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:10,626
Here you go.

252
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:13,587
Thank you.

253
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:16,506
Dong-min suffered the most,
filling in for Producer Kang…

254
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,091
I mean, Producer Lee.

255
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:22,387
Thanks.

256
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,848
Then, treat me to a meal! A fancy one.

257
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,100
Let go. Get off me.

258
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:30,646
"Lee Ki-ho."

259
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:34,066
It sounds so weird. It doesn't suit you.

260
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:35,609
You look like a "Kang Bo-geol."

261
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:37,569
Right? I prefer "Producer Kang" as well.

262
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,196
Can we just call you Producer Kang?

263
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:40,948
Please call me "Producer Lee."

264
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:47,329
I prefer "Lee" instead of "Kang."

265
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:54,753
What kind of hair piece is used
to give volume to a specific area

266
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:56,421
on the head?

267
00:20:57,547 --> 00:20:58,423
Correct.

268
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:04,137
After a haircut is finished,

269
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:07,307
what technique is used
to lightly cut the ends of hair?

270
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:13,480
Correct.

271
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:15,816
I'm going to fail at this rate.

272
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:17,401
No, you won't.

273
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:20,195
Let's just file an administrative lawsuit

274
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,863
and ask for our licenses back.

275
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,323
That'll take too long.

276
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:26,243
It'll be much faster
to get new ones with our new names.

277
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,912
-I can't do it.
-Yes, you can.

278
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,791
-We're back.
-We're home.

279
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:34,334
Hi. Did you have dinner yet?

280
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:36,545
I love you, Dad.

281
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,715
I love you, Mom.

282
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:42,301
I had dinner already.

283
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:47,097
Has he been watching
American TV shows? What's with him?

284
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,433
What? I like it.

285
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:56,773
What's gotten into you?

286
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:00,193
I've decided to express myself
from now on.

287
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,112
Come here.

288
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:03,322
Stay back.

289
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,326
I love you, my brother.

290
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:10,287
Gross. What's the matter with you?

291
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,706
When we almost lost Dad, I realized

292
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:14,458
not expressing your feelings

293
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:16,043
can be the biggest regret in life.

294
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:19,671
You know how much I hate regrets.

295
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:22,424
So I won't hide or cover up
my feelings anymore.

296
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:34,770
Our team reviewed
the invoice and the contract.

297
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:38,857
We believe we have a case.

298
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:42,027
What are the chances of winning? 100%?

299
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:44,529
A 100% chance of winning
a civil suit would be a lie.

300
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:47,574
-I'd say fifty-fifty.
-Fifty-fifty?

301
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:50,368
But he purposely fabricated
sales to be lower.

302
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:54,331
It's not easy to prove
he left out those figures on purpose.

303
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:58,794
Plus, Ms. Yoon's already signed
the termination form.

304
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,927
If we sue, it'll take some time
before we see a ruling, right?

305
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:08,678
It'll take at least a few months.

306
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:09,721
At most,

307
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,431
maybe over a decade.

308
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:14,726
Sending the subpoenas, gathering evidence,

309
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:17,020
conducting the trial, summoning witnesses…

310
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:18,480
It'll be an endless cycle.

311
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:22,609
At the end of the day,
it's a war of attrition.

312
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:33,745
You said she's your cousin, right?

313
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:34,830
Yes.

314
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:37,207
She's usually conservative with her words,

315
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:39,668
so it means
she's pretty confident about this.

316
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:42,546
Is she any good?

317
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:44,798
She has to be good
to be a partner at a law firm.

318
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:49,052
Are you going to sue him?

319
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,769
There's a sword in my hand,

320
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,271
so I might as well wield it.

321
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:28,091
"WE ARE ONE"

322
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:37,267
"WE ARE ONE"

323
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,019
You want me to switch songs?

324
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:40,770
What are you talking about?

325
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:43,064
President Lee decided
after discussing it with us.

326
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:46,234
"Into the Light" is too colorful for you.

327
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:47,569
It suits Ms. Eun better.

328
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:51,072
You think she's colorful
and I'm black and white?

329
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:52,949
I have fancy colors too!

330
00:24:53,491 --> 00:24:54,993
I touched up the lyrics

331
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:56,578
and wrote the directing notes.

332
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,038
And he's stealing it from us?

333
00:24:58,121 --> 00:25:01,082
He's not stealing it.

334
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:03,627
He wants to switch it with Ms. Eun's song.

335
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:04,961
Take a look.

336
00:25:05,962 --> 00:25:07,714
Goodness, I hate the title already.

337
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:09,883
"We Are One"? What kind of title is that?

338
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:12,802
Does he think we're trash cans
for throwaway songs?

339
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:15,472
Where is he?

340
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:20,644
Gosh.

341
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:23,730
This is going to be a headache.
He's not even here.

342
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,321
This fool still won't pick up.

343
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:33,406
Damn it.

344
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:35,867
Where are you going?

345
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:38,828
I'm going to look for him.
Call me right away if he comes.

346
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:40,121
-Okay?
-Okay.

347
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:05,480
President Lee!

348
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:07,190
Maru!

349
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:09,567
Good dog.

350
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:10,819
Where is President Lee?

351
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:12,946
President Lee!

352
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:14,447
President Lee.

353
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:17,242
President Lee! I know you're here!

354
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:18,868
Where is he?

355
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:22,330
Ran-joo.

356
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:24,291
So you were here.

357
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:26,710
Look at you.

358
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:28,420
Are you working from home today?

359
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:30,797
I'm feeling a bit under the weather.

360
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:33,466
How may I help you?

361
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:36,136
I get that you don't respect us,

362
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:37,804
but this is being too dirty.

363
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:40,974
What are you talking about?

364
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:43,601
You should support us
if you agreed to release an album.

365
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:45,312
How could you steal our song?

366
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:46,896
I didn't. I just switched them.

367
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,398
Stop playing around with words!

368
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:49,482
First,

369
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:51,401
sit down.

370
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:53,653
Let's sit down and talk.

371
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:01,286
Where in the world is he?

372
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:04,039
I'm so ready to fight right now.

373
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:05,915
President Lee!

374
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,088
Where is President Lee?

375
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:15,759
I'd like to ask you that.

376
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:19,721
You should know better
since you're close to him.

377
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:21,431
"Close"?

378
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:28,605
I get that Mo-rae is your top star,
but you're being a tyrant.

379
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:30,815
This is why I wanted the shares.

380
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:32,859
You make decisions as you please.

381
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:35,945
This is exactly why
I refused to give you the shares.

382
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:38,782
You make every decision
based on your emotions.

383
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:40,325
So?

384
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:42,702
You rationally decided to switch songs?

385
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:45,080
If we add "Into the Light"
to Mok-ha's album,

386
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:47,374
then she'll have two songs
of medium tempo.

387
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:48,958
The album will become boring.

388
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:51,586
I thought it would be better

389
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:55,173
for Mok-ha to sing Mo-rae's song
since she taps into emotions better.

390
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:57,300
How could you say

391
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:59,886
I was being a tyrant
even before listening to them?

392
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:01,888
I really don't get--

393
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:02,972
Here's my proof.

394
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:06,726
Why don't you give me
a rational explanation for this too?

395
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:14,567
I've been sick of being told I was
your substitute for the past 15 years.

396
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:17,070
I thought I was finally free
from hearing that,

397
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:19,114
but now he's treating me
like your sidekick.

398
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:20,615
Goodness.

399
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:24,619
If you're this insecure,
this is a serious disease.

400
00:28:24,702 --> 00:28:27,455
He gave me a song you threw away.
And you expect me to be calm?

401
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:28,498
This is being insecure?

402
00:28:28,581 --> 00:28:30,959
I lost it too when I got
the song you threw away!

403
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:32,502
I never threw it away!

404
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:33,878
I didn't throw away mine either!

405
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:37,507
President Lee said my song
was elaborate and colorful,

406
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:39,092
so it'd suit you better.

407
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:41,177
That means he thinks I'm dark and dull!

408
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:43,972
He told me my song was too grand for me

409
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:45,265
so it'd suit you better.

410
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:48,435
That means I should only sing
trivial and ordinary songs.

411
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:51,104
What? Then, he's the problem.

412
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:52,689
He provoked both of us!

413
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:55,734
Exactly. He has such a knack
for offending people.

414
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:06,327
What are we doing?

415
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,041
Don't tell anyone about this.

416
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:14,627
It'll humiliating for both of us.

417
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:26,264
Your mother had this in her possession?

418
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:27,474
That's right.

419
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:29,934
Even as her mind
struggled to maintain clarity,

420
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:33,021
she pleaded to not let you find out.

421
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:34,564
So explain to me

422
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:37,984
why my mother had
this shredded document in this state!

423
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:41,946
Your mother was the one who shredded it.

424
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:44,741
And I put it back together.

425
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:48,661
You're really the worst.

426
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:51,623
How low can you possibly go?

427
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:55,919
I can't even guess it now.

428
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:58,129
And if what you said was true,

429
00:29:58,713 --> 00:30:00,256
then she was the one

430
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:01,966
who took this back.

431
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,176
Why would she?

432
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,969
Because she wanted you

433
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:07,013
to remain a singer,

434
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:10,600
not become the president of an agency.

435
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:13,978
You're lying.

436
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:15,188
It's true.

437
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:18,817
And it's true that I used her as my excuse

438
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,611
to become the president.

439
00:30:23,863 --> 00:30:26,783
As the president of the agency,
I decided to switch the songs.

440
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:29,577
If my judgment was wrong,

441
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:31,955
it means I don't deserve to be president.

442
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:34,040
So why don't we do this?

443
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:36,668
With her new song,

444
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:39,003
if Mok-ha fails to top the charts,

445
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:42,131
I'll relinquish my position

446
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:44,968
and my shares.

447
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:49,055
What do you say?

448
00:30:57,063 --> 00:30:58,231
Just exactly how grand

449
00:30:58,898 --> 00:31:00,358
is your song?

450
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:02,569
What? Are you interested?

451
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:05,113
Just curious.

452
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:11,536
Send me yours too.

453
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:14,122
Let me see just how colorful it is.

454
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:56,623
Let me drive you home.

455
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:57,624
Forget it.

456
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:59,876
We're not close anymore
for such kind gestures.

457
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,338
Did you mean what you said before?

458
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:05,590
Yes, I did.

459
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:07,133
Words don't mean anything.

460
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:08,509
Write it up on paper.

461
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:11,471
I'll do that.

462
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:16,935
When are they investing?

463
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:20,063
They're not. I didn't sign the contract.

464
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:21,481
What?

465
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:24,817
Hold on.

466
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:26,736
Why not?

467
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:28,363
I just didn't want to

468
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,698
become a total scumbag.

469
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:47,256
Ran-joo, did you meet with President Lee?

470
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:48,758
Yeah.

471
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:51,427
I saw him and gave him an earful.

472
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:52,637
He apologized as well.

473
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:55,181
I see. You did well.

474
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:57,976
Then, what will we do about the songs?

475
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,520
Well…

476
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:03,231
He said he'd give
your song back right away.

477
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:04,565
But I told him to wait.

478
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:07,110
Deciding before even listening to it

479
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:08,945
seemed a bit hasty.

480
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:14,450
Did you get to listen to Mo-rae's song?

481
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:16,536
I did.

482
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:18,830
I gave it a listen.

483
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:22,625
What if…

484
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:25,128
Mok-ha hears the song

485
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,755
and still doesn't want to sing it?

486
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:30,883
I highly doubt that would happen.

487
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:32,677
But if that's the case,

488
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,595
then it means my judgment was wrong.

489
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:37,265
Then, would you acknowledge your mistake

490
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:38,516
and give up everything?

491
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:40,977
Your position and the shares?

492
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:42,478
Yes.

493
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:43,855
I'll do that.

494
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,982
But you have to promise me too

495
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:49,444
that you'll respect
Mok-ha's opinion as well.

496
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:53,531
How was the song?

497
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:56,325
Ran-joo, I…

498
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:59,328
totally…

499
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:00,580
loved it.

500
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,045
As soon as I listened to it,

501
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:09,380
I knew it was my song.

502
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:12,759
Can we switch the songs?

503
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:14,635
Sure.

504
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,721
Okay.

505
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:19,057
Let's think about it.

506
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:32,153
So? You're going to switch them?

507
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:33,613
Why? Should I not?

508
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:35,740
No, you should sing both of them.

509
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:38,076
-Don't give them to Mo-rae.
-What?

510
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,911
You're torn because you love both.

511
00:34:39,994 --> 00:34:41,829
So just insist on taking both of them.

512
00:34:43,372 --> 00:34:45,416
Don't share or be considerate.

513
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,294
That's how you'll become
the most successful artist ever.

514
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:49,587
Don't you think it's unfair?

515
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,386
What? What is it?

516
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:00,515
When I was little,

517
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:03,976
I wished I had an older brother
who'd always side with me.

518
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:06,729
Could you be my brother from now on?

519
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,858
-No.
-Why not?

520
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:13,486
You're older than me,
and it feels rude to treat you

521
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:14,821
as if we're the same age.

522
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:15,905
It's okay.

523
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,032
You can do that.

524
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:22,411
All right, then.

525
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:32,588
Hello.

526
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:34,465
This place is very popular these days.

527
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:36,092
I can't believe I'm finally here.

528
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:37,718
Can I eat whatever I want, right?

529
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:39,220
Sure, knock yourself out.

530
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:42,849
You don't know what this is, do you?

531
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:45,309
What are they having? I should order that.

532
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:46,477
Let's go somewhere else.

533
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:47,436
But why?

534
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,188
No, I want to eat here.

535
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:53,776
The chief is here. Should we join them?

536
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:56,362
Darn it. You knew about that, didn't you?

537
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:04,078
I've told you about Gull before?

538
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:06,289
You told me about it back at the salon.

539
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:12,587
It's on me.

540
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:13,754
No, it's expensive.

541
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:16,215
Hey, now. That's exactly
why it's my treat.

542
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,551
Also…

543
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:23,764
-Here.
-What's this?

544
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:29,228
It's money.

545
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,647
Both you and Ki-ho resigned,

546
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:33,816
and the salon is closed too.

547
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,360
It's hard on everyone, so use that money.

548
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:40,114
I'll give you much more once I debut.

549
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,534
Hey, we were both reinstated.

550
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:45,328
The salon will reopen soon too.

551
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:46,454
Really?

552
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:48,581
Ta-da.

553
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:50,333
Gosh, it's true.

554
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:52,210
I'm so happy for you!

555
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:56,255
Spend it on yourself.
Don't give it to others.

556
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:00,009
In that case,

557
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:02,053
give this to Ki-ho so I can pay rent.

558
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:04,430
But why would you pay him?

559
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:06,390
Your agency gave you that place.

560
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:08,851
No, they didn't. Ki-ho got it for me.

561
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:12,188
He said I didn't need to pay,
but how could I do that?

562
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:15,107
If I can't pay the security deposit,
I should at least pay rent.

563
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:17,318
Ki-ho did that?

564
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:18,402
Yeah.

565
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:21,239
When I was first rescued,

566
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:23,366
he was planning to take me there.

567
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:27,578
But I ended up going
with you to the rooftop room.

568
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:53,854
Bo-geol, hear me out first.

569
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,273
Let me…

570
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:56,857
Let me explain.

571
00:37:57,566 --> 00:38:00,611
It's nice to meet you.
I'm Bo-geol, Woo-hak's younger brother.

572
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:02,530
But you insisted on letting her in.

573
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:05,574
You said that was smooth
and perfect reasoning.

574
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:07,076
You were right.

575
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:09,662
That's why I decided to let her in.

576
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:22,591
Are you already asleep?

577
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:38,399
TO MY FIRST FAN, THANK YOU.
SEO MOK-HA

578
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:45,781
I have a question.

579
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:47,867
What? You were still awake?

580
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,410
Remember when you said

581
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:53,122
it was a coincidence
that I found Mok-ha on that island?

582
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:54,582
Yeah.

583
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:56,292
Do you still think so?

584
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,003
Yes.

585
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:02,631
HEYDAY AGAIN

586
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:07,470
No.

587
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:11,474
It wasn't a coincidence.

588
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:14,060
I went to Seoul Station every week,

589
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:15,311
joined the navy,

590
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:17,855
and cleaned deserted islands
for over a decade.

591
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:20,816
I did all that to find Mok-ha.

592
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:23,277
And you found her that day,

593
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:25,571
because you came with me.

594
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:28,866
It wasn't a coincidence.

595
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:31,535
It was fate.

596
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:38,125
You should've told me this sooner.

597
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:39,418
You know why I couldn't.

598
00:39:40,294 --> 00:39:43,214
I couldn't tell anyone
about our true identities back then.

599
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:50,554
Did you tell Mok-ha about this?

600
00:39:52,264 --> 00:39:53,265
No.

601
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,184
Jeez.

602
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,398
That's your problem.

603
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:02,483
Then, how would she know?

604
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:04,860
You're always so tight-lipped

605
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:06,946
as if you're the keeper of all secrets.

606
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:10,991
Jeez, you should be more transparent.

607
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:18,249
Then, you wouldn't regret it.

608
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:26,215
Chae-ho.

609
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:28,092
What?

610
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:30,845
I love you.

611
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:44,567
Ki-ho.

612
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:50,197
What you said to me
before I became stranded…

613
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:53,826
feels different

614
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:55,286
when I think about it now.

615
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:56,787
How is it? Isn't it crooked?

616
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:58,998
Yeah, it is. Lower the left side.

617
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:00,124
In the past,

618
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:03,836
"If you wish for something
with all your heart, one way or another,

619
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:06,505
"it'll come true one day"
was the part I liked.

620
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:08,048
Gosh.

621
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:09,633
I brought the rice cakes.

622
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:12,803
Open it and put it
next to the counter for the customers.

623
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:15,347
-Okay.
-I'll hang this here.

624
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:16,348
Okay.

625
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:19,852
But now, "It'll happen
in an unexpected way."

626
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:22,771
is the part I like the most.

627
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:24,815
BUSINESS LICENSE

628
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:27,526
-Right, Mok-ha.
-Yes?

629
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,862
-Can you sign a few autographs?
-Okay.

630
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:33,032
Having gone through it now,

631
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:37,203
I learned wishes
don't always come true right away.

632
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:40,998
They don't come true
when you want them to.

633
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:44,084
They take a long time.

634
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:45,794
They look good.

635
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:48,464
-Hello.
-Hello.

636
00:41:50,382 --> 00:41:51,717
You forget about them,

637
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:53,135
and then suddenly…

638
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:54,053
Congratulations.

639
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:57,014
Gosh, you didn't have to. Thank you.

640
00:41:57,097 --> 00:41:58,599
-Here.
-Thank you.

641
00:42:00,267 --> 00:42:01,310
They come true.

642
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:04,688
-It's about time I got a new perm.
-I see.

643
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:06,023
I'm here to dye my roots.

644
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:07,525
So don't cut ties…

645
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:09,652
just because you don't like them.

646
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:10,819
Thank you.

647
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:11,904
Give them the rice cakes.

648
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:14,240
Gosh, hello.

649
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:16,033
And don't give up even if it gets tough.

650
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:18,202
Don't hide and just come in already!

651
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:22,289
I'm sorry.

652
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:24,041
You know I tend to be rash.

653
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:25,501
Gosh, it's okay.

654
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:28,462
So you were aware of that?
I thought you didn't know.

655
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:31,507
I'm glad you came.

656
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:32,633
I wish you the best.

657
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:34,510
You didn't need to get this. Thanks.

658
00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:36,095
-Come on in.
-Congratulations.

659
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:38,138
Gosh, this is nice.

660
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:39,765
-Have some rice cakes first.
-Okay.

661
00:42:39,848 --> 00:42:42,017
Eat up. I'll bring out some tea.

662
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:48,274
Stay strong, endure it, and hang in there.

663
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:50,776
And then, one day…

664
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:53,070
-This is really tasty, Dad.
-Really?

665
00:42:53,153 --> 00:42:55,281
-Have a piece later.
-It's a well-known shop.

666
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:57,533
It's very chewy.

667
00:42:57,616 --> 00:42:59,451
Your wishes will come true…

668
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:04,123
in unexpected ways.

669
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:20,180
…IN UNEXPECTED WAYS

670
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:15,944
AFTER I WAS LOST

671
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:19,657
A SEEMINGLY ENDLESS FOG

672
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:25,037
IT WAS HARD TO SAY IT
CLOSE YOUR EYES AND FEEL PEACE

673
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:35,839
DESERVES TO BE REMEMBERED

674
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:38,801
IN THE DARK SKY
THE STARS BEGIN TO LIGHT UP

675
00:44:38,884 --> 00:44:42,012
AND SHINE ON ME
LEAN ON IT AND ENDURE

676
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:10,999
What are you up to?

677
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:13,085
Hey, there.

678
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:16,213
The night sky looks
so beautiful from up here.

679
00:45:16,296 --> 00:45:17,881
I was writing down some lyrics.

680
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:19,591
Right?

681
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:21,093
Our house has a killer view.

682
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:25,222
Gosh, I would've never dreamed
of such a view on the deserted island.

683
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:28,809
The stars were in the sky
back on the island.

684
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:30,936
But here, they're down below.

685
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:36,775
Tell her.

686
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:41,113
Not expressing your feelings
can be the biggest regret in life.

687
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:47,786
Mok-ha.

688
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:49,329
Yes?

689
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:54,751
When I found you on the deserted island,

690
00:45:57,546 --> 00:45:59,006
do you think it was a coincidence?

691
00:46:01,049 --> 00:46:02,050
No.

692
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:05,929
How could that have been a coincidence?

693
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:12,144
I know you tried your best to look for me.

694
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:16,690
After I went missing,

695
00:46:17,399 --> 00:46:21,195
I also know you smashed
all the water tanks.

696
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:24,823
I know you went to the ocean

697
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:26,783
and worried about me.

698
00:46:29,411 --> 00:46:30,746
I also know you asked…

699
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:33,832
-Please help her.
-…Ran-joo for help.

700
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:35,083
Please give her a chance.

701
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:42,424
I also know you waited
for me at Seoul Station.

702
00:46:45,844 --> 00:46:46,970
And you searched

703
00:46:48,555 --> 00:46:50,432
all the deserted islands to find me.

704
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:53,352
I know all about it.

705
00:46:56,855 --> 00:46:58,482
You tried so hard.

706
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:01,777
So how could it have been a coincidence?

707
00:47:06,114 --> 00:47:07,282
It was fate.

708
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:20,087
What's this?

709
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:22,381
Gosh! You can't look at that!

710
00:47:22,464 --> 00:47:23,340
No!

711
00:47:23,423 --> 00:47:24,591
Did you write this for me?

712
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:26,176
No, I didn't!

713
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:27,219
Gosh, give that back!

714
00:47:27,302 --> 00:47:28,887
Don't read it!

715
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:31,348
Goodness. That's my journal!

716
00:47:31,431 --> 00:47:34,268
-Gosh.
-Gosh.

717
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:36,562
-Let's go.
-Gosh, let's go.

718
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:40,857
If we hang them at night,
will they dry properly?

719
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:42,609
Of course. It's been dry lately.

720
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:44,736
Let me read your journal.

721
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:46,071
Give it back to me!

722
00:47:47,447 --> 00:47:48,782
-All right.
-Come on!

723
00:47:49,449 --> 00:47:51,410
-Goodness.
-Hey.

724
00:47:51,493 --> 00:47:54,871
No, they won't dry properly.
Let's hang them in the morning.

725
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:55,831
Why?

726
00:47:55,914 --> 00:47:56,748
Come on, Dad.

727
00:47:58,875 --> 00:48:00,377
Give it back to me.

728
00:48:00,877 --> 00:48:02,421
Have you talked to Mok-ha yet?

729
00:48:02,504 --> 00:48:03,380
No.

730
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:04,840
When will you then?

731
00:48:04,923 --> 00:48:05,882
I won't.

732
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:07,718
Why not? You said you'd regret it.

733
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:12,264
I wasn't the only one who felt that way.

734
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:20,939
-All right.
-Give it back.

735
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:22,107
I'll give it back.

736
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:24,067
Jeez.

737
00:48:27,112 --> 00:48:28,488
You gave me a heart attack.

738
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:34,995
I'm pretty sure you wrote it for me.

739
00:48:35,912 --> 00:48:36,955
Let me take a peek.

740
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:39,958
Listen to the song once it comes out.

741
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:42,336
I used this to write the lyrics.

742
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:46,006
Are you promoting your song right now?

743
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:49,926
Come to my performance
and listen to it in person if you can.

744
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:52,095
I see. You're holding a concert too?

745
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:53,805
I will probably one day, right?

746
00:48:55,932 --> 00:48:56,892
This is the stage,

747
00:48:57,934 --> 00:49:00,646
and all those lights are light sticks.

748
00:49:01,229 --> 00:49:05,317
A concert hall this size would be nice.

749
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,736
Gosh, this is as big

750
00:49:08,528 --> 00:49:10,572
as the Jamsil Sports Complex.

751
00:49:11,698 --> 00:49:14,451
If I sang at a place like this

752
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:17,287
and you directed the camera shots,

753
00:49:18,538 --> 00:49:20,707
just imagine how wonderful would it be.

754
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:23,460
Let's do that.

755
00:49:25,837 --> 00:49:26,838
Thanks.

756
00:49:30,008 --> 00:49:31,009
I'm sorry,

757
00:49:31,968 --> 00:49:33,887
but I read a page in your journal.

758
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:35,055
What?

759
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:38,225
Which page? What did you read?

760
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:41,895
"After leaving the deserted island,
the thing I was most grateful for was"

761
00:49:44,272 --> 00:49:46,983
"the word 'father' went
from being a nightmare"

762
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:53,156
"to the most heartwarming word
in the world."

763
00:49:58,578 --> 00:49:59,830
I feel the same way too.

764
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:05,961
That day,

765
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:09,631
when you stepped in under my umbrella…

766
00:50:13,009 --> 00:50:13,885
Thank you.

767
00:50:19,224 --> 00:50:20,225
Come here.

768
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:40,078
In an endless fog…

769
00:50:51,256 --> 00:50:53,884
It does sound much better
with the new lyrics.

770
00:50:55,802 --> 00:50:58,096
But what if Mo-rae makes
a hit with our song?

771
00:50:58,180 --> 00:50:59,639
And you still wouldn't regret it?

772
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:02,601
No, I wouldn't.

773
00:51:02,684 --> 00:51:04,060
Why did you pick this song?

774
00:51:07,272 --> 00:51:08,273
Ran-joo.

775
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:10,817
This song is--

776
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:18,116
What is it?

777
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:20,327
Mo-rae said she had something to say.

778
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:29,669
This is yours, right?

779
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:30,962
The directing notes.

780
00:51:31,046 --> 00:51:32,881
They were left in the practice room.

781
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:34,549
Give them to me.

782
00:51:36,384 --> 00:51:37,344
What are you doing?

783
00:51:39,554 --> 00:51:40,555
I'd like you

784
00:51:41,056 --> 00:51:42,682
to produce this song for me.

785
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:46,019
No, thanks. Why should I?

786
00:51:48,855 --> 00:51:52,067
I heard you analyzed it a ton
and changed the lyrics for her.

787
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:54,820
So wouldn't it be a waste?

788
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:58,490
I'd rather waste it
than hand it over to you.

789
00:51:58,573 --> 00:51:59,616
Let's go.

790
00:52:03,203 --> 00:52:05,080
I'll add your name as songwriter.

791
00:52:07,999 --> 00:52:09,000
You know

792
00:52:09,084 --> 00:52:11,962
that my songs
get huge royalty fees, right?

793
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:20,679
You've become much bolder.

794
00:52:33,024 --> 00:52:35,735
We'll do a test recording first.

795
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:37,153
Are you ready?

796
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:38,071
Yes.

797
00:52:39,155 --> 00:52:41,199
I thought you'd rather waste it?

798
00:52:41,283 --> 00:52:43,368
We can always learn from this.

799
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:47,664
"Let the failure of others
become a lesson to you."

800
00:52:47,747 --> 00:52:50,083
Learn what you can and ignore the rest.

801
00:52:50,166 --> 00:52:52,377
-You're next.
-Yes, ma'am.

802
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:58,508
-Don't stop even if she makes a mistake.
-Okay.

803
00:53:01,261 --> 00:53:02,345
Cue.

804
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:35,170
Mok-ha, see how the vibe changes here?

805
00:53:35,253 --> 00:53:37,589
-Right.
-Bring it up softly.

806
00:53:50,936 --> 00:53:52,354
Gosh, she's gorgeous.

807
00:53:52,437 --> 00:53:55,607
-Mo-rae is so stunning.
-I love her new song.

808
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:59,194
Okay. One, two, three.

809
00:54:00,946 --> 00:54:02,656
-We love you, Mok-ha.
-We love you.

810
00:54:03,156 --> 00:54:06,701
We met her 15 years ago over the phone.

811
00:54:06,785 --> 00:54:09,412
But today, she's here
at our studio as a singer

812
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:10,914
releasing her debut record.

813
00:54:10,997 --> 00:54:13,083
Ms. Seo, could you introduce yourself?

814
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:14,626
Okay.

815
00:54:15,126 --> 00:54:16,419
Hello.

816
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:19,339
I'm here to introduce
my new song "Fly Away" to everyone.

817
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:21,591
I'm the rookie singer Seo Mok-ha.

818
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:31,726
SEO MOK-HA

819
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:34,396
Come in.

820
00:54:38,566 --> 00:54:39,567
What is it?

821
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:42,153
I have something to ask you, sir.

822
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:48,743
Remember how you promised
to reward me last time?

823
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:52,247
Of course, I remember that.

824
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:56,251
What do you want? A bonus or a promotion?

825
00:54:56,751 --> 00:54:57,919
No, sir.

826
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:02,340
I'd like to transfer teams

827
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:05,719
and join Seo Mok-ha's.

828
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:07,220
Mok-ha's team?

829
00:55:08,346 --> 00:55:10,056
I don't think that'd be a reward.

830
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:12,392
Isn't it easier with Mo-rae?

831
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:15,311
I had it easy for the past ten years,

832
00:55:17,439 --> 00:55:20,567
so I want to have
some fun for the next ten.

833
00:55:34,956 --> 00:55:38,710
NUMBER ONE AGAIN!
THANK YOU TO ALL MY BELOVED FANS

834
00:55:50,263 --> 00:55:53,683
YOON RAN-JOO

835
00:55:58,229 --> 00:56:01,149
FOLLOW

836
00:56:08,823 --> 00:56:11,951
See? We shouldn't have switched songs!

837
00:56:13,369 --> 00:56:15,663
Hey, doesn't this make you upset?

838
00:56:15,747 --> 00:56:17,999
Mo-rae's topped
the charts for ten days now.

839
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:20,919
I'm slowly climbing up the charts too.

840
00:56:21,461 --> 00:56:24,005
I was number 32 yesterday,
and I'm number 31 today.

841
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:27,759
At this rate, I'll top the charts
sooner or later, right?

842
00:56:27,842 --> 00:56:31,596
You're so generous with yourself.
Everything must seem just peachy to you.

843
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:33,515
Indeed, it is.

844
00:56:33,598 --> 00:56:34,849
I even have

845
00:56:35,391 --> 00:56:36,851
a gig booked for today.

846
00:56:38,269 --> 00:56:39,145
A gig?

847
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:41,856
Where?

848
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:47,737
Sangyeon Park Gym.

849
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:49,906
It finally understood me.

850
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:52,784
There's another Deodeok Festival
this year?

851
00:56:52,867 --> 00:56:57,622
That one celebrated the sowing.
This one celebrates the harvesting.

852
00:56:57,705 --> 00:56:58,540
Isn't this so fun?

853
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:02,293
Yes, it must be great
to have so much fun all the time.

854
00:57:04,963 --> 00:57:06,923
Yong-gwan, are you helping us
just for today?

855
00:57:07,799 --> 00:57:08,800
No.

856
00:57:09,425 --> 00:57:11,803
I've been assigned
to this team starting today.

857
00:57:12,637 --> 00:57:14,305
-Really?
-Why?

858
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:16,432
Did you do something bad?

859
00:57:16,516 --> 00:57:17,559
Did you fight with Lee?

860
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:20,353
-No.
-Then, why were you demoted?

861
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:21,855
Goodness, Ran-joo.

862
00:57:22,355 --> 00:57:24,691
Why would it be
a demotion to join our team?

863
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:26,901
She's right.
It could actually be a promotion.

864
00:57:27,026 --> 00:57:28,027
Right.

865
00:57:29,487 --> 00:57:31,739
Am I always going for people like you

866
00:57:31,823 --> 00:57:34,576
or do I attract only people like you?

867
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:36,286
It's just fascinating.

868
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:39,080
The most fascinating thing is

869
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:43,209
this is the place
where you and I first met.

870
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:47,422
Jeez.

871
00:57:54,512 --> 00:57:56,139
We're in event season.

872
00:57:56,222 --> 00:57:58,558
-You should understand.
-Goodness.

873
00:57:58,641 --> 00:58:00,643
Look at all this. We've prepared a lot.

874
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:02,604
Gosh, you must've invested a bit of money.

875
00:58:02,687 --> 00:58:04,522
-It's insane, right?
-It's extravagant.

876
00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:05,648
Anyway,

877
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:08,443
-the most important part…
-You're so talented, Ran-joo.

878
00:58:08,526 --> 00:58:09,736
-…is deodeok.
-Right.

879
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:11,154
-It's deodeok.
-Deodeok.

880
00:58:11,237 --> 00:58:12,947
"A performance as bold

881
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:15,074
and exciting as deodeok!"

882
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:16,117
Got it.

883
00:58:16,201 --> 00:58:17,076
-Got that?
-Yes.

884
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,036
Don't forget that.

885
00:58:18,119 --> 00:58:19,871
-It needs to be killer, right?
-Right.

886
00:58:19,954 --> 00:58:21,122
It has to be sensational.

887
00:58:21,206 --> 00:58:22,624
-Keep that in mind.
-All right.

888
00:58:22,707 --> 00:58:24,334
-Please remember that.
-Sure thing.

889
00:58:25,084 --> 00:58:27,462
Excuse me.

890
00:58:27,545 --> 00:58:30,798
But my song isn't necessarily
all that exciting or killer.

891
00:58:30,882 --> 00:58:33,343
It's a bit on the grand side.

892
00:58:36,095 --> 00:58:37,263
That sounds better.

893
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:42,810
"Bold and grand like deodeok."

894
00:58:42,894 --> 00:58:43,770
-I see.
-Yeah.

895
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:45,021
-I like it.
-Right?

896
00:58:45,104 --> 00:58:46,898
I like it. "Bold and grand."

897
00:58:46,981 --> 00:58:47,982
Yong-gwan.

898
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:49,859
Is there a mart nearby?

899
00:58:49,943 --> 00:58:50,902
A mart?

900
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:52,487
What for?

901
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:56,824
Look for one.

902
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:05,041
Gosh.

903
00:59:07,502 --> 00:59:08,711
I'm so dizzy.

904
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:09,796
Jeez.

905
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:11,923
How did Mok-ha blow all of these?

906
00:59:13,258 --> 00:59:14,467
We won't ever finish.

907
00:59:15,885 --> 00:59:18,137
Tying them is no joke either.

908
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:22,016
What?

909
00:59:23,309 --> 00:59:25,186
Goodness, what brings you here?

910
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:26,688
We came to help.

911
00:59:27,772 --> 00:59:28,982
When Seo Mok-ha appears,

912
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:30,441
just shake them like this.

913
00:59:30,525 --> 00:59:32,360
-Shake them a lot.
-Please cheer for Mok-ha!

914
00:59:32,443 --> 00:59:33,861
Hold it up high.

915
00:59:34,529 --> 00:59:36,281
Hi, please help a fellow staff member.

916
00:59:36,364 --> 00:59:38,283
Hold it high and shake it for Seo Mok-ha!

917
00:59:38,366 --> 00:59:40,076
Here! Take one.

918
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:41,828
You need to shake it later.

919
00:59:41,911 --> 00:59:43,121
-Okay?
-Thank you.

920
00:59:43,204 --> 00:59:44,330
Hold it high and shake it.

921
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:46,040
Shake it like this.

922
00:59:46,124 --> 00:59:48,001
Shake it like this
when Seo Mok-ha appears.

923
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:51,212
-Thank you.
-Please cheer for Seo Mok-ha. Thank you.

924
00:59:51,296 --> 00:59:53,047
You need to shake it, okay? You, sir!

925
00:59:53,131 --> 00:59:56,134
-Hold it high and shake it.
-Just shake it like this.

926
00:59:56,217 --> 00:59:59,095
-Please cheer for Seo Mok-ha!
-Hey, here!

927
01:00:20,992 --> 01:00:21,993
You're up next.

928
01:00:22,076 --> 01:00:23,119
Are you ready?

929
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:26,205
I'm so nervous

930
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:27,290
and excited.

931
01:00:27,373 --> 01:00:28,875
I'm nervous too.

932
01:00:30,126 --> 01:00:31,377
I'm worried.

933
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:34,756
Why are you so worried?

934
01:00:34,839 --> 01:00:36,424
I'm worried about you.

935
01:00:37,258 --> 01:00:39,344
Eun Mo-rae is topping all the charts,

936
01:00:39,427 --> 01:00:42,555
so seeing you happy
with such a small event worries me.

937
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:45,725
How will you become
a singer if you're so complacent?

938
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:50,188
Ran-joo.

939
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:52,815
Do you remember

940
01:00:53,441 --> 01:00:56,903
that cooler box story
I told you back then?

941
01:00:59,155 --> 01:01:00,365
Of course, I do.

942
01:01:00,865 --> 01:01:02,325
How could I ever forget that?

943
01:01:05,453 --> 01:01:07,997
Before finding that cooler box,

944
01:01:08,873 --> 01:01:09,874
for six years,

945
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:13,795
I wondered every single day.

946
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:18,049
"Will they ever send a rescue team?"

947
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:23,304
"What if another typhoon hits?"

948
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:27,642
"Will I be able to survive here?"

949
01:01:30,978 --> 01:01:33,606
"What did I do that was so wrong
to deserve this?"

950
01:01:36,651 --> 01:01:37,860
Like so,

951
01:01:38,403 --> 01:01:39,862
I filled every single day

952
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:43,282
with those questions that had no answers.

953
01:01:44,909 --> 01:01:47,203
And that made me want to die.

954
01:01:51,791 --> 01:01:54,794
But after eating
that ramyeon in the cooler box,

955
01:01:56,254 --> 01:01:57,422
I told myself

956
01:01:58,214 --> 01:02:01,634
to keep hanging on
for another five minutes.

957
01:02:03,010 --> 01:02:04,178
When I made up my mind…

958
01:02:07,181 --> 01:02:09,559
another question then popped into my head.

959
01:02:09,642 --> 01:02:10,810
"What will I do

960
01:02:12,228 --> 01:02:13,563
for those five minutes?"

961
01:02:19,318 --> 01:02:20,570
And that question

962
01:02:21,279 --> 01:02:23,030
had no answer either.

963
01:02:25,324 --> 01:02:26,784
But at that moment,

964
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:28,661
I saw

965
01:02:30,288 --> 01:02:34,500
the sunlight shining through the leaves.

966
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:37,086
It was so beautiful.

967
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:39,672
So…

968
01:02:40,506 --> 01:02:44,969
I forgot about the question
for five minutes.

969
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:55,980
One day, I befriended a seagull.

970
01:02:58,691 --> 01:02:59,692
Hey, gull.

971
01:03:00,526 --> 01:03:01,736
Hey, seagull.

972
01:03:01,819 --> 01:03:03,446
It was so fascinating

973
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:06,240
that for about 50 minutes,

974
01:03:07,241 --> 01:03:10,620
I forgot about the questions.

975
01:03:13,122 --> 01:03:14,207
One day,

976
01:03:14,832 --> 01:03:17,251
a ton of trash washed ashore.

977
01:03:18,294 --> 01:03:20,755
I wondered what I should make with it

978
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:23,090
and felt excited.

979
01:03:25,051 --> 01:03:26,969
So for five hours,

980
01:03:27,887 --> 01:03:32,433
I forgot about the questions.

981
01:03:35,019 --> 01:03:38,981
By replacing those answerless questions

982
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:43,069
with other things to fill up the time,

983
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:46,155
I survived one day after another.

984
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:51,118
And that's when it came
at the most unexpected moment.

985
01:03:51,702 --> 01:03:52,787
The drone?

986
01:03:56,457 --> 01:03:58,084
Even when I came ashore,

987
01:03:58,167 --> 01:04:01,045
I kept asking myself
questions that had no answers.

988
01:04:01,629 --> 01:04:04,882
"Is it right to pursue
singing at this age?"

989
01:04:04,966 --> 01:04:07,760
"Will I be able to
make a living out of this?"

990
01:04:07,844 --> 01:04:10,763
"When will I ever surpass Eun Mo-rae?"

991
01:04:12,306 --> 01:04:14,767
But as soon as I heard this song,

992
01:04:16,435 --> 01:04:21,732
I was reminded of that sunlight.

993
01:04:29,657 --> 01:04:31,826
The sunlight that erased all my questions

994
01:04:33,578 --> 01:04:34,579
that had no answers.

995
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:39,000
That's why I chose it.

996
01:04:41,168 --> 01:04:43,337
Why ask questions that have no answers?

997
01:04:43,421 --> 01:04:46,007
I'd rather practice singing instead.

998
01:04:46,841 --> 01:04:49,594
And it's better to perform
even if the stage is small.

999
01:04:50,261 --> 01:04:51,762
I'd rather do manual labor

1000
01:04:51,846 --> 01:04:53,556
and earn money

1001
01:04:53,639 --> 01:04:55,349
than worry about making ends meet.

1002
01:04:56,767 --> 01:04:59,395
Right, that is better.

1003
01:05:01,772 --> 01:05:05,860
If you continue to fill up your time

1004
01:05:06,569 --> 01:05:07,778
in that way,

1005
01:05:09,113 --> 01:05:12,116
then don't you think, one way or another,

1006
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:16,120
it'll happen one day?

1007
01:05:36,974 --> 01:05:39,060
It's 270,000 won per share when trading.

1008
01:05:39,143 --> 01:05:40,394
-Okay.
-You can sign

1009
01:05:40,478 --> 01:05:41,979
on the back page.

1010
01:05:42,063 --> 01:05:43,064
Excuse me.

1011
01:05:44,315 --> 01:05:45,650
ARTIST

1012
01:05:47,068 --> 01:05:47,944
Hey.

1013
01:05:48,027 --> 01:05:49,779
I was going to call you.

1014
01:05:49,862 --> 01:05:50,947
Where are you?

1015
01:05:51,030 --> 01:05:53,699
I'm signing the stock transfer agreement

1016
01:05:53,783 --> 01:05:55,284
with the legal team right now.

1017
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:57,495
Put it on hold for now.

1018
01:05:57,578 --> 01:05:59,288
Put it on hold?

1019
01:06:00,206 --> 01:06:01,207
Why?

1020
01:06:02,541 --> 01:06:03,542
Well…

1021
01:06:04,418 --> 01:06:07,546
Mok-ha might top the charts
as you said she would.

1022
01:06:08,673 --> 01:06:10,132
No, I think she will.

1023
01:06:11,008 --> 01:06:12,009
Let's be patient.

1024
01:06:12,468 --> 01:06:13,719
Let's take our time

1025
01:06:13,803 --> 01:06:15,388
before dealing with the shares.

1026
01:06:20,309 --> 01:06:22,812
Our next singer has a special place

1027
01:06:22,895 --> 01:06:24,939
in her heart for deodeok.

1028
01:06:25,481 --> 01:06:28,901
She survived
on a deserted island for 15 years

1029
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:30,736
by digging up and eating deodeok.

1030
01:06:33,197 --> 01:06:37,535
Her song is as bold and grand as deodeok.

1031
01:06:37,618 --> 01:06:40,788
It's Seo Mok-ha.

1032
01:06:40,871 --> 01:06:42,623
Please give her a round of applause.

1033
01:07:28,836 --> 01:07:30,588
You're so gorgeous!

1034
01:07:36,260 --> 01:07:40,347
-Seo Mok-ha!
-Seo Mok-ha!

1035
01:07:41,432 --> 01:07:43,726
You look so beautiful!

1036
01:07:45,394 --> 01:07:46,729
Over here, Mok-ha!

1037
01:07:48,522 --> 01:07:51,192
Seo Mok-ha!

1038
01:07:53,027 --> 01:07:54,570
We love you!

1039
01:08:36,070 --> 01:08:42,493
How long have I been lost for?

1040
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:48,457
I don't even remember

1041
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:56,382
I was trapped in an endless fog

1042
01:08:57,383 --> 01:09:03,180
It was hard to console myself

1043
01:09:05,850 --> 01:09:08,519
In the dark sky

1044
01:09:09,562 --> 01:09:13,190
The stars begin to light up

1045
01:09:14,525 --> 01:09:17,820
And shine on us

1046
01:09:18,404 --> 01:09:24,785
Close your eyes and feel this moment

1047
01:09:24,869 --> 01:09:29,915
Lean on me

1048
01:09:32,376 --> 01:09:38,674
The pain from those lonely days

1049
01:09:38,757 --> 01:09:42,511
As long as I'm with you

1050
01:09:42,595 --> 01:09:48,184
We can endure it

1051
01:09:48,267 --> 01:09:51,020
Fly away

1052
01:09:52,146 --> 01:09:54,481
Fly away

1053
01:09:55,733 --> 01:10:01,780
Fly away

1054
01:10:02,531 --> 01:10:04,950
Fly away

1055
01:10:06,285 --> 01:10:09,079
Fly away

1056
01:10:09,830 --> 01:10:16,795
Fly away

1057
01:10:18,088 --> 01:10:24,595
Close your eyes and feel this moment

1058
01:10:24,762 --> 01:10:31,727
Lean on me

1059
01:10:32,478 --> 01:10:35,856
The pain…

1060
01:10:35,940 --> 01:10:38,317
Camera six, cut.

1061
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:39,443
Camera three.

1062
01:10:40,110 --> 01:10:42,571
Cut. Prepare the jib camera.

1063
01:10:42,655 --> 01:10:48,661
We can endure it

1064
01:11:02,758 --> 01:11:05,552
Fly away

1065
01:11:06,303 --> 01:11:09,556
Fly away

1066
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:15,771
Fly away

1067
01:11:23,362 --> 01:11:26,991

CASTAWAY DIVA

01:12:28,635 --> 01:12:32,181
SEO MOK-HA

1082
01:12:58,332 --> 01:12:59,666
Mother. Father.

1083
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:01,043
-Look over here.
-Okay.

1084
01:13:01,126 --> 01:13:02,920
One, two, three.

1085
01:13:09,843 --> 01:13:11,261
Enough photos. Let's eat already.

1086
01:13:11,345 --> 01:13:12,346
Okay.

1087
01:13:12,429 --> 01:13:14,223
Mok-ha, have some japchae.

1088
01:13:14,306 --> 01:13:16,058
It's my work, but it's so good.

1089
01:13:16,141 --> 01:13:18,560
I can't go on a diet because of you.

1090
01:13:18,644 --> 01:13:20,270
You always make a ton of food.

1091
01:13:21,397 --> 01:13:24,650
Mok-ha, have some hairtail too.
You have to eat well to sing well.

1092
01:13:25,651 --> 01:13:26,652
-Mom.
-Yes?

1093
01:13:26,735 --> 01:13:29,238
I love hairtail and japchae too.

1094
01:13:30,447 --> 01:13:32,616
You're overflowing with love these days.

1095
01:13:32,699 --> 01:13:33,867
You have a double chin now.

1096
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:35,452
Ridiculous. What's your problem?

1097
01:13:35,536 --> 01:13:37,162
-Try to cut back.
-Gosh.

1098
01:13:37,246 --> 01:13:39,415
Mok-ha, stop taking photos and eat.

1099
01:13:39,498 --> 01:13:40,791
Okay.

1100
01:13:40,874 --> 01:13:43,293
Goodness! You look so handsome.

1101
01:13:43,377 --> 01:13:44,294
Do I?

1102
01:13:44,378 --> 01:13:45,337
How does this look?

1103
01:13:45,421 --> 01:13:46,880
Gosh, you look stunning.

1104
01:13:46,964 --> 01:13:48,924
-Anchovies will make me fatter.
-No, smarter.

1105
01:13:49,007 --> 01:13:50,676
-You need them.
-Thanks for the meal!

1106
01:13:50,759 --> 01:13:51,677
I'm already smart.

1107
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:53,220
-Have this.
-I never liked them.

1108
01:13:53,303 --> 01:13:54,138
I like japchae.

1109
01:13:54,221 --> 01:13:55,180
Start liking these.

1110
01:13:55,264 --> 01:13:56,640
-Thanks.
-Have some anchovies.

1111
01:13:56,723 --> 01:13:58,183
You need stronger bones.

1112
01:13:58,267 --> 01:13:59,768
My bones are strong. I want hairtail.

1113
01:17:13,545 --> 01:17:15,547
