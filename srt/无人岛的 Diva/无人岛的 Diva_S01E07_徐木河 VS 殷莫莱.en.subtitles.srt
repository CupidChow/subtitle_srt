1
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:55,054
CASTAWAY DIVA

2
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:57,599
BROTHERS SALON

3
00:00:57,682 --> 00:00:59,059
The hair treatment's on the house.

4
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:00,769
I'll only charge you 60,000 won.

5
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,104
I don't see your husband around.

6
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:05,190
You're right. Goodness.

7
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:08,318
He's taking the whole day to recycle.

8
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:11,071
I'm really curious.

9
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:14,574
-Did you have an arranged marriage?
-No, we married out of love.

10
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:15,700
Out of love?

11
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:17,786
How's that possible?

12
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:20,163
It was love at first sight.

13
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:22,373
I wonder what made you fall for him.

14
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:28,338
Your mom and I first met

15
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,423
at my former workplace.

16
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:32,383
And where was that?

17
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:33,843
An office in Woldo-eup.

18
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:37,138
I used to be

19
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,890
a civil servant.

20
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:39,974
Seriously?

21
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:41,059
Yes.

22
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:44,729
I was the prime example
of diligence and kindness.

23
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:45,855
It's all set.

24
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:49,025
If you met at work,

25
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:51,319
was she a civil servant too?

26
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:52,529
No.

27
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:54,447
She was there to get help.

28
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:55,532
Excuse me.

29
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:58,243
I have a question.

30
00:01:58,326 --> 00:01:59,828
Sure, what is it?

31
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,332
How do I change my name?

32
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:06,793
After you change it,
you come here to report it.

33
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:08,753
You need to go to court to change it.

34
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:10,880
I see.

35
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,136
Sir.

36
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:18,138
Is it possible to change it

37
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:21,266
without my husband's knowing?

38
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:28,648
Well…

39
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:30,483
It'll be easy for him to find out.

40
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:34,154
He'll just need
to get a copy of the family register.

41
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:35,989
I see.

42
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:39,617
She didn't call the police?

43
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,371
Ma'am.

44
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:46,166
Have you tried calling the police?

45
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:48,918
Do you need…

46
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:52,088
-I can help--
-It's okay. Thank you.

47
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:58,595
I'm sure she did.

48
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:00,430
But it was useless.

49
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,850
So she came all the way
to the countryside on her poor legs.

50
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,521
Wait!

51
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:15,695
How could I not
fall in love at first sight?

52
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:18,364
He was handsome.

53
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:20,199
It's a beautiful village.

54
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:22,744
-He was a gentleman.
-If you're up for it…

55
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:24,329
Okay. Then…

56
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:26,164
Let me show you the way.

57
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:28,124
He was the first person

58
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,461
who tried to walk at my pace.

59
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:36,549
Your mom said

60
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:39,677
she had two sons.

61
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:42,472
And that she wanted to protect them.

62
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:52,774
That's when I found a way.

63
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:54,609
A family had disappeared in my region.

64
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:57,570
They also had two sons.

65
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,364
The entire family disappeared,

66
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:01,658
so they weren't reported missing.

67
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:04,786
The boys were around your age too.

68
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:07,914
Then, their names…

69
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,375
Are ours now.

70
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:14,295
Kang Sang-doo, Song Ha-jung, Kang Woo-hak,

71
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:16,297
and Kang Bo-geol.

72
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:23,179
Where are they?

73
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,431
Who knows.

74
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:28,101
They just vanished into thin air.

75
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:30,103
What if they return?

76
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:33,606
They've been missing
for over 20 years now.

77
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,609
They probably would've shown up by now.

78
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:37,735
Dad.

79
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:40,238
I know. What we did was wrong.

80
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:42,490
But,

81
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:44,742
back then,

82
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:49,247
we had no other choice.

83
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:58,673
Then, what are our real names?

84
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,356
You're Jung Chae-ho.

85
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,027
Bo-geol is…

86
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:21,571
Jung Ki-ho.

87
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,585
My name is Yang Jae-kyung.

88
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:38,838
I see. I'm Lee Uk.

89
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:55,229
Ms. Yoon lip-synced?

90
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:57,523
I had no idea.

91
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:59,108
We didn't know either.

92
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:03,029
She's going to come clean
on TV today, so the script's a bit thick.

93
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,865
If Ms. Yoon wins,

94
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:07,909
the actual singer will appear on stage?

95
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,953
She's a great singer. Who is she?

96
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,497
It's an incredible story.

97
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,082
She used to be Ms. Yoon's fan.

98
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:16,292
She left for Seoul
in middle school to audition,

99
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,294
and then got stranded
on a deserted island.

100
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:20,963
I was there when she was rescued.

101
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:24,092
I remember watching it on the news.

102
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:25,176
So it's her.

103
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:27,345
What was her name again?

104
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:28,721
Isn't it Seo Mok-ha?

105
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:32,433
Hey, Reporter Kang.

106
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:34,894
Mok-ha's appearing on stage?

107
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:36,729
Yes, if they win.

108
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,533
What's going on?

109
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:51,911
It's President Lee and Producer Kang.

110
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:00,503
We agreed to be on the show
only if she could live lip-sync.

111
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:02,880
We have no choice
but to back out otherwise.

112
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,632
You don't have a substitute anyway.

113
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:06,175
You're right. We don't.

114
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,595
We'll have to explain why the show's off.

115
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:12,807
"Ms. Eun couldn't sing live,

116
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:14,809
so she backed out."

117
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:17,061
The reporters will love that.

118
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:19,939
I heard this was your first show.

119
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:22,525
You have a knack for turning
an opportunity into a risk.

120
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:26,487
You can turn it back into an opportunity.

121
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:31,075
I'd appreciate your help.

122
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:37,957
You'll have a lot
to make right after the show.

123
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,710
I expect a written apology.

124
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:44,505
I'd have to resign if I allowed
lip-syncing over a pre-recorded track.

125
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:48,885
A written apology

126
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,095
is nothing.

127
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:01,022
What about Ms. Yoon's lip-syncing?

128
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,692
She'll personally apologize for it.

129
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,621
What's wrong with Producer Kang?

130
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:19,040
How did he know about the lip-syncing?

131
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:22,210
Why does he want to put you on stage?

132
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:25,755
I don't know either.

133
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:28,549
But Ran-joo.

134
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,593
Well,

135
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:34,430
we can't win anyway
since Mo-rae has so many fans.

136
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:36,224
What if we do?

137
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:40,061
Are you really going to go up there?

138
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:46,567
What do you think we should do?

139
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:51,572
I'll go on stage.

140
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:57,370
It's a live show after all.

141
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:59,121
It's a live show so what can they do?

142
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,752
I went through so much to get back here.

143
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:10,216
You can't take it from me.

144
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:11,300
I won't let you.

145
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:13,844
Ran-joo.

146
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:17,723
I have no intention of taking

147
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:18,975
the stage from you.

148
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,686
But you eventually will.
Just like Mo-rae did.

149
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:25,439
At first, she sweet-talked me
and said she was a fan who adored me.

150
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,733
Then, she betrayed me
when the time was right.

151
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,736
-Do you think you're any different?
-Yes, I am.

152
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,906
Mo-rae and I are absolutely different.

153
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:37,618
Don't be so sure about it.

154
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:39,954
People change.

155
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:51,716
Ran-joo.

156
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:54,218
On the deserted island,

157
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:56,846
I had a friend.

158
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,014
Its name was Gull.

159
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:00,182
No, you didn't. It was a deserted island.

160
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:04,312
I did. It was a seagull.

161
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:06,647
That's why its name was Gull.

162
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:12,987
I befriended it,
because I hated eating alone.

163
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:15,990
Hey.

164
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:18,117
We shared potatoes every day…

165
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,161
-Eat up.
-…and bonded.

166
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:28,794
How have you been?

167
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:30,963
Then, because of a typhoon,

168
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:35,635
I ran out of food.

169
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:38,512
Maybe…

170
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,973
for ten days, I couldn't eat anything.

171
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:44,894
I thought I was going to die.

172
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,146
That's when I saw

173
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:50,650
that Gull was sitting on some eggs.

174
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,569
You ate them.

175
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,156
No.

176
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:58,866
I didn't.

177
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:01,369
I'm telling you

178
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:04,538
I'd never stab you in the back.

179
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,332
I'd rather starve to death.

180
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:07,875
So…

181
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:11,253
I'll never steal your stage.

182
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:26,852
I said I'm leaving!

183
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:32,650
I'm not doing the show.

184
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,903
It'll be a huge mess if you don't.

185
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:38,447
Going on stage
would make an even bigger mess!

186
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:45,329
Lower your voice.
There are people outside.

187
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:49,041
Are you okay?

188
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,501
Yes, sir.

189
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:53,462
Just sing. I'll take care it afterwards.

190
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:54,588
"Take care of it"?

191
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:56,966
Will that even be possible?

192
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,259
Sound issues at the network.

193
00:11:58,342 --> 00:12:00,886
Malfunctioning in-ear monitors.
There's a lot of excuses.

194
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,388
I'll hand out a press release--

195
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:04,473
They'll write something different then!

196
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:07,726
"Eun Mo-rae Proves
She's Seo Mok-ha's Substitute."

197
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,020
"The True Diva From the Deserted Island

198
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:12,148
Beats the Fake Diva, Eun Mo-rae"!

199
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:16,694
I'm pretty much rolling out
the red carpet for Seo Mok-ha's debut.

200
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:24,660
Ms. Seo Mok-ha?

201
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,620
-Yes?
-Producer Kang sent us.

202
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:28,664
He said to help
with your makeup and outfit.

203
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,166
Goodness.

204
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,251
No, I don't need any of that.

205
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:34,670
No, you're right. It's for her.

206
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:36,255
She'll be performing on stage.

207
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:45,139
Today is your stage,

208
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,266
not mine.

209
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:51,770
Please make her look pretty.

210
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:52,855
Okay.

211
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:54,356
Go on.

212
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:55,900
This way, please.

213
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,786
I'm going to read the script for a bit.

214
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:10,122
Please make her look nice.

215
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:11,499
-But Ran-joo.
-Okay.

216
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:14,627
Ran-joo.

217
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,016
"For…

218
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:15,479
this entire time,

219
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:18,524
someone else

220
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,110
has been singing for me…

221
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:25,781
on this show."

222
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:48,989
Ms. Cha, I need some water.

223
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:54,638
SEO MOK-HA VS. EUN MO-RAE

224
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:02,980
We can get our names back.

225
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:05,190
and tell Mok-ha that we found Ki-ho.

226
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:06,275
Why can't we do that?

227
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:07,609
If we do that,

228
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:13,449
our entire family will be destroyed.

229
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:24,501
Mok-ha, where are you?

230
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,547
I heard about everything.

231
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,468
You might end up going on stage today.

232
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:34,762
Excuse me.

233
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:38,682
I need to tell you something.

234
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:40,267
Woo-hak.

235
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:52,613
It's me.

236
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:54,823
Mok-ha.

237
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,033
Yeah.

238
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:58,827
What did you need to tell me?

239
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:03,123
Right, I need to tell you.

240
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:09,546
-You see--
-Ms. Seo!

241
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,507
Have you seen Ms. Seo?

242
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,133
-Ms. Seo!
-What?

243
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:15,677
-Ms. Seo!
-Yes?

244
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,596
-Yes?
-What?

245
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:23,852
Right.

246
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,562
The rehearsal is about to begin.

247
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,564
Okay. I'll be right there.

248
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:30,025
Let's talk later. Okay?

249
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:46,375
We'll first go through movement
on stage before starting rehearsal.

250
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,292
Okay.

251
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,797
You look totally different
from when you were on the island.

252
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,384
That's not true.

253
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,594
I think I look the same.

254
00:18:57,678 --> 00:19:00,264
Come on. You looked terrible back then.

255
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:02,474
You were so filthy. Like a primitive…

256
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:07,354
Like a raw charm.
It was a totally different appeal you had.

257
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,190
Thank you.

258
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:15,028
Do you still volunteer and clean
deserted islands these days?

259
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:16,864
Island Keeper?

260
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:18,115
Of course.

261
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:20,492
Wait.

262
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,163
Actually, no.

263
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,832
What's up with him? He never takes breaks.

264
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,836
"Him"? Who are you talking about?

265
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:32,421
Kang Bo-geol.

266
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,965
He founded that club back in college.

267
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:36,925
That's where I met him too.

268
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:40,846
He never skipped volunteering
except when he was in the military.

269
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:42,389
What's gotten into him?

270
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:45,809
HEYDAY AGAIN

271
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:49,855
Aren't you getting in?

272
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:52,816
Right.

273
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,673
Goodness!

274
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:19,259
Am I dreaming?

275
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:34,775
-Isn't the stage pretty?
-It is.

276
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:38,487
Okay, so you'll be down here,

277
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,239
and Ms. Eun will be down there.

278
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,241
During the interlude,

279
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:44,076
you'll go to the back of the stage.

280
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,744
Once the LED door opens…

281
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:46,912
I told you.

282
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:50,374
I don't want Seo Mok-ha
showing herself to the world.

283
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:52,793
That's why I'm on this stupid show.

284
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:55,045
But now, I'm about to be her sidekick!

285
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:57,547
Why do you keep assuming she'll win?

286
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:00,175
Are you that lacking in confidence?

287
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,426
This contest

288
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:03,971
is an opportunity for you.

289
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:06,932
Don't be ridiculous.

290
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:10,143
When Mok-ha wasn't around,
you always said you felt inferior to her.

291
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:13,063
Now, she's here.

292
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:15,107
So challenge her.

293
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,567
And beat her.

294
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:20,570
I'm not sure.

295
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:23,198
Your throat can be dry,
so drink lots of water.

296
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,366
Use the restroom in advance.

297
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:26,326
Ms. Eun, let's go through
movements on stage.

298
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:29,079
Tell me if you're nervous
and need a medicinal pill.

299
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:30,455
Can you give me one?

300
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,040
-Okay. Hold on.
-All right.

301
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:42,843
Gosh, you look pretty.

302
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:46,054
You seem intent on getting your big break.

303
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:48,015
What?

304
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:49,516
My big break?

305
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:54,604
I mean, if you weren't,
why would you go this far?

306
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:58,066
I should've known
when you buttered up Ran-joo

307
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,526
at the Deodeok Village Festival.

308
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:05,240
If life worked the way I wanted it to,

309
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,159
then I wouldn't have been stranded.

310
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:09,953
And I would've become a singer already.

311
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,748
Judging by your words,

312
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:16,084
it looks like your life
has always worked out

313
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,128
the way you wanted it to.

314
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,926
You're more disrespectful than I thought.

315
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:29,097
Look around. Feel the vibe.

316
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,850
Hello.

317
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:47,115
You're going up on stage with that face?

318
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,158
What?

319
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:51,912
What's wrong with my face?

320
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:54,998
It seems like you have a lot
on your mind. You look very worried.

321
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:56,750
I see.

322
00:22:58,293 --> 00:23:00,420
I hope you don't look like that on stage.

323
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:03,048
Without any worries or concerns,

324
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:06,468
I want you to only focus
on today's performance.

325
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:13,308
You must think I'm going to
go up on stage.

326
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:19,314
Everyone else says
what-ifs are no sure things.

327
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:23,401
Doesn't everything in life
have a fifty-fifty chance?

328
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:26,071
Either it happens or it doesn't.

329
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:36,248
You're right.
Either it happens or it doesn't.

330
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:39,417
Bo-geol.

331
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:41,169
Can you come check the LED screens?

332
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,337
Okay.

333
00:23:57,185 --> 00:23:58,270
Isn't Ms. Seo pretty?

334
00:23:58,353 --> 00:24:01,022
Now that she's all dressed up,
she's totally my type.

335
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,107
Do you want to die?

336
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,483
No. Why?

337
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:06,444
Why?

338
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:07,904
Get off me.

339
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:09,573
Could you please change the screen?

340
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:15,120
The background looks great.

341
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:16,663
Producer Kang picked it.

342
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:18,790
He said it had to look like the ocean.

343
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,125
The ocean?

344
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:21,209
How nice.

345
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:38,560
Looks good, right?

346
00:24:40,478 --> 00:24:43,148
The lights will turn blue later.

347
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:46,943
Hey.

348
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:50,030
How was my singing?

349
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:52,741
Well, it was unexpected.

350
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,203
Is that a compliment or what?

351
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,122
Something like that.
In my eyes, you seemed

352
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:00,332
to lack a lot.

353
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:01,583
"Lack"?

354
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:03,501
What did I lack?

355
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:06,630
You lacked maturity, manners, and thought.

356
00:25:08,506 --> 00:25:09,549
What?

357
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:10,842
You also lacked worries,

358
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:12,761
gloominess,

359
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:17,057
concerns,

360
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:19,726
or reasons to cry.

361
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:24,272
So whenever I looked at you…

362
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:27,859
-Jealous much?
-What?

363
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:32,197
Sure. It's understandable.

364
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:35,200
Even I'm totally jealous of myself.

365
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:37,661
You're jealous of yourself?

366
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:42,999
You see,

367
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:45,585
I saw the future me today.

368
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:52,425
And even I'm jealous of her.

369
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:55,053
She looks absolutely stunning.

370
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:58,890
From this moment on,

371
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:03,061
I'll keep going forward
toward that future.

372
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:23,999
I want people to feel
the ocean right away.

373
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:25,458
Can we make that happen?

374
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:35,176
HEYDAY AGAIN WILL BEGIN SOON

375
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:37,971
Ten seconds left in the commercials.

376
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:39,431
Prepare the jib camera.

377
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:42,225
Five, four,

378
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:45,270
three, two, one.

379
00:26:48,606 --> 00:26:50,108
Host, standby.

380
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:56,823
Hello, I'm Kim Gi-hyeon,
the host of Heyday Again.

381
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:57,907
Nice to see you again.

382
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:06,082
Today, Ms. Yoon Ran-joo will attempt

383
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:09,461
-to bring about her fourth heyday.
-I wonder who will win.

384
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:11,254
I'm 80% sure Eun Mo-rae will win.

385
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:14,174
-She has a huge fandom.
-Please give them a round of applause.

386
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:25,435
First, let me introduce the person
going for her fourth heyday today.

387
00:27:25,518 --> 00:27:27,145
Please welcome Yoon Ran-joo.

388
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:31,733
And this week,
we have a special contender.

389
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:34,110
Back then, she was called
"the next Yoon Ran-joo."

390
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:36,905
And now, she's known as the top diva.

391
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:38,323
Please welcome Eun Mo-rae.

392
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:41,409
Hello, I'm Eun Mo-rae.

393
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:45,622
I can't believe I'll be performing
alongside Ran-joo.

394
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:50,001
You're my mentor and role model.

395
00:27:50,668 --> 00:27:54,214
Really? I had no idea. I'm honored.

396
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:57,884
Right. I'm honored as well.

397
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:03,681
You two have a beautiful friendship,
but there can be only one winner.

398
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:06,476
Now, could you each say
a few words before we begin?

399
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,144
Let's start with Ms. Eun.

400
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:11,815
To be honest, my throat isn't
in the best condition today.

401
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:15,693
But I still came here,
because I wanted to perform with Ran-joo.

402
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:18,071
Even if it's not the best,
I'll try my hardest,

403
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:19,739
so I hope you'll vote for me.

404
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:26,329
All right. And now, it's Ms. Yoon's turn.

405
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:32,961
BEFORE THAT, I HAVE SOMETHING
TO APOLOGIZE TO THE VIEWERS FOR

406
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:44,806
What's wrong with her?

407
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:46,516
Why won't she read the script?

408
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:02,866
I'm telling you

409
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:05,702
I'd never stab you in the back.

410
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:07,662
I'd rather starve to death.

411
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:19,424
Before that,

412
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,218
I have something

413
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:25,305
to apologize to the viewers for.

414
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:30,518
Apologize? For what, may I ask?

415
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,230
She's making me so nervous.

416
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:37,484
Camera three.
Please get a close up of Ms. Yoon.

417
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:40,195
Thank you.

418
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:45,867
For this entire time…

419
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:55,043
someone else has been singing for me

420
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:58,463
on this show.

421
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:05,428
Are you saying you've been lip-syncing?

422
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:08,056
That's correct.

423
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:10,391
I'm sorry.

424
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:13,144
I did something…

425
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:17,065
you should never do as a singer.

426
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,568
I have no excuse.

427
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,613
But there's a voice I've been wanting

428
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:24,948
all of you to hear.

429
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:27,992
And the owner of that voice

430
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:29,953
was accidentally stranded

431
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:32,330
on a deserted island 15 years ago.

432
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:35,208
That sounds very familiar.

433
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:37,710
Didn't you cover that news?

434
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:39,379
I did.

435
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:42,382
It's about Ms. Seo.
She was rescued from that island.

436
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:44,759
Thankfully, she was recently rescued

437
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,970
from that island after 15 years.

438
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:48,888
And her voice has remained the same.

439
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:50,473
However,

440
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:55,103
I couldn't think of a way
for her voice to be heard.

441
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:59,983
Goodness. She's talking about Mok-ha.

442
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:03,361
That's why I decided to join this show.

443
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:05,613
Even if it meant I had to lip-sync,

444
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:08,533
I wanted to share her voice with everyone.

445
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:13,663
I'm truly sorry.

446
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:18,293
In this competition, I believe

447
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:20,044
there's only one winner.

448
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:23,631
And it'll be neither me nor Mo-rae.

449
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:27,051
If you want to meet her,

450
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:29,137
don't vote for the singer.

451
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:31,931
Please vote for the best voice.

452
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,561
All right.

453
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:38,396
What? That wasn't part of the script.

454
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:41,524
She's so sly.

455
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:44,861
She rattled Mo-rae
and encouraged everyone to vote for her.

456
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:47,822
At this rate,
Seo Mok-ha has a shot to win.

457
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:51,367
This week's Heyday Again

458
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:54,162
isn't a match
between Yoon Ran-joo and Eun Mo-rae.

459
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:57,206
It's the mysterious voice
from a deserted island

460
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:00,335
who will go up against Eun Mo-rae.

461
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:01,586
The rules are the same.

462
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:03,880
The voice on the left is number one.

463
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:07,008
The voice on the right is number two.

464
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:08,718
Text #2142

465
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:14,140
and vote for the voice, not the singer.

466
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:17,018
The voice that receives the most votes

467
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:20,104
will appear on stage.

468
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:28,988
All right. Let's listen
to the song they will sing.

469
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:30,990
"Open Your Eyes."

470
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:50,259
Look at the stars

471
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:52,804
They shine brightly

472
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:58,184
And show how I feel

473
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:04,315
Do you feel it?

474
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:07,068
My heart is

475
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:12,991
Always thinking of you

476
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:15,868
I still love you

477
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:19,789
I think I know now

478
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:26,295
The reason why you and I met

479
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:28,214
Things are looking up for Mo-rae.

480
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:30,008
She has half of Mok-ha's total

481
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:31,259
and she hasn't even started.

482
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:33,428
That's not enough.

483
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:35,805
If those votes are from her fans,

484
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:38,474
then she needs to win
the rest with her singing.

485
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:48,109
Here I stand
Open your eyes

486
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:54,115
Here to be with you

487
00:33:55,825 --> 00:34:02,331
Darkness slowly approaches

488
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:09,005
Even if I lose the light

489
00:34:10,673 --> 00:34:12,508
She must be nervous.

490
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:15,094
Singing with style doesn't equal skills.

491
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:21,559
Be my light

492
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:24,270
I still love you

493
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:28,149
I think I know now

494
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:30,318
The reason why…

495
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:32,320
Chorus and orchestra, standby.

496
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:34,906
The voting will end in three seconds.

497
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:37,742
It's okay

498
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:42,580
I will overcome fate

499
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:48,419
And I will run to you

500
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:57,470
All right. The voting has come to an end.

501
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:05,728
This week's episode
has set two new records.

502
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:10,691
First, we received
the most number of votes ever.

503
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:15,154
Second, the winner won
by the narrowest margin ever.

504
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:17,365
Give me Seo Mok-ha's number.

505
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:21,536
Yes, sir.

506
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:26,082
Which voice did you vote for?

507
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:27,166
Lights.

508
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:31,420
Camera two. Full shot of the stage.

509
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:34,090
What were the results?

510
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:55,069
Prepare the LED screens.

511
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:58,072
Now, we will now reveal the results

512
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:01,159
and welcome the winner to the stage!

513
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:04,847
Ki-ho!

514
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:06,390
Has this ever happened to you?

515
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,351
When your heart is about to burst

516
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:10,102
just by thinking about something?

517
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:19,820
No.

518
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:22,406
Not until today.

519
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,954
Okay. I'll begin now.

520
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:30,873
All right.

521
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:32,750
Get ready.

522
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:34,919
Action.

523
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:41,884
Here I stand
Open your eyes

524
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:46,931
Here to be with you

525
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:55,564
We were lost in an endless maze

526
00:37:56,190 --> 00:38:02,863
But now I'll never let you go

527
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:07,702
I

528
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:10,997
I will be your starlight

529
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:18,796
I will be your light forever

530
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:21,340
Look at me

531
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:26,137
I won't let go of your hands

532
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:33,227
Like the starlight
I'll be by your side forever

533
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:40,443
Here I stand
Open your eyes

534
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:45,906
Here to be with you

535
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,968
The diva from the deserted island!

536
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:08,554
Please welcome Seo Mok-ha!

537
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:12,558
-Seo Mok-ha!
-Seo Mok-ha!

538
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:15,811
-Seo Mok-ha!
-Seo Mok-ha!

539
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:19,190
-Seo Mok-ha!
-Seo Mok-ha!

540
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:22,610
-Seo Mok-ha!
-Seo Mok-ha!

541
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:25,988
-Seo Mok-ha!
-Seo Mok-ha!

542
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:27,615
-Seo Mok-ha!
-Seo Mok-ha!

543
00:39:57,436 --> 00:39:58,437
You did great.

544
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:00,439
So great that I wasn't even jealous.

545
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:01,941
Ran-joo.

546
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:03,609
Now,

547
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,404
I can finally die in peace.

548
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:09,532
No, you can't do that.

549
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:12,159
I still have so much to do.

550
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:14,703
I'll prove to the world I was right.

551
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:18,916
This is only the beginning.
Brace yourself.

552
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:20,876
Don't betray me by giving up.

553
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:25,881
I will never betray you, Ran-joo.

554
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:33,889
Goodness.

555
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:37,143
Seo Mok-ha, "The Castaway Diva,"

556
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:39,603
is trending
all over the internet right now.

557
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:41,147
Woo-hak.

558
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:43,941
Looks like you'll have to do a follow-up.

559
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:46,819
Woo-hak!

560
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:51,031
We always bring the best.

561
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:54,452
You want to book Seo Mok-ha for your show?

562
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:56,203
I'm not sure.

563
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:58,414
Try calling RJ Entertainment.

564
00:40:58,497 --> 00:41:00,666
She's working as Yoon Ran-joo's manager.

565
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:02,501
Okay, bye.

566
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:05,254
They're blowing up my phone.

567
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:08,132
Poor Yoon Ran-joo.

568
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:10,759
I thought she'd finally
made a comeback. Right?

569
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:13,846
Hey, I feel worse for Eun Mo-rae.

570
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:16,265
She used to be called
the queen of live performance.

571
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:18,684
She'll be ridiculed so much now.

572
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:19,977
Of course not.

573
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:22,855
Her die-hard servants
will do their best to defend her.

574
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:27,151
Eun Mo-rae isn't a queen.

575
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:28,736
Right.

576
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:31,030
A queen is a bit too much.

577
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:32,531
A princess maybe?

578
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:35,326
She's Eun Mo-rae, not a princess.

579
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:37,495
And they're her fans, not servants.

580
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:41,040
They're not die-hards.
They're just rooting for who they like.

581
00:41:42,124 --> 00:41:43,125
Right.

582
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:45,669
Watch what you say, will you?

583
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:46,921
Go.

584
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:48,797
We'll call you next time.

585
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:50,424
Hey, you. Gosh.

586
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:52,301
Jeez. You…

587
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:03,812
You must've scrambled over here
to hear what they'd say.

588
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:06,524
I only learned it from the best.

589
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:16,158
You knew I was here
and said those things, right?

590
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:18,202
No, I didn't.

591
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:20,412
Had I known,
I would've said something else.

592
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:22,706
Like what?

593
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:26,168
"I knew it. She's a fake
and a substitute for Mok-ha."

594
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:28,087
Something like that?

595
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:30,297
Do better, will you?

596
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:32,841
It's your fans who suffer
if you don't do well.

597
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:34,843
You heard them, right?

598
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:36,804
They called your fans die-hard servants.

599
00:42:37,596 --> 00:42:40,015
Your fans were often called that too.

600
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:43,352
As if you were any better.

601
00:42:50,025 --> 00:42:51,235
I wasn't.

602
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:54,572
That's why I'm speaking from experience.

603
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:00,953
Be careful, or you'll end up like me.

604
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:04,915
That was harsh.

605
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:07,751
It was a piece of advice.

606
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:09,920
Didn't you say I was your role model?

607
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:17,761
You better try harder
unless you want to end up like me.

608
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:32,151
Thank you.

609
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:34,653
Excuse us.

610
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:36,447
Can you open the door, please?

611
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:49,251
They'll edit the video
of today's episode before uploading it.

612
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:52,212
We sent out a press release

613
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:54,048
that said you had a sore throat.

614
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:56,842
-Eun Mo-rae!
-Eun Mo-rae!

615
00:43:56,925 --> 00:43:59,470
-Eun Mo-rae!
-Eun Mo-rae!

616
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:00,679
Hold on a minute.

617
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:01,764
Sure.

618
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:14,234
Hang in there, Mo-rae!

619
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:17,988
-Eun Mo-rae!
-Eun Mo-rae!

620
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:19,406
-Eun Mo-rae!
-Eun Mo-rae!

621
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:23,952
-Eun Mo-rae!
-Eun Mo-rae!

622
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:25,913
I'm sorry for disappointing you.

623
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:29,249
-Eun Mo-rae!
-Eun Mo-rae!

624
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:30,542
-Eun Mo-rae!
-Eun Mo-rae!

625
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:32,586
I'll do better next time.

626
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:34,505
I'm not disappointed.

627
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:37,383
Mo-rae, please stay healthy.

628
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:40,135
-Eun Mo-rae!
-Eun Mo-rae!

629
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:42,680
-Eun Mo-rae!
-Eun Mo-rae!

630
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:45,307
-Eun Mo-rae!
-Eun Mo-rae!

631
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:48,060
-Eun Mo-rae!
-Eun Mo-rae!

632
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,187
Great job today!

633
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:52,481
You looked gorgeous.

634
00:44:52,564 --> 00:44:53,565
Well done.

635
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:55,984
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

636
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:57,069
You were great today.

637
00:44:57,152 --> 00:44:58,904
-You were the best.
-You truly were.

638
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:11,291
Ma'am.

639
00:45:12,584 --> 00:45:13,585
By any chance,

640
00:45:14,086 --> 00:45:15,629
do you know where Producer Kang is?

641
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:17,881
He's probably in the control room.

642
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:19,591
I see.

643
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:27,516
Great job.

644
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:30,102
I'll book a restaurant sometime next week.

645
00:45:33,313 --> 00:45:34,314
You're the best.

646
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:37,734
-Good job, everyone.
-Good work.

647
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:42,072
-Are there any leftover cue cards?
-Cue cards?

648
00:45:43,365 --> 00:45:44,366
What for?

649
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:46,410
I want to ask Ms. Seo for an autograph.

650
00:45:46,493 --> 00:45:48,454
People are loving her right now.

651
00:45:48,537 --> 00:45:50,873
An autographed cue card
from her very first show?

652
00:45:50,956 --> 00:45:53,333
I might be able to purchase
a house with this.

653
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:55,043
That's going to be worth money?

654
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:56,712
You know Michael Jordan, right?

655
00:45:56,795 --> 00:45:59,965
His first autographed card
was auctioned for 3.2 billion won.

656
00:46:00,048 --> 00:46:01,049
Instead, why don't you

657
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:02,843
open a savings account for a house?

658
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:05,137
Mok-ha can't hold a candle
to Michael Jordan.

659
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:08,348
Can I get a card too?

660
00:46:15,647 --> 00:46:16,815
Here.

661
00:46:36,376 --> 00:46:38,128
HEYDAY AGAIN

662
00:46:57,314 --> 00:46:59,233
Why did you put Mok-ha on stage?

663
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:01,235
The reason was simple.

664
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:03,946
It's a live show,
so we put on a live show.

665
00:47:04,029 --> 00:47:05,656
And the winner was brought on stage.

666
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:07,950
So you have no plan.

667
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:10,911
I did what had to be done.

668
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:12,663
-I'm not joking right now.
-Woo-hak.

669
00:47:14,414 --> 00:47:16,166
I've never been more serious.

670
00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:19,336
Just as you said, our family

671
00:47:19,419 --> 00:47:20,796
will be destroyed at this rate.

672
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:22,756
What?

673
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:25,634
It'll only be a matter of time
until he finds Mok-ha and us.

674
00:47:25,717 --> 00:47:28,804
-We must come up with a plan--
-And what exactly is your plan?

675
00:47:28,887 --> 00:47:31,181
Lying, stopping her
from becoming a singer,

676
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:32,849
and living with fake names forever?

677
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:33,934
Is that your plan?

678
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:35,352
Yes, we can do that.

679
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:39,982
I'll do what you've been doing.

680
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:41,400
I can sweep the past

681
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:43,360
under the rug.

682
00:47:43,443 --> 00:47:45,153
That's because you just found out.

683
00:47:45,237 --> 00:47:46,238
But for me…

684
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:52,452
I've been living like this for 15 years.

685
00:48:03,171 --> 00:48:04,840
And you've been doing well.

686
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:08,468
You said you could forget
the past while lying to me.

687
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:09,720
It was hard on us.

688
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:13,640
As we shared the same room,
you kept asking and I kept lying to you.

689
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,518
Deceiving people…

690
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:19,980
I can't do it anymore.

691
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:23,400
I'm sick and tired of it.

692
00:48:39,958 --> 00:48:42,169
This is why I said
not to share personal matters.

693
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:44,755
It would only attract
all kinds of lunatics.

694
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:13,075
MENTOR

695
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:15,619
Hi, Ran-joo.

696
00:49:16,161 --> 00:49:17,829
I'm in the parking lot. Where are you?

697
00:49:17,913 --> 00:49:18,914
I…

698
00:49:18,997 --> 00:49:20,540
Ran-joo.

699
00:49:22,542 --> 00:49:24,878
I'm really sorry,

700
00:49:25,962 --> 00:49:27,964
but can you go home first?

701
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:29,758
I'm…

702
00:49:31,259 --> 00:49:32,260
Mok-ha.

703
00:49:36,598 --> 00:49:38,100
I should've charged my phone.

704
00:49:38,183 --> 00:49:39,351
What's going on?

705
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:42,938
My phone…

706
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:44,022
What do I do?

707
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:45,440
Do you need a phone?

708
00:49:47,734 --> 00:49:49,319
Do you need to call Ms. Seo?

709
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:50,570
Forget it.

710
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:52,823
I'm not comfortable
receiving help from you.

711
00:49:56,034 --> 00:49:57,744
When did you get her number?

712
00:49:58,453 --> 00:49:59,454
Today.

713
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:02,791
What? Is she your next target?

714
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:05,585
Not necessarily a target.

715
00:50:06,628 --> 00:50:09,256
I'm thinking about asking her.

716
00:50:09,756 --> 00:50:11,299
Asking her? About what?

717
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:15,846
To join your agency?

718
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:18,515
I'm considering it.

719
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:25,897
Didn't Mok-ha look so beautiful?

720
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:27,482
She was dazzling.

721
00:50:28,775 --> 00:50:29,860
She was.

722
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:32,362
She looked like a different person.

723
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:35,198
Maybe

724
00:50:36,074 --> 00:50:37,200
we shouldn't have listened

725
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:39,911
to Bo-geol back then.

726
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:42,205
"Back then"?

727
00:50:43,957 --> 00:50:44,958
Right.

728
00:50:45,792 --> 00:50:46,877
Back then.

729
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:55,510
Who's in the rooftop room right now?

730
00:50:56,052 --> 00:50:58,346
Yoon Ran-joo and Mok-ha.
Woo-hak brought them.

731
00:50:58,430 --> 00:50:59,431
What?

732
00:50:59,514 --> 00:51:01,391
Mok-ha? As in, that Mok-ha?

733
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:04,060
The girl you've been looking for?

734
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:06,688
Lower your voice. Woo-hak might wake up.

735
00:51:09,691 --> 00:51:10,692
Look.

736
00:51:11,193 --> 00:51:12,944
We can take her in if you want,

737
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:14,613
but what if she recognizes you?

738
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:16,990
She couldn't recognize me at all.

739
00:51:17,073 --> 00:51:18,325
I must've changed a lot.

740
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:20,452
That's a relief.

741
00:51:20,535 --> 00:51:21,661
Don't worry.

742
00:51:22,162 --> 00:51:24,164
I'll make sure she never recognizes me.

743
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:27,501
What should we do?

744
00:51:30,545 --> 00:51:33,507
Let's take her in
just until she can get back on her feet.

745
00:51:34,716 --> 00:51:35,717
Please?

746
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:37,594
What's going on?

747
00:51:38,303 --> 00:51:40,889
You didn't budge
when Woo-hak wanted to take her in.

748
00:51:43,975 --> 00:51:45,393
Is that a yes then?

749
00:51:49,856 --> 00:51:52,192
I was able to see
your precious smile thanks to her.

750
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:54,736
So I have no choice but to say yes.

751
00:51:57,239 --> 00:51:58,240
Don't worry.

752
00:51:58,824 --> 00:52:01,201
We'll treat her like family.

753
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:02,327
Thank you.

754
00:52:04,037 --> 00:52:05,038
Thank you, Mom.

755
00:52:09,501 --> 00:52:10,585
Bo-geol

756
00:52:11,586 --> 00:52:13,255
smiled so beautifully back then.

757
00:52:15,131 --> 00:52:17,300
This must be our punishment for lying.

758
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:21,680
The happier the kids are,
the more worried we become.

759
00:52:30,021 --> 00:52:31,106
It's okay.

760
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:32,941
It's all right.

761
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:36,361
We're okay.

762
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:45,871
HEYDAY AGAIN
YOON RAN-JOO'S GREEN ROOM

763
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:09,561
DRONE'S BROTHER

764
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:40,592
Mr. Jung.

765
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:54,230
How have you been?

766
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,822
What brings you all the way here?

767
00:54:05,033 --> 00:54:06,618
I had something to ask you.

768
00:54:08,703 --> 00:54:09,955
You know

769
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:12,290
where Ki-ho is, right?

770
00:54:15,251 --> 00:54:16,252
Mr. Jung.

771
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:18,463
If I knew,

772
00:54:18,546 --> 00:54:21,216
would I have shown up
when you posed as him

773
00:54:21,299 --> 00:54:23,218
and reached out to me?

774
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:24,761
That's a good point.

775
00:54:27,055 --> 00:54:29,140
I was really hurt that day.

776
00:54:29,224 --> 00:54:30,934
I was happy to see you,

777
00:54:31,017 --> 00:54:32,602
but you ran away.

778
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:34,437
I'm sorry.

779
00:54:35,146 --> 00:54:37,816
You were chasing me so furiously,

780
00:54:38,149 --> 00:54:39,359
so I got the wrong idea.

781
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:40,944
I guess I'm just destined

782
00:54:41,027 --> 00:54:43,363
to have people always misunderstand me.

783
00:54:44,781 --> 00:54:48,410
Including my sons, my wife,

784
00:54:49,995 --> 00:54:51,037
and you.

785
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:54,082
Then, maybe there's a reason
why that's the case.

786
00:55:01,673 --> 00:55:03,258
The villagers on Chunsam Island

787
00:55:03,758 --> 00:55:05,593
think Ki-ho is my only son.

788
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,513
But when I said "sons,"

789
00:55:09,848 --> 00:55:11,349
you weren't surprised.

790
00:55:13,893 --> 00:55:15,603
Did you meet Chae-ho as well?

791
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:20,316
What are you talking about?

792
00:55:21,067 --> 00:55:24,404
I didn't even know you said "sons."

793
00:55:25,613 --> 00:55:26,656
Thanks.

794
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:28,658
I know Ki-ho is alive thanks to you.

795
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:30,702
Now, I just need to find him.

796
00:55:30,785 --> 00:55:31,786
What…

797
00:55:32,787 --> 00:55:33,872
Mr. Jung.

798
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:36,458
You know I was a police officer, right?

799
00:55:39,252 --> 00:55:40,378
I can see through you.

800
00:55:41,212 --> 00:55:42,797
You're lying right now.

801
00:55:42,881 --> 00:55:44,674
Ki-ho is hiding nearby.

802
00:55:47,385 --> 00:55:49,596
Everything you just said was wrong.

803
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:52,223
Goodness.

804
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:54,059
Jeez, I'm running late.

805
00:55:54,851 --> 00:55:56,311
I'll get going first.

806
00:56:28,593 --> 00:56:29,594
Hello.

807
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:40,730
Where are you headed?

808
00:56:46,611 --> 00:56:47,612
What do I do?

809
00:56:51,449 --> 00:56:52,826
What should I do?

810
00:56:58,498 --> 00:57:00,750
Where should I go?

811
00:57:08,049 --> 00:57:09,592
This is so gorgeous.

812
00:57:16,891 --> 00:57:19,185
ON YOUR BEGINNING…

813
00:57:39,706 --> 00:57:40,623
Come in.

814
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:49,007
What is it?

815
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:50,341
Is Mok-ha home?

816
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:51,926
No, not yet. Why?

817
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:53,636
We can't reach her.

818
00:57:54,512 --> 00:57:55,680
Hold on.

819
00:58:03,021 --> 00:58:04,814
MENTEE
MISSED CALLS FROM MENTEE

820
00:58:12,697 --> 00:58:13,865
What is this?

821
00:58:22,248 --> 00:58:25,043
I'm sorry, Ran-joo.

822
00:58:28,463 --> 00:58:30,965
I should be telling you this face-to-face.

823
00:58:32,425 --> 00:58:36,054
Please forgive me for texting.

824
00:58:39,224 --> 00:58:40,517
Please say your destination.

825
00:58:42,644 --> 00:58:43,645
Well…

826
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:47,148
Which train has the fewest passengers

827
00:58:48,399 --> 00:58:50,777
and is traveling the farthest?

828
00:58:52,612 --> 00:58:55,240
I finally realized
after performing on stage today.

829
00:58:57,242 --> 00:59:00,662
Performing on stage
wasn't a dream of mine.

830
00:59:01,829 --> 00:59:03,498
It was just a horse chestnut.

831
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:17,262
I took a bite because it looked
as pretty as a regular chestnut.

832
00:59:18,763 --> 00:59:22,225
But I finally realized
after taking a bite.

833
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:24,936
What is she saying?

834
00:59:25,019 --> 00:59:26,938
Is she giving up on her dream?

835
00:59:29,148 --> 00:59:31,192
It was so bitter.

836
00:59:31,693 --> 00:59:34,904
I thought I might die if I swallowed it.

837
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:36,573
Wait up.

838
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:44,914
What's gotten into her?

839
00:59:46,332 --> 00:59:49,335
I'm going to dig up potatoes again now

840
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:52,422
and live a life that befits me.

841
01:00:10,189 --> 01:00:11,065
I was truly happy

842
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:15,111
that I could have
such a far-fetched dream for a moment

843
01:00:15,945 --> 01:00:17,196
thanks to you.

844
01:00:20,992 --> 01:00:24,996
I will forever cherish
these memories and root for you.

845
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:39,969
This place is similar
to the deserted island.

846
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:46,225
He won't find me here, right?

847
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:33,606
Compared to the deserted island,

848
01:01:34,148 --> 01:01:38,361
this is good enough
to be considered paradise.

849
01:01:41,864 --> 01:01:43,116
That's right.

850
01:01:43,825 --> 01:01:47,704
The city life wasn't for me.

851
01:02:14,063 --> 01:02:15,064
Mok-ha!

852
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:18,776
Seo Mok-ha!

853
01:02:38,504 --> 01:02:39,505
Hey.

854
01:02:41,549 --> 01:02:42,675
How long will it take?

855
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:44,594
Mok-ha.

856
01:02:46,679 --> 01:02:47,555
I'm sorry.

857
01:02:47,638 --> 01:02:48,639
What are you doing?

858
01:02:52,894 --> 01:02:58,524
DAMCHEON RESTAURANT

859
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:03,988
Hello.

860
01:03:11,454 --> 01:03:12,413
No need to browse.

861
01:03:12,497 --> 01:03:13,539
We only serve one dish.

862
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:15,041
Dried radish green gukbap.

863
01:03:15,583 --> 01:03:16,584
It's 3,000 won.

864
01:03:16,667 --> 01:03:17,668
I see.

865
01:03:19,045 --> 01:03:20,630
Gosh, this looks delicious.

866
01:03:22,507 --> 01:03:25,301
Goodness, it's nice and spicy.

867
01:03:26,344 --> 01:03:28,012
Have we met before?

868
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:31,098
You look familiar.

869
01:03:31,182 --> 01:03:32,683
That can't be.

870
01:03:32,767 --> 01:03:34,393
This is my first time here.

871
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:36,729
Right. You're speaking
a different dialect.

872
01:03:37,855 --> 01:03:39,232
Hold on.

873
01:03:40,149 --> 01:03:41,734
Are you a singer by any chance?

874
01:03:44,111 --> 01:03:45,112
You are.

875
01:03:45,613 --> 01:03:49,158
I saw you on TV yesterday.
You were stranded on an island.

876
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:50,701
That's you, right?

877
01:03:51,911 --> 01:03:52,912
Yes.

878
01:03:53,412 --> 01:03:55,748
But it's too soon

879
01:03:56,499 --> 01:03:58,376
to call myself a singer.

880
01:03:58,459 --> 01:04:00,670
Goodness.

881
01:04:00,753 --> 01:04:02,380
What do I do?

882
01:04:02,463 --> 01:04:04,006
Goodness.

883
01:04:05,341 --> 01:04:06,175
Here.

884
01:04:06,259 --> 01:04:08,010
Here. Give me your autograph.

885
01:04:10,429 --> 01:04:11,973
Ma'am.

886
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:15,476
I can't become a singer.

887
01:04:16,102 --> 01:04:17,728
I can't give autographs either.

888
01:04:17,812 --> 01:04:19,230
Don't be ridiculous.

889
01:04:20,231 --> 01:04:22,942
Nothing is impossible.

890
01:04:23,025 --> 01:04:24,902
You can do it. Okay?

891
01:04:24,986 --> 01:04:25,820
Here.

892
01:04:26,571 --> 01:04:27,446
Go on.

893
01:04:28,489 --> 01:04:29,740
There were things

894
01:04:30,783 --> 01:04:35,037
that I wasn't supposed do in life.

895
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:37,623
Apparently, there were.

896
01:04:41,836 --> 01:04:42,962
Goodness, look at you.

897
01:04:44,255 --> 01:04:46,007
Why are you crying?

898
01:04:48,551 --> 01:04:49,552
Because…

899
01:04:51,012 --> 01:04:52,930
I lied.

900
01:04:57,935 --> 01:05:01,939
I did eat the seagull's eggs.

901
01:05:02,857 --> 01:05:06,986
But I lied and said I didn't.

902
01:06:18,849 --> 01:06:21,727
I shouldn't have done it to a friend.

903
01:06:23,938 --> 01:06:25,648
I knew I was betraying it.

904
01:06:26,232 --> 01:06:27,900
But I still ate them.

905
01:06:28,943 --> 01:06:31,237
I was starving to death.

906
01:06:33,906 --> 01:06:36,158
But the seagull can't understand.

907
01:06:37,326 --> 01:06:39,495
Giving an excuse wouldn't work.

908
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:55,803
It was my one and only friend.

909
01:06:56,971 --> 01:06:59,682
But we became enemies.

910
01:07:00,474 --> 01:07:02,643
I feel so terrible.

911
01:07:03,644 --> 01:07:06,397
That's why I'm crying.

912
01:07:09,608 --> 01:07:10,609
Here.

913
01:07:12,987 --> 01:07:14,113
What is she talking about?

914
01:07:15,698 --> 01:07:18,826
I'm sorry.

915
01:07:22,955 --> 01:07:24,081
Don't cry.

916
01:07:24,165 --> 01:07:25,958
I don't need your autograph.

917
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:28,127
I'm truly sorry.

918
01:07:29,003 --> 01:07:30,629
Don't be.

919
01:07:35,801 --> 01:07:36,969
One gukbap, please.

920
01:07:42,099 --> 01:07:45,186
Come to think of it, we haven't eaten
since yesterday evening.

921
01:07:45,269 --> 01:07:47,313
Why haven't you eaten anything?

922
01:07:50,149 --> 01:07:53,527
How did you know I'd be here?

923
01:07:53,611 --> 01:07:55,029
I searched you online.

924
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:57,073
Searched?

925
01:08:00,659 --> 01:08:03,621
Bo-geol, they spotted Mok-ha
at a cafe an hour ago.

926
01:08:03,746 --> 01:08:06,582
THE CELEBRITY WHO DEBUTED TODAY

927
01:08:10,878 --> 01:08:13,422
Then, maybe there's a reason
why that's the case.

928
01:08:14,465 --> 01:08:15,925
You're right. It's that girl.

929
01:08:16,008 --> 01:08:17,009
-Right?
-Yes.

930
01:08:29,230 --> 01:08:31,774
HAMCHANG STATION

931
01:08:41,909 --> 01:08:45,371
I could track you in real time
since you're kind of a public figure now.

932
01:08:48,916 --> 01:08:49,917
Are you her boyfriend?

933
01:08:50,459 --> 01:08:52,211
Goodness! What are you saying?

934
01:08:52,294 --> 01:08:54,380
Not at all!

935
01:08:54,463 --> 01:08:55,464
We're former classmates.

936
01:08:56,757 --> 01:08:57,842
Middle school classmates.

937
01:09:31,417 --> 01:09:33,627
Why are you doing this, Producer Kang?

938
01:09:33,711 --> 01:09:34,753
Let's go home.

939
01:09:34,837 --> 01:09:35,838
What home?

940
01:09:36,881 --> 01:09:40,676
I never considered your house my home.

941
01:09:40,759 --> 01:09:42,720
Are you really giving up on your dream?

942
01:09:43,929 --> 01:09:46,056
Performing once on stage
is good enough for me.

943
01:09:46,140 --> 01:09:47,933
I have nothing more to ask for.

944
01:09:53,522 --> 01:09:54,523
It's me. Ki-ho.

945
01:09:59,987 --> 01:10:00,988
No.

946
01:10:02,364 --> 01:10:04,366
You're Producer Kang Bo-geol.

947
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:06,744
I'm Jung Ki-ho from Chunsam Middle School.

948
01:10:06,827 --> 01:10:08,787
How could you do this to me?

949
01:10:09,747 --> 01:10:12,124
You didn't show yourself
when I was looking for you.

950
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:15,377
Why are you showing up now
and upsetting me?

951
01:10:15,461 --> 01:10:16,295
Mok-ha.

952
01:10:16,378 --> 01:10:19,048
To me, you're Kang Bo-geol.

953
01:10:19,131 --> 01:10:21,884
And you have to remain that way forever!

954
01:10:22,718 --> 01:10:25,262
Being Kang Bo-geol is better for you too!

955
01:10:26,013 --> 01:10:27,097
It was.

956
01:10:27,181 --> 01:10:28,557
But there was one day…

957
01:10:31,101 --> 01:10:32,311
when I regretted it.

958
01:10:35,606 --> 01:10:38,317
The day I found you on the island…

959
01:10:42,696 --> 01:10:44,573
I wished I was Jung Ki-ho again.

960
01:10:46,825 --> 01:10:49,328
I wanted to find you
before anyone else could.

961
01:10:51,288 --> 01:10:52,331
You're alive.

962
01:10:53,499 --> 01:10:54,875
I knew you'd be alive.

963
01:11:01,382 --> 01:11:02,883
I wanted to thank you.

964
01:11:13,519 --> 01:11:14,895
I wanted to thank you…

965
01:11:19,316 --> 01:11:20,317
for being alive.

966
01:12:19,501 --> 01:12:22,421
CASTAWAY DIVA

967
01:12:57,539 --> 01:12:58,749
Rock, paper, scissors!

968
01:12:59,166 --> 01:13:00,918
The past series of events have told me

969
01:13:01,001 --> 01:13:02,628
you two used to be fond of each other.

970
01:13:03,253 --> 01:13:05,339
Do you still have those feelings?

971
01:13:06,924 --> 01:13:07,925
I'm sorry.

972
01:13:08,008 --> 01:13:11,303
I'm sick and tired
of looking after a talentless girl.

973
01:13:11,387 --> 01:13:13,764
President Lee wanted to see me.

974
01:13:13,847 --> 01:13:15,474
As an artist, not a manager.

975
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:18,685
If you want to help us, become famous.

976
01:13:18,769 --> 01:13:20,854
I'm Yoon Ran-joo.

977
01:13:21,522 --> 01:13:25,317
For the first time in a while,
I'm finally going to see my family again.

978
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:26,402
Father.

979
01:13:30,531 --> 01:13:32,533
