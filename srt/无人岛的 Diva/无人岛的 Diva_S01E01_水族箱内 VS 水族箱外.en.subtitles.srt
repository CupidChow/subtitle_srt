1
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,971
CASTAWAY DIVA

2
00:00:55,054 --> 00:00:56,139
Run!

3
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:58,475
That's it!

4
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:00,727
EPISODE 1

5
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,020
More!

6
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:05,106
What kind of kick was that?

7
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:09,319
Hey, what cell phone do you use?

8
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:11,112
-I don't have one.
-You don't have one?

9
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:12,739
Unbelievable!

10
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:15,575
Hey! What's your phone?
Anyone have the Go A-ra phone?

11
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:19,037
No, not that one.
The phone advertised by Go A-ra!

12
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,538
Hey, don't get mad now.

13
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:21,706
Sorry about that.

14
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:24,584
Hey, the Go A-ra phone!

15
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:30,131
-Hello, sir.
-Hey, Seo-jun. Where are you?

16
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:32,258
We're on our way to do a radio show.

17
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:37,472
Make sure Ran-joo promotes
the fan video contest when she gets there.

18
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:39,599
She'll forget if you don't remind her.

19
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:40,683
WHO WILL SIGN YOON?

20
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,560
Yes, sir. But you see--

21
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:45,021
Also, when she seems to be in a good mood,

22
00:01:45,104 --> 00:01:48,358
ask her when she's going
to renew her contract.

23
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:50,401
Yes. I understand, sir.

24
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:56,116
Do you have the Go A-ra phone?

25
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:57,200
No?

26
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:59,452
-Come on!
-Do you have the Go A-ra phone?

27
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:00,620
What?

28
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:02,038
No.

29
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,790
It turned off, Young-ju.

30
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:05,333
What do I do?

31
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:07,001
It's okay.

32
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:09,337
We still have three minutes left.

33
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:12,882
Does anyone use the Go A-ra phone?

34
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,885
We only have three minutes left.
Where's Yoon Ran-joo?

35
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,554
Okay.

36
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,472
She just got off the elevator.

37
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:21,933
I'm taking blood pressure medication
because of her--

38
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:23,351
Goodness, hello.

39
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:24,644
Hello.

40
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:34,863
Hey, new kid. You have the Go A-ra phone.

41
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:37,615
Let me borrow your battery.
I'll give it right back.

42
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:41,494
-For 1,000 won.
-Come on.

43
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:44,372
We just need it for a minute.

44
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:46,249
I'm expecting a call,

45
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:47,792
but my battery ran out.

46
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:51,880
Can I borrow it for a minute? Please?

47
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:53,006
That'll be 2,000 won.

48
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:55,925
Jeez.

49
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,969
I told you it was an emergency.

50
00:02:58,052 --> 00:02:59,929
My life is at stake here!

51
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:02,724
-Now, it's 3,000 won.
-You're so annoying.

52
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:05,852
Even if you're blinded by money,
don't you care about your classmate?

53
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:07,103
No, I don't.

54
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:10,732
I don't care, and you don't have manners.

55
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:15,445
-Happy?
-What a jerk.

56
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,408
Goodness. Hey.

57
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:21,743
Are you crying?

58
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:24,787
It's because I'm so pathetic.

59
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,873
I'm such a loser.

60
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:28,917
Of all days,

61
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,878
I can't believe I forgot
to charge my phone today!

62
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,881
This is horrible!

63
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:36,716
I'm the worst.

64
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,970
You're not the worst.
You're the best, okay?

65
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:50,980
Thank you. Thank you so much.

66
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:54,317
What kind of call is it?

67
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,860
Make sure to use the Seoul accent.

68
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:57,862
From this moment on, you're a Seoulite!

69
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:59,614
Right, I am.

70
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:13,294
Hello?

71
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:14,504
Did she call you?

72
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:17,674
No way.

73
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:19,384
Ran-joo?

74
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,807
Is it really you?

75
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,725
NOON MUSIC CHALLENGE

76
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:30,144
Yes, it's me. Yoon Ran-joo.

77
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:31,396
It's me, Ran-joo.

78
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:38,987
Ran-joo!

79
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,948
Ran-joo, it's really you!

80
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:46,160
Ran-joo, I love you so much!

81
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:48,121
I truly love you!

82
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:51,207
-Goodness.
-Oh, my. Ms. Seo Mok-ha.

83
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,584
You shouldn't cry already. Just a moment.

84
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:55,128
This is Karaoke with the Stars.

85
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:58,548
Today's guest has been topping
all music charts.

86
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:02,593
She's Korea's number one diva.
The queen of K-pop.

87
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:06,180
No, she's the goddess.

88
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:08,099
I'm here with Yoon Ran-joo.

89
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:11,894
And we're on the phone with the listener
who'll sing along with her.

90
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,021
Ms. Seo Mok-ha?

91
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,274
Yes. Hello…

92
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:18,192
How are you?

93
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:19,736
How are…

94
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,487
Ran-joo!

95
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:25,116
Ran-joo, on the phone,

96
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,785
your voice sounds so beautiful.

97
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:30,705
She's adorable.

98
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:34,917
I just love your accent, Ms. Seo Mok-ha.

99
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,377
Ran-joo.

100
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:37,879
Can you…

101
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:39,714
Can you say my name once more?

102
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:41,466
Ms. Seo Mok-ha.

103
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:46,596
You know what?

104
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:49,599
I could die in peace right now.

105
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:52,351
Ran-joo…

106
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:58,191
You…

107
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,235
What have you done?

108
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,282
What are you doing?

109
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:10,369
You said you could die in peace.

110
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,167
Thanks.

111
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:20,797
Mok-ha, are you okay?

112
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:26,094
Hey, Jung Ki-ho!

113
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:34,560
She was nothing more
than a brainless fangirl.

114
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:37,772
He was a money-grubbing lunatic.

115
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:42,151
Back then, we thought we'd have
absolutely nothing in common.

116
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:43,945
But little did we know,

117
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:46,114
in that hot summer of 2007,

118
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:48,616
that we were

119
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:50,785
in our own different season.

120
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:58,292
INSIDE THE FISH TANK
VS. OUTSIDE THE FISH TANK

121
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,005
That jerk deserves to die.

122
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:06,342
He just had to take the phone away
right at that moment!

123
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:07,677
Tell me about it.

124
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:10,805
Ki-ho's always acted like a runaway.

125
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:14,183
But now, he's changed into a loan shark.

126
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:20,857
If only that scumbag
hadn't ruined my call,

127
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,985
Ran-joo would've heard me sing.

128
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,613
-And as soon as she heard me…
-She's really good.

129
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:32,910
Let's go. I'll turn you
into a star just like me.

130
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:41,043
On course to become a diva,

131
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:44,088
I had just weighed anchor.

132
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:47,508
And right when I was about to set sail…

133
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:51,679
That good-for-nothing lunatic.

134
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:54,724
He capsized your ship.

135
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:59,729
Still, if I give up now…

136
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:02,356
-That'd be unlike you!
-Exactly!

137
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,401
So you're going to shoot
your own music video

138
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,320
and enter the fan video contest?

139
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:08,779
Correct.

140
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:11,199
But the prizes are a bit weak.

141
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:13,242
Cyber acorns? Seriously?

142
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,411
Girl, come on.

143
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:18,498
Who cares about the prizes?

144
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:21,292
Ran-joo will be evaluating
the videos herself.

145
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:24,212
That's the important thing.

146
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:25,546
That's right.

147
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:29,800
Leaving a strong impression on Ran-joo
is what's most important.

148
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,177
That's right.

149
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,596
Do you have a digital camera though?

150
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,265
You'll need one
if you want to shoot a video.

151
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:40,478
Do you have one?

152
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:42,939
I don't even have a cell phone,
so what do you think?

153
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:46,150
Dae-woong, do you have a digital camera?

154
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:47,276
No.

155
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:51,197
But I do know someone who does.

156
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,491
Who?

157
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:57,954
Come on, Ki-ho.

158
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:00,289
Jung Ki-ho.

159
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:03,459
Please take it easy, will you?
Why are you working so hard?

160
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:06,087
Men need to protect their lower backs.

161
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,964
Jeez.

162
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:12,176
You're making a boy do the shoveling?
You call yourself an adult?

163
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,220
I did it, too. Look at all this sweat.

164
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:16,973
Ki-ho.

165
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:19,225
Go and hold the sack instead.

166
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:20,351
No, I'll do this.

167
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:23,563
But in return,
please keep letting me work here.

168
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:27,275
Goodness. Why would a kid like you
want to make money so bad?

169
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,193
By the way,

170
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:32,446
does your father know
that you're working here?

171
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:37,868
No.

172
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:41,038
Sir, please keep this

173
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:42,915
a secret from him.

174
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,584
A secret?

175
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:45,876
Why?

176
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,297
Well…

177
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,509
I'm planning to buy him a gift.

178
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,095
It'll be his birthday soon.

179
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:57,888
Goodness.

180
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:00,099
Lucky him.

181
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:02,518
My goodness.

182
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,812
-Gosh.
-You know what?

183
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:07,857
I wish your dad and I could swap sons.

184
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,069
Sir.

185
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,905
Please don't tell my father about this.

186
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,158
-Please.
-All right.

187
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:18,826
Don't you worry.

188
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:20,453
I'm going to

189
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:22,121
zip my mouth.

190
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,206
Goodness.

191
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,919
-Ki-ho said that?
-I'm telling you.

192
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,922
He's so eager to make money these days.

193
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:35,134
He wants to surprise you
for your birthday.

194
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,595
Right, my birthday.

195
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:39,680
Ki-ho is one unbelievable kid.

196
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,641
He used to always run away from home,

197
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,851
and now he's suddenly matured.

198
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,645
You're right.

199
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,774
Play dumb when he gives you the gift.

200
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:51,192
Don't be lame and show you knew.

201
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:53,778
All right.

202
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:55,029
Okay. Eat up.

203
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:59,992
Dad, your zipper's broken.

204
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:01,911
What? My zipper?

205
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,037
Where?

206
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:06,165
No, not your pants.
The one on that mouth of yours.

207
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:08,501
"On that mouth…"

208
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:13,214
That's no way to talk
to your father! You little…

209
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:15,508
Then what should I say?
That kisser of yours?

210
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:16,801
That sounds a bit weird.

211
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:18,302
How dare you talk back to me?

212
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:20,137
When will you ever grow up?

213
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:22,223
-When will you?
-Stop pulling my ear!

214
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:23,349
Just hit me already!

215
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,095
Father, what's wrong?

216
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:02,221
Father!

217
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:22,658
How dare you hoard money behind my back?

218
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:23,742
For what?

219
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:27,329
-Where are you running off to now?
-That's not why!

220
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,123
You spoke to your mother, didn't you?

221
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:30,499
Did that bitch tell you to come?

222
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,376
Tell me!

223
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,711
Where is that bitch?

224
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,255
Where is she hiding?

225
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,177
Father!

226
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:43,804
I fed you!

227
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,056
I put a roof over your head!

228
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,267
And you're still ungrateful!

229
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:40,129
Current is inversely proportional
to resistance

230
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:42,256
and proportional to voltage.

231
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:45,175
This is Ohm's law.

232
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:46,802
STAGE FOR MOK-HA'S DEBUT

233
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,889
This man named Ohm was born in Germany.

234
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,265
In 1826…

235
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:54,435
This textbook says 1827,

236
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:56,353
but it said 1826 when I learned this.

237
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:59,356
Don't worry. I won't put this on the test.

238
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,025
Okay?

239
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:02,985
Thanks to this law,

240
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:06,155
our everyday lives…

241
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:12,286
CHUNSAM MIDDLE SCHOOL

242
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:22,630
Jeez, this is driving me crazy.

243
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:38,062
Not only does Ki-ho have a digital camera,

244
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:40,356
but he also has a tripod
and a light reflector.

245
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:44,318
Are you sure?

246
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:45,569
How do you know that?

247
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:48,864
Ki-ho was the one who filmed
my grandma's 60th birthday party.

248
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:52,409
His filming and editing skills
are incredible too.

249
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:56,163
He made my grandma look like a celebrity.

250
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:00,376
Do you want a ride back home?

251
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,670
Yeah. Thanks.

252
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,798
That'll be 1,000 won.

253
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:09,093
Jeez. Forget it.

254
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,638
Keep the pettiness within reason, okay?

255
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:15,307
Hey, isn't your backpack heavy?

256
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:17,101
One of your shoulders is sagging.

257
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:25,526
Let's go.

258
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:36,245
It's 1,000 won for the bicycle ride.

259
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:38,122
Well…

260
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:40,791
Forget about the bicycle.

261
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,503
I heard

262
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:46,964
you had a digital camera.

263
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,764
TODAY'S SINGER: SEO MOK-HA

264
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:09,737
What are you doing?

265
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,905
No questions, all right?

266
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:13,949
They're all symbols for things.

267
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,326
Symbols? What, a crazy girl?

268
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:20,956
What?

269
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:24,418
Having flowers in your hair
means you're crazy.

270
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:29,131
Hey, these flowers are Ran-joo's favorite.

271
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:31,008
They're called daffodils, okay?

272
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,594
Jeez. And they symbolize

273
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:35,763
nobility.

274
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,890
What do you think?

275
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:40,434
-Am I as noble as--
-Those are potato flowers.

276
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:42,352
What?

277
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:45,022
Daffodils don't blossom
in groups like that.

278
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,483
They're noble and blossom one by one.

279
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,693
Jeez. Didn't you know that?

280
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,697
I knew!

281
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:56,450
They're kind of the same species.

282
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:57,951
Jeez, he's so annoying.

283
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:03,832
Anyway, make sure to film it
so that Ran-joo likes what she sees.

284
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,795
Shouldn't she like what she hears?

285
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,383
Hey, don't you worry.

286
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:14,968
I'm confident in my skills.

287
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:16,512
Really?

288
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,557
Then, let's say she likes
what she hears. Then what?

289
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:28,148
Then, Sugar Agency will reach out to me.

290
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:32,236
They'll say my talents are too precious

291
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,947
to go to waste on Chunsam Island.

292
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,076
Okay. And if they call?

293
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,578
Then, I'll move to Seoul.

294
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,455
I'll go there and meet Ran-joo.

295
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:45,207
And then?

296
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,209
"And then?"

297
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:52,548
And then…

298
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:00,931
And then, I'll…

299
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:05,269
I'll freeze on the spot.

300
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:16,155
I won't be able to breathe.

301
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:19,700
She has a breathtaking aura about her.

302
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:22,202
-Hello, Ms. Yoon.
-Hello.

303
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:47,561
But you see, I'll be focused

304
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,354
as I sing.

305
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:59,948
Dream us
The little girl who used to dream

306
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:05,287
Dream us
Shining brighter than the stars

307
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:10,000
Dream us
My heart will never change

308
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:13,962
I'm still dreaming of you

309
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:19,885
When the sun rises in the distance

310
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:24,890
In this eternally dark place

311
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:30,771
I pray that at the end
Of this path we're taking

312
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:36,610
Will be a bright future waiting for us

313
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:40,447
I won't shed a tear

314
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,532
No matter what hardships may come

315
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:45,911
I will ride the waves of fate

316
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,288
And take your hand

317
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:51,041
When it becomes too foggy

318
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:53,794
We can rely on each other

319
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:57,923
Until the morning sunlight comes

320
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:03,971
Dream us
The little girl who used to dream

321
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:08,809
Dream us
Shining brighter than the stars

322
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:14,189
Dream us
My heart will never change

323
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:18,193
I'm still dreaming of you

324
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:20,404
With my eyes wide open

325
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:25,742
Even if the entire world ridicules me

326
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:29,830
For this path that I'm taking

327
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:36,378
I'll follow the map drawn
By my earnest heart

328
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:43,260
And run forward once again

329
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:49,016
Dream us
The little girl who used to dream

330
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:54,021
Dream us
Shining brighter than the stars

331
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:59,276
Dream us
My heart will never change

332
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:03,530
I'm still dreaming of you

333
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:05,866
With my eyes wide open

334
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:07,576
Dream us

335
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:08,910
So you successfully sing

336
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,495
in front of Yoon Ran-joo.

337
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:11,913
Then what?

338
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,665
Dream us

339
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:14,791
"Then what?"

340
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:17,836
Then…

341
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:20,589
It's a secret.

342
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:28,096
VIDEO EDITING

343
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:46,948
How was my singing?

344
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:50,410
Well, it was unexpected.

345
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:54,039
Is that a compliment or what?

346
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:57,042
Something like that.
In my eyes, you seemed

347
00:22:58,335 --> 00:22:59,419
to lack a lot.

348
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:01,046
"Lack"?

349
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:02,547
What did I lack?

350
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:06,051
You lacked maturity, manners, and thought.

351
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:08,512
What?

352
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:10,263
You also lacked worries,

353
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:12,182
gloominess,

354
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:16,144
concerns,

355
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,854
or reasons to cry.

356
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:22,275
So whenever I looked at you…

357
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:28,490
I was annoyed.

358
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:45,632
What are you crying about?

359
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:01,356
You disrespectful brat.

360
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:03,692
Were you seriously going to

361
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:06,862
call the police on your father?

362
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:08,405
Do it.

363
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:10,615
Go on and do it!

364
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:12,450
You dumb little bitch.

365
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:14,953
The police would know better.

366
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:17,080
Would they arrest me
for teaching you a lesson

367
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:20,083
or you for acting
like you have no damn parents?

368
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:22,085
Try it.

369
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:24,546
Say something with that mouth of yours!

370
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:25,672
Damn it!

371
00:24:56,494 --> 00:24:58,622
What are you doing? The bell rang.

372
00:24:58,705 --> 00:25:00,957
Hurry up and sit down.

373
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:03,919
-Today…
-Young-ju.

374
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:06,338
-Turn to page 45.
-Young-ju.

375
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:08,381
Is Mok-ha not here yet?

376
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:11,134
She must be sick again.

377
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,345
Why do you ask?

378
00:25:15,513 --> 00:25:16,556
I just…

379
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:22,812
had something to give her.

380
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:35,951
CHUNSAM ISLAND SEAFOOD

381
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:01,476
Hello, this is the police.

382
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:02,602
I…

383
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:07,190
This is Chunsam Island Seafood.

384
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:13,113
-Ki-ho!
-Your call cannot be connected.

385
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:15,991
-You will be redirected to voicemail.
-Jung Ki-ho!

386
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:18,702
The deadline's today.

387
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:19,786
What is?

388
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:21,997
Hey, can I get a ride home?

389
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:23,748
Like you said,

390
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:25,959
I think my shoulder is sagging.

391
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:29,087
What?

392
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:31,965
It's not like him to pass up money.

393
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:58,908
Damn it.

394
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:02,912
I came home,
but she was nowhere to be seen.

395
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:05,290
She didn't bother to come out of her room!

396
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:07,792
And the living room lights were all on!

397
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:12,714
She has absolutely no respect for me.

398
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:15,091
That's why you beat her?

399
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:17,052
That little girl?

400
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:19,262
I'm sorry.

401
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:21,848
I'm the one to blame.

402
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:25,769
After losing my wife
and struggling to be a single dad,

403
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:28,438
I guess it's a sin
to have a little bit to drink.

404
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:29,564
Jeez.

405
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:31,358
What a sad fate.

406
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:35,195
Even still,
you shouldn't have beaten your child.

407
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:38,448
I didn't want her to be ridiculed
for not having a mother!

408
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:41,534
I picked up a broom just once.

409
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:42,994
Just to discipline her.

410
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:47,707
Kids with single parents
can be easily condemned

411
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:49,793
even for the tiniest mistakes!

412
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:52,754
Can't you relate, Officer Jung?

413
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:57,384
Of course.

414
00:27:57,467 --> 00:28:00,512
I completely understand how you feel.

415
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:04,182
I only did this for her sake.

416
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:05,975
I can't believe

417
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:09,604
my own daughter accused me of a crime.

418
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,899
How could this be?

419
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:16,444
I've become a laughingstock.

420
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:19,030
I'm mortified.

421
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:29,457
Mok-ha.

422
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:31,584
You get angry
when you see your dad, right?

423
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:33,461
You don't want to hear his nagging

424
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,630
and want to run away, right?

425
00:28:35,713 --> 00:28:38,800
I'm familiar with this situation
since I have a son your age.

426
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:40,301
That's a syndrome.

427
00:28:41,719 --> 00:28:43,680
You know
the "eighth-grader syndrome," right?

428
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:47,350
It just came late for you.

429
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,145
Don't worry.

430
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:51,980
It'll soon pass.

431
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:53,690
And you'll regret it a lot.

432
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:57,736
You'll regret what you did to your dad.

433
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:04,367
What are you doing?

434
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:06,494
Say, "I'm sorry."

435
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:08,580
"I love you."

436
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:10,457
And give her a hug.

437
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:17,338
I'm sorry.

438
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:24,262
Mok-ha, I'll protect you so don't worry.

439
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:27,766
I love you.

440
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:40,945
What are you doing?

441
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:43,406
You should apologize

442
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:46,367
and say you won't act up again.

443
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:51,831
I'm…

444
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:55,001
I'm sorry.

445
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:58,338
I won't ever…

446
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:21,921
We're closed.

447
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:45,653
Here's your music video.

448
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:49,282
Thanks.

449
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:56,706
The fan video contest
ends at midnight today.

450
00:31:57,874 --> 00:31:58,917
Is that so?

451
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:14,265
I'm sorry.

452
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:17,477
For what?

453
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:19,437
Just…

454
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:22,357
for everything.

455
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:26,027
Did you know?

456
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:27,654
Ran-joo

457
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:30,615
is from this island.

458
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:32,575
Really?

459
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:33,826
She got plastic surgery

460
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:36,412
and stopped using the dialect,
so no one knows.

461
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:37,747
But I do.

462
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:39,624
That's unexpected.

463
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:43,211
What?

464
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:45,505
Does she also lack a lot in your eyes?

465
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:49,467
I said I was sorry.

466
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:55,640
Don't be sorry.

467
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,143
I agree with you.

468
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:02,981
She has no worries, gloominess,

469
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:05,733
concerns, or reasons

470
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:08,319
to cry.

471
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:15,076
I was envious of her.

472
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:17,495
I wanted to be like her.

473
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:24,085
So when you said I lacked a lot,

474
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:26,337
I was actually jumping for joy.

475

FAN VIDEO CONTEST
AUDITION

476

HELLO, I'M SEO MOK-HA

Seo Mok-ha's cell phone broke,

478
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:21,893
so her friend, Jung Ki-ho,
will leave his number instead.

Dream us
The little girl who used to dream

482
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:50,755
Dream us
Shining brighter than the stars

483
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:53,174
Dream us
My heart…

484
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:30,419
What did you do yesterday?

485
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:31,796
Did you pull an all-nighter?

486
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:33,548
What is it?

487
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:36,467
Your shoulders are too stiff
for someone in their twenties.

488
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:38,302
I was up watching something.

489
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:41,305
I should call in Dr. Jung
for some therapy.

490
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:42,640
How does 4:00 p.m. sound?

491
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:43,724
Good.

492

TALENT AGENCY STOCKS UP & DOWN

493
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:50,022
Is that news article true?

494
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:51,816
It's just a rumor, not an article.

495
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:55,278
"Yoon Ran-joo and the person
who turned her into a star…"

496
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:56,988
And who exactly is that?

497
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:58,614
I'm a self-made woman.

498
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:01,450
"…Hwang Byung-gak,
have strong loyalty toward each other."

499
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:03,161
It's flimsy.

500
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:05,746
It's flimsier than this.

501
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:08,791
"She'll most likely remain loyal."

502
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:11,210
I have no intention of doing that.

503
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:13,087
"Said a close friend of Yoon's."

504
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,381
Who is that?

505
00:36:16,048 --> 00:36:17,466
Even I don't know who it is.

506
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:23,264
Look.

507
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:26,767
If resigning your contract isn't set yet,
can I give your number to the CEO

508
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,811
of Bier Entertainment?

509
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:32,648
I don't care which agency it is.
They can all contact me.

510
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:37,737
I've done all I can for Mr. Hwang.

511
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:40,781
His agency got its own building
and went public thanks to me.

512
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:43,034
If I resign with him,

513
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,953
he'll monopolize
Korea's entertainment industry.

514
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:48,331
He'll have to answer
to the anti-trust committee.

515
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:54,837
What is it? Are you going to tell on me?

516
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:56,505
No.

517
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:02,261
Then spread a rumor
behind his back for me.

518
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:04,639
Say that I haven't chosen my next agency

519
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:06,641
and I'm accepting contract proposals.

520
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:10,394
Can I send you one as well?

521
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:14,815
I'm interested in you too.

522
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:20,696
Does the size of the agency matter?

523
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:23,449
Well…

524
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:24,951
No, not really but…

525
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:51,602
Did you watch the fan videos?

526
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:53,562
Yes, I watched all of them.

527
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:55,773
Which one caught your eye the most?

528
00:37:58,401 --> 00:37:59,944
You better answer well.

529
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:02,071
If we see eye to eye, then I'll consider

530
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:04,573
your contract proposal.

531
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:09,787
There was one girl.

532
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:20,673
Hey, Mok-ha.

533
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:23,676
Can you collect the volunteer applications
from your class?

534
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:25,761
Yes, sir.

535
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:26,846
Good.

536
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:43,654
Hello?

537
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:45,448
Is this Jung Ki-ho?

538
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:47,700
Yes, it's me.

539
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:49,493
I'm Lee Seo-jun from Sugar Agency.

540
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:51,787
I'm calling regarding Ms. Seo Mok-ha.

541
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:52,997
One minute.

542
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,165
Please wait.

543
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:55,249
Don't hang up.

544
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:03,049
Hey, Mok-ha!

545
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:04,342
Seo Mok-ha!

546
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:07,261
Hey.

547
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:09,347
-I'm not deaf.
-Mr. Lee Seo-jun

548
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:11,057
from Sugar Agency is calling.

549
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,059
He watched your video.

550
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:15,144
Take it. Hurry.

551
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:25,071
Hello?

552
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:30,284
Yes, I'm Seo Mok-ha.

553
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:32,495
Yes.

554
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:35,206
Thank you. Yes.

555
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:38,501
Well…

556
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:43,005
No, it's such an honor. But…

557
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:49,303
Singing is just a hobby of mine.

558
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:52,390
And I sent the video just for fun.

559
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:54,642
Well…

560
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:57,478
Seoul?

561
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:03,651
I'm afraid that would be difficult.

562
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:06,237
Yes.

563
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:07,905
I'm sorry.

564
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:11,158
Thank you, though. Goodbye.

565
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:16,247
Here.

566
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:18,249
Thanks.

567
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:24,422
What was that?

568
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:26,632
What do you mean?

569
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:27,925
You won first place.

570
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:29,635
I know.

571
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:33,431
Then, you should go to Seoul.

572
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:34,974
You wanted to meet Yoon Ran-joo.

573
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:40,479
I've lost interest now.

574
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:42,982
Just like that police officer said,

575
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:45,067
I think I've grown up now.

576
00:40:57,705 --> 00:40:58,747
Hey.

577
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:02,543
Submit your volunteer applications now.

578
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:10,676
Hey, did you hear me?

579
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:19,351
Submit your volunteer applications.

580
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:21,645
Will you please listen…

581
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:29,278
Hey! Submit your volunteer applications!

582
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,532
Why…

583
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:35,868
Why won't you listen to me?

584
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:39,163
I told you to submit your forms!

585
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:41,415
Do I sound

586
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,168
like a joke to you?

587
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:51,342
Mok-ha.

588
00:41:55,429 --> 00:41:57,890
Why didn't you listen to her
in the first place?

589
00:41:57,973 --> 00:41:59,808
Submit the forms right now!

590
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:07,691
Sorry.

591
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:08,943
We're sorry.

592
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:12,905
We didn't mean to.

593
00:42:12,988 --> 00:42:15,783
Why are you crying? Don't cry.

594
00:42:16,283 --> 00:42:17,743
Sorry, Mok-ha.

595
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:22,831
Is this something to cry about?

596
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:31,507
So you successfully sing

597
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:33,968
in front of Yoon Ran-joo.

598
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:35,261
Then what?

599
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:37,972
"Then what?"

600
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:43,018
Then…

601
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:48,107
It's a secret.

602
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:55,948
I could guess what her secret was.

603
00:42:58,784 --> 00:43:00,494
After performing in front of her,

604
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:05,374
Mok-ha would've probably said this
to Yoon Ran-joo.

605
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:09,920
"I want to become like you."

606
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,965
"I want to leave Chunsam Island

607
00:43:14,341 --> 00:43:18,429
and become so famous
that I'm untouchable."

608
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:23,183
"So…"

609
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:29,231
-"Please save me."
-Please save me.

610
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:45,831
RESPECT YOUR CLASSMATES
FOR A HAPPY SCHOOL LIFE

611
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:49,877
You startled me.

612
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,045
What is it?

613
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:54,840
Take it.

614
00:43:54,923 --> 00:43:55,924
What's this?

615
00:43:56,008 --> 00:43:57,092
A map to my house.

616
00:43:58,218 --> 00:43:59,386
Why would you give this--

617
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:00,596
Mok-ha.

618
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:02,931
It's not the eighth-grader syndrome.

619
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:05,684
I know better than anyone else

620
00:44:06,393 --> 00:44:07,394
what it is.

621
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:14,860
You'll die at this rate.

622
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:17,696
Just like the fish in the water tank,

623
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:21,200
you'll die if you're left as is.

624
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:33,754
You'll either be cut with a knife
or die of suffocation.

625
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:36,131
You'll die if you don't do anything.

626
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:40,010
Then, what can I do?

627
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:42,429
What am I supposed to do?

628
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:45,307
There's no way…

629
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:49,019
out of this.

630
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:54,233
There is.

631
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:04,410
If your father becomes violent again,

632
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:09,206
don't go to the police station.

633
00:45:09,289 --> 00:45:10,416
Come to me

634
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:12,584
without him knowing.

635
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:15,629
My window is blue.

636
00:45:15,712 --> 00:45:16,755
It's easy to spot.

637
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:18,090
Knock on it twice.

638
00:45:19,007 --> 00:45:20,050
Gently.

639
00:45:21,468 --> 00:45:23,929
Do you think you're a hero or something?

640
00:45:24,596 --> 00:45:25,931
If I knock, then what?

641
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:28,600
Then, I'll leave this island

642
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:31,353
with you.

643
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:47,327
I'll take you to Yoon Ran-joo
without your father knowing.

644
00:45:55,502 --> 00:45:56,587
Open the door.

645
00:45:57,379 --> 00:45:58,755
Mok-ha.

646
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:00,549
Open the door.

647
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,969
Don't cause a scene and open the door!

648
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,305
Open the door!

649
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:09,391
Mok-ha.

650
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:14,563
Don't give up even if you get scared
and just come to me.

651
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:17,357
Don't forget.

652
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:19,568
Blue window. Knock twice.

653
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:21,778
Okay?

654
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:26,867
What if it's late at night?

655
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:29,703
Just come no matter what.

656
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:31,830
What if it's at dawn?

657
00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:33,123
What if you're asleep?

658
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:34,917
It's okay. Just come.

659
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:37,419
I'm a very light sleeper.

660
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:55,437
It doesn't matter what time it is.

661
00:46:56,855 --> 00:46:58,065
Just come.

662
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:05,924
Let's buy some shoes once we get ashore.

663
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:56,600
Hello?

664
00:48:56,683 --> 00:48:58,477
I'm sorry for calling so late.

665
00:48:58,977 --> 00:49:00,812
I'm Jung Ki-ho, Seo Mok-ha's friend.

666
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:01,980
Who?

667
00:49:02,856 --> 00:49:04,483
Mok-ha's decided to go to Seoul.

668
00:49:05,859 --> 00:49:06,902
Yes.

669
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:09,946
Where and what time should we meet?

670
00:49:12,157 --> 00:49:15,077
We'd be grateful if you showed up.

671
00:49:16,411 --> 00:49:17,412
Okay.

672
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:19,122
All right.

673
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:22,209
Sunday.

674
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:27,339
Old Seoul Station.

675
00:49:27,422 --> 00:49:29,383
A compass on the ground.

676
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:35,597
Should we meet you there?

677
00:49:38,266 --> 00:49:39,267
Okay.

678
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:41,937
We'll be there at all costs.

679
00:49:42,604 --> 00:49:43,730
No matter what.

680
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:03,750
YOON RAN-JOO

681
00:50:04,584 --> 00:50:06,044
Hello, what is it?

682
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:08,588
That was quick. Were you awake?

683
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:09,965
Yes, I just woke up.

684
00:50:10,048 --> 00:50:11,800
Then, can you come over right now?

685
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:46,460
Mok-ha.

686
00:50:50,422 --> 00:50:51,715
Mok-ha.

687
00:50:58,054 --> 00:51:00,849
How can you call this place a house?

688
00:51:02,642 --> 00:51:03,685
Mok-ha.

689
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:06,897
Open up!

690
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:08,106
Mok-ha.

691
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:10,442
Open up!

692
00:51:11,109 --> 00:51:12,444
Mok-ha!

693
00:51:12,527 --> 00:51:13,862
Open up!

694
00:51:15,113 --> 00:51:16,573
You little…

695
00:51:16,656 --> 00:51:19,659
She's locking her door again.

696
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:21,536
One.

697
00:51:22,454 --> 00:51:23,455
Two.

698
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:03,370
Are you seriously signing my contract?

699
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:05,121
Yes.

700
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:08,750
You did read it, right?

701
00:52:08,834 --> 00:52:09,918
Of course.

702
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:12,921
The contract period
was significantly long.

703
00:52:13,004 --> 00:52:15,131
You think I'll be
successful for that long?

704
00:52:16,591 --> 00:52:17,634
Yes.

705
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:21,346
I liked that.

706
00:52:22,597 --> 00:52:24,391
I don't have any money to pay you.

707
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:27,602
That's why I added a few lines.

708
00:52:29,187 --> 00:52:31,481
The total amount of albums sold for me--

709
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:34,901
It's 18,700,000. The most ever
for a Korean female singer.

710
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:37,362
Add 1.3 million to that
to make 20 million.

711
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:40,407
Do your absolute best to raise

712
00:52:41,533 --> 00:52:43,076
your agency's value by then.

713
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:46,037
Once I sell a total of 20 million albums,

714
00:52:46,121 --> 00:52:49,249
you can hand over half
of the agency's shares instead paying me.

715
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:50,792
What do you say?

716
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:51,960
Sounds good.

717
00:52:52,919 --> 00:52:53,962
I like that.

718
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:02,804
You're not going to regret this?

719
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:06,224
There must've been
other favorable contracts, so why me?

720
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:07,350
More than anything else…

721
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:11,187
it's because I liked this word.

722
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:13,315
You didn't refer to me as "you," "she,"

723
00:53:14,399 --> 00:53:16,276
or any other pronoun.

724
00:53:17,402 --> 00:53:18,486
You put "artist."

725
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:30,165
It's the first ship at 7:00 a.m.

726
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:36,046
Have some.

727
00:53:39,841 --> 00:53:40,926
I'm not hungry.

728
00:53:41,843 --> 00:53:43,053
You should still eat.

729
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:45,931
It'll be a long trip.

730
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:53,897
You don't regret it?

731
00:53:55,231 --> 00:53:56,274
Regret what?

732
00:53:56,358 --> 00:53:57,984
I told you to come out,

733
00:53:59,986 --> 00:54:01,446
but I'm not too confident.

734
00:54:02,155 --> 00:54:04,324
We might sleep
on the streets for some time.

735
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:05,825
We could starve too.

736
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:08,244
Or we could be dragged back here.

737
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:11,373
It's okay.

738
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:15,794
If I can spend one day
in peace away from my dad,

739
00:54:15,877 --> 00:54:17,128
I'll be satisfied.

740
00:54:17,796 --> 00:54:19,047
Two days would be even better.

741
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:21,508
If it was forever,

742
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:24,469
my wish would come true.

743
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:31,893
My mom told me

744
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:33,895
if you wish for something
with all your heart,

745
00:54:35,313 --> 00:54:37,190
one way or another,
it'll come true one day.

746
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:40,276
And it'll happen in an unexpected way.

747
00:54:47,158 --> 00:54:49,536
I couldn't sleep a wink
because of the mosquitoes.

748
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:50,662
Be quiet.

749
00:54:50,745 --> 00:54:51,746
Dad.

750
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:54,332
Isn't that Ki-ho?

751
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:57,460
Yes, it is.

752
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:01,381
And that's the girl
from Chunsam Island Seafood.

753
00:55:01,881 --> 00:55:03,717
What are they doing here this early?

754
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:11,141
Your call cannot be connected.
You will be redirected to voicemail.

755
00:55:11,224 --> 00:55:12,434
You will be charged--

756
00:55:12,517 --> 00:55:15,103
This is driving me insane!

757
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:26,781
Young-ju, have you seen Mok-ha?

758
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:29,451
No, I haven't. She's not home?

759
00:55:29,534 --> 00:55:31,911
That little bitch has gone crazy.

760
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:35,040
Hello?

761
00:55:35,123 --> 00:55:36,916
Hey, Mr. Seo. It's me.

762
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,752
Is Mok-ha taking a boat somewhere?

763
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:58,271
From now on, I promise
to take care of you no matter what.

764
00:55:59,647 --> 00:56:00,690
What is this?

765
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:03,693
You're not proposing, are you?

766
00:56:03,777 --> 00:56:07,405
Jeez. No, it's not that.

767
00:56:07,489 --> 00:56:10,700
I'm going to be a grown-up
and take care of you.

768
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:11,826
A grown-up?

769
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:13,703
You?

770
00:56:16,831 --> 00:56:19,292
Ran-joo picked me.

771
00:56:19,375 --> 00:56:22,295
I'll be able to make
a living with my singing.

772
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:26,633
You and I are different now.

773
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:29,594
I'm a working adult, and you're a minor.

774
00:56:30,428 --> 00:56:31,429
A minor?

775
00:56:34,682 --> 00:56:36,351
So don't worry about a thing

776
00:56:37,018 --> 00:56:38,603
and focus on your studies.

777
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:41,564
Trust me. Okay?

778
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:44,234
How can I trust you?

779
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:47,695
What? Just trust me.

780
00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:51,324
Just trust me and keep going forward.

781
00:56:51,407 --> 00:56:52,408
All the way.

782
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:55,370
Hey, let's sit over there.

783
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:58,206
We'll be in direct sunlight here.

784
00:56:58,289 --> 00:56:59,374
Let's go.

785
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:01,584
Okay.

786
00:57:18,143 --> 00:57:19,227
Have you seen Mok-ha?

787
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:25,900
Let's part ways here.

788
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:28,319
You can go alone, right?

789
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:30,280
Alone?

790
00:57:30,363 --> 00:57:31,448
Listen carefully.

791
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:35,201
Go to Old Seoul Station
on Sunday, July 1 by 8:00 p.m.

792
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:38,496
You'll see a copper plate in the shape
of a compass on the ground.

793
00:57:39,664 --> 00:57:40,707
Hey, Ki-ho.

794
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:44,544
A man named Lee Seo-jun
will be waiting for you.

795
00:57:45,753 --> 00:57:47,255
Call him if you don't see him.

796
00:57:47,338 --> 00:57:49,340
He's at the very top of the call log.

797
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:53,636
I thought you were coming with me.

798
00:57:55,346 --> 00:57:56,473
Ki-ho.

799
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:01,478
I was going to.

800
00:58:02,395 --> 00:58:04,189
But this is only right.

801
00:58:04,772 --> 00:58:07,484
Change your name like Ran-joo did
when you get to Seoul.

802
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:09,235
Forget about everyone on this island.

803
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:11,154
Including Young-ju, Dae-woong,

804
00:58:11,946 --> 00:58:13,323
and me.

805
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:17,035
That way, your father won't find you.

806
00:58:17,118 --> 00:58:18,161
Understand?

807
00:58:22,081 --> 00:58:23,416
Good luck on the audition.

808
00:58:24,626 --> 00:58:27,462
I hope you become a singer.

809
00:58:33,718 --> 00:58:35,512
And not just any singer.

810
00:58:35,595 --> 00:58:37,847
But one whose songs are played everywhere,

811
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:39,974
like on TV, in the streets,
and in restaurants.

812
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:42,018
Become so famous

813
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:43,770
that no one

814
00:58:44,479 --> 00:58:46,314
could ever dare to mistreat you.

815
00:58:47,106 --> 00:58:48,191
Okay?

816
00:59:10,588 --> 00:59:11,965
What are you doing?

817
00:59:14,884 --> 00:59:15,885
What is this?

818
00:59:16,761 --> 00:59:18,513
I won't let you take another step, sir.

819
00:59:20,765 --> 00:59:22,892
You're the one who persuaded her to leave?

820
00:59:24,602 --> 00:59:25,895
Move.

821
00:59:27,772 --> 00:59:29,274
What are you doing?

822
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:43,765
SUGAR AGENCY LEE SEO-JUN
DIRECTIONS

823
01:01:14,295 --> 01:01:16,422
VOCAL TRAINING ROOM
CLOSE TO SUGAR AGENCY

824
01:01:16,506 --> 01:01:18,091
STUDY ROOM
FAR FROM AGENCY BUT CHEAP

825
01:01:21,636 --> 01:01:24,430
SUNDAY 8:00 P.M., OLD SEOUL STATION,
COMPASS ON THE GROUND

826
01:02:04,178 --> 01:02:07,640
Ki-ho's always acted like a runaway.

827
01:02:28,035 --> 01:02:29,579
I know better than anyone else

828
01:02:30,329 --> 01:02:31,497
what it is.

829
01:02:40,548 --> 01:02:43,593
I'll take you to Yoon Ran-joo
without your father knowing.

830
01:03:10,953 --> 01:03:13,372
You. Where do you think you're going?

831
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:14,332
Where are you going?

832
01:03:14,415 --> 01:03:15,416
Where?

833
01:03:33,518 --> 01:03:34,852
You…

834
01:03:59,293 --> 01:04:01,045
Damn it!

835
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:03,589
Mok-ha.

836
01:04:04,257 --> 01:04:05,299
Let's go home.

837
01:04:06,008 --> 01:04:07,593
What's the matter with you?

838
01:04:08,177 --> 01:04:09,262
It's all over.

839
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:11,472
Let's go home and talk.

840
01:04:11,556 --> 01:04:12,765
Come here.

841
01:04:14,767 --> 01:04:16,561
I said come here.

842
01:04:17,645 --> 01:04:18,646
What are you doing?

843
01:04:22,358 --> 01:04:23,442
I said come here.

844
01:04:24,777 --> 01:04:26,571
Just come here right now.

845
01:04:27,864 --> 01:04:29,156
What are you doing?

846
01:04:33,828 --> 01:04:35,079
I'm sorry.

847
01:04:35,746 --> 01:04:37,123
Let's talk it out at home.

848
01:04:37,206 --> 01:04:38,249
Okay?

849
01:04:50,428 --> 01:04:52,054
What are you doing? You'll fall.

850
01:04:56,434 --> 01:04:58,060
Mok-ha!

851
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:12,325
No!

852
01:05:15,453 --> 01:05:16,787
Ki-ho.

853
01:05:17,413 --> 01:05:18,623
Are you awake?

854
01:05:18,706 --> 01:05:21,042
Hey, go get the doctor.

855
01:05:21,125 --> 01:05:22,126
Okay.

856
01:05:22,209 --> 01:05:24,045
Doctor, the patient has woken up!

857
01:05:24,128 --> 01:05:25,755
-Are you okay?
-Goodness, Doctor!

858
01:05:25,838 --> 01:05:27,506
Do you recognize me?

859
01:05:29,634 --> 01:05:30,676
Mok-ha.

860
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:32,303
Where's Seo Mok-ha?

861
01:05:36,098 --> 01:05:37,141
Don't worry.

862
01:05:38,434 --> 01:05:40,770
The coast guard is searching for her.

863
01:05:41,646 --> 01:05:42,647
"Searching"?

864
01:05:43,856 --> 01:05:44,982
Why would they?

865
01:05:45,066 --> 01:05:46,150
You see,

866
01:05:46,901 --> 01:05:49,904
Mok-ha's father came to get her,
and she was running away.

867
01:05:50,529 --> 01:05:52,323
Then, they both fell into the water.

868
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:56,202
But I heard the search has been hard
since the fog is so thick.

869
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:05,803
Those are potato flowers.

870
01:11:06,595 --> 01:11:07,596
What?

871
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:10,140
Daffodils don't blossom
in groups like that.

872
01:11:10,975 --> 01:11:12,601
They're noble and blossom one by one.

873
01:11:12,685 --> 01:11:14,853
Jeez. Didn't you know that?

874
01:11:41,547 --> 01:11:42,589
Ki-ho.

875
01:11:44,091 --> 01:11:46,385
When I'd wake up every morning,

876
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:48,762
I used to wish my father was gone.

877
01:12:13,704 --> 01:12:15,414
You were right.

878
01:12:26,842 --> 01:12:27,885
If you wish for something,

879
01:12:29,094 --> 01:12:30,220
one way or another,

880
01:12:31,221 --> 01:12:33,223
it'll come true one day.

881
01:12:36,018 --> 01:12:38,187
And it'll happen in an unexpected way.

882
01:16:07,938 --> 01:16:11,108
TWENTY

883
01:16:13,735 --> 01:16:16,113
FIVE

884
01:18:41,174 --> 01:18:42,342
What in the world…

885
01:18:44,136 --> 01:18:45,178
is that?

886
01:18:56,815 --> 01:18:59,526
CASTAWAY DIVA

887
01:19:51,578 --> 01:19:53,121
The world has changed a lot, right?

888
01:19:54,247 --> 01:19:56,333
This tastes so good.

889
01:19:56,416 --> 01:19:57,417
-Stop!
-Why?

890
01:19:57,501 --> 01:19:58,710
YOON RAN-JOO

891
01:19:58,794 --> 01:19:59,878
Ran-joo.

892
01:19:59,961 --> 01:20:02,380
Yoon Ran-joo isn't what she used to be.

893
01:20:03,632 --> 01:20:04,674
I'll deal with it.

894
01:20:04,758 --> 01:20:06,510
Shake these balloons!

895
01:20:07,636 --> 01:20:11,181
-They want you to sing live instead.
-No one here would know my song.

896
01:20:11,264 --> 01:20:12,474
You can do it!

897
01:20:12,557 --> 01:20:15,727
I'm going to protect and cover for her.

898
01:20:21,024 --> 01:20:23,568
