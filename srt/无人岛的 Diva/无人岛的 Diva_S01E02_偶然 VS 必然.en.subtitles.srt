CASTAWAY DIVA

00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:59,142
BROTHERS SALON

00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:07,817
THIRD FLOOR FOR RENT
GAS AND CABLE TV INCLUDED

4
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,027
Bo-geol!

5
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,071
Hey, Bo-geol!

6
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:12,155
Coming.

7
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,574
Let's have breakfast, Bo-geol.

8
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,242
Okay, I'm coming.

9
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:18,578
EPISODE 2

10
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:19,704
Woo-hak.

11
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,372
Kang Woo-hak!

12
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,084
Savage Kang!

13
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:25,960
Get up already!

14
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:32,425
He came home so drunk
he's still passed out.

15
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:33,927
Jeez, tell me about it.

16
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:36,012
He shouldn't have had so much to drink.

17
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:38,139
Bo-geol, go wake your brother up.

18
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:39,682
Okay.

19
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:42,852
Why did you take it down?
I wanted to avoid real estate fees.

20
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:44,604
I'm going to take the rooftop room.

21
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:46,439
Why? What about your room?

22
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:49,400
Brothers in their thirties
sharing a room is a bit gross.

23
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:50,735
But still…

24
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:55,532
-You think I'm gross?
-Don't put words in my mouth.

25
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:57,742
I mean grown siblings
sharing a room is gross.

26
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:01,412
-Isn't that my underwear?
-I bought the same ones.

27
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:04,124
Just answer my question.
You think I'm gross?

28
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:06,334
Of course. You think he'd adore you?

29
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:09,712
You ran out of things to copy,
so you bought the same underwear?

30
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:10,713
Mom.

31
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:11,798
Hold on.

32
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:15,135
Don't raise your voices
before breakfast. Go and sit.

33
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:23,810
Bo-geol.

34
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:26,729
-Do you really want the rooftop room?
-I do.

35
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:28,148
And you want to room with him?

36
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:29,983
-Yes.
-Gosh, what do we do?

37
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:32,527
Then, Woo-hak.

38
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:35,738
Go to the rooftop with him.

39
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,198
-Honey.
-Dad.

40
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:38,449
-Nice, Dad.
-Yes.

41
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,870
-I'm not moving up there.
-Me neither.

42
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:43,788
-Woo-hak.
-I have separation anxiety.

43
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:47,333
Are you volunteering this weekend?
Which island? I'll come.

44
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:49,878
You said you hate volunteering,
boats, and getting dirty.

45
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:50,879
I love it.

46
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:53,339
I love boats and getting dirty.
I'm born to volunteer.

47
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:58,595
What?

48
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:14,652
It feels nice to ride--

49
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:20,909
Stop! Stop throwing up!

50
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:49,062
-What are you doing?
-Good gear's important for volunteering.

51
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:52,357
I'll show you where all the trash is.

52
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,236
You just go pick it up.

53
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:05,745
Let's walk clockwise along the shore.

54
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:08,665
Grab a raincoat since it'll rain soon.

55
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:09,916
-Okay.
-All right.

56
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,293
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

57
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:14,170
-Let's go.
-Wear your raincoats.

58
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:22,595
Beautiful.

59
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,126
What in the world…

60
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,046
is that?

61
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:07,617
Stay back.

62
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:09,660
Stay away.

63
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:15,041
Stop!

64
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:16,125
Don't come near me!

65
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,293
Don't touch it!

66
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:19,837
Jeez, why did he even come here?

67
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:21,255
Hey, go away!

68
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:23,508
Because I told him not to.

69
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:24,592
What?

70
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:26,761
He does the exact opposite of what I say.

71
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:28,387
He's rebellious to the bone.

72
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:30,723
He was born to be a reporter.

73
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,100
I see.

74
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:34,894
Stay back. Don't touch--

75
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:36,312
Don't touch that! Go away!

76
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,361
Darn it!

77
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:45,530
Why does she keep following me?

78
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:59,293
Does she know how much that cost?

79
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:08,886
Woo-hak!

80
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:32,702
Excuse me!

81
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:42,503
Hey, you!

82
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:44,297
Do you know how much that drone cost?

83
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:49,385
Don't drop it like that!

84
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,304
Ma'am.

85
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:54,140
That cost over two million won.

86
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:55,683
I mean…

87
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:57,685
Look.

88
00:07:57,768 --> 00:07:58,978
Why do you keep--

89
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:08,988
This isn't…

90
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:11,741
a dream.

91
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:19,457
I'm not seeing things.

92
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:22,293
Are you…

93
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:24,795
a real person?

94
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,840
What are you doing? Why do you keep--

95
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,347
Are you crying?

96
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:40,645
What in the world are you…

97
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:42,355
Thank you…

98
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:48,110
for finding me.

99
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:16,847
COINCIDENCE VS. FATE

100
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,663
On this deserted island?

101
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:42,123
No way.

102
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:43,499
All by herself?

103
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,544
Wasn't the guy in Cast Away
stranded for four to five years?

104
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:47,670
Exactly.

105
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:51,173
How could a woman survive alone
on that island for 15 years?

106
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:58,472
This tastes so good.

107
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:01,934
I can't believe no one came to her rescue.

108
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,854
It's not impossible.

109
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:07,356
Korea has over 2,000 deserted islands.

110
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,816
What about her family?

111
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:09,900
She has none.

112
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:12,653
She's an only child,
and both parents passed away.

113
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:19,952
Just hold on.

114
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,295
The world has changed a lot, right?

115
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:07,309
I think you're a size 6.

116
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,812
Try them on.
I'll get smaller ones if needed.

117
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:16,819
Let's buy some shoes once we go ashore.

118
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,226
What's wrong?

119
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,644
Why are you crying again?

120
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:53,063
It's just that…

121
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:58,360
I'm just very thankful.

122
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:12,625
Hold on.

123
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,003
Are you going to cover this?

124
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:18,839
"A Woman Returns
from a Deserted Island After 15 Years."

125
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:20,007
It's intriguing.

126
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,053
What? I can't?

127
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:26,639
It's been tough for her to adjust.

128
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:28,933
She'll only gain
more attention from the public.

129
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:30,768
You want me to kill the story?

130
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,269
Would you do it if I told you to?

131
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:33,187
Sure.

132
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:35,105
Then, kill the story.

133
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:43,197
Pilji Island in Jeolla Province
is a deserted island.

134
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:46,742
In search of trash on this island,

135
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:50,204
I flew this drone with a camera
and stumbled across this woman.

136
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:52,164
The woman in this footage, Seo,

137
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:56,001
fell from Chunsam Ferry 15 years ago.

138
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:59,338
As a young girl
in ninth grade at that time,

139
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:03,259
Seo was on the island for 15 years
as she waited to be rescued.

140
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:06,345
She was miraculously rescued
as an adult at the age of 31.

141
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:12,810
There was no water or fire.
There was nothing. Just trash.

142
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,646
I dug out potatoes and ate them.

143
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:17,606
I caught fish and ate them.

144
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:20,943
That's how

145
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,112
I barely survived.

146
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:27,032
Pilji Island is 55 km away from the area

147
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:29,285
where Seo fell from the ferry.

148
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:32,830
At that time, this island
wasn't included in the search operation.

149
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:35,749
Seo was immediately taken
to the hospital after rescue

150
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,543
to receive a checkup.

151
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:40,671
Tests showed that she was in good health.

152
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:42,172
Left.

153
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:45,551
The police have stated
they will actively help Seo

154
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:47,678
with recovering her identity

155
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:50,306
and receiving a new ID card

156
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,765
so she can readjust into society.

157
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:54,393
For YGN News, I'm Kang Woo-hak.

158
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,146
Was he born to rebel?

159
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,023
He never listens.

160
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:03,152
Speak of the devil.

161
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:13,704
Why the third floor?

162
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:16,916
Right. You're recording today.

163
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,420
You said you'd kill the story.

164
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:26,842
You saw?

165
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,720
This is all because of that drone.

166
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:31,931
They asked me why I broke their property.

167
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:35,476
I explained what happened.
They said to report on it, so I did.

168
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,353
Then, why did you even ask?

169
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:38,687
What choice did I have?

170
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,606
I have to obey my superiors.

171
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:42,900
They want me to do a follow-up story too.

172
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:45,319
They said my story lacked the basics.

173
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:47,905
They want me to find out
why she left the island.

174
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:50,240
I said I didn't ask since it was personal.

175
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:51,700
But they just won't listen.

176
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,077
They want me to look into it.

177
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:56,372
Should I take the news desk head on?

178
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,290
What would you do?

179
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,877
Why ask if you're not going to listen?

180
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,844
You never gave me
an answer worth listening to.

181
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,641
Don't tell me you believe him.

182
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:18,602
What choice do I have?
Should I ask the news desk myself?

183
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:21,271
Bo-geol. Don't think
I'm being rude for saying this.

184
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:23,273
You already sound rude.

185
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:26,276
You're also to blame
for what happened to Woo-hak.

186
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,821
They say being a pushover
makes one a savage.

187
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:30,990
Who's the pushover, and who's the savage?

188
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:33,367
You're the pushover, and he's the savage.

189
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,202
He's not a savage.

190
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:36,954
If we're splitting hairs,

191
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:38,622
it's the other way around.

192
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,004
Hello.

193
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,006
-Hello, sir.
-Hello.

194
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,432
Let's begin the rehearsal.

195
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:11,196
THE HOUSE OF SHARED LOVE

196
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,407
I'm here to see Ms. Seo Mok-ha.

197
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,703
Did anyone reach out to her
after the news?

198
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:19,455
Perhaps her family or friends?

199
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:22,041
She also asks me every day

200
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,917
if anyone has tried to contact her.

201
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,377
I guess it's a no.

202
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,421
She'd been missing for so long.

203
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:30,549
She's getting discharged today,
but I feel bad.

204
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,302
Where will she go?

205
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:36,138
She said she's going to her hometown.

206
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,766
As in Chunsam Island?

207
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:40,476
Yes.

208
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,562
She'll be all alone there. I'm worried.

209
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,445
She's 31 on the outside,

210
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:53,822
but she's still 16 deep down

211
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,991
in terms of her education
and relationships.

212
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:02,414
She probably has no idea
what her future plans are.

213
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,458
She has no adult who can guide her.

214
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:06,960
I feel bad for her.

215
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,144
Goodness.

216
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:28,107
Your phone is faster
than the fastest internet out there.

217
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,359
First time seeing a smartphone?

218
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:32,027
Yes.

219
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,240
Goodness.

220
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:37,491
You can use that

221
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,243
to watch TV?

222
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:40,577
Of course.

223
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,664
If you do this, you can watch movies too.

224
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:45,040
Goodness.

225
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,793
You can also listen to music.

226
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,963
And you can search for things too.

227
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:54,133
Gosh.

228
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:56,426
It's too much for me.

229
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,511
You're incredible.

230
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,764
You're a million times more incredible.

231
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,808
Hello, ma'am.

232
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:06,228
Who else has survived
on an island for 15 years?

233
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:10,357
-What brings you here?
-Your friend is here.

234
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,609
My friend? Could it be--

235
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,778
It's me. Kang Woo-hak.

236
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,657
I see. Kang Woo-hak.

237
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:22,953
I mean, hello.

238
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:34,089
What are those shoes for?
Selling them on Craigslist?

239
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:49,771
I apologize.

240
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:55,068
I'm sorry that I wasn't the person
you were waiting for.

241
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:57,571
I'm also sorry I insisted on escorting you

242
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:59,364
by car and boat on your way back home.

243
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:07,956
Thank you.

244
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:09,458
Then, tell me.

245
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:12,961
Tell you what?

246
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,296
Everything.

247
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:16,340
Why did you leave Chunsam Island

248
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:17,716
and fall into the water?

249
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,888
It's a pretty long story.

250
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:25,849
I'm a reporter. It's my job to listen.

251
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:35,525
Where should I begin?

252
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,157
Gosh!

253
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,117
Stop!

254
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:45,285
Why?

255
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,001
Ms. Seo! Wait…

256
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,092
DEODEOK VILLAGE FESTIVAL

257
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:02,844
What is it?
Why did you want me to suddenly pull over?

258
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:05,555
Ran-joo.

259
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:09,101
"Ran-joo"? Is that your sister's name?

260
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:10,644
Weren't you an only child?

261
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:14,606
Ran-joo.

262
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:17,359
"Yoon Ran-joo."

263
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:19,403
Do you know her?

264
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:24,408
She was the start of everything.

265
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:37,379
"Deodeok"?

266
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:45,178
I'm telling you.
She left home to see a singer.

267
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:47,514
Yoon Ran-joo.
She's that singer from the past.

268
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:50,767
"Girl Runs Away to See a Singer,
Gets Stranded for 15 Years."

269
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:52,227
That's it for the headline.

270
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,354
Come on.

271
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:57,649
How can I dig more when there's nothing?
It's already embarrassing.

272
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,401
A fangirl got on a boat to see Yoon

273
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:02,112
or whatever her name is
without her dad knowing and fell.

274
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:03,739
That's the truth.

275
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:07,826
Sure, I'll dig into it.

276
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:11,121
It's a lovely day
to do meaningless grunt work.

277
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:14,624
Mister.

278
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:17,252
Yes?

279
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:20,213
It's true that I'm a fangirl.

280
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,801
It's true that I left home
to see a singer.

281
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:26,762
But still!

282
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:29,890
Her name is Yoon Ran-joo.

283
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:32,100
She's not someone

284
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,685
you can disrespect like that!

285
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:36,646
I'm sorry.

286
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,191
Good day, sir.

287
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:47,074
But there's nowhere to go.

288
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:51,369
Why does she call me "mister"
when we're the same age?

289
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:13,892
What lovely weather.

290
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,140
JAE-SIK'S MARINATED CRAB

291
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:07,737
Was this her house?

292
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:10,949
-Here's your marinated crab!
-Here it is!

293
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:13,410
This is a lot for a small size. Enjoy.

294
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:14,786
Thank you.

295
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:19,833
Are you here by yourself?

296
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:22,669
Sir.

297
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,130
It's me.

298
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:26,214
What?

299
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:29,176
Who are you? Do you know me?

300
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:33,221
I'm Mok-ha. Seo Mok-ha.

301
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:36,391
Goodness. Are you serious?

302
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:38,727
Dad!

303
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:42,022
Mok-ha is here. She's come back alive.

304
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:43,106
Mok-ha?

305
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:46,401
Goodness.

306
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:52,115
Are you really Mok-ha?

307
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,701
Yes, I am.

308
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:57,537
It's been ages.

309
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:04,669
Just come out already!

310
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:05,879
Sir, what's the matter?

311
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:09,382
What does it say?

312
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:13,762
This is Jae-sik's Marinated Crab,
not Chunsam Island Seafood.

313
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:15,013
It's mine!

314
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,057
My marinated crab restaurant!

315
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:20,268
You should've come back alive sooner.

316
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:21,895
What do you expect now?

317
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:23,188
You can't just take over

318
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:25,899
this restaurant we've built
for a decade just like that!

319
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:27,609
Goodness, sir.

320
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:29,110
-That's not why--
-Forget it!

321
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:33,949
You must not know a lot about the law.

322
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:36,952
But… What's it called again?

323
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,912
It's called adverse possession.

324
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:42,082
If you possess a vacant spot for a decade,

325
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:44,209
the government rewards you
for your hard work

326
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:46,920
by handing over legal ownership to you.

327
00:25:47,003 --> 00:25:49,965
Also, if you've been missing
for over five years,

328
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:51,716
the government declares you dead.

329
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,718
You're legally dead, Mok-ha.

330
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,098
"Dead"?

331
00:25:58,181 --> 00:26:00,767
The deceased has no right of possession.

332
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:05,230
The only recognized owners
of this restaurant

333
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:07,357
are us who are alive and well!

334
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,068
-It's us!
-This is the truth.

335
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:12,737
By the way, who are you?

336
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:16,074
Right. I am

337
00:26:16,574 --> 00:26:18,034
YGN reporter Kang Woo-hak.

338
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:20,954
-Why are you here?
-Don't mind me and keep talking.

339
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:23,290
-Don't film us.
-Darn it.

340
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:26,001
By the way, ten years isn't enough

341
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:27,919
to grant adverse possession.

342
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:33,008
You must not know the law that well.

343
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:35,385
Ten years after the owner has died--

344
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:36,720
Ms. Seo isn't dead.

345
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:41,808
Look. She's alive and well.

346
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:44,477
So why do you keep claiming she's dead?

347
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:48,023
Being missing for even five years
doesn't make you legally dead.

348
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:50,608
You need to be declared missing
for that to happen.

349
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:54,321
But she's never been declared dead.
So this woman

350
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:57,615
is legally alive and well.

351
00:26:58,325 --> 00:27:00,910
Look, I'm…

352
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:03,371
You must not know the law well.

353
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:07,042
But what you're doing is trespassing.

354
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,627
You could be slapped
with all sorts of lawsuits.

355
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:12,130
Okay, bring on your laws.

356
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:14,215
-I'll report this to the police.
-No, I…

357
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:15,675
That's enough, mister.

358
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,471
Look.

359
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:23,099
I didn't come here
to take the restaurant back.

360
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:27,562
I just had a question.

361
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:32,025
About what?

362
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:36,905
Can you tell me what happened to Ki-ho?

363
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:40,283
Ki-ho? Jung Ki-ho?

364
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:42,369
Yes.

365
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:47,165
You see…

366
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:50,085
Why would you want to know

367
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:52,087
what that insolent boy is up to?

368
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:55,840
He's right. He lured you and your father
into a dangerous situation.

369
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:58,426
That's not true.

370
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:00,970
He's not insolent.

371
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:03,431
You just didn't see it.

372
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:06,393
He became a lunatic after you were gone.

373
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:09,396
He destroyed
your restaurant's water tanks.

374
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:18,071
He never went to school
and always stared at the sea.

375
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:23,576
Then, he got the urge
to run away once again

376
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:24,661
and did just that.

377
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:27,247
Not only that,

378
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:29,874
he reported his own father
for domestic violence.

379
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:34,879
Officer Jung insisted
that he was innocent.

380
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,841
But the police were merciless.

381
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:40,969
He was fired immediately that day.

382
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:43,096
Ki-ho is the worst son ever.

383
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:48,435
Goodness,
and he's still looking for his son.

384
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:56,359
After hearing Ki-ho was seen in Seoul,
he abandoned his house

385
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:58,862
and has been searching Seoul

386
00:28:58,945 --> 00:29:00,113
for his son ever since.

387
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:04,617
His son left him, but he still loves him.

388
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:06,745
That's what parents do.

389
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:21,092
I wonder where Ki-ho is.

390
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:23,636
He's probably dead.

391
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,681
If not, how could he have gone
unnoticed for 15 years?

392
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:15,271
IF YOU WISH FOR SOMETHING
WITH ALL YOUR HEART,

393
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:17,482
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER,
IT'LL COME TRUE ONE DAY

394
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:19,442
AND IT'LL HAPPEN IN AN UNEXPECTED WAY

395
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:29,661
He's alive.

396
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:33,248
Who?

397
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:35,291
Jung Ki-ho?

398
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,504
I had gone unnoticed for 15 years,

399
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:41,339
but I'm still alive.

400
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:46,636
I'm certain that he's still out there.

401
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:50,390
Don't you resent him?

402
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:52,141
If it weren't for him,

403
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:54,561
you might not have been
stranded for 15 years.

404
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:00,608
If it weren't for him,

405
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:05,947
fifteen years ago…

406
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,117
I would've been dead…

407
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:12,787
after getting beaten by my father.

408
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:21,087
We didn't just run away.

409
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:24,966
Back then…

410
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:28,219
we ran away

411
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:30,680
to survive.

412
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:40,356
Do those shoes

413
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:43,026
belong to him?

414
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:16,517
-One adult ticket for the 5:00 p.m. ferry.
-Make that two.

415
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:22,565
Buy me a ticket.

416
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:25,276
But this is your home.

417
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,570
That's not my house.

418
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:29,072
It is yours.

419
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:30,657
I explained everything back there.

420
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,991
Will it be one or two?

421
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:33,284
-One.
-Two.

422
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:34,369
Look, Ms. Seo.

423
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:36,496
I told you already.

424
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:39,207
I didn't come here to settle down.

425
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,167
You're here already, so settle down.

426
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:47,882
Then, everything I did
would've been in vain.

427
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:53,429
I got on that ferry to meet Ran-joo.

428
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:54,764
It was 15 years ago.

429
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:59,978
I was lost for 15 years
before I came back.

430
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,355
And you want me to settle down here?

431
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:08,903
Then, those 15 years would mean nothing.

432
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:14,242
My life

433
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:19,163
would be so meaningless.

434
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,006
Hey.

435
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:29,590
Thank you.

436
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:36,848
This is driving me crazy.

437
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:43,438
BROTHERS SALON

438
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:47,191
HIRING
REST DAYS: MONDAY, TUESDAY

439
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:50,153
Then, she came to Seoul just like that.

440
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:51,070
She has no plans.

441
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:53,990
She's a 16-year-old fangirl
in a 31-year-old woman's body.

442
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:55,825
What's her name? Yoon Ran-joo?

443
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:58,661
She insists on meeting
that washed-up singer. Then what?

444
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:00,371
She'll probably be disappointed.

445
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:12,675
This is all my fault.

446
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:14,594
I was the first person she met,

447
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:15,970
so she thinks everyone is

448
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:18,014
-as nice as me.
-Lift your feet.

449
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:18,973
Okay.

450
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:20,683
You missed a spot, Dad.

451
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,688
I told her to return to the shelter.

452
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:27,607
She said she'd rather sleep outside.

453
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:28,775
It's cold at night.

454
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:30,485
She'll get sick sleeping outside.

455
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:33,362
Speaking of which, Bo-geol,
do you have to take the rooftop?

456
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:35,323
Well, that's a random question.

457
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:38,201
"Random"? It's not random at all.

458
00:34:38,701 --> 00:34:39,702
Was it random, Dad?

459
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:40,787
No.

460
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,413
That was very smooth.

461
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:44,290
-Right?
-Yes.

462
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:47,460
She has no place to stay,
and I want to room with you.

463
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:50,004
The rooftop is vacant,
so she can stay there.

464
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:52,507
How smooth was that? It's just perfect.

465
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,342
My goodness.

466
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:56,135
That makes absolutely no sense.

467
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:58,930
Woo-hak.

468
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:00,973
You mixed up the sizes of the rollers.

469
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,101
Mom.

470
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:06,020
This makes no sense.

471
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:09,941
It makes no sense
for a reporter to organize these rollers.

472
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:11,734
We need to fix this. How?

473
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:14,237
The rooftop is vacant,
your salon is hiring,

474
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,363
and Seo is homeless.

475
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:17,323
It's natural. We can help each other.

476
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:18,658
Don't you agree?

477
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:22,995
What's going on between you two?

478
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:23,955
What do you mean?

479
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:25,206
Nothing's going on.

480
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:26,582
Then, just shut up and work.

481
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:28,084
Or you'll look more suspicious.

482
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:29,168
So?

483
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:30,711
You're going to move up there?

484
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,255
-Yes.
-When?

485
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:34,715
Maybe next Tuesday?

486
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:42,473
He's going to move here next Tuesday,

487
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:44,058
so you'll be safe until then.

488
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:47,979
Don't turn on the lights.
You don't want to get caught.

489
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:51,816
You didn't need to do this.

490
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:54,485
I brought some food from the fridge.

491
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:57,738
You didn't need to do this.

492
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:59,907
Jeez, are these grapes?

493
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:04,745
They look so cute and plump.

494
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:07,373
You must've never seen
Shine Muscats before.

495
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:09,625
They came out
while you were on that island.

496
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:11,878
Gosh, that's sweet.

497
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:15,089
It's seedless too.

498
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:20,887
What will you do
once you meet Yoon Ran-joo?

499
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:21,971
Do you have a plan?

500
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:27,018
Why are you so fixated on the future?

501
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:30,062
You always ask me,

502
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:31,522
"And then?"

503
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:33,858
"What's your plan?"
That's all that you ask.

504
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:37,028
Because it's only natural

505
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:39,363
to plan ahead as an adult.

506
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:45,661
A few days
before I ended up on the island…

507
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:49,540
It was probably June 2007.

508
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:53,127
I received a phone call.

509
00:36:53,794 --> 00:36:54,795
Mr. Lee Seo-jun

510
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:56,672
from Sugar Agency is calling.

511
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:58,341
He watched your video.

512
00:36:58,424 --> 00:37:00,259
Take it. Hurry.

513
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:04,013
It was from Ran-joo's agency.

514
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:05,973
The manager said

515
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:08,768
that Ran-joo wanted to see me.

516
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:10,228
Hello?

517
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:12,855
Well…

518
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:16,525
No, it's such an honor. But…

519
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:21,822
But that's when I was concerned
about the future.

520
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:25,952
If I went to see her,

521
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:29,372
then my father would find out eventually.

522
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:31,457
Then, I'd be beaten for it.

523
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:34,460
Then, he'd destroy my MP3 player.

524
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:36,420
And then…

525
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:39,382
That's why…

526
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:41,509
Seoul?

527
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:45,763
I'm afraid that would be difficult.

528
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:47,348
I'm sorry.

529
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:51,394
Then, a few days later,
I was stranded on a deserted island.

530
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:57,149
On the island, I kept going back
to that phone call.

531
00:37:57,233 --> 00:38:00,361
"I should've told him that I'd go."

532
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:02,405
"Then, I would've gotten
on the ferry sooner

533
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:03,990
and not have ended up here."

534
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:06,534
On the island, I regretted that decision

535
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:08,077
at least 10,000 times.

536
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:11,163
If you keep worrying

537
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:13,165
about the future,

538
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:15,418
then you'll end up

539
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:19,755
with just as many regrets down the road.

540
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:25,845
From now on, I'm going to do

541
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:28,055
whatever I want in that moment.

542
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:31,934
So you're adamant about meeting Ran-joo.

543
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:35,021
Is this my fate?

544
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:38,024
People around me just don't listen to me.

545
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:39,692
Both Bo-geol

546
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:40,776
and you.

547
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:43,988
Is Bo-geol your younger brother, mister?

548
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:45,072
How old is he?

549
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:46,741
He's one year younger than me

550
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:48,367
and a year younger than you.

551
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:51,120
Meaning we're the same age.
Why do you call me "mister"?

552
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:55,166
Then, how else should I address you?

553
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:56,417
There are many options.

554
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,752
Mr. Kang. Reporter Kang.

555
00:38:58,711 --> 00:38:59,712
Better yet,

556
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:01,130
let's drop the honorifics.

557
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:02,757
How does "Woo-hak" sound?

558
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:12,433
Sure.

559
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:16,645
Let's do that, Woo-hak.

560
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:21,692
Sounds good, Mok-ha.

561
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:27,114
Also,

562
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:28,908
here.

563
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:30,534
Mister, is this--

564
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:33,788
I mean, is this your business card?

565
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:34,872
Yes.

566
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:37,333
But don't call me all the time. I'm busy.

567
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:42,213
I highly doubt that.

568
00:39:42,296 --> 00:39:46,300
Why don't you come with me
when I go see Ran-joo tomorrow?

569
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:49,929
You want me to continue
taking care of you?

570
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:52,473
You lack such shame.

571
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:56,519
"Lack"?

572
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:57,937
What did I lack?

573
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:01,524
You lacked maturity, manners, and thought.

574
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:08,280
What?

575
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:09,407
What is it?

576
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:15,663
I felt this way from the moment we met,

577
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:20,543
but you remind me of Ki-ho.

578
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:23,671
I do?

579
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:30,052
It's been 15 years,
so I don't have the sharpest memory.

580
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:32,138
But you're similar

581
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:35,015
in age, personality,

582
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:37,476
and vibe.

583
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:46,986
Bo-geol.

584
00:40:47,486 --> 00:40:48,404
What?

585
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:50,197
I keep coming up

586
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:53,033
with strange assumptions.

587
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:55,453
Assumptions? Like what?

588
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:58,747
What if Jung Ki-ho,
the friend Mok-ha is looking for,

589
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:02,460
is actually me?

590
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:05,880
What are you talking about?

591
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:09,508
She said Ki-ho and I were similar.

592
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:11,886
We're the same age
and have the same personality.

593
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:13,220
Doesn't that give you chills?

594
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:18,184
Have an open mind.
It actually makes sense.

595
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:20,060
I used to be Jung Ki-ho.

596
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:21,812
Mok-ha and I used to be friends.

597
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:23,647
And I became Woo-hak after we separated.

598
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:25,524
But I don't recognize her. Why?

599
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:28,736
Because I lost my memories.

600
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,743
I don't remember anything
prior to high school,

601
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:37,328
because I hurt my head.

602
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:39,288
"Jun-sang."

603
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:40,915
What?

604
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:44,793
That's the story of Jun-sang
from Winter Sonata.

605
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:46,253
Right. So it does make sense.

606
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:48,172
That's why that drama became huge.

607
00:41:48,797 --> 00:41:50,216
Stop hanging out with her.

608
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:52,134
You've become even stranger these days.

609
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:54,428
Then explain it to me,
so it won't become strange.

610
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:55,721
Explain what?

611
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:56,847
Is my name

612
00:41:58,098 --> 00:41:59,350
really Kang Woo-hak?

613
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:00,601
Of course, it is.

614
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:03,187
Don't ask me. Just check your ID card.

615
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:05,231
Was that also my name in middle school?

616
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:09,944
You would know

617
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:11,904
what kind of person I used to be

618
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:13,280
and what my name was.

619
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:18,077
Your name?

620
00:42:18,577 --> 00:42:20,579
Yes, my name.

621
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:27,378
Jun-sang. Kang Jun-sang.

622
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:28,295
Hey!

623
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:30,923
Stop living in dramas
and come to your senses.

624
00:42:31,423 --> 00:42:33,801
You were always Kang Woo-hak.

625
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:09,545
To start a fire,

626
00:43:11,046 --> 00:43:13,966
I used to work like a dog for half a day.

627
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:17,761
But this only takes

628
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:20,472
one second.

629
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:22,016
Just one second.

630
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,479
How futile.

631
00:43:28,647 --> 00:43:29,898
What a waste of my time.

632
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:49,710
That's okay.

633
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:53,047
It's all right. Drunk driving
is barely a blemish these days.

634
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:54,131
Of course.

635
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:56,800
I'll empty my cue sheet next month
and wait for you.

636
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:58,052
Okay.

637
00:43:58,135 --> 00:44:00,262
Goodbye.

638
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:03,766
Drop Seo Chan-ki.

639
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:06,518
I'm on a diet, Dong-min. No sugar for me.

640
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:08,020
Okay. No sugar.

641
00:44:08,103 --> 00:44:09,730
Should we add him for next month?

642
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:12,399
No, his reputation is ruined
for drunk driving.

643
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:14,902
Just remove him entirely.

644
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:17,029
What should I do?

645
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:18,781
Who will fill in for Chan-ki now?

646
00:44:18,864 --> 00:44:20,532
Find a substitute
who's past their heyday,

647
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:23,118
is clean of scandals, and is free now…

648
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:25,871
Is that even possible?

649
00:44:25,954 --> 00:44:29,291
What do I do?

650
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:31,377
I'm craving sweets.

651
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:33,003
Dong-min, make mine sweet.

652
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:35,422
Okay. No sugar but sweet.

653
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:37,383
What about Sim Jae-hee?

654
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:39,718
She's trending nowadays
thanks to a soundtrack song.

655
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:43,972
Our program is called Heyday Again.

656
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:46,975
Did Jae-hee ever have a heyday?

657
00:44:48,143 --> 00:44:49,436
Don't be absurd.

658
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:51,438
It's sweet.

659
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:53,691
Dong-min, I said I was on a diet.

660
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:56,777
I only added a low-calorie sweetener.

661
00:44:57,945 --> 00:44:59,279
Good.

662
00:45:00,989 --> 00:45:02,574
This is it.

663
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:06,620
Is there anyone perfect like this coffee?

664
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:08,497
What about Yoon Ran-joo?

665
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:10,416
Yoon Ran-joo?

666
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:16,797
Yes, Yoon Ran-joo.

667
00:45:17,714 --> 00:45:20,467
She did have her heyday.

668
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:50,038
She definitely had
that diva aura about her.

669
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:04,845
But she's all washed up now.

670
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:07,639
Rumor has it
she's a drunk and a heavy smoker.

671
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:11,477
She won't do. She's too unpopular now.

672
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:12,728
Ever checked out her songs?

673
00:46:12,811 --> 00:46:14,688
I had no opportunity for that.

674
00:46:14,771 --> 00:46:16,231
Look for her videos online.

675
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:19,109
There would've been videos of her
had she been any good.

676
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:21,111
But I bet there are no videos.

677
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:23,405
Hey, I found one.

678
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:24,573
What? Really?

679
00:46:24,656 --> 00:46:27,451
She's the guest singer
at Deodeok Village Festival today.

680
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:28,952
Where is the venue?

681
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:34,416
Sangyeon Park Gym.

682
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:37,085
I don't understand.
Could you repeat that, please?

683
00:46:37,169 --> 00:46:38,962
Sangyeon Park Gym.

684
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:41,673
I will guide you to Sangyeon Park Gym.

685
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:45,636
-The estimated time…
-It only understands the Seoul dialect.

686
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:50,015
I thought you were busy and had no time.

687
00:46:50,098 --> 00:46:51,850
My schedule suddenly freed up.

688
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:53,769
-All of a sudden?
-That's right.

689
00:46:55,729 --> 00:46:58,649
My article got killed,
so I had a lot of time on my hands.

690
00:46:58,732 --> 00:46:59,733
That's why I'm here.

691
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:02,819
What is that?

692
00:47:04,196 --> 00:47:05,197
These are

693
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:07,783
lemon green balloons.

694
00:47:07,866 --> 00:47:10,410
They're Ran-joo's official balloons.

695
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:13,622
I'm handing them out
to those who don't have any.

696
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,387
Mok-ha, do you have to go?

697
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:31,348
You'll be disappointed.

698
00:47:31,431 --> 00:47:33,517
Yoon Ran-joo isn't what she used to be.

699
00:47:38,605 --> 00:47:39,648
I know.

700
00:47:39,731 --> 00:47:42,067
I looked her up as soon as I came here.

701
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:44,194
So why are you going?

702
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:57,040
You can dance elsewhere.

703
00:47:57,874 --> 00:47:58,959
I'm sorry.

704
00:48:02,504 --> 00:48:03,505
Ran-joo.

705
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:05,299
This is a gift from the sponsor.

706
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:08,218
What is it? Whiskey? Wine?

707
00:48:09,928 --> 00:48:10,929
DEODEOK WINE

708
00:48:11,763 --> 00:48:12,764
You can have it.

709
00:48:13,265 --> 00:48:15,309
Ran-joo, about today's performance…

710
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:18,145
They want you to sing live instead.

711
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:19,396
The music player is broken.

712
00:48:19,896 --> 00:48:20,897
What?

713
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:23,317
I'll try to find
some backup singers right now.

714
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,610
Exactly how?

715
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:27,279
No one here would know my song.

716
00:48:30,782 --> 00:48:32,034
This is driving me nuts.

717
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:39,583
Hey.

718
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:41,293
Put that on the table.

719
00:48:41,376 --> 00:48:42,377
What?

720
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:43,879
-This?
-Yes, hurry.

721
00:48:43,962 --> 00:48:45,172
Hurry.

722
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:48,342
Open it.

723
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:51,303
Let's do this.

724
00:48:51,803 --> 00:48:54,222
The sponsor wanted me to drink
before my performance.

725
00:48:54,973 --> 00:48:57,309
I couldn't refuse their kindness,

726
00:48:57,392 --> 00:48:58,602
so I drank it anyway.

727
00:48:59,394 --> 00:49:00,395
What--

728
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:05,567
So I ended up
ruining my performance. Okay?

729
00:49:05,651 --> 00:49:07,110
Come on, Ran-joo.

730
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:08,612
It wasn't me.

731
00:49:08,695 --> 00:49:09,821
The sponsor ruined it.

732
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:17,537
Make sure you wave properly, okay?

733
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:19,039
With all your might! Thank you!

734
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:20,749
Ma'am!

735
00:49:20,832 --> 00:49:22,918
-Put this under your chair.
-Well done.

736
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:24,628
-Then…
-Well done.

737
00:49:24,711 --> 00:49:28,507
When Ran-joo appears on stage,
shake them like this!

738
00:49:29,841 --> 00:49:31,551
Thank you.

739
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:32,844
Sir!

740
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:33,970
Sir!

741
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:36,139
You know Ran-joo, right? When she appears…

742
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:37,224
This was it?

743
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:39,434
This is what you wanted to do
when you meet her?

744
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:41,895
Who brings balloons
to a performance these days?

745
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,735
They're Ran-joo's official balloons.

746
00:49:50,278 --> 00:49:51,863
I handed them all out already.

747
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:54,616
This place is teeming with people.

748
00:49:55,701 --> 00:49:57,744
Hey. Don't just sit there.

749
00:49:58,286 --> 00:49:59,788
Hand them out with me.

750
00:49:59,871 --> 00:50:01,289
Do you think I'm a pushover?

751
00:50:01,373 --> 00:50:02,999
Why should I do this?

752
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:06,169
Hurry up. There are so many of them.

753
00:50:06,878 --> 00:50:08,714
It'll be sundown soon.

754
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:09,798
Goodness.

755
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:14,970
-Here!
-Hey!

756
00:50:15,053 --> 00:50:16,304
They're for Ran-joo!

757
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:19,224
Shake these balloons!

758
00:50:19,307 --> 00:50:21,059
Shake them!

759
00:50:21,643 --> 00:50:24,771
There's not much mentioning
of "deodeok" in the script.

760
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:26,231
Can we do something about it?

761
00:50:26,314 --> 00:50:27,399
We'll try.

762
00:50:27,482 --> 00:50:29,943
After all,
this is the Deodeok Village Festival.

763
00:50:30,026 --> 00:50:30,944
Of course.

764
00:50:31,027 --> 00:50:31,945
Excuse me.

765
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:34,573
Please remove the part
about her singing skills

766
00:50:34,656 --> 00:50:36,032
and find us some backup singers.

767
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:38,285
How can we find them right now?

768
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:40,370
You never mentioned a live performance.

769
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:42,748
Ran-joo has a cold,
so she can't sing well.

770
00:50:42,831 --> 00:50:44,207
What is this?

771
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:46,835
You got the mayor
of the county's name wrong.

772
00:50:46,918 --> 00:50:48,628
We would've been in huge trouble.

773
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:49,713
Bring me a pen!

774
00:50:49,796 --> 00:50:51,089
Here you go.

775
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:53,300
Just calm down.

776
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:54,384
Wait.

777
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:58,054
I can't do this anymore.

778
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:00,474
Excuse me.

779
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:04,227
You must be Ran-joo's manager.

780
00:51:05,854 --> 00:51:07,230
Yes. Why do you ask?

781
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:10,484
Are you looking for a backup singer?

782
00:51:12,652 --> 00:51:13,653
Are you?

783
00:51:46,895 --> 00:51:49,064
Ms. Yoon, please get ready.

784
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:51,274
Okay.

785
00:52:18,176 --> 00:52:19,302
Ran-joo!

786
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:23,014
-Why are you so red?
-What?

787
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:24,099
Is it the makeup?

788
00:52:25,433 --> 00:52:26,434
It has to be.

789
00:52:26,518 --> 00:52:28,562
You're not drunk, are you?

790
00:52:29,145 --> 00:52:30,981
No, I'm not.

791
00:52:31,064 --> 00:52:33,358
I'm barely tipsy.

792
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:37,279
Their deodeok wine is incredible.

793
00:52:37,362 --> 00:52:39,072
No wonder they hold a festival for it.

794
00:52:39,155 --> 00:52:40,949
Ran-joo, listen carefully to me.

795
00:52:41,032 --> 00:52:44,160
I just found an incredible singer
who'll sing instead of you.

796
00:52:44,744 --> 00:52:47,122
I listened to her sing,
and she sounds just like you.

797
00:52:47,205 --> 00:52:49,833
She's your fan,
so she knows all of your songs.

798
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:52,377
I have no fans.

799
00:52:52,919 --> 00:52:54,379
You do, okay?

800
00:52:55,046 --> 00:52:55,881
Ran-joo.

801
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:59,718
Turn off your microphone
when you get on stage.

802
00:52:59,801 --> 00:53:02,012
Just lip sync to her singing.

803
00:53:02,095 --> 00:53:03,805
She'll do the singing for you. Got it?

804
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:07,350
As if there will be anyone
who will listen to me sing.

805
00:53:08,101 --> 00:53:11,271
You really work so hard. Thanks.

806
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:12,564
Ran-joo.

807
00:53:12,647 --> 00:53:16,526
That performance was
as impactful and fun as deodeok.

808
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:19,863
-You agree, don't you?
-Do you want some water?

809
00:53:19,946 --> 00:53:21,656
-I'm not drunk.
-Breathe.

810
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:23,408
You know I'm a good judge, right?

811
00:53:24,117 --> 00:53:25,827
This next guest

812
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:28,538
also enjoys eating deodeok.

813
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:32,083
That's the secret
to her amazing singing skills.

814
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:33,627
I told them to omit that part.

815
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:37,172
Breathtaking charisma.
Incredible singing skills.

816
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:39,674
-Korea's number-one diva!
-I'll be back.

817
00:53:39,758 --> 00:53:41,801
-You can do it.
-It's Yoon Ran-joo.

818
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:43,345
Give her a round of applause.

819
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:46,157
-Yoon Ran-joo!
-Yoon Ran-joo!

820
00:54:46,241 --> 00:54:50,787
-Yoon Ran-joo!
-Yoon Ran-joo!

821
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:55,917
-Yoon Ran-joo!
-Yoon Ran-joo!

822
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:58,586
-Yoon Ran-joo!
-Yoon Ran-joo!

823
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:00,588
-I must be totally drunk.
-Yoon Ran-joo!

824
00:55:00,672 --> 00:55:03,466
-Yoon Ran-joo!
-Yoon Ran-joo!

825
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:05,301
-I'm seeing things.
-Yoon Ran-joo!

826
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:10,432
-Yoon Ran-joo!
-Yoon Ran-joo!

827
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:14,853
-Yoon Ran-joo!
-Yoon Ran-joo!

828
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:22,610
-Yoon Ran-joo!
-Yoon Ran-joo!

829
00:55:22,694 --> 00:55:27,407
-Yoon Ran-joo!
-Yoon Ran-joo!

830
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:32,412
-Yoon Ran-joo!
-Yoon Ran-joo!

831
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:37,375
-Yoon Ran-joo!
-Yoon Ran-joo!

832
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:42,172
-Yoon Ran-joo!
-Yoon Ran-joo!

833
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:46,926
-Yoon Ran-joo!
-Yoon Ran-joo!

834
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:51,514
-Yoon Ran-joo!
-Yoon Ran-joo!

835
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:54,642
-Yoon Ran-joo!
-Yoon Ran-joo!

836
00:55:54,726 --> 00:55:57,312
-Yoon Ran-joo still got it.
-Yoon Ran-joo!

837
00:55:58,021 --> 00:55:59,564
-You're right.
-Yoon Ran-joo!

838
00:55:59,647 --> 00:56:02,567
-Yoon Ran-joo!
-Yoon Ran-joo!

839
00:56:06,404 --> 00:56:08,114
Hurry up already.

840
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:12,911
Ran-joo, behind you.

841
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:21,836
Then, I'll move to Seoul.

842
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:24,005
I'll go there and meet Ran-joo.

843
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:25,173
And then?

844
00:56:25,673 --> 00:56:26,674
"And then?"

845
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:31,888
And then…

846
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:40,355
And then, I'll…

847
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:43,900
I'll freeze on the spot.

848
00:56:45,944 --> 00:56:47,946
I won't be able to breathe.

849
00:56:49,197 --> 00:56:53,118
She has a breathtaking aura about her.

850
00:56:53,785 --> 00:56:56,538
But you see, I'll be focused

851
00:56:57,413 --> 00:56:58,706
as I sing.

852
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:45,920
Even the stars had disappeared that night

853
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:53,553
No one listened to me

854
00:57:55,472 --> 00:58:00,643
It felt like time had stopped

855
00:58:03,062 --> 00:58:08,443
But that couldn't erase my hope

856
00:58:11,738 --> 00:58:16,075
I gather all my earnest wishes

857
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:23,625
And release them into the sky

858
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:29,214
I believe these dark days

859
00:58:29,797 --> 00:58:32,759
Will come to an end

860
00:58:33,593 --> 00:58:39,015
Just like how the sun rises every day

861
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:47,065
I won't be sad anymore

862
00:58:47,148 --> 00:58:51,819
The day I get to hold your hand

863
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:55,657
I dream about it

864
00:58:56,658 --> 00:59:02,830
I won't fall down anymore

865
00:59:02,914 --> 00:59:07,669
You'll come to me like a miracle

866
00:59:07,752 --> 00:59:11,214
I believe it

867
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:15,677
The reason why I stayed strong

868
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:20,807
Even while weathering the storm

869
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:26,688
The reason why I stayed on my feet

870
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:34,070
Even in the pouring rain

871
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:37,907
Oh, my life

872
00:59:38,616 --> 00:59:41,452
Oh, my dream

873
00:59:41,536 --> 00:59:48,251
My love

874
00:59:49,127 --> 00:59:55,133
I won't be sad anymore

875
00:59:55,216 --> 00:59:59,012
Yoon Ran-joo's incredible.
She sings even better than she used to.

876
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:05,184
I dream about it

877
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:10,607
I won't fall down anymore

878
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:16,070
You'll come to me like a miracle

879
01:00:16,154 --> 01:00:20,408
I believe it

880
01:00:20,491 --> 01:00:25,204
I hope one day in the near future

881
01:00:25,747 --> 01:00:29,000
We can look up at the clear, night sky

882
01:00:29,792 --> 01:00:35,423
And smile at the stars

883
01:00:35,506 --> 01:00:40,345
I hope one day in the near future

884
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:46,601
We can share the same dream as we walk

885
01:00:46,684 --> 01:00:53,191
Together

886
01:00:57,487 --> 01:00:59,030
Someday

887
01:01:28,226 --> 01:01:32,647
-Yoon Ran-joo!
-Yoon Ran-joo!

888
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:37,318
-Yoon Ran-joo!
-Yoon Ran-joo!

889
01:01:37,402 --> 01:01:40,321
-Yoon Ran-joo!
-Yoon Ran-joo!

890
01:01:48,663 --> 01:01:52,959
-Yoon Ran-joo!
-Yoon Ran-joo!

891
01:01:53,584 --> 01:01:57,672
-Yoon Ran-joo!
-Yoon Ran-joo!

892
01:01:58,423 --> 01:02:03,219
-Yoon Ran-joo!
-Yoon Ran-joo!

893
01:02:03,302 --> 01:02:04,470
Ki-ho.

894
01:02:05,471 --> 01:02:07,765
I don't know what the future holds.

895
01:02:12,103 --> 01:02:13,604
But one thing I know for sure

896
01:02:14,272 --> 01:02:16,399
is that I will never

897
01:02:17,608 --> 01:02:20,528
regret this moment.

898
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:25,950
-Yoon Ran-joo!
-Yoon Ran-joo!

899
01:02:30,455 --> 01:02:34,709
-Yoon Ran-joo!
-Yoon Ran-joo!

900
01:02:34,792 --> 01:02:39,630
-Yoon Ran-joo!
-Yoon Ran-joo!

901
01:02:39,714 --> 01:02:44,093
-Yoon Ran-joo!
-Yoon Ran-joo!

902
01:02:58,107 --> 01:02:59,108
What's your name?

903
01:03:01,986 --> 01:03:03,404
Mok-ha.

904
01:03:04,989 --> 01:03:06,783
My name is Seo Mok-ha.

905
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:15,041
Goodness.

906
01:03:17,668 --> 01:03:18,669
Ran-joo.

907
01:03:21,464 --> 01:03:23,508
Ran-joo…

908
01:03:33,559 --> 01:03:35,144
The 15 years

909
01:03:36,604 --> 01:03:39,357
that seemed so futile…

910
01:03:40,149 --> 01:03:41,317
Ran-joo.

911
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:44,195
…finally found meaning.

912
01:03:55,206 --> 01:03:57,708
CASTAWAY DIVA

913
01:03:57,792 --> 01:04:00,378
You were always Kang Woo-hak.

914
01:04:16,894 --> 01:04:19,188
Is it a coincidence
that we are the same age?

915
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:20,857
Yes, it is.

916
01:04:21,774 --> 01:04:23,943
Was it also coincidence
that I found Mok-ha?

917
01:04:24,026 --> 01:04:25,278
Yes, it was.

918
01:04:29,282 --> 01:04:30,366
Then, what about this?

919
01:04:30,825 --> 01:04:31,826
What is it?

920
01:04:32,535 --> 01:04:34,495
I found it on Ki-ho's desk.

921
01:04:35,454 --> 01:04:37,331
"If you wish for something
with all your heart,

922
01:04:37,415 --> 01:04:39,292
one way or another,
it'll come true one day."

923
01:04:39,375 --> 01:04:41,210
"And it'll happen in an unexpected way."

924
01:04:43,421 --> 01:04:45,172
Ki-ho's mom said this to him.

925
01:04:47,925 --> 01:04:49,010
And this is something

926
01:04:49,802 --> 01:04:51,512
our mom always says as well.

927
01:04:55,016 --> 01:04:56,517
Is this also a coincidence?

928
01:04:58,561 --> 01:04:59,770
Or is it fate?

929
01:05:05,401 --> 01:05:06,569
You're not Jung Ki-ho.

930
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:13,367
I must be a rebel like you said.

931
01:05:14,493 --> 01:05:16,162
I was unsure until a while ago.

932
01:05:16,829 --> 01:05:18,873
But your answer assured me.

933
01:05:19,749 --> 01:05:20,750
I am Jung Ki-ho.

934
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:22,251
Woo-hak.

935
01:05:22,376 --> 01:05:23,836
I sent Mok-ha to a deserted island,

936
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,963
and I was a bad kid
who reported my own dad.

937
01:05:26,047 --> 01:05:27,048
I was that boy.

938
01:05:28,215 --> 01:05:29,717
No, that's not you.

939
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:31,969
What's the first thing Ki-ho would do

940
01:05:32,053 --> 01:05:33,679
when he sees Mok-ha again?

941
01:05:38,434 --> 01:05:39,852
That's what I'm going to do.

942
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:44,023
I thought you were busy and had no time.

943
01:05:44,106 --> 01:05:45,775
My schedule suddenly freed up.

944
01:05:45,858 --> 01:05:47,735
-All of a sudden?
-That's right.

945
01:06:38,452 --> 01:06:41,831
There's something
I've always wanted to ask you.

946
01:06:41,914 --> 01:06:42,915
What is it?

947
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:44,583
The song is just incredible.

948
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:47,086
I'm your

949
01:06:47,169 --> 01:06:51,424
From now on, call me your mentor!

950
01:06:51,507 --> 01:06:53,968
I'm going to do as much legwork as I can

951
01:06:54,051 --> 01:06:56,429
and help her sell
a total of 20 million albums.

952
01:06:56,512 --> 01:06:58,514
Your audition date is set.

953
01:06:58,597 --> 01:07:00,224
You said she was 31.

954
01:07:00,307 --> 01:07:02,226
It just doesn't make any sense.

955
01:07:02,309 --> 01:07:03,894
Don't you want to find Ki-ho?

956
01:07:04,437 --> 01:07:05,521
You do the singing.

957
01:07:08,482 --> 01:07:09,775
