1
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:55,054
CASTAWAY DIVA

2
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:58,850
EPISODE 5

3
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:26,086
This stop is Seoul Station
Bus Transfer Center.

4
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:28,254
Next stop is Sungnyemun.

5
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:38,723
CULTURE STATION SEOUL 284

6
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:02,932
Ki-ho.

7
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:19,115
You're Ki-ho, right?

8
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:38,676
What…

9
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,681
Bo-geol, what are you doing here?

10
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:46,017
I'd like to ask you the same question.

11
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,227
Well…

12
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:50,021
I received a note

13
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:51,773
saying to meet here.

14
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:54,692
You came all the way here
because of a note?

15
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:57,278
No, I…

16
00:03:57,362 --> 00:04:00,782
I thought Ki-ho had sent it
after watching the show.

17
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:02,992
This is why I said
not to share personal matters.

18
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,370
It would only attract
all kinds of lunatics.

19
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,209
That was my intention.

20
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:14,879
I thought maybe Ki-ho
could've been one of those lunatics.

21
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:16,047
Ki-ho!

22
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,925
Is Ki-ho the only thing
you and Woo-hak ever think about?

23
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:20,969
When he's mentioned,
you can't think straight.

24
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:22,637
You lack judgment.

25
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:26,808
It must be so easy to deceive you.

26
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:28,726
Just put his name on a piece of paper,

27
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,353
-and it's that simple--
-Fine!

28
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:33,398
I'm sorry!

29
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:35,858
I'm reckless,

30
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,486
and I'm a fool who lacks judgment,

31
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:40,196
so I'm sorry.

32
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:43,950
But that's how I am.

33
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:48,079
Even right now, I don't know
why Ki-ho's father came

34
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:49,998
instead of Ki-ho.

35
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:53,293
I wonder if Ki-ho's safe.

36
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,462
That's all I ever think about!

37
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:00,049
I don't care
if it's just a piece of paper.

38
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:04,304
I just want to find Ki-ho.

39
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:08,558
That's all I'm asking for.

40
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:20,570
Let's go.

41
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:28,119
Stop crying.

42
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,332
People will get the wrong idea of me.

43
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:37,337
Like a jerk who made
a woman cry in the rain.

44
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:40,548
That sounds about right.

45
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:44,510
Ki-ho is safe.

46
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:52,351
Do you know him?

47
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:58,316
Do you?

48
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:02,070
No, I don't.

49
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,158
But I know one thing for sure.

50
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:10,411
Seeing how his father made
the effort to come all the way here,

51
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,831
it means he still hasn't found Ki-ho.

52
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,209
And it means he's well hidden.

53
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,753
We don't know

54
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:20,963
if he's hiding

55
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:22,924
or if he's dead.

56
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:26,594
He's in hiding.

57
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:28,763
He's hiding well.

58
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,642
How do you know that?

59
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:35,436
I just do.

60
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:06,008
You still haven't answered me yet.

61
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:07,885
What do you mean?

62
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:10,388
How did you know that I'd be there?

63
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,433
Woo-hak told me.

64
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:16,060
I see.

65
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,358
You don't have

66
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:25,194
any interest in me, right?

67
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,781
No.

68
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,783
Then, why did you help me?

69
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:41,836
Are you sleeping?

70
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:45,423
Or are you just pretending?

71
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,680
Wake up when we get there.

72
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,849
I don't have any money.

73
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,773
DRONE

74
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,234
Hello?

75
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,072
Mok-ha, why weren't you picking up?

76
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,407
Sorry.

77
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,659
I'm so out of it right now.

78
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:14,744
Where are you?

79
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:18,122
Inside a taxi. I'm on my way home.

80
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:24,378
Is everything all right?

81
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:26,631
Ki-ho didn't show up.

82
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:28,716
Instead,

83
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,093
his father showed up.

84
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:32,720
Who?

85
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:34,847
Ki-ho's father.

86
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,062
Jung Ki-ho's father?

87
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:42,146
Yes.

88
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:54,255
DRONE

89
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:56,382
Hello?

90
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:57,842
Are you still up?

91
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:01,095
Yes. Is something up?

92
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:03,764
You must be psychic. How did you know?

93
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:05,558
Because I can see you.

94
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:17,611
You must've been startled.

95
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:21,407
I never even imagined
Ki-ho's father would show up.

96
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:26,454
Me neither. My heart skipped a beat.

97
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:30,124
Sorry. It's all my fault.

98
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:32,376
Sorry about what?

99
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,463
I'm actually thankful.

100
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:39,341
Thanks to you, I felt relieved today.

101
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,344
Think about it.

102
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:45,639
If Ki-ho's father had already found him,

103
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:48,142
would he have made
all that effort to come see me?

104
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:52,021
He only showed up
because he hasn't found him yet.

105
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:55,941
Just like me,

106
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:59,778
Ki-ho's wish was to live in a world
where his father didn't exist.

107
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,449
Whether it be in this life

108
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:06,327
or the afterlife,

109
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,289
his wish sure did come true.

110
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,876
With that thought in mind,

111
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,045
I think I'll be able

112
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:19,840
to sleep somewhat at ease.

113
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:24,386
Once I confirm he's alive,

114
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,556
I'll finally be able to rest comfortably.

115
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:31,143
Don't you…

116
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:35,356
regret it?

117
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,650
About leaving with Ki-ho?

118
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:42,321
What are you talking about?
It's the best decision I've ever made.

119
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,117
How could you say that?

120
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:51,121
You wouldn't have been stranded
if it weren't for him.

121
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:52,998
You could've become a global star.

122
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,166
Why do you--

123
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:57,920
Why do you worry about him so much?

124
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:01,006
How many times must I tell you?

125
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,008
It was my decision.

126
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:05,928
All Ki-ho did was help me
make that decision.

127
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,596
So please.

128
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,099
Stop bad-mouthing him.

129
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:16,438
What?

130
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:18,899
Are you…

131
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:21,026
Are you crying?

132
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:23,779
Goodness.

133
00:14:23,862 --> 00:14:26,073
You're not a kid.

134
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:30,035
Why are you crying?

135
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:43,674
Today…

136
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:46,927
was a very exhausting day.

137
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:57,438
You did well.

138
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,778
It's all over now.

139
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:08,115
You'll be…

140
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,869
okay now.

141
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:53,994
Did you just get home?

142
00:15:57,498 --> 00:16:00,459
Yeah. Mok-ha told me what happened.

143
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:02,252
She said you saved her.

144
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:03,754
Thanks.

145
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:06,840
Why would you thank me?

146
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:08,968
Because it all started with me.

147
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,262
-Are you free tomorrow?
-Tomorrow? Why?

148
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:15,015
I'm thinking about reporting
Ki-ho's father to the police.

149
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:16,100
No!

150
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,980
What would you report him for?
There's no valid reason.

151
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:22,731
What's not valid?

152
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,693
He impersonated Ki-ho
and attempted to kidnap Mok-ha.

153
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:27,736
We can definitely report him for stalking.

154
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:30,155
Stalking is when it's done repeatedly.

155
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,281
This was his first time.

156
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:34,702
Kidnapping is even more ridiculous.
How can you prove that he tried?

157
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:35,786
You said you saw

158
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:37,329
Mok-ha running away in fear.

159
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,164
I did, but Mok-ha--

160
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:41,709
It's not like she was injured.

161
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:43,127
There was no real harm.

162
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:46,797
What will we do if he claims
he just wanted to say hi to her?

163
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:50,175
We'd be charged with false accusations.

164
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,177
Bo-geol.

165
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:54,847
I'm just worried that reporting him
would backfire on us.

166
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,515
And he could just end up finding out

167
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:57,599
where she lives.

168
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,312
So we should just sit on our hands?

169
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,523
What if what happened today
repeats itself?

170
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:06,233
-She'll be protected.
-By who?

171
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:11,822
By us.

172
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:21,892
REGRET VS. PRIDE

173
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:23,102
That made me emotional.

174
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:26,355
Now, let me introduce the next song.

175
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:28,440
Gosh, look at that.

176
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:31,193
Almost all of our listeners

177
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,320
have been requesting
this song since yesterday.

178
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:35,114
Here it is again.

179
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:37,116
Yoon Ran-joo sang this on Heyday Again,

180
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:38,325
and it made headlines.

181
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:40,410
-"That Night."
-"That Night."

182
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:41,745
Goodness.

183
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,789
Let me get that for you.

184
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:47,793
They played this song on repeat yesterday.
I guess today isn't an exception.

185
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:49,878
Let me do it.

186
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:52,798
Goodness.

187
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:55,717
How many times must I tell you?

188
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,887
Don't overestimate your height.
Place them on the lower shelves.

189
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,180
All right.

190
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,810
How do you feel today? Are you okay?

191
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:07,062
Yeah, I feel very refreshed.

192
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:08,689
Give me your phone.

193
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:10,399
My phone?

194
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:12,276
What for?

195
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:14,987
Let's see.

196
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:20,742
Where's my number?

197
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:22,703
Right.

198
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:24,913
I saved you under a nickname. "Drone."

199
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:26,874
"Drone"?

200
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,459
If you get in danger again,

201
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:31,378
press this button five times.

202
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:33,213
It'll call an emergency number

203
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:34,756
and send them your location.

204
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,758
It has that kind of feature too?

205
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:39,344
What's wrong?
Did something happen yesterday?

206
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,597
She almost got hurt by some bad person.

207
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,681
What?

208
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:43,807
Who was this bad person?

209
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,102
We don't know yet.
I'm going to look into it.

210
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:50,439
Add my number too

211
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:52,691
in case you can't pick up at work.

212
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:53,775
Add mine too.

213
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:55,277
That's too many.

214
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,155
The more, the better.

215
00:19:58,238 --> 00:19:59,698
Instead of my name…

216
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:00,782
I got it.

217
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,534
Make it "Woo-hak's Dad." It's simpler.

218
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:05,120
What's wrong?

219
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,997
Would my name be better?

220
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,919
No, "Woo-hak's Dad" sounds better.

221
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,671
-Hurry up and add mine.
-Mine first.

222
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:15,589
Add mine first.

223
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:16,757
No, I should come first.

224
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,217
-Put me second then.
-Second.

225
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,259
-Do I come third?
-Yes.

226
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:20,594
-And Bo-geol?
-Don't need him.

227
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:22,095
Come on! The more, the better.

228
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:23,180
Three is enough.

229
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:24,473
No, come on.

230
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:26,183
-Add it. Done.
-"Drone."

231
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:27,851
We'll add you as "Mom."

232
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:29,144
Please…

233
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:33,523
add me too.

234
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:35,025
What?

235
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,111
I mean…

236
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:40,489
In your emergency contact lists,

237
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,075
please add me too.

238
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:47,871
-Sure.
-All right.

239
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:51,541
Your number will be at the top of my list.

240
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,001
Okay.

Are you ready?

245
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,315
Yes, I am!

246
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:20,362
The driving test will now begin.

247
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:32,082
Your songs won't top the charts.
You could appear on TV all you want.

248
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:34,710
And you still won't sell
20 million albums.

249
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:37,254
Why would you go this far?

250
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:39,381
Because I must protect the company.

251
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:40,590
"Protect the company"?

252
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:42,592
From who?

253
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:44,428
From you.

254
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:46,013
From me?

255
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:48,015
I built that company.

256
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:51,018
There would've been nothing
to begin with if it wasn't for me!

257
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:53,312
If it wasn't for me,

258
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:56,189
you would've been nothing!
Do you understand?

259
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:13,915
That worthless jerk.

260
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,587
I can succeed without him.

SEO MOK-HA

264
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,996
I passed with almost a perfect score.

265
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:54,956
Even the instructor said,

266
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,958
"You must be experienced."

267
00:22:57,042 --> 00:23:00,003
"You could start driving right away."

268
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:02,255
I see. You passed right away.

269
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:03,757
I wanted to drive Ran-joo

270
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,759
in a nice car to the broadcasting station,

271
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:07,427
so I put my heart into that test.

272
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:09,304
Right.

273
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,807
Just to be sure,

274
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,226
you better not give me a van that's worse

275
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:15,560
than the ones other artists have.

276
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,813
I won't stand for it.

277
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:24,528
Or maybe I should put up with it.
I totally should.

278
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:27,656
I totally should put up with it!

279
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:29,991
When she has work,
just log it before taking it out.

280
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,701
Yes, sir!

281
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:35,831
I hope we get along.

282
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,211
Come on!

283
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:46,508
Goodness!

284
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:48,468
These are Ran-joo's.

285
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:52,347
You should've been more careful.

286
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:54,850
I guess Ran-joo's songs
are topping the charts again,

287
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:57,853
so people are buying
her albums left and right.

288
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,980
These aren't for sale.

289
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:01,189
We're collecting them.

290
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:04,526
"Collecting"?

291
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:05,610
Yes.

292
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:07,988
What…

293
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:13,702
What does he mean?

294
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:25,297
Hey.

295
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:28,300
Where do you think you're going?

296
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,011
Hey, Seo Mok-ha.

297
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:36,183
Which floor is the president's office?

298
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:37,809
Why?

299
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:40,395
-Are you going to confront him?
-Of course, I should.

300
00:24:40,478 --> 00:24:42,439
As the head of the agency,

301
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:44,816
he should be releasing
new albums for his artists,

302
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,942
not recalling them.

303
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:47,319
Unbelievable.

304
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:50,989
That is so cowardly and shameless.

305
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,450
Why aren't you upset?

306
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:55,452
You said you were Ran-joo's fan too.

307
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,664
Cancel.

308
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:02,292
What are you doing?

309
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:12,469
Hello.

310
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:19,392
President Hwang,
I should've called you sooner.

311
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:21,061
Yes, you should have.

312
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:23,021
I called you numerous times.

313
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:24,439
Just in this month,

314
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:27,234
I believe I've called you over 30 times.

315
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:31,112
I'm sorry.
My schedule is hectic these days.

316
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,697
So I forgot to call you back.

317
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,533
Hi. I'll have one roughscale sole

318
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:36,743
and one cold raw fish soup.

319
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:37,827
They're caught wild, right?

320
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:39,788
Yes, none of our fish are farmed.

321
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:42,540
It's 150,000 won for a small
and 200,000 won for a medium.

322
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:46,878
You pick the size
since you're the one buying.

323
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:56,054
Medium, please.

324
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:57,138
Sure.

325
00:25:58,223 --> 00:25:59,224
Gosh.

326
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:02,143
Someone who abandoned
the CEO who discovered her

327
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:05,188
to start her own agency
with some young man,

328
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:08,900
and who never spent money on others,

329
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:13,113
is buying a medium order
of wild-caught sashimi?

330
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,576
What kind of favor do you want
to do something so uncharacteristic?

331
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:22,580
It's not a favor but a suggestion.

332
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:23,665
What?

333
00:26:24,582 --> 00:26:25,583
President Hwang.

334
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:29,587
Let's re-release the albums
I made when I was with Sugar Agency.

335
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,131
Your albums?

336
00:26:31,214 --> 00:26:33,925
You know my old songs
are topping the charts again, right?

337
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:37,554
Consider this an opportunity
and re-release them.

338
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:41,683
You can take all of the profits.

339
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:51,901
Fifth floor.

340
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:53,320
Ran-joo lip-synced, right?

341
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:56,614
And you're the one who sang?

342
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:58,783
Sorry?

343
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,829
Here we go again.

344
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:05,081
I already told you last time

345
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:06,249
that you were wrong…

346
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:15,467
Who's cowardly and shameless now?

347
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:16,551
President Lee?

348
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:18,136
Or Ran-joo?

349
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:20,555
Ran-joo…

350
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,560
is desperate and had no choice.

351
00:27:25,643 --> 00:27:27,354
The same goes for President Lee.

352
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:29,856
That's why he's collecting the albums.

353
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:31,483
"Desperate"?

354
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:35,904
Hear that?

355
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:38,656
The elevator says you're wrong.

356
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:43,912
No one is cowardly or deceitful
because they want to be.

357
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:48,166
We all become desperate

358
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:52,379
and make choices for our own reasons.

359
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:56,049
So stop that nonsense
and get back in here.

360
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:58,259
If you don't,

361
00:27:58,343 --> 00:27:59,636
I'm going to spread this.

362
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:20,448
Second basement level.

363
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:22,325
Satisfied?

364
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,701
Now, delete that.

365
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:27,580
I said I wouldn't spread it.
I never said I'd delete it.

366
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:29,290
Yong-gwan!

367
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:31,876
I have the advantage
of knowing your secret.

368
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:34,003
So why would I waste it in one go?

369
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:37,006
I thought you were

370
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:40,301
someone on Ran-joo's side.

371
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:43,555
Then, what about you?

372
00:28:44,305 --> 00:28:45,724
Are you on her side?

373
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:50,645
It says that you're wrong.

374
00:28:58,111 --> 00:28:59,237
Ran-joo…

375
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:02,949
must've been so lonely.

376
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:06,369
She was surrounded

377
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:08,788
by enemies.

378
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:12,751
I knew that scumbag Lee Seo-jun
would do that.

379
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:14,669
He puts on a facade.

380
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,672
There's nothing genuine about him.

381
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,841
President Hwang.

382
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:22,260
You still haven't answered me.

383
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,471
Why would I give an answer already?

384
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:25,555
Sorry?

385
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:29,309
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,

386
00:29:29,392 --> 00:29:31,436
so I might as well savor it.

387
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:33,688
What is this?

388
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:36,483
Ji-hyeon is getting married tomorrow.

389
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:37,692
You know my daughter, right?

390
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:39,486
Of course, I do.

391
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:42,947
Send her some flowers,
give her plenty of congratulatory money,

392
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:44,699
and come sing at her wedding.

393
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:46,326
What?

394
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:48,703
You know. Your song "Here I Am."

395
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:49,871
What do you say?

396
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:51,790
The lyrics are suitable for a wedding.

397
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:53,166
I can't sing at her wedding.

398
00:29:53,249 --> 00:29:55,126
Why not? You did pretty well on TV.

399
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,711
That was because…

400
00:29:57,837 --> 00:29:59,380
Look, President Hwang.

401
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:01,800
-Let's talk about the album first--
-Come on, now.

402
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:04,010
We'll talk about that later.

403
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:06,513
Don't you know what "give and take" means?

404
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:10,809
You give first, and then take afterwards.

405
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:12,435
Okay?

406
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:14,562
Come on and eat.

407
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:18,858
Excuse me.

408
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:20,693
Can I have a bottle of soju?

409
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:21,694
Sure.

410
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:14,455
I could've just walked.

411
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,166
It's hard to walk here. It's uphill.

412
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,668
Right, open your phone.

413
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:19,878
Go to "Settings"

414
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:22,088
and then "Safety and Emergency."

415
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:23,172
I know.

416
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,260
Go to emergency contact list
and add my number.

417
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:29,178
Activate it if you get in danger again,

418
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:30,805
and it'll send me your location.

419
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:33,725
That's okay.

420
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:36,853
What if I call you when you're at work?

421
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:39,439
Don't worry about it
and call me no matter what.

422
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,902
Just come no matter what.

423
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:45,445
What if it's at dawn?

424
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:47,196
What if you're asleep?

425
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:49,616
What if it's late,

426
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:54,162
and you're asleep?

427
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:56,039
It's okay. Just call me.

428
00:31:57,665 --> 00:31:59,167
I'm a light sleeper.

429
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:01,878
It's okay. Just come.

430
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:04,714
I'm a very light sleeper.

431
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:09,344
Wait, isn't that Ms. Yoon?

432
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:22,357
Ran-joo.

433
00:32:22,982 --> 00:32:25,026
Hey, it's you.

434
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:27,862
It's a wedding invite.

435
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,238
Who's getting married?

436
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:33,368
What's it to you?

437
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,247
Are you planning to go?

438
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:40,750
Do you want to sing
for them instead of me?

439
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:44,128
Ran-joo.

440
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:46,464
Did you know?

441
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:49,634
Being hopelessly talented
is just being a nuisance.

442
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:50,718
Do you know that?

443
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:53,554
It's true. You'd be hopeless without me.

444
00:32:58,017 --> 00:32:59,310
I'm sorry.

445
00:32:59,894 --> 00:33:02,480
I'm quite hopeless, aren't I?

446
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:09,112
Darn it.

447
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:13,199
Both President Lee
and President Hwang were like that.

448
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:16,661
They would've been hopeless without me.

449
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:18,121
And now that I'm like this,

450
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:20,707
they have me wrapped around their fingers.

451
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:26,337
One can't wait to drag me down

452
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:30,383
while the other threatens me
to be at his beck and call.

453
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:34,345
Why should I even be doing this?

454
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:35,638
Because of you, why do I--

455
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:44,147
Sorry.

456
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:46,607
I'm sorry.

457
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:48,526
I apologize.

458
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,494
Why am I so pathetic?

459
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:05,543
No, I'm not sorry.

460
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:08,379
You came to me first.

461
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:10,131
Why did you do that?

462
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,509
I never asked you to trust and support me!

463
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:20,933
Ran-joo, where are you going?

464
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:22,935
I don't know. Don't follow me.

465
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:42,246
I'm only saying this

466
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:44,707
so you won't misunderstand.

467
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:49,337
Ran-joo isn't mad at me.

468
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:53,549
She only said those things,

469
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:56,094
because she was upset and frustrated.

470
00:34:57,011 --> 00:35:00,598
And I just happened be next to her.

471
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:03,559
I mean it.

472
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:06,020
She doesn't resent me.

473
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:10,108
It's really nothing, so it's okay.

474
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:11,651
It's not okay.

475
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:18,449
You're hurt
because she took it out on you.

476
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:37,760
Sometimes, I wonder

477
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:41,514
if they destroyed me

478
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:43,182
or…

479
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:46,477
if I destroyed them.

480
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:50,565
In life,

481
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:54,360
it feels like the world mistreats you.

482
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:59,031
And you take your anger out
on the wrong person.

483
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:10,418
I'M SORRY
I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID

484
00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:19,760
You feel terrible and want to apologize.

485
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:22,221
But that's even harder,

486
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:25,057
because it feels
like you're admitting how petty you were.

487
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,356
You hoped they understand

488
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:36,652
and put up with you.

489
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:42,325
You hope they do the thing
that even you couldn't do.

490
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:46,329
Then time passes,

491
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:49,081
and you regret it.

492
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:55,880
Now that I think of it,

493
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:58,925
I think I destroyed myself.

494
00:37:01,844 --> 00:37:04,722
That must be why

495
00:37:06,098 --> 00:37:07,850
I'm all alone now.

496
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,611
BROTHERS SALON

497
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:22,615
Woo-hak's been less of a drunk these days.

498
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:25,117
I guess he's finally maturing.

499
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:26,202
Are you worried?

500
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:27,370
Of course.

501
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:29,914
The biggest fear is
Woo-hak becoming mature.

502
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:36,128
Who is it?

503
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:39,799
Mok-ha.

504
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:41,133
Hello, ma'am.

505
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:42,510
You see…

506
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:44,720
I have a wedding to attend.

507
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:47,390
Could you lend me some formal clothes?

508
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:49,141
Sure thing. Come on in.

509
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:51,435
Okay. Thank you.

510
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:53,854
Hello.

511
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:56,857
Where's Woo-hak?

512
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:57,942
Surprised?

513
00:37:58,025 --> 00:38:00,653
It may not seem like it,
but he really is a reporter.

514
00:38:00,736 --> 00:38:04,824
He's on a stake out to cover something.
He didn't come home yesterday either.

515
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:07,326
Let's see what I have.

516
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:09,704
Have you eaten yet?

517
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:12,206
Bo-geol, set the table again
and take out an eel.

518
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,583
Gosh, that's okay.

519
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:17,336
I have a wedding to attend anyway.

520
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:28,389
I didn't recognize my dad either.

521
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:31,100
Then, I met Bo-geol
long after I was discharged.

522
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:32,727
He felt like a total stranger.

523
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:37,523
Still,

524
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:41,277
I never thought
they'd be actual strangers.

525
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:02,423
MONDAY, APRIL 4
WENT TO WORK AT 7:30 A.M.

526
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:58,687
I could've just walked.

527
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:01,774
It's hard to walk here. It's downhill.

528
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:03,859
Wait.

529
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:06,737
I'll do it. You can focus on driving.

530
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:07,947
Do you know how to do it?

531
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:09,740
Come on, now.

532
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:14,620
I'm not a baby. I'm 31 years old.

533
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:16,372
I can see

534
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:19,458
it has the same layout as my phone.

535
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:21,669
It's a wireless connection, right?

536
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:25,840
Turn on the navigation system like this.

537
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:28,509
Here.

538
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:32,054
Gangjung Intersection Station.

539
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:33,639
Gangjung Intersection Station.

540
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:37,852
Royal Class Wedding Hall.

541
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:40,896
This is the direction
to Royal Class Wedding Hall.

542
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,065
-Estimated travel time, 40 minutes.
-Wait.

543
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:46,861
That's okay. Just drop me off
at the subway station.

544
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:53,075
I'm going there too.

545
00:40:54,326 --> 00:40:55,536
What?

546
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:56,912
What for?

547
00:40:56,996 --> 00:41:00,166
He's the president of Sugar Agency,
and I'm a variety show producer.

548
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:02,293
I should honor the relationship we have.

549
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:15,764
-Here.
-Thank you.

550
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:19,935
-Please sign this.
-Sure.

551
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,064
By the way,

552
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:25,191
after I parked my car,

553
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:27,359
I saw a few bees the size of my finger.

554
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:30,321
Oh, dear. They're Asian giant hornets.

555
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:32,781
Where were they again?

556
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:34,992
Near the flower garden in the parking lot.

557
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:37,369
Are you going to catch them yourself?

558
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:39,497
You should just call for help.
It's dangerous.

559
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:40,581
I'll be fine.

560
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:43,459
I used to work in a rural area,

561
00:41:44,376 --> 00:41:46,212
and I've caught them before a few times.

562
00:41:47,379 --> 00:41:48,756
You must've been a firefighter.

563
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:50,382
No, a police officer.

564
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:52,092
I see.

565
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:55,804
You're not old enough to retire yet,
so why did you quit?

566
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:02,645
You're awfully curious for your own good.

567
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:04,772
I'm sorry.

568
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:08,526
Where was it?

569
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:10,486
The flower garden in the parking lot.

570
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:34,760
MONTHLY EVENTS AND SCHEDULE

571
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:00,286
What?

572
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:03,330
Why is he here?

573
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,460
He must be here to see President Hwang.

574
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:10,754
This early?

575
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:13,757
The wedding isn't starting anytime soon.

576
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:16,468
Does President Hwang have control
over President Lee too?

577
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:17,553
What?

578
00:43:20,806 --> 00:43:21,807
Wait.

579
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:23,475
What is it?

580
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:25,936
You said President Lee
collected Ms. Yoon's albums.

581
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,187
Yes.

582
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:30,024
But he can't collect
her albums prior to 2007.

583
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:32,067
because Hwang has
the rights to the masters.

584
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:33,694
That's true.

585
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:38,907
That's why he's here?

586
00:43:40,492 --> 00:43:42,161
He must be very anxious.

587
00:43:42,244 --> 00:43:43,621
This way, please.

588
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:51,170
All right.

589
00:43:51,253 --> 00:43:52,880
Here's the insurance policy.

590
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:54,548
And this is a gift.

591
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:55,841
They're towels.

592
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:57,509
Goodness.

593
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:03,390
You didn't have to.

594
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:06,226
That's the least I can do.

595
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:08,187
You helped me fill my quota last month.

596
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:10,022
I'm so lucky.

597
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:12,858
I got a gift and found Ki-ho too.

598
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:17,279
Found who?

599
00:44:18,697 --> 00:44:20,407
I was on my way to see Mok-ha

600
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:23,827
when some guy
took her with him and ran away.

601
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:26,872
It's obvious why
he ran away after seeing me.

602
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:28,457
He was Ki-ho.

603
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:32,878
Come on. That's absurd.

604
00:44:32,961 --> 00:44:34,380
You must've been mistaken.

605
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:38,467
And why chase after someone
running away? You'll tire yourself out.

606
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:46,892
-Dae-woong.
-Yes?

607
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:49,812
If he saw me as his father
and ran, he's a bad son.

608
00:44:49,895 --> 00:44:53,148
If he saw me as an officer
and ran, then he must be guilty.

609
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:57,152
Either way, I must catch him.

610
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:06,328
Thanks for the gift.

611
00:45:07,704 --> 00:45:10,165
I'll use them once my family reunites.

612
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,544
There's one for each of us.

613
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:17,047
Mr. Jung.

614
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:21,093
Let's say

615
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:23,095
that it really was Ki-ho.

616
00:45:23,178 --> 00:45:26,306
He's no longer the boy he used to be.

617
00:45:27,474 --> 00:45:31,353
He's as big, young, and strong as I am.

618
00:45:32,187 --> 00:45:35,107
You'll hurt yourself trying to catch him.

619
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:37,526
Ki-ho didn't run away

620
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:40,446
because he was scared of you.

621
00:45:41,029 --> 00:45:43,282
He was worried about hurting you.

622
00:45:44,116 --> 00:45:45,784
He ran away so he wouldn't become

623
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:48,579
a truly bad son.

624
00:45:49,496 --> 00:45:51,081
So please.

625
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:53,917
Please, sir.

626
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:55,669
Don't look for him.

627
00:45:56,545 --> 00:45:57,546
Okay?

628
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:14,646
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR WEDDING
FROM SINGER YOON RAN-JOO

629
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:23,113
Let me carry that.

630
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:28,202
Where should I put it?

631
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:31,163
Over there. Put it over there.

632
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:58,065
YOON RAN-JOO
LEE SEO-JUN

633
00:47:02,611 --> 00:47:05,280
I feel much better now.

634
00:47:09,701 --> 00:47:10,702
Is this it?

635
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:11,787
What?

636
00:47:18,752 --> 00:47:20,045
I can assume

637
00:47:20,128 --> 00:47:22,464
what kind of life President Hwang led.

638
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:25,884
No wonder Ran-joo left him as well.

639
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:45,279
Two, one, zero, zero.

640
00:47:53,787 --> 00:47:57,165
"HERE I AM"
BY YOON RAN-JOO

641
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:07,175
Before I knew it

642
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:10,721
You came into my life

643
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:14,433
And I suddenly could feel you

644
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:21,440
I felt you

645
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:26,236
Growing within my heart

646
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:31,199
And I found happiness

647
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:03,940
An outside director of RJ Entertainment.

648
00:49:05,859 --> 00:49:08,362
They say third parties
benefit from fights.

649
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:11,740
I guess I'm the third party here.

650
00:49:12,574 --> 00:49:16,328
You just need to vote a couple times
a month at our board meetings.

651
00:49:16,953 --> 00:49:20,832
I believe this is a handsome salary,
and you'll get a golf membership as well.

652
00:49:21,541 --> 00:49:23,794
It's quite a lot for a side gig.

653
00:49:23,877 --> 00:49:25,837
Of course, I know that.

654
00:49:27,547 --> 00:49:29,049
Prestigious golden years…

655
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:31,677
What an attractive offer.

656
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:34,179
The conditions are simple too.

657
00:49:34,763 --> 00:49:37,349
Just don't do anything.

658
00:49:37,974 --> 00:49:39,768
"Anything"? Such as?

659
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:42,437
For example,

660
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:46,650
re-releasing old albums. Things like that.

661
00:49:58,286 --> 00:50:00,580
Hey, that's…

662
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:02,791
That's President Hwang.

663
00:50:03,792 --> 00:50:05,460
I know him.

664
00:50:06,294 --> 00:50:07,546
That's possible.

665
00:50:07,629 --> 00:50:10,716
He's the president of Sugar Agency,
Ms. Yoon's old agency.

666
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:12,175
No.

667
00:50:12,884 --> 00:50:14,928
I knew him much before that.

668
00:50:15,595 --> 00:50:17,472
Three, three,

669
00:50:18,557 --> 00:50:19,558
six.

670
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:31,945
MENTEE

671
00:50:38,076 --> 00:50:39,077
What is it?

672
00:50:39,661 --> 00:50:40,787
Ran-joo.

673
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:44,207
I'm at the wedding
of President Hwang's daughter.

674
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,501
Why are you there?

675
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:51,423
Can't you come and sing?

676
00:50:52,424 --> 00:50:53,884
No.

677
00:50:53,967 --> 00:50:56,386
Why would I sing
for someone I don't even like?

678
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:01,808
Ran-joo.

679
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:04,853
I'm your very first fan.

680
00:51:04,936 --> 00:51:07,022
Number one. The first fan you ever got.

681
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:09,191
Is that so?

682
00:51:09,274 --> 00:51:10,317
I give you my word.

683
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,611
I was your fan since the age of five.

684
00:51:12,694 --> 00:51:14,488
I've been your fan for 26 years now.

685
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:17,532
What do you mean?
I hadn't even debuted back then.

686
00:51:19,534 --> 00:51:21,495
Didn't you go to Chunsam Middle School?

687
00:51:26,291 --> 00:51:27,417
It is…

688
00:51:28,668 --> 00:51:30,837
the oldest memory I have.

689
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:34,424
Long ago on that hill of golden grass

690
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:35,509
I was five

691
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:39,012
when I saw you for the first time.

692
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:43,600
I couldn't believe

693
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:47,020
anyone could sing so beautifully.

694
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:49,481
I was shocked.

695
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:56,488
President Hwang
was your music teacher, right?

696
00:51:57,906 --> 00:51:58,907
He was.

697
00:52:02,035 --> 00:52:06,540
I had no idea
that he created his own agency.

698
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:07,791
Back then,

699
00:52:07,874 --> 00:52:11,211
he quit his job
to help me become a singer.

700
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:12,963
I totally get it.

701
00:52:13,046 --> 00:52:15,257
Back then, even I fell

702
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:16,508
head over heels for you.

703
00:52:16,591 --> 00:52:18,426
He was too reckless for his own good.

704
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:21,721
He resigned and gave up his pension
right after hearing me sing.

705
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:28,436
Then, he fought with his wife,
and they separated.

706
00:52:29,604 --> 00:52:31,648
-Separated?
-Yeah.

707
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:35,068
I bet that man's biggest regret

708
00:52:36,194 --> 00:52:39,281
is when he resigned from his job.

709
00:52:39,364 --> 00:52:40,615
One, two, three.

710
00:52:46,788 --> 00:52:51,376
I'll play the saxophone at your wedding.

711
00:52:51,459 --> 00:52:53,086
I thought a singer was coming.

712
00:52:53,169 --> 00:52:57,340
It'd be more meaningful
if I did it instead.

713
00:52:58,216 --> 00:53:00,135
Meaningful, my foot.

714
00:53:01,094 --> 00:53:03,138
I was a fool for trusting you.

715
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:10,270
I just represent humiliation
and regret to him.

716
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:13,815
He abandoned his family to make me famous.

717
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:15,650
But I betrayed and abandoned him.

718
00:53:16,234 --> 00:53:18,445
And look where I am now.

719
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:21,990
He must feel so empty inside.

720
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:25,911
-Ran-joo.
-That's why I don't want to go there.

721
00:53:25,994 --> 00:53:27,329
No, I refuse to go.

722
00:53:29,122 --> 00:53:32,167
Why did his daughter
have to get married now?

723
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:33,585
It should've been sooner

724
00:53:34,419 --> 00:53:37,047
when I was prettier
and could still sing properly.

725
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:39,090
You're still just as gorgeous.

726
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:40,717
You're fine.

727
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:51,686
Maybe in your eyes.

728
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:54,564
I'm pitiful

729
00:53:56,191 --> 00:53:57,192
and pathetic.

730
00:53:59,361 --> 00:54:00,987
You can wear makeup.

731
00:54:02,447 --> 00:54:05,617
If that's how you feel,
then cover it up with some makeup.

732
00:54:06,159 --> 00:54:09,829
Makeup will cover anything.

733
00:54:10,622 --> 00:54:11,706
So come.

734
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:17,963
We can sing together.

735
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:20,090
If the song is too high, lower the key.

736
00:54:20,173 --> 00:54:22,342
I'll find a way to cover for you.

737
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:26,096
I'll harmonize with you
and help you sound beautiful.

738
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:31,518
I'll be your mascara,

739
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:35,146
foundation, lipstick,

740
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:36,731
voice,

741
00:54:37,565 --> 00:54:39,192
and armor.

742
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:43,405
I'm going to protect and cover for you.

743
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:45,865
So come.

744
00:54:52,497 --> 00:54:54,290
You're too easily forgiving.

745
00:54:58,169 --> 00:54:59,504
You see,

746
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:02,549
I want President Hwang

747
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:06,177
to be proud of you.

748
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:13,226
So please come.

749
00:55:14,227 --> 00:55:15,645
Don't make it another regret.

750
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:04,444
You came.

751
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:07,572
Of course.
Did you think I wouldn't make it?

752
00:56:39,395 --> 00:56:42,857
Without any reason

753
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:46,486
When I look into your eyes

754
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:52,033
The emptiness within me disappears

755
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:57,664
When I close my eyes

756
00:56:57,747 --> 00:57:01,167
I see you

757
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:06,506
Coming to me

758
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:11,845
-Here I am
-Here I am

759
00:57:12,428 --> 00:57:16,057
-I will always
-I will always

760
00:57:16,141 --> 00:57:19,018
-Be together
-Be together

761
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:21,187
-With you
-With you

762
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:27,527
-Let me love all of you
-Let me love all of you

763
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:34,701
-Even the pain that's inside
-Even the pain that's inside

764
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:39,038
-I've always cherished in my heart
-I've always cherished in my heart

765
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:42,542
-My feelings about you
-My feelings about you

766
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:49,048
-I'll keep this promise forever
-I'll keep this promise forever

767
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:54,721
-Here I am
-Here I am

768
00:57:54,804 --> 00:57:58,892
-Whenever you turn around
-Whenever you turn around

769
00:57:58,975 --> 00:58:04,147
-I'll always be by your side
-I'll always be by your side

770
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:11,154
-Come close to me
-Come close to me

771
00:58:11,237 --> 00:58:15,116
-And hold me silently
-And hold me silently

772
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,035
-We can do this.
-We can do this.

773
00:58:17,702 --> 00:58:18,703
I can do this!

774
00:58:25,877 --> 00:58:31,508
Here I am

775
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:45,230
-Yoon Ran-joo!
-Yoon Ran-joo!

776
00:58:45,313 --> 00:58:48,483
-Yoon Ran-joo!
-Yoon Ran-joo!

777
00:58:48,566 --> 00:58:52,111
-Encore!
-Yoon Ran-joo!

778
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:56,366
-Encore!
-Yoon Ran-joo!

779
00:59:04,999 --> 00:59:06,000
Where's your wife?

780
00:59:06,501 --> 00:59:10,547
She went straight
to the airport with the kids.

781
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:14,968
I gave money and sang
at the wedding but all I get is this.

782
00:59:20,431 --> 00:59:21,516
I'm sorry.

783
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:25,061
It's okay. I have to lose weight
for my TV appearance anyway.

784
00:59:25,144 --> 00:59:30,191
I meant talking harshly to you
and giving you a hard time back then.

785
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:35,488
What? Why bring up the past now?

786
00:59:36,114 --> 00:59:39,909
My family left me,
and I was upset and struggling with work.

787
00:59:41,286 --> 00:59:43,580
So I took a bit of my anger out on you.

788
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:49,294
Don't downplay it.

789
00:59:50,003 --> 00:59:51,129
You're right.

790
00:59:51,212 --> 00:59:52,589
I vented at you a lot.

791
00:59:54,215 --> 00:59:57,885
I should've solved my issues
with whoever was involved.

792
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:02,056
But I took it out on you instead.

793
01:00:04,309 --> 01:00:08,563
We tend to take it out
on the kindest pushovers.

794
01:00:09,981 --> 01:00:13,985
But I never stopped.
And even a kind pushover like you

795
01:00:14,736 --> 01:00:16,946
eventually betrayed and left me too.

796
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:19,532
I never betrayed you.

797
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:21,284
I left after our contract ended.

798
01:00:21,367 --> 01:00:25,246
I thought you were mine back then,

799
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:28,875
because I discovered and helped you grow.

800
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:31,711
That's why I was so harsh.

801
01:00:40,386 --> 01:00:41,763
Thank you

802
01:00:42,555 --> 01:00:43,556
for today.

803
01:00:59,113 --> 01:01:02,325
I would've regretted it
had I not shown up today.

804
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:07,080
Thank you for everything.

805
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:10,249
I should thank you instead.

806
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:11,334
For what?

807
01:01:11,918 --> 01:01:15,380
I crossed something off
my bucket list thanks to you.

808
01:01:15,963 --> 01:01:17,590
Singing a duet with you.

809
01:01:18,758 --> 01:01:22,136
It was my dream
ever since I was on Chunsam Island.

810
01:01:23,054 --> 01:01:25,932
Performing on stage with you.

811
01:01:27,266 --> 01:01:28,101
Goodness.

812
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:29,894
My heart is about to burst

813
01:01:29,977 --> 01:01:32,897
just thinking about what just happened.

814
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:34,899
It's about to burst.

815
01:01:34,982 --> 01:01:36,776
A heart doesn't burst that easily.

816
01:01:38,236 --> 01:01:40,196
You don't like dried persimmons?

817
01:01:40,988 --> 01:01:42,323
This?

818
01:01:42,907 --> 01:01:45,118
Then, let me have it. They were good.

819
01:01:46,452 --> 01:01:49,747
Ran-joo, you see…

820
01:01:49,831 --> 01:01:52,125
There's someone I'd like to give this to.

821
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:55,211
Didn't you just talk
about how your heart almost burst

822
01:01:55,294 --> 01:01:57,296
and that singing with me was your dream?

823
01:01:57,380 --> 01:02:00,842
Yes, but this is
an entirely different thing.

824
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:04,220
How did it go?

825
01:02:04,303 --> 01:02:05,471
-What do you mean?
-What?

826
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:07,473
Weren't you here to discuss album sales

827
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:08,766
with President Hwang?

828
01:02:09,809 --> 01:02:10,852
-Goodness.
-Oh, my.

829
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:13,688
-Goodness!
-Oh, my!

830
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:28,119
The conditions are simple too.

831
01:02:28,619 --> 01:02:30,621
Just don't do anything.

832
01:02:31,205 --> 01:02:32,957
"Anything"? Such as?

833
01:02:34,375 --> 01:02:35,668
For example,

834
01:02:36,210 --> 01:02:39,756
re-releasing old albums. Things like that.

835
01:02:48,097 --> 01:02:49,599
-Seo-jun.
-Yes?

836
01:02:49,682 --> 01:02:52,643
I believe there's something
I have that's in your favor.

837
01:02:54,187 --> 01:02:56,022
But that thing will run out soon.

838
01:02:56,647 --> 01:02:58,524
Then, you'll discard me.

839
01:02:58,608 --> 01:02:59,525
Sir--

840
01:03:00,485 --> 01:03:01,569
There's no guarantee…

841
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:07,241
that you won't betray me
like you did with Ran-joo.

842
01:03:31,682 --> 01:03:34,101
President Lee, I just landed.

843
01:03:35,603 --> 01:03:38,314
Mo-rae, can you talk right now?

844
01:03:44,987 --> 01:03:46,405
Heyday Again?

845
01:03:47,365 --> 01:03:48,616
I'd love to.

846
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:52,870
Come on. What are you saying?
It's not subpar.

847
01:03:52,954 --> 01:03:56,582
I'd be honored to perform alongside her.

848
01:03:59,335 --> 01:04:01,754
No, I'll prepare well for it. Don't worry.

849
01:04:03,256 --> 01:04:04,257
Okay.

850
01:04:04,966 --> 01:04:05,883
Goodbye.

851
01:04:08,761 --> 01:04:11,138
All the passengers have left,
so get changed.

852
01:04:18,563 --> 01:04:20,523
-Which exit do I go to this time?
-Gate C.

853
01:04:20,606 --> 01:04:22,275
This is the item you're promoting.

854
01:04:22,358 --> 01:04:23,359
Okay.

855
01:04:25,111 --> 01:04:26,696
How many reporters are waiting?

856
01:04:27,196 --> 01:04:30,741
About 60 to 70
including this bracelet's PR Team.

857
01:04:40,167 --> 01:04:41,419
I'm finally here.

858
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:47,174
Excuse us!

859
01:04:47,258 --> 01:04:48,759
Mo-rae, you're so beautiful!

860
01:04:49,302 --> 01:04:50,595
I love you!

861
01:04:53,598 --> 01:04:54,599
Step aside, please!

862
01:05:12,116 --> 01:05:13,200
You're already home?

863
01:05:13,284 --> 01:05:14,702
Yes, but I'm leaving again.

864
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:17,580
-Another stake out?
-Yeah.

865
01:05:19,165 --> 01:05:20,958
What in the world are you covering?

866
01:05:23,169 --> 01:05:24,629
I guess the headline will be

867
01:05:24,712 --> 01:05:27,381
"The Two-faced Domestic Abuser."

868
01:05:28,257 --> 01:05:29,842
Who's the domestic abuser?

869
01:05:29,926 --> 01:05:31,969
It's a secret.
I need to protect my source.

870
01:05:34,472 --> 01:05:35,640
I'll be home late.

871
01:05:47,985 --> 01:05:49,111
Woo-hak.

872
01:05:50,446 --> 01:05:51,614
Woo-hak.

873
01:05:54,241 --> 01:05:55,242
A formal outfit?

874
01:05:55,326 --> 01:05:58,496
I borrowed it from Ms. Song,
because I had a wedding to attend.

875
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:00,539
I'm glad you're here.

876
01:06:01,332 --> 01:06:03,334
Here. Eat this.

877
01:06:03,417 --> 01:06:05,878
I got it at the wedding.

878
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:09,340
I've never seen
such adorable dried persimmons before.

879
01:06:10,091 --> 01:06:10,925
They are cute.

880
01:06:11,592 --> 01:06:13,844
-Why didn't you just have them?
-Woo-hak.

881
01:06:14,762 --> 01:06:17,765
I hate being indebted to others.

882
01:06:18,349 --> 01:06:20,935
I toss and turn at night,
because I always get your help.

883
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:24,647
I may be starting off small,

884
01:06:24,730 --> 01:06:28,359
but I'll repay you handsomely later on.

885
01:06:28,442 --> 01:06:30,403
Goodness, are you going to finish that?

886
01:06:35,032 --> 01:06:35,866
Thanks.

887
01:06:36,951 --> 01:06:38,119
So be prepared

888
01:06:38,202 --> 01:06:41,789
to receive many gifts from me. Got that?

889
01:06:43,916 --> 01:06:44,750
What?

890
01:06:45,334 --> 01:06:49,130
Not only do they look adorable,
but they're super delicious too.

891
01:06:51,590 --> 01:06:52,591
Mok-ha.

892
01:06:53,092 --> 01:06:54,093
Yeah?

893
01:06:56,971 --> 01:06:58,055
If we're lucky,

894
01:06:58,764 --> 01:07:00,307
I think we can find Ki-ho.

895
01:07:06,188 --> 01:07:07,189
What did you say?

896
01:07:09,191 --> 01:07:10,192
Do you mean that?

897
01:07:11,152 --> 01:07:13,070
Where is he?

898
01:07:13,154 --> 01:07:14,488
Can I meet him?

899
01:07:15,489 --> 01:07:16,615
Not yet.

900
01:07:17,241 --> 01:07:18,868
Why not?

901
01:07:18,951 --> 01:07:20,661
You could be in danger like last time.

902
01:07:20,745 --> 01:07:21,746
First,

903
01:07:22,246 --> 01:07:24,498
let me make sure it's safe.

904
01:07:25,374 --> 01:07:26,542
Then, I'll let you see him.

905
01:07:28,252 --> 01:07:31,172
Are you sure he's alive?

906
01:07:31,255 --> 01:07:32,423
He is.

907
01:07:33,174 --> 01:07:34,341
I've confirmed it already.

908
01:07:36,385 --> 01:07:38,304
He's healthy and doing well.

909
01:07:39,889 --> 01:07:42,349
Seriously?

910
01:07:43,350 --> 01:07:44,518
Are you sure?

911
01:07:45,686 --> 01:07:47,563
Yes, I'm sure.

912
01:07:51,859 --> 01:07:52,860
All right.

913
01:07:54,361 --> 01:07:56,113
Yes, that'll do.

914
01:07:56,197 --> 01:07:58,616
That's more than enough.

915
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:01,368
Now, I…

916
01:08:01,952 --> 01:08:06,791
I can truly sleep at ease now.

917
01:08:20,888 --> 01:08:24,600
Why did he crash
when he wasn't even drunk?

918
01:08:24,683 --> 01:08:26,143
The dashcam will let us know.

919
01:08:33,317 --> 01:08:34,360
What's wrong?

920
01:08:34,902 --> 01:08:36,320
There are hornets inside!

921
01:08:36,403 --> 01:08:38,280
-Hornets?
-Yes, sir.

922
01:08:39,406 --> 01:08:42,409
Hornets must've gotten in
while he was driving.

923
01:08:43,077 --> 01:08:45,913
That's why he rolled down all the windows.

924
01:08:45,996 --> 01:08:47,790
This must be why he crashed.

925
01:08:47,873 --> 01:08:50,000
Go tell the first responders

926
01:08:50,084 --> 01:08:51,961
that the driver could've been stung.

927
01:08:52,044 --> 01:08:53,045
-Okay?
-Yes, sir.

928
01:08:56,674 --> 01:08:59,260
There are hornets in the vehicle.

929
01:08:59,343 --> 01:09:01,053
He could've been stung by them.

930
01:09:01,137 --> 01:09:02,429
Okay, I understand.

931
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:09,145
Ms. Song!

932
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:11,188
Thank you for the outfit.

933
01:09:11,272 --> 01:09:13,691
You didn't have to get it dry-cleaned.

934
01:09:13,774 --> 01:09:15,985
You'll probably need it
more often than I do.

935
01:09:16,068 --> 01:09:17,570
-You can have it.
-Goodness.

936
01:09:17,653 --> 01:09:18,779
That's okay.

937
01:09:18,863 --> 01:09:21,407
When will I ever get to wear this again?

938
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:22,992
More often than you think.

939
01:09:23,075 --> 01:09:25,411
You'll need it for interviews
when you become singer.

940
01:09:25,494 --> 01:09:26,996
She's right. It's perfect.

941
01:09:27,121 --> 01:09:28,122
Goodness.

942
01:09:28,205 --> 01:09:30,958
I don't even know
if that day will ever come.

943
01:09:31,041 --> 01:09:33,335
It will. No matter what.

944
01:09:33,961 --> 01:09:36,130
If you wish for something
with all your heart,

945
01:09:36,213 --> 01:09:38,048
one way or another,
it'll come true one day.

946
01:09:38,132 --> 01:09:40,426
-And--
-And it'll happen in an unexpected way.

947
01:09:41,594 --> 01:09:43,095
My mom told me

948
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:45,431
if you wish for something
with all your heart,

949
01:09:46,515 --> 01:09:48,726
one way or another,
it'll come true one day.

950
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:51,520
And it'll happen in an unexpected way.

951
01:09:52,521 --> 01:09:53,814
Come on.

952
01:09:53,898 --> 01:09:55,608
I was being serious for once.

953
01:09:55,691 --> 01:09:56,692
I'm sorry.

954
01:09:56,775 --> 01:09:59,320
I've heard it so many times
that it just came out.

955
01:10:01,322 --> 01:10:02,615
Ms. Song.

956
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:05,284
Who did you hear

957
01:10:06,202 --> 01:10:07,828
that saying from?

958
01:10:07,912 --> 01:10:08,913
"Who"?

959
01:10:09,872 --> 01:10:11,874
I made it up. Why?

960
01:11:52,891 --> 01:11:54,184
Does he have family?

961
01:13:53,554 --> 01:13:54,555
That's me.

962
01:13:56,723 --> 01:13:58,559
But why is Bo-geol in the photo too?

963
01:14:19,705 --> 01:14:20,706
Who is it?

964
01:14:31,842 --> 01:14:32,843
It's me.

965
01:14:36,763 --> 01:14:37,890
Let's get out of here.

966
01:14:39,975 --> 01:14:40,976
You.

967
01:14:43,061 --> 01:14:44,062
You know, don't you?

968
01:14:50,986 --> 01:14:52,154
Why am I in that photo?

969
01:14:52,905 --> 01:14:54,781
Why are you and Mom there too?

970
01:14:56,366 --> 01:14:57,367
Is he my--

971
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:02,331
No.

972
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:05,459
Is he our father?

973
01:15:11,757 --> 01:15:13,050
Answer me!

974
01:15:21,808 --> 01:15:23,268
-I'll throw this away.
-Okay.

975
01:15:25,395 --> 01:15:26,688
Let's go upstairs first.

976
01:15:27,606 --> 01:15:29,107
-Ms. Song.
-Yes?

977
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:31,902
I…

978
01:15:32,569 --> 01:15:34,947
I have something to ask you.

979
01:15:37,783 --> 01:15:38,867
By any chance,

980
01:15:39,493 --> 01:15:42,538
do you know a boy named Jung Ki-ho?

981
01:15:59,721 --> 01:16:02,516
CASTAWAY DIVA

982
01:16:37,634 --> 01:16:40,512
Are you saying one of them is Ki-ho?

983
01:16:41,013 --> 01:16:42,556
I've regained my memory.

984
01:16:43,849 --> 01:16:44,891
We can protect her.

985
01:16:45,392 --> 01:16:48,353
A match between the legend,
Yoon Ran-joo, and Eun Mo-rae.

986
01:16:48,437 --> 01:16:49,938
Eun Mo-rae is

987
01:16:50,022 --> 01:16:54,276
the boar that found its way
onto the deserted island.

988
01:16:54,359 --> 01:16:55,819
I know she'll win.

989
01:16:55,902 --> 01:16:58,488
I prefer things to be black and white.

990
01:16:58,572 --> 01:17:00,824
Do you think it was that easy
for me to become a star?

991
01:17:01,325 --> 01:17:02,492
If we do that,

992
01:17:02,993 --> 01:17:04,828
our entire family will be destroyed.

993
01:17:09,333 --> 01:17:11,335
