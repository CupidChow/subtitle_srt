1
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:55,054
CASTAWAY DIVA

2
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:58,308
The present you must beat the past you,

3
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:02,062
and then, you'll enjoy another heyday.

4
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:04,689
Heyday Again is live.

5
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:06,691
Who is our contender this week?

6
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:08,902
She's Korea's top diva.

7
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:12,447
It's the star of the millennium,
Yoon Ran-joo!

8
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,365
To be honest, I'm not confident.

9
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:15,575
Back then…

10
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:19,954
I was so incredible.

11
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:25,460
She'll face the Ran-joo who everyone loved
from her incredible heyday.

12
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:29,005
The 28-year-old Ran-joo from 2008.

13
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:35,929
Against her dazzling 28-year-old self,
will the 42-year-old Ran-joo

14
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:37,931
come out victorious?

15
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:40,141
Watch the live broadcast on April 1.

16
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:43,478
Find out for yourself on Heyday Again.

17
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:53,113
Will this interview be aired
during the live broadcast?

18
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:55,365
Yes, it'll last
about three to four minutes.

19
00:01:55,907 --> 00:02:00,328
The color of these Shine Muscats is
the same as the one symbolizing Ran-joo.

20
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:03,081
Lemon green. Keep that in mind.

21
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:04,541
-Lemon green?
-Yes.

22
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:07,794
This is delicious.

23
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:08,878
Right?

24
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:11,589
Please take good care of Ran-joo.

25
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:15,385
Are you okay with the questions?

26
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:17,428
Yes, they're fine.

27
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:20,974
Can I add one more, though?

28
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:22,392
Yes, of course.

29
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:26,896
I want to find someone with this song.

30
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,690
He was my manager's childhood friend.

31
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:29,732
I know.

32
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,818
Isn't his name Jung Ki-ho?

33
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:33,027
So you know his name.

34
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:35,780
I'd like to talk about them
when introducing this song.

35
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:37,782
I want to help them meet again.

36
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:41,286
Are you sure it's okay to mention
something so private on TV?

37
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:42,954
They may not be up for it.

38
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:45,623
I am up for it!

39
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,125
I'd totally love that.

40
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,544
No, I'm talking about Mr. Jung.

41
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:53,965
Thank you for working late.

42
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:55,425
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

43
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:57,677
-Thank you.
-Thank you. Goodbye.

44
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,470
Thank you, everyone.

45
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:00,597
Thank you.

46
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,849
-Good work, everyone.
-Thank you.

47
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:04,100
Goodbye.

48
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:07,395
We'll need to stay in touch.
What should we do?

49
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:11,107
I'll come downstairs every day
and check with you.

50
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:14,235
I picked the prettiest
and biggest ones for you--

51
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,362
Our staff doesn't live here.

52
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,198
Are you going to visit
all of their houses?

53
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:20,825
Right.

54
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:23,328
Well…

55
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:26,706
You should get a phone.

56
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:30,835
Right. Yes, I should.

57
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:32,837
And a driver's license.

58
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:36,674
Right. That too.

59
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:42,889
Of course.

60
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:46,017
I'll buy a phone.

61
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,520
As for the driver's license,
I'll get that too.

62
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:52,607
Well…

63
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:57,528
Jeez. I know I look
a bit pathetic in your eyes.

64
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,323
I seem to be immature, lacking manners,

65
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:03,326
and complacent, right?

66
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,078
Very pathetic, actually.

67
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,289
Sir, all the equipment's been packed.

68
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:16,756
Thank you for your work.

69
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:29,394
Jeez.

70
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:32,355
He's so condescending.

71
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,107
He's the absolute worst.

72
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,025
And he's younger than me.

73
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,610
Unbelievable.

74
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:40,071
I'd love a phone and a driver's license.

75
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:41,364
But what can I do?

76
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:44,659
I have no money.

77
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:50,581
Money.

78
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:52,875
Money.

79
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:57,547
BROTHERS SALON

80
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:02,010
After you're done shampooing,
go have your dinner first.

81
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:03,803
There's a good hot pot place nearby.

82
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:07,390
I can't finish an entire hot pot alone.
Let's just order some tofu stew.

83
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:10,226
The entire salon will reek of it.
Let's just have gimbap.

84
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,477
Gimbap again?

85
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,730
I'll be pooping out gimbap
one of these days.

86
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:14,939
Honey.

87
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,526
Gosh, he's such a fool.

88
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:20,570
Goodness.

89
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:23,197
Ms. Song.

90
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,661
You said you were hiring.
Is this offer still valid?

91
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,371
Goodness.

92
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:33,583
Of course, it is!

93
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,460
Goodness.

94
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:38,087
Goodness. Then, can I…

95
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,756
Can I?

96
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:44,886
Hello, sir!

97
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:46,554
How are you?

98
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:48,181
Hey, Kang Woo-hak.

99
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,684
What were you covering this week again?

100
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:53,811
Residential noise complaints.

101
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:54,896
Right.

102
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:58,149
Focus on nighttime noises,
not construction or protests.

103
00:05:58,232 --> 00:05:59,859
-Got that?
-Yes, sir.

104
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:02,028
So have you had lunch yet?

105
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:03,988
Yes, I have.

106
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:05,990
Pho is on the menu today.

107
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,158
Enjoy.

108
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,328
Pho.

109
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:13,372
I don't feel like pho today.

110
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:35,103
Bo-geol, have you had lunch yet?
Want some gimbap?

111
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,396
Yes, Mok-ha.

112
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,482
It's a video of Ms. Yoon from 2008.

113
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:41,526
I'll send it to you once it's converted.

114
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:43,528
Your e-mail address…

115
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,991
You should create
an e-mail account. It's free.

116
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:51,536
Okay.

117
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:53,496
Let me know once you do.

118
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:55,998
Bye.

119
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:58,918
How inconsiderate.

120
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:00,920
That's not how I raised you.

121
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:03,422
You're still here? I had lunch already.

122
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:11,597
Have you created
an e-mail account recently?

123
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,017
You must verify yourself.

124
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,853
Choose a valid username.

125
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,896
Make a password
with at least eight characters

126
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,357
with symbols, numbers,
capital and lowercase letters.

127
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:24,068
Even I struggle with it.

128
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:27,113
She lived on a deserted island.
Imagine how hard it'd be for her.

129
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:29,907
People like you who only care
about their own convenience

130
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:32,702
are why people
feel left out in the digital age.

131
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:38,040
You little brat.

132
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:46,841
What's wrong with him?

133
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:51,179
BROTHERS SALON

134
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:07,361
Hello.

135
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:11,199
What are you doing here?

136
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:14,869
I got a job. I needed some money.

137
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:17,622
I'm moonlighting here
on top of being a manager.

138
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:19,248
That's great.

139
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,334
My parents can finally eat together now.

140
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:24,128
They always took turns eating,
because they had no employee.

141
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:25,671
Why are you here at this hour?

142
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:28,508
Here.

143
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,426
This is Yoon Ran-joo's video from 2008.

144
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,594
She'll be up against this.

145
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:34,055
This is why you came here?

146
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:36,265
I got a phone. You could've just called.

147
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:39,310
I stopped by on my way
for some home-cooked food.

148
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:41,437
I hate eating alone.

149
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:45,483
Jeez. Gimbap isn't home-cooked food.

150
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:57,245
Why do you think
Ki-ho hasn't reached out to me yet?

151
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:01,249
I shouldn't think this way,

152
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:05,795
but I can't help but think
that it's one of two reasons.

153
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:07,630
One of two?

154
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:11,968
Either he doesn't want to look for me,

155
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:14,262
or…

156
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,558
he's not alive.

157
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:20,476
What are you talking about?

158
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,103
You said that he was alive.

159
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:25,314
Then, does he not want to find me anymore?

160
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,233
Is that why he's not looking for me?

161
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:30,361
Jeez, that breaks my heart too.

162
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,825
Why only those two?
There could be another reason.

163
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,119
Another reason?

164
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,997
I'm not sure there is. What other reason?

165
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,584
I suffer from memory loss.

166
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:47,587
-What do you mean?
-I hurt my head in an accident.

167
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,047
So I don't remember anything
before high school.

168
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:51,924
Really?

169
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,801
Yeah. Look.

170
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:57,388
From here to here. It's my scar.

171
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:59,181
Goodness gracious.

172
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:01,809
Gosh.

173
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:04,562
When I woke up from surgery,

174
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:07,189
it felt like my life
began from high school.

175
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,234
Are you awake?

176
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:12,945
Do you recognize me?

177
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,614
-I didn't recognize her.
-Do you?

178
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,073
But she said she was my mom.

179
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,116
It's me, Mom.

180
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:19,577
I didn't recognize my dad either.

181
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:24,498
Then, I met Bo-geol
long after I was discharged.

182
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:26,083
He felt like a total stranger.

183
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,544
You don't have any memories at all?

184
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,212
Maybe if you look at old photos--

185
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:31,964
They said our house caught on fire.

186
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:34,008
And our photos were all burned up.

187
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:38,095
It's okay.

188
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:40,973
I recovered thanks to my family,
and it wasn't too bad.

189
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:45,186
It's just a shame
that I lost all of my childhood friends.

190
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,813
I'd love to find them, but I can't.

191
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:50,274
There's no way
since I don't even remember them.

192
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,194
That's true.

193
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:55,237
Let's say if I were Ki-ho,

194
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:58,240
I wouldn't be able to find you
since I don't remember you.

195
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:01,243
-What?
-I mean…

196
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,579
You asked me if there were other reasons.

197
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:04,664
This could be one.

198
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:07,833
He's alive and wants to find you,
but he lost his memory.

199
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:10,544
I see.

200
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,838
Who knows? Maybe Ki-ho could be like me.

201
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:15,758
Hey, your case isn't that common.

202
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:16,842
It is.

203
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,137
I know someone else like me.

204
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:22,973
Kang Jun-sang.

205
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:25,309
Kang Jun-sang? Who's that?

206
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:27,520
You should know him
since it aired in 2002.

207
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:29,313
It's Winter Sonata's main character.

208
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:30,481
Come on.

209
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:32,066
That's who you're talking about?

210
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:34,318
See? That's two already.

211
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:35,778
I'm sure there are more.

212
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:40,574
Don't let your assumptions make you sad.

213
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:41,826
We still don't know.

214
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:56,382
By the way,
about that term "eating alone"…

215
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:58,426
Is that when you eat by yourself?

216
00:11:58,843 --> 00:11:59,927
Yeah.

217
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:01,720
Is that new to you too?

218
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:06,809
-Did they not use that term 15 years ago?
-Of course not.

219
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:10,938
Given how they coined that term,
I guess many people these days eat alone.

220
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:12,148
You bet.

221
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,817
Eating, drinking, watching movies,
singing karaoke alone.

222
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,110
You do everything alone.

223
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,156
-Woo-hak.
-What?

224
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:25,744
Call me over anytime
you're about to eat alone.

225
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:28,747
You won't know where
or what I'll be eating.

226
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:31,542
None of that matters.

227
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:34,462
Just call me, and I'll be there.

228
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:40,050
Why? Because it's for free?

229
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:43,095
If anything, I hate eating alone the most.

230
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:47,808
I did that for 15 years.

231
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:59,612
I did all sorts of things,
because I hated eating alone.

232
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:06,619
Eat up.

233
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:08,996
I didn't prepare much though.

234
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,503
Goodness. Don't be ridiculous!

235
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,963
This is practically a feast!

236
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:27,264
Did you notice?

237
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,141
I just caught

238
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:32,853
a long-armed octopus
that's the size of a normal octopus.

239
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:33,938
Look.

240
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:36,106
Isn't this just gigantic?

241
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,318
Eat up, will you?

242
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:50,454
Hey, gull.

243
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:53,374
Hey, seagull.

244
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,042
Goodness.

245
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:56,126
Yes.

246
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:58,420
You have a good appetite.

247
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:00,339
Yes.

248
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:03,717
Come here, one bite at a time.

249
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:06,428
Let's have a meal together.

250
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,556
Don't you understand me?

251
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:23,362
I went so far as to eat with a seagull.

252
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,034
You're a good eater.

253
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,620
It's a huge blessing to have someone

254
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,914
you can eat with.

255
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:36,208
So call me over whenever you want.

256
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,544
I'll come and eat with you
even if I'm eating

257
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:40,462
at a buffet on Jeju Island.

258
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,217
Okay.

259
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:53,517
But how did you lure a seagull?

260
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:56,312
I lured it with some potatoes.

261
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,355
Seagulls eat potatoes?

262
00:14:58,439 --> 00:14:59,982
Yes, it loved it.

263
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:02,151
How did it eat such a hard vegetable?

264
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:03,527
With its beak, of course.

265
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:04,987
But it's hard to penetrate.

266
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,322
That gull--

267
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:07,990
-"Gull"?
-Seagull.

268
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:11,994
-Right.
-The gull couldn't recognize me at first.

269
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:13,078
Of course not.

270
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,208
RJ ENTERTAINMENT ARTISTS' SCHEDULES

271
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,379
YOON RAN-JOO
HEYDAY AGAIN LIVE BROADCAST

272
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:24,548
PARK YONG-GWAN (SEO MOK-HA)

273
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:33,432
Hello, sir.

274
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:35,392
About Ms. Yoon Ran-joo…

275
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:38,062
Is her appearance on Heyday Again set?

276
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:42,858
Yes, I confirmed it with Ms. Seo Mok-ha
and the program itself.

277
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,652
-When is the broadcast?
-This week.

278
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:47,738
Where are you now? Stop by my office.

279
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:59,249
Once I sell 20 million albums,

280
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,835
half of RJ Entertainment's shares
will become mine.

281
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:04,630
You barely sold 20,000 albums
in the past ten years.

282
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:05,923
So how will you do that?

283
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:08,008
Do you think I can't?

284
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,635
I beg to differ.

285
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:21,981
Could you tell Mr. Choi
from Sales to come by?

286
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:24,858
I also want to reach out to Heyday Again.

287
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:30,948
Let's see.

288
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:39,498
I will wait for you

289
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:40,958
No matter how long it takes

290
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,251
What's her deal?

291
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:43,961
She must be insane.

292
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:46,547
Goodness, your beauty is blinding.

293
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,883
You're so gorgeous.

294
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:51,802
My singing was crazier back then.

295
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:54,013
My singing overcame
the crappy sound system.

296
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:57,349
Goodness. You are beautiful and talented.

297
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,059
You have it all.

298
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,770
What do I do?

299
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,981
How can I possibly hold a candle to her?

300
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:05,357
Look at these neck wrinkles.

301
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:08,527
Goodness! You have no wrinkles.

302
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,571
You are absolutely stunning even now.

303
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:12,906
You look so beautiful
even without makeup--

304
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,033
I got them tattooed.

305
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:17,870
My brows, eyes, and lips are all tattooed.

306
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:20,456
-Tattoos?
-Right.

307
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,583
Who's the main producer of Heyday Again?

308
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:27,713
Right. Her name is Hong Yeon-kyung.

309
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,927
This won't be easy.

310
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,181
Why? Do you know her?

311
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:38,682
Of course, I know her.

312
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:40,350
We have quite the history.

313
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,186
I was vice-president of the RHC.

314
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:45,314
-RHC?
-"Ran-joo Haters' Club."

315
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:47,483
-There's such a thing?
-Yes, it's quite big.

316
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:50,152
The members became
executive producers or division heads.

317
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:53,947
Remember Seong-hwan the radio director?
He founded the club.

318
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,992
She must've been obnoxious
for that kind of club to form.

319
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,078
It's a long list.

320
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:02,081
She was so fussy during her prime.

321
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:04,875
-Her nickname was Canary Yoon.
-"Canary"?

322
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:07,920
You know, those birds
that are sensitive to poisonous gas.

323
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:13,634
Isn't this asbestos dust?
It's the most deadliest carcinogen.

324
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:16,053
Jeez, I'm leaving.

325
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:17,721
Call me once you clean this area.

326
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:19,014
What?

327
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:22,601
She'd cancel at the last minute
and blame it on dust or other substances.

328
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:29,024
Gosh, there are no windows around here.

329
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,861
Radon will build up
if this room isn't ventilated.

330
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:36,949
You're familiar with radon, right?
The silent killer?

331
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,785
She even pulled out the radon card.

332
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:42,955
You would've thought
she was Marie Curie or something.

333
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:45,999
But we had no choice
since she was so famous back then.

334
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,585
We had to book her
despite her extreme fussiness.

335
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,462
We had to spend more than our budget.

336
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:53,715
We bought an air purifier
and a humidifier.

337
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,343
We even broke down the walls
to build windows. Jeez.

338
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:58,178
I was a victim of her power trip.

339
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:00,597
Gosh, she was a headache.

340
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:02,349
Do you think she's still like that?

341
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:04,434
Of course not. She doesn't have a say.

342
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:08,355
She has less than a say.
She has a minus say.

343
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:11,316
The air in here
must've been bad back then.

344
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,278
Don't get me started.
There isn't enough time in the day.

345
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:16,113
You fools. During my time--

346
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:18,866
Did anyone ask her
to bring up the past? Did you?

347
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:22,619
You should know
that you have it easy nowadays.

348
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:27,166
Every time I blew my nose after work,
I'd have a bunch of black snot.

349
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,002
Thank you, Canary Yoon.

350
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:32,129
What? Why are you thanking her?

351
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:33,338
I bought that.

352
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,090
Only because Ms. Yoon told you to.

353
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,216
Right.

354
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:38,093
But…

355
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:40,762
I was a victim of her power trip.

356
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,599
Thank you for becoming a victim.

357
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,767
What do you take me--

358
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:46,935
Who is it?

359
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,688
What? Why would he call me?

360
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:55,235
Hello, President Lee.
This is Hong Yeon-kyung speaking.

361
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:57,821
Yes.

362
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,158
Yes, Ms. Yoon will be appearing today.

363
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:04,703
Sorry?

364
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,167
-Are you nervous?
-What?

365
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,337
Yes, a bit.

366
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:15,839
No, a lot.

367
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:19,176
I'm going to lie a lot today.

368
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,470
Although pathetic, I'll act confident.

369
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,096
I'll pretend to sing well.

370
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:26,767
I've withered,
but I'll act like a blooming flower,

371
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:30,270
because today is April Fools' Day.

372
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:32,940
I see.

373
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:40,489
So you do the same.
Boldly pretend like you're not nervous.

374
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:41,865
You can do that today.

375
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:46,828
Are you still nervous?

376
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:49,748
No.

377
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:51,583
You're a good liar.

378
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:03,178
-Excuse me.
-Yes, I'm Yoon Ran-joo.

379
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:06,473
Rumors of me being a divorcée
or a mistress are false. I'm clean.

380
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:08,850
I have no car for drunk driving
or money for drugs.

381
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,727
I'm not lying low. I didn't retire.

382
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:12,938
I'm finally back on TV,
and yes, I take the bus.

383
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:14,690
Thank you for your interest. Happy?

384
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:16,984
No, you're covering the information board,

385
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:19,736
and I was wondering if you could move.

386
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:22,239
I see.

387
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:24,574
Our bus is here. Let's go.

388
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,662
We'll be late to the studio.

389
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:35,711
Come in.

390
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:37,796
This way.

391
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:42,384
Goodness.

392
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,096
Gosh.

393
00:21:58,233 --> 00:21:59,484
Ran-joo!

394
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:04,031
I'm so irritated and sick of her.

395
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:07,367
Goodness! Look who this is!

396
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:08,744
Darling!

397
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:11,246
I missed you so much!

398
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,665
Me too! It's been ages!

399
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,667
I know. You look so gorgeous today.

400
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,294
Our staff was waiting for you.

401
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:18,378
They're so grateful.

402
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:19,921
What? For what?

403
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,506
What? Over there.

404
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,883
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

405
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:25,427
This is Ms. Yoon's treat.
Please take good care of her.

406
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,763
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

407
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:29,890
-You can do it.
-This is Ms. Yoon's treat.

408
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:31,141
What would you like?

409
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:32,559
MS. YOON'S TREAT

410
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:34,269
Gosh.

411
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,022
Please take good care of her.

412
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:38,732
Thank you.

413
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:42,694
I thought her agency had forgotten her.

414
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:43,904
I guess not.

415
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:45,072
You're right.

416
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:48,700
Yong-gwan, what are you doing here?

417
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:52,412
President Lee told me to support you
since you hadn't had a gig in a while.

418
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:53,663
Thank you.

419
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:55,123
Come on. Help me out here.

420
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:57,876
-Hello.
-Okay.

421
00:22:57,959 --> 00:22:59,669
-President Lee said that?
-Yes.

422
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:02,631
He wants me to make sure
everything pans out today.

423
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:04,966
Did he prepare all this too?

424
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,843
Yes, with his own money.

425
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:08,929
You should try one too.

426
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:11,098
There's quite a variety.

427
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:13,892
MS. YOON'S TREAT

428
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:15,352
What's up with President Lee?

429
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:17,229
Why is he suddenly sucking up to me?

430
00:23:18,396 --> 00:23:22,317
He must think he can win our hearts
with these little snacks.

431
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,070
I can totally see through him.

432
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:28,031
Goodness, Ran-joo.

433
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:30,534
Goodness, Ms. Cha.

434
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:41,920
Gosh, how did you get this outfit?

435
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:45,173
President Lee purchased it himself
after hearing about this show.

436
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:47,634
He spent his own money on it.

437
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:51,972
What year are you competing with again?

438
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,724
-It's 2008.
-Really?

439
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:58,562
Then, I'll turn you
into Ran-joo from 2007.

440
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:00,605
Did President Lee contact you too?

441
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:05,652
I said I couldn't make it since I had
a commercial to do, but he called me.

442
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:08,155
He begged me to show up

443
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:11,700
and give you a confidence boost
since you hadn't had a gig in a while.

444
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:32,220
WE SUPPORT YOON RAN-JOO'S NEW HEYDAY

445
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:47,152
President Lee is like a horse chestnut.

446
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:50,280
You know what they are, right?

447
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:54,201
They're pretty but poisonous.

448
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:59,998
Ran-joo, do you know what this is?

449
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:01,291
Isn't it a chestnut?

450
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:03,293
It's called a horse chestnut.

451
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:06,171
Goodness. This is how
a horse chestnut looks?

452
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:07,255
Yes.

453
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:10,175
It's poisonous, but it has
a pretty name in French.

454
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:11,885
It's poisonous? Why?

455
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:16,806
There was a horse chestnut tree
on the deserted island.

456
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:21,353
And these nuts look exactly
like regular chestnuts.

457
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:22,854
You're right.

458
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:26,274
I was sick of eating potatoes every day,

459
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,235
so I had these one day.

460
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:32,697
Goodness. I was vomiting and ran a fever.

461
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:34,616
I almost died.

462
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:36,201
Seriously?

463
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:41,122
They're plump
and look like delicious chestnuts.

464
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,291
That's how they lure us in.

465
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:48,463
You should never be fooled. Never.

466
00:25:58,765 --> 00:25:59,808
Get rid of this.

467
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,726
Yes, ma'am.

468
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:16,157
The rehearsal will be at 3:00 p.m. Yes.

469
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,286
I'm on my way down. Bye.

470
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:28,837
What's wrong?

471
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,715
Disappointed that I look better
in this jacket than you?

472
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:39,055
-Are you filming today?
-Yeah, the Yoon Ran-joo episode.

473
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:42,142
How's her condition?

474
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:43,643
Good. Why?

475
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:47,772
She said a cold affected her voice
at the Deodeok Festival.

476
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:50,150
I wondered if she was all better.

477
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:55,071
We're going to adjust
the sound during rehearsal.

478
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:56,865
Is this the order?

479
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:58,366
Yes, it is.

480
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,744
My throat isn't doing too well right now.

481
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:03,038
I think you should still test it out.

482
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:04,956
Why don't you speak with the producer?

483
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:08,460
But she's all washed up now.

484
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:10,962
Rumor has it
she's a drunk and a heavy smoker.

485
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,427
Yoon Ran-joo's incredible.

486
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:19,512
She sings even better than she used to.

487
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:25,226
I won't be sad anymore

488
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:31,775
My throat isn't doing too well today,

489
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:33,860
so I'll just do a mic test.

490
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:37,781
Please just check the volume.

491
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:41,201
I'll save my voice for the broadcast.

492
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:44,746
Ms. Yoon doesn't want
to rehearse because of her throat.

493
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:46,164
What should we do?

494
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:50,710
We've already tested the lights
and cameras, so let's skip it.

495
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:52,170
Okay. Mic test.

496
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:54,881
One, two, one, two, three, three.

497
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,551
Have you heard Mok-ha sing?

498
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:01,388
She's amazing.
Give it a listen, and you'll understand.

499
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:06,559
I will wait for you
No matter how long it takes

500
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:10,730
At the end of your long journey

501
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:13,358
I'll lend you my shoulder

502
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:17,737
Where's Seo Mok-ha?

503
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:21,950
-Did you check the numbered equipment?
-Yes.

504
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:24,661
-Then, what's left to check?
-It's on the other side.

505
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:26,079
-Let's go.
-Okay.

506
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:45,140
What are you doing?

507
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:49,894
Hello, sir.

508
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:52,397
I heard you got a phone. Save my number.

509
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:55,442
Yes, sir.

510
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,611
Save me under a nickname.

511
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:01,823
Fans and reporters nowadays
take photos of our screens too.

512
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:04,826
Only text things that will be okay
even if they're exposed

513
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:06,369
and make calls for the rest.

514
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:09,080
Yes, sir.

515
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:12,292
That's a very important tip.
Thank you, sir.

516
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:15,712
Are you singing again today?

517
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:20,341
Like last time?

518
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:26,556
No, Ran-joo's voice has gotten better.

519
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:29,309
Then, why didn't she sing
during her rehearsal?

520
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:33,229
She sang her best
even during dry runs in the past.

521
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,235
Are you sure her voice is back?

522
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:45,074
Yes, her voice is…

523
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:47,535
What are you doing here?

524
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,289
It's almost time for the live show.
Let's be on standby.

525
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:54,334
Okay. I'm sorry.

526
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:06,095
HEYDAY AGAIN WILL BEGIN SOON

527
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:11,226
Make sure the host
and Ms. Yoon are both on standby.

528
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:12,310
We have one minute.

529
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:49,138
Woo-hak, I got what we need.

530
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:50,598
We can report now.

531
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:51,850
Hold on.

532
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:53,977
Jeez, that brat.

533
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:57,981
The present you must beat the past you,

534
00:30:58,064 --> 00:31:01,317
and then, you'll enjoy another heyday.

535
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:04,571
Heyday Again is live.

536
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:08,116
HEYDAY AGAIN

537
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:15,123
Let us introduce this week's contender.

538
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:18,084
The top diva of the 20th century,

539
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:21,796
Yoon Ran-joo,
will be singing "That Night."

540
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,008
Let's begin
with the performance on the left.

541
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:37,186
So I'm still waiting for you

542
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:44,027
Like sand and sunlight

543
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:48,364
You escape through my fingers

544
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:53,745
Like the moment two clock hands meet

545
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:57,457
Our time together was too brief

546
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:02,837
Countless days and nights

547
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:05,715
You need to beat me at all costs.

548
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:09,052
That'll be the start of everything. Okay?

549
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:12,305
But I'm still waiting there

550
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:16,809
Ran-joo, if you win…

551
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:19,270
Don't worry. I'll remember to tell them.

552
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:24,067
I will wait for you
No matter how long it takes

553
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:28,613
At the end of your long journey

554
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:33,868
I'll lend you my shoulder to let you rest

555
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:36,913
And give you this song

556
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:40,291
So I'm still waiting for you

557
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:45,672
This time, let's listen
to the performance on the right.

558
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:54,305
My long night has passed

559
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:59,310
And morning has finally dawned

560
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:03,940
I wonder when you look at the sky

561
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:08,695
Do you ever think about me?

562
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:13,741
Countless days and nights

563
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:16,703
The sun rose and fell a thousand times

564
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:17,620
Three.

565
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:22,583
Cut. Yoon Ran-joo's still got it.

566
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:24,711
She must've quit drinking and smoking.

567
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:27,338
On screen text on standby.

568
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:32,468
I will wait for you
No matter how long it takes

569
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:36,431
At the end of your long journey

570
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:42,311
I'll lend you my shoulder to let you rest

571
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:45,023
And give you this song

572
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:48,735
So I'm still waiting for you

573
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:56,075
Thank you.

574
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,368
Viewers at home,

575
00:33:57,452 --> 00:34:03,875
which voice do you think
was Yoon Ran-joo's from her heyday?

576
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:07,420
Please send your texts to #2142.

577
00:34:07,503 --> 00:34:10,423
We will begin the nationwide voting.

578
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:14,218
Text "one" for the left stage

579
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:17,138
and "two" for the right stage.

580
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:22,060
Let's find out which voice
was Yoon Ran-joo's from her heyday.

581
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:25,605
Voting will begin now.

582
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:33,446
One of the two voices
was from a 2008 video.

583
00:34:33,529 --> 00:34:38,659
The other voice was
her singing the song live today.

584
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:40,078
Personally,

585
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:44,874
I don't think I can tell
the difference at all.

586
00:34:44,957 --> 00:34:47,668
Let's find out which performance

587
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:50,546
you chose as her voice from her heyday.

588
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:54,342
We will now reveal the voting results.

589
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:16,614
That's a huge gap.

590
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:19,700
The performance on the right
won by a landslide.

591
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:25,331
I wonder which era
this Yoon Ran-joo is from.

592
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:28,751
Is it 2008 or 2022?

593
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:33,089
Did the present Yoon Ran-joo
beat her past self?

594
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:35,591
We will now reveal the winner.

595
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:37,093
The winner is…

596
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:44,243
Like the countless stars in the sky

597
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:49,248
Countless days I wait for pass

598
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:54,378
Those days I've dreamed of

599
00:36:55,338 --> 00:37:00,885
When they finally come to me

600
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:13,481
I will wait for you
No matter how long it takes

601
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:18,110
At the end of your long journey

602
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:22,990
I'll lend you my shoulder to let you rest

603
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:26,327
And give you this song

604
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:30,539
So I'm still waiting for you

605
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:40,091
So I'm still waiting for you

606
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:56,649
-Yoon Ran-joo!
-Yoon Ran-joo!

607
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:57,942
Congratulations.

608
00:37:58,025 --> 00:37:59,110
Yoon Ran-joo!

609
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:05,616
Yoon Ran-joo from 2022
defeated her past self from 2008.

610
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:10,997
-Yoon Ran-joo!
-Yoon Ran-joo!

611
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:14,000
You've achieved your second heyday

612
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:19,422
with the largest voting margin
ever on our show.

613
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:21,173
Did you expect this?

614
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:23,759
No, I didn't--

615
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:26,387
No, it was unexpected.

616
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:29,015
Thank you for your votes, everyone.

617
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,644
All right, then.

618
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,730
Please tell us how you feel.

619
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:40,568
I have so many people to thank.

620
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:44,113
First of all,
I'd like to thank myself from 2008

621
00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:48,200
for performing on this stage with me.

622
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:55,041
I'd also like to thank
an individual who inspired me

623
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:56,500
to write this song.

624
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:59,587
Someone who inspired you?

625
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,547
Could it have been your first love?

626
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:05,926
No. He's a friend of my fan's.

627
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:12,016
I'd like to tell him something
in case he's watching.

628
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:16,395
I'd like him to know that the friend
he's looking for is doing well.

629
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:21,734
That friend is waiting,
so I hope they'll meet one day.

630
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:23,778
This is what I'd like to say.

631
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:30,785
All right. So Yoon Ran-joo
from 2022 finally beat herself from 2008.

632
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:33,829
Please give her
a round of applause once again.

633
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:34,997
Thank you.

634
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,085
That was great.

635
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:41,337
-Hello. You were incredible.
-Hello.

636
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,421
Good work.

637
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:52,098
Mok-ha, go to the restroom right now.

638
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:54,475
What? The restroom?

639
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:59,230
It's the best place to find out
how the show went immediately after.

640
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:06,278
-Today's episode was amazing.
-Seriously.

641
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:07,530
Did you see?

642
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:10,199
They're blowing up our phones.

643
00:40:10,282 --> 00:40:11,784
They want Yoon Ran-joo's number.

644
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:13,702
How was the real-time viewer rating?

645
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:16,664
It went all the way up to 40%,
so let's find out tomorrow.

646
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:20,418
Yoon Ran-joo may be obnoxious,
petty, and annoying, but I admit.

647
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:21,919
She was really good.

648
00:40:22,002 --> 00:40:25,089
If I were to exaggerate,
she's a million times better now.

649
00:40:25,172 --> 00:40:26,966
We've never had such a big voting gap.

650
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:29,051
I know. I got goosebumps.

651
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:31,387
I almost forgot to say "Cut."

652
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:33,180
-Really?
-I'm telling you.

653
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:36,392
-Come on.
-Seriously.

654
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:38,853
I can't believe you
of all people would do that.

655
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:41,188
I saw the broadcast.
You guys had an interview.

656
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,649
-How about some beer today?
-I'm down.

657
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:45,192
-Is it your treat?
-You bet.

658
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:47,403
Do you think Ki-ho watched it too?

659
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:49,989
-Let's have chicken.
-Chicken?

660
00:40:58,497 --> 00:40:59,915
DO YOU THINK KI-HO WATCHED IT TOO?

661
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:00,958
PROBABLY

662
00:41:48,547 --> 00:41:50,591
Yes. Of course, he did.

663
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:56,180
Ki-ho, did you really see it?

664
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:58,349
Did you hear it?

665
00:42:13,822 --> 00:42:15,199
It was my voice.

666
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:35,010
HEYDAY AGAIN

667
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:42,851
Like the countless stars in the sky

668
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:47,481
Countless days I wait for pass

669
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:53,195
Those days I've dreamed of

670
00:42:53,779 --> 00:43:00,327
When they finally come to me

671
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:12,172
I will wait for you
No matter how long it takes

672
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:16,594
At the end of your long journey

673
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:21,932
I'll lend you my shoulder to let you rest

674
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:25,394
And give you this song

675
00:43:25,477 --> 00:43:28,856
So I'm still waiting for you

676
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:38,699
So I'm still waiting for you

677
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:53,005
Where's Ms. Yoon?

678
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:58,510
She's changing.

679
00:43:58,594 --> 00:44:02,389
Then, please tell her to follow
the script for our next live show.

680
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:04,350
I apologize.

681
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:08,479
I begged her to say that on camera.

682
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:10,314
Are you that desperate to find him?

683
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:12,191
Sorry?

684
00:44:12,274 --> 00:44:14,234
It's been 15 years now.

685
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:17,071
He's probably changed.

686
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:20,074
Maybe he became a criminal
and couldn't reach out to you.

687
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:23,744
Do you know Ki-ho?

688
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:25,579
No.

689
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:27,373
I do.

690
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:28,457
So…

691
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:31,877
please don't say such things if you don't.

692
00:44:38,258 --> 00:44:41,011
Their highest ratings? Seriously?

693
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:45,599
Well, I mean…

694
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:48,143
I didn't do much.

695
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:53,190
You deserve the credit
for preparing the show. I just showed up.

696
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:56,735
My earrings are really sold out?

697
00:44:57,569 --> 00:44:58,821
Unbelievable!

698
00:44:58,904 --> 00:45:03,242
You must've gotten
a really pretty shot of them, Ms. Hong.

699
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:08,539
This is all thanks to you. Thank you.

700
00:45:08,622 --> 00:45:10,374
All right. See you next week.

701
00:45:14,169 --> 00:45:15,504
Thanks to her, my foot.

702
00:45:15,587 --> 00:45:17,047
This is all

703
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:18,674
-thanks to us!
-Thanks to us!

704
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:23,512
EMPEROR OF SUGAR

705
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:31,854
Don't you have to pick that up?

706
00:45:33,021 --> 00:45:34,606
No, I don't have to.

707
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:37,359
Jeez.

708
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:39,069
Just for being on that show

709
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:41,864
all kinds of pathetic losers
are reaching out to me.

710
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:46,285
-Were a lot of articles written about us?
-Do you want to see?

711
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:49,705
"Yoon Ran-joo."

712
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:54,251
There are too many,
so I can't read all of them.

713
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:57,754
I'll just read the headlines for you.

714
00:45:58,547 --> 00:46:02,509
"Yoon Ran-joo, The Queen Lives Forever."

715
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:04,136
"Long live the queen!"

716
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:11,351
There are two women in this country
who fit the term "queen."

717
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:13,562
Kim Yu-na and…

718
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:15,898
me.

719
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:22,321
Right. I loved the title
of that other article too.

720
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:27,784
"She Proves Herself To Be
In A Class of Her Own Once Again."

721
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:32,706
"Yoon Ran-joo Is the Same As Ever."

722
00:46:32,789 --> 00:46:35,709
"Yoon Ran-joo Is the Same As Ever."

723
00:46:35,792 --> 00:46:38,837
"Why Had We Forgotten About Her?"

724
00:46:40,797 --> 00:46:45,802
"In 2022, Yoon Ran-joo Vigorously Begins…"

725
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:48,472
"Her Next Heyday."

726
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:51,892
You know what?

727
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:55,854
My favorite article of all was…

728
00:46:59,024 --> 00:47:00,150
Click on this one.

729
00:47:00,817 --> 00:47:01,777
Okay.

730
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:06,281
"The queen has returned."

731
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:11,745
"No, the queen
had always been shining on her throne."

732
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:16,542
"We didn't notice
because her radiance was too dazzling."

733
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:25,467
That's right.

734
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:29,596
That was how I was born again.

735
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:44,861
Ran-joo, are you crying?

736
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:53,537
Ran-joo.

737
00:48:02,337 --> 00:48:03,380
Ran-joo.

738
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:05,716
The war has begun.

739
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:08,468
And the wind is on our side.

740
00:48:09,261 --> 00:48:13,056
At this rate, selling 20 million albums
will be a walk in the park.

741
00:48:16,476 --> 00:48:20,063
War and wind?

742
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:23,900
Who do you think you are?
Admiral Yi Sun-sin?

743
00:48:33,285 --> 00:48:34,286
She cried?

744
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:36,997
The ratings were superb.
All the articles complimented her.

745
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,165
So why would she cry?

746
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:41,335
I don't know.
She cried for a while, then left.

747
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:42,919
Maybe they were tears of joy.

748
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:44,713
-That could happen.
-Woo-hak!

749
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:47,341
Someone sent you flowers.

750
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:49,009
-Flowers?
-Yeah.

751
00:48:49,676 --> 00:48:51,303
Coming. Hold on.

752
00:48:55,724 --> 00:48:56,725
Thank you.

753
00:48:57,517 --> 00:48:59,311
-Do you have good news?
-Not really.

754
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:03,357
I'm back. I don't know why
anyone would send me flowers.

755
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,192
Is it your birthday today?

756
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:08,779
No, but there's a card inside.

757
00:49:08,862 --> 00:49:10,072
Hold on.

758
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:22,751
Who sent it?

759
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:27,547
Woo-hak.

760
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:31,259
These flowers…

761
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:36,556
are for you.

762
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:40,185
TELL MOK-HA I'LL BE WAITING
THERE AT 8 P.M. TODAY - JUNG KI-HO

763
00:51:02,517 --> 00:51:04,352
You were right.

764
00:51:05,103 --> 00:51:09,149
These are tears of joy.

765
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:16,239
The chief even gave us
the corporate credit card.

766
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:17,491
I know.

767
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:21,369
Don't we deserve some top-notch beef
on a day like this?

768
00:51:21,453 --> 00:51:23,371
You don't know anything.

769
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:27,000
It's an unspoken rule to have
cafeteria food when the ratings are high.

770
00:51:27,083 --> 00:51:29,753
Look at who this is.

771
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:32,923
It's the Heyday Again team
who helps keep YGN afloat.

772
00:51:33,548 --> 00:51:34,883
You can go first.

773
00:51:34,966 --> 00:51:35,967
Excuse me.

774
00:51:36,051 --> 00:51:37,219
Make way.

775
00:51:37,302 --> 00:51:39,638
You're fully booked
for next week's commercials?

776
00:51:39,721 --> 00:51:42,140
Even the three-minute commercials
are booked.

777
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:44,893
Looking good, Ms. Hong.

778
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:46,645
How was Yoon Ran-joo?

779
00:51:46,728 --> 00:51:49,064
Tell us how it went
at our next RHC gathering.

780
00:51:49,147 --> 00:51:50,398
You haven't heard?

781
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:52,275
I'm her fan now.

782
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:54,277
I love her so much.

783
00:51:55,654 --> 00:51:56,780
I'll have that.

784
00:51:56,863 --> 00:51:59,783
Viewer ratings can sure change a person.

785
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:27,352
You may not believe me,
but I want to be alone right now.

786
00:52:28,144 --> 00:52:29,521
Why? You hate eating alone.

787
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:33,233
Is something up?

788
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:37,195
Do you know why I was intrigued by Ki-ho?

789
00:52:38,071 --> 00:52:39,656
Because he was just like me.

790
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:42,284
He was firm and wise.

791
00:52:43,785 --> 00:52:46,162
He listened to Mok-ha
and supported her dream.

792
00:52:46,746 --> 00:52:49,374
He was selfless, and…

793
00:52:50,625 --> 00:52:51,751
Seo Mok-ha.

794
00:52:53,211 --> 00:52:55,839
I understood why he wanted to protect her.

795
00:52:56,965 --> 00:52:58,300
He felt like someone familiar.

796
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:00,510
He was just like me.

797
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:02,262
How so?

798
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:04,347
He's a completely different individual.

799
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:07,517
You're right. He is.

800
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:08,643
He isn't me.

801
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:11,354
What?

802
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:14,733
He sent Mok-ha a bouquet of flowers today.

803
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:19,696
What did you just say?

804
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:25,410
Hey.

805
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:47,849
This stop is Seoul Station
Bus Transfer Center.

806
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:50,185
Next stop is Sungnyemun.

807
00:54:36,189 --> 00:54:37,691
You didn't change your passcode.

808
00:54:41,486 --> 00:54:43,488
And the treats are where they always were.

809
00:54:49,244 --> 00:54:50,829
There was no need to change them.

810
00:54:50,912 --> 00:54:51,913
You're right.

811
00:54:51,997 --> 00:54:57,585
I know very well
that you only do things for a reason.

812
00:55:06,636 --> 00:55:07,679
Gosh, that's noisy.

813
00:55:07,762 --> 00:55:10,432
It sounds like a tank.
Let's take it down a notch.

814
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:13,560
Noise is our theme, so we can't reduce it.

815
00:55:13,643 --> 00:55:14,644
Go on.

816
00:55:17,731 --> 00:55:19,524
How can anyone live there?

817
00:55:19,607 --> 00:55:22,360
-They can't even hear their babies crying.
-I know.

818
00:55:24,029 --> 00:55:25,488
Where the hell is he?

819
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:34,831
Hold on.

820
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:37,959
Jung Ki-ho!

821
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:39,753
Hey!

822
00:55:40,336 --> 00:55:41,504
Are you okay?

823
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:43,298
Reporter Kang!

824
00:55:43,798 --> 00:55:45,175
Wake up.

825
00:55:47,343 --> 00:55:48,344
Open up.

826
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:52,390
Open this now.

827
00:55:56,436 --> 00:55:57,645
Father.

828
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:04,444
Hey, are you okay?

829
00:56:04,944 --> 00:56:05,945
Sorry?

830
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:07,530
Yes.

831
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:09,532
What happened?
I almost called an ambulance.

832
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:10,742
You startled me.

833
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:14,621
-It's okay. I was just a bit dizzy.
-What's up with you?

834
00:56:14,704 --> 00:56:16,581
Get up. Let's go to the hospital.

835
00:56:16,664 --> 00:56:17,707
No, it's okay.

836
00:56:18,291 --> 00:56:19,918
I need to go to the restroom.

837
00:56:20,001 --> 00:56:21,669
Are you really okay?

838
00:56:38,478 --> 00:56:39,562
What's going on?

839
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:43,691
What was all that?

840
00:56:52,367 --> 00:56:53,535
Who am I?

841
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:13,680
Who in the world was he?

842
00:57:16,182 --> 00:57:17,225
Woo-hak!

843
00:57:17,725 --> 00:57:19,519
Someone sent you flowers.

844
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:22,355
Reporter Kang Woo-hak?

845
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:33,867

THERE AT 8 P.M. TODAY - JUNG KI-HO

846
00:57:34,576 --> 00:57:35,743
No.

847
00:57:35,827 --> 00:57:37,036
No, Mok-ha.

848
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,204
Mok-ha.

849
00:57:43,918 --> 00:57:45,378
Your call can't be connected.

850
00:57:46,379 --> 00:57:49,090
SEO MOK-HA

851
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:55,138
Come on.

852
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:17,994
The PR Team must've worked hard.

853
00:58:18,703 --> 00:58:20,538
The press release was excellent.

854
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:22,916
And they picked a good photo of me.

855
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:26,169
I saw you on the show.

856
00:58:27,086 --> 00:58:28,129
You haven't changed.

857
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:32,634
What was your reason?

858
00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:38,848
You prepared snacks, called Ms. Cha,
and even made a press release.

859
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:43,645
You didn't support me this much
during my prime.

860
00:58:44,229 --> 00:58:46,022
I can normally see your motives,

861
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:49,275
but not this time.

862
00:58:51,903 --> 00:58:53,488
Do you have to know?

863
00:58:55,448 --> 00:58:57,283
Can't you just appreciate my kindness?

864
00:58:59,827 --> 00:59:00,870
It bothers me.

865
00:59:02,455 --> 00:59:03,456
It makes me uneasy.

866
00:59:06,876 --> 00:59:07,919
I felt bad.

867
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:17,804
I felt guilty.

868
00:59:24,435 --> 00:59:26,396
It's getting late. I'll drive you home.

869
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:39,492
You know what, Ran-joo?

870
00:59:39,617 --> 00:59:42,078
I actually ate these horse chestnuts

871
00:59:43,204 --> 00:59:46,874
several times afterward.

872
00:59:46,958 --> 00:59:49,335
Why? Because you mistook them
for chestnuts?

873
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:51,421
No, because I was hungry.

874
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:56,759
The typhoon had destroyed
all the potatoes.

875
00:59:56,843 --> 00:59:58,928
I was on the verge of starvation

876
01:00:00,513 --> 01:00:02,307
and went totally insane.

877
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:07,645
I knew they weren't regular chestnuts.

878
01:00:31,753 --> 01:00:34,547
"These are chestnuts."

879
01:00:35,214 --> 01:00:36,841
I ended up believing that.

880
01:00:51,522 --> 01:00:53,483
CULTURE STATION SEOUL 284

881
01:00:56,611 --> 01:00:58,446
When you're very desperate,

882
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:04,327
you become a total fool.

883
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:20,551
Ran-joo.

884
01:01:22,637 --> 01:01:24,263
Your songs won't top the charts.

885
01:01:25,306 --> 01:01:29,560
I told the Sales Team
to recall all of your albums

886
01:01:29,644 --> 01:01:30,978
both online and offline.

887
01:01:31,979 --> 01:01:35,233
No one can purchase
or sell your albums now.

888
01:01:35,817 --> 01:01:37,652
You could appear on TV all you want.

889
01:01:38,277 --> 01:01:41,155
And you still won't sell
20 million albums.

890
01:01:50,331 --> 01:01:52,166
Is that why…

891
01:01:54,752 --> 01:01:55,795
That's why…

892
01:01:58,423 --> 01:01:59,716
I felt bad.

893
01:02:02,093 --> 01:02:03,219
I truly mean that.

894
01:02:19,777 --> 01:02:21,487
You're so heartless.

895
01:03:58,334 --> 01:03:59,710
Are you okay, sir?

896
01:04:54,557 --> 01:04:55,641
Ki-ho.

897
01:05:07,612 --> 01:05:11,699
You're Ki-ho, right?

898
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:42,396
CASTAWAY DIVA

899
01:06:13,052 --> 01:06:14,053
You.

900
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:16,347
-You know, don't you?
-Ki-ho!

901
01:06:16,430 --> 01:06:19,225
Is Ki-ho the only thing
you and Woo-hak ever think about?

902
01:06:19,308 --> 01:06:21,227
But that's how I am.

903
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:23,521
I wonder if Ki-ho's safe.

904
01:06:23,604 --> 01:06:25,231
That's all I ever think about!

905
01:06:25,314 --> 01:06:26,399
Did you know?

906
01:06:26,482 --> 01:06:27,650
Because of you, why do I--

907
01:06:28,734 --> 01:06:30,528
You're hurt
because she took it out on you.

908
01:06:31,362 --> 01:06:34,323
She was surrounded by enemies.

909
01:06:34,407 --> 01:06:36,033
Who's cowardly and shameless now?

910
01:06:36,117 --> 01:06:40,079
I'll be your voice and armor.

911
01:06:40,162 --> 01:06:42,373
What if what happened today
repeats itself?

912
01:06:42,456 --> 01:06:44,792
She'll be protected. By us.

913
01:06:48,754 --> 01:06:50,756
