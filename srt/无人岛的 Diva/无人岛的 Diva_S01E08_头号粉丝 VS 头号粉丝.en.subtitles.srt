00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:55,054
CASTAWAY DIVA

2
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,436
EPISODE 8

3
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:04,564
Your call cannot be connected.

4
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,776
-Is she not picking up?
-No.

5
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:09,736
She must've turned off her phone.

6
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:11,237
Nothing after Hamchang Station?

7
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:13,948
No. That was the last place
she was spotted.

8
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:15,241
How far is it from here?

9
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:17,786
It's about two hours away.

10
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:23,958
Don't speed.

11
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:26,795
Going faster won't help.
We'll just waste fuel.

12
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:29,130
I know.

13
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:31,591
Talk to me while we're on our way.

14
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:32,509
About what?

15
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:35,011
My memory isn't fully back.
There are still gaps.

16
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:37,514
So help me fill them in.

17
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:43,102
Which parts do you not remember?

18
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,066
The day I got hurt.

19
00:01:49,108 --> 00:01:50,318
Let's start from there.

20
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,115
That day…

21
00:01:57,283 --> 00:02:00,662
You hurt your head pretty badly
while protecting me from our father.

22
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:02,455
Bong-wan!

23
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:09,379
You were unconscious
for a while even after surgery.

24
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:12,966
Meanwhile,

25
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:16,094
our father was assigned
to work on Chunsam Island.

26
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:22,600
He decided to go there with just me.

27
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:24,769
Why just you two?

28
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:27,188
There weren't any big hospitals
on that island.

29
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:31,484
Mom said she'd come too
once you regained consciousness.

30
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:33,653
Ki-ho.

31
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:37,031
For the time being,
don't provoke your father.

32
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:38,533
Do as he says.

33
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:40,493
And then,

34
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:42,412
once spring comes,

35
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:44,789
come to me without letting him know.

36
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:50,003
Once Chae-ho wakes up,

37
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,422
I'll be in hiding from your father.

38
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,308
What if we get caught again?

39
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,144
What if someone gets hurt again?

40
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:07,228
Don't worry.

41
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:10,440
He'll never be able to find us this time.

42
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:13,276
I'm going to change our names
and phone numbers.

43
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:15,528
So come without letting him know.

44
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:17,697
Don't let anyone know.

45
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:19,532
Do it in secret.

46
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:20,825
But if you change everything,

47
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:23,411
how am I supposed to find you?

48
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:26,789
Over there.

49
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:31,544
On the back of that mailbox, I'll write

50
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,004
the address of where to go.

51
00:03:38,217 --> 00:03:39,677
You have to come

52
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:41,930
without him knowing.

53
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:44,349
Okay?

54
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,940
She told me to come in the spring,

55
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,484
but I kept getting caught by our father.

56
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:07,747
After failing to run away with Mok-ha…

57
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:12,126
I finally managed to escape
after the summer.

58
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:20,218
DOLLARBIRD CHICKEN
143-11, HYOMIN-DONG, JEONGIN

59
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:27,100
DOLLARBIRD CHICKEN

60
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:51,541
Are you Jung Ki-ho?

61
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,512
Ki-ho!

62
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:06,097
Ki-ho!

63
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:10,184
You did well!

64
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:12,895
Good job.

65
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:16,107
This time,

66
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,151
Mom hid herself really well.

67
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:21,779
She changed her name, her phone number,

68
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,448
and even her address.

69
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:26,993
I asked her how she did it,

70
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,455
and she said an angel had helped her.

71
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,253
Then, it's everything as you remember.

72
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:41,340
Chae-ho doesn't remember
anything from the past.

73
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:44,927
So let's make new memories for him.

74
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:47,930
Good ones, okay?

75
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:54,979
Ta-da!

76
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,023
Hey, you're pretty handsome.

77
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:59,108
Father, is he really Bo-geol?

78
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,109
My younger brother?

79
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,278
What do you think? Don't we look so alike?

80
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:04,322
-Look at our eyes.
-I don't think so.

81
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:06,741
I had no idea and was all smiles.

82
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:10,912
You didn't remember anything,
so you were an entirely different person.

83
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:14,248
You smiled a lot and became talkative.

84
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:15,416
Don't we look alike?

85
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,001
Bo-geol, pour the water.

86
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:18,753
Okay. Is this much enough?

87
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:20,338
No, a bit more.

88
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:22,757
Dad, are you okay?

89
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:24,926
Mok-ha once said

90
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:27,929
that she wanted to spend
just one day in peace

91
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:30,139
-away from her father.
-Let's not camp anymore.

92
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,307
Here.

93
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,017
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

94
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:34,769
After spending a day like that,

95
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:36,479
it felt nice.

96
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:41,317
It felt like we were
on a picnic every day.

97
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:46,823
No!

98
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,493
Oh, no!

99
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:53,871
-Watch out!
-Help me, Woo-hak!

100
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:55,998
-Grab it, Woo-hak!
-Hold on tight!

101
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:57,625
I loved it so much…

102
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:00,962
that I felt sorry.

103
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:05,133
You felt sorry?

104
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:06,717
To who?

105
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:09,595
Mok-ha.

106
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:15,101
I wanted her to have
this kind of life too.

107
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,149
So I wanted to find her even more.

108
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:22,483
So that I could show her.

109
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:31,617
But how could you wait for 15 years
without knowing if she was alive?

110
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:36,873
You're incredible.

111
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:41,127
Mok-ha survived
on that island for 15 years.

112
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:43,588
Waiting for her was nothing.

113
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,007
I wonder

114
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:48,342
what this man said to her.

115
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:51,429
He probably asked her where we were,

116
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:53,181
and she probably said she didn't know.

117
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,309
That's why she disappeared?

118
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:58,853
So she could protect us.

119
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:11,449
HAMCHANG STATION

120
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:19,373
Let's split up and call if we find her.

121
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,375
What will you say to her?

122
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:23,669
-I'll say we should go home.
-I won't say that.

123
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:28,090
I'm going to tell her to hide even better.

124
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,425
-Woo-hak.
-I'll say that I'm sorry

125
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30,968
but she should give up her dream.

126
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:35,389
For our family's sake, I'll ask her
to lie low so that man doesn't find her.

127
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,267
Just stay here. I'll look for her.

128
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:46,692
Mok-ha!

129
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:50,446
Seo Mok-ha!

130
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:54,951
Hey.

131
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,079
How long will it take?

132
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,039
Mok-ha.

133
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:02,083
I'm sorry.

134
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,167
What are you doing?

135
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:08,756
DAMCHEON RESTAURANT

136
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:22,478
Mok-ha!

137
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:26,023
Seo Mok-ha!

138
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:52,466
Hey, look.

139
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:57,430
Don't be alarmed when you hear this.

140
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,601
After the show yesterday…

141
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,022
Mr. Jung came to see me.

142
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,482
I know.

143
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:10,484
What?

144
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:13,321
That's it?

145
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:15,031
You told me not to be alarmed.

146
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,825
It looks like

147
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:19,952
your father won't give up until he finds

148
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,579
all of your family members.

149
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:25,416
Is that why you wanted to give up
your dream and disappear? To protect us?

150
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:27,668
That's not what's important right now!

151
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:29,712
If lying low is
the only way to protect us,

152
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,505
are you going to hide forever?

153
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,424
Yes. Of course.

154
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:35,926
It'd be a cakewalk.

155
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,304
I survived alone on a island for 15 years.

156
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:40,806
Hiding's easy. It'd be nothing.

157
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:45,686
Woo-hak.

158
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:46,771
Woo-hak.

159
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:48,105
Mok-ha, I'm sorry but--

160
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:50,107
-Please, Woo-hak.
-I'm sorry but…

161
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,866
Hey, Seo Mok-ha.

162
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:00,451
You're not supposed to say that.

163
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:03,120
You should say,
"That's your problem, not mine."

164
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:05,247
"I'll go my way no matter what you do."

165
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:06,749
That's what you should say.

166
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,669
How could I say that?
Would you say that if you were me?

167
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:11,295
Yes, I'd totally say that.

168
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,506
Didn't you know? I'm extremely selfish.

169
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:15,633
I'd sacrifice others for my own good.

170
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:16,842
And it's not just me.

171
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,928
Everyone is like that. But you…

172
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:21,764
Why do you…

173
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:32,817
If you act like this,
I can't say what I need to say.

174
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:36,487
What do you need to say? Say it now.

175
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:39,115
-That's enough.
-Mok-ha, you…

176
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,742
You…

177
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:43,911
I'm sorry but you…

178
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,126
Did you get that?

179
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:35,796
You're separate from our family.

180
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,881
Don't turn us

181
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:39,842
into people who weigh you down.

182
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:48,767
If you feel that bad,

183
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:52,104
give us money.

184
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,189
Money?

185
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:57,776
Will money fix everything?

186
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,487
It's better than not having any.

187
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,572
How much do you need?

188
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:04,617
I'd say…

189
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,703
about 3.2 billion won.

190
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:10,915
When do you need it by?

191
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:13,459
Not right away.

192
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:16,504
Maybe in ten years?

193
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:20,925
What's this?

194
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,969
Do you know who Michael Jordan is?

195
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:25,596
Of course, I do.

196
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:27,473
He was a basketball player.

197
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:29,642
They say his first autograph

198
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:32,144
was auctioned for 3.2 billion won.

199
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,480
Who knows?

200
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:36,857
Yours could be worth
something too one day.

201
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:39,818
Sign it for me.

202
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:42,738
I can't believe you.

203
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:45,199
How can you joke around
at a time like this?

204
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:47,368
I'm not joking though.

205
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:52,289
If you want to help us, become famous.

206
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:53,374
Don't hide.

207
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:55,626
Instead of a so-so singer,

208
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:59,046
become an incredibly famous one.

209
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:02,841
Good luck on the audition.

210
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:06,178
I hope you become a singer.

211
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,353
And not just any singer.

212
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:16,564
But one whose songs are played everywhere,

213
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:18,857
like on TV, in the streets,
and in restaurants.

214
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:21,443
A singer whose first autograph
is put up for auction

215
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:24,697
and whose songs change the world.

216
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:26,949
That kind of singer.

217
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:29,785
If you become that famous,

218
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,495
he won't be able to do anything.

219
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:35,708
So…

220
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,085
sign this for me.

221
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,186
What should I write?

222
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,147
Write…

223
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:00,941
what you want to say right now.

224
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:32,139
In a moment, turn left.

225
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:35,059
What? We have to stay
on this road for Seoul.

226
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:37,353
Woo-hak, what did you set
as the destination?

227
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:38,896
Today is Saturday.

228
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:41,190
And tomorrow is Sunday.

229
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:45,736
-Starting Monday, it'll be a war.
-What are you talking about?

230
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:47,154
The weather's great today.

231
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:48,781
What?

232
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:50,616
The view's nice too.

233
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,285
It's a great day for a picnic.

234
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:47,840
Hi!

235
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:50,175
How did you know we were here?

236
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:51,427
Surprise.

237
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,095
We stuck trackers on you.

238
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:56,265
Woo-hak told us the location.

239
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:57,850
You said you wanted to go camping.

240
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:02,354
You wanted to show Mok-ha.

241
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:04,314
Goodness, let me.

242
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:05,399
Sure.

243
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:07,776
This place hasn't changed one bit.

244
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,362
Isn't it beautiful here?

245
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:11,447
It is.

246
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:14,616
Let's unload the gear.

247
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,035
We brought tons of stuff.

248
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:16,994
All right.

249
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:18,370
What about our clothes?

250
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:19,455
-What?
-Clothes.

251
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,166
All right.

252
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,084
-Put it in.
-Okay.

253
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:26,295
Okay.

254
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:28,047
Bo-geol, is this high enough?

255
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:34,595
-Mok-ha.
-Yeah?

256
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:35,929
-Come over here.
-Okay.

257
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:44,646
-Do these light up?
-Yes.

258
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,398
-Do we hang these up?
-Yes.

259
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:50,861
No, this.

260
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:53,697
Hang them over here.

261
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:00,954
-All set?
-Yeah.

262
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,918
I bet they'll look super pretty.

263
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:08,962
There's a few more.

264
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:10,047
Okay.

265
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:22,684
Really? I bet it's still hot.

266
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,770
-I don't have one.
-It's really good.

267
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,106
The fire isn't that strong.

268
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:29,858
Loser washes the dishes.
Rock, paper, scissors!

269
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:32,319
-Rock, paper, scissors!
-Rock, paper, scissors!

270
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,738
-Rock, paper, scissors!
-Rock, paper, scissors!

271
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,117
Aren't you a bit too happy?

272
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,577
She's right. You're so mean.

273
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:41,995
-You can rest.
-No, I can't…

274
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,212
Ki-ho, can you pass me

275
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:51,338
that lid over there?

276
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:55,509
-This?
-Yeah.

277
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:56,677
Attention.

278
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:00,848
Time out.

279
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:02,683
Let's clear up some stuff.

280
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,354
"Clear up some stuff"?

281
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:08,397
What do you mean?

282
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,775
He's Kang Bo-geol, and I'm Kang Woo-hak.

283
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:14,820
Jung Ki-ho and Jung Chae-ho
don't exist in this world. Got that?

284
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:16,530
Goodness.

285
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:18,240
You're right.

286
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:21,952
You and I are the same age.

287
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:23,453
He's a year younger than us.

288
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:27,708
You can speak casually when it's just us,
but be careful when we're outside.

289
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,042
Got it.

290
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:32,337
Here's the final part.

291
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:36,049
The past series of events have told me
you two used to be fond of each other.

292
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,134
So tell me.

293
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:40,179
Do you still have those feelings?

294
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:42,431
Goodness. Not at all.

295
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,684
Yes, I still do.

296
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:48,478
It'd be weird if I didn't.

297
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:50,480
What kind of lunatic searches 15 years

298
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:52,274
for someone he's uninterested in?

299
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,320
That's true.

300
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:57,571
Okay. Got it.

301
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:59,823
Was this also a part
of clearing things up?

302
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:00,949
Of course.

303
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:02,743
All right.

304
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:04,912
Let's resume dishwashing. Turn around.

305
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:41,740
Dream us
The little girl who used to dream

306
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:46,620
Dream us
Shining brighter than the stars

307
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:52,167
Dream us
My heart will never change

308
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:56,588
I'm still dreaming of you

309
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:01,969
When the sun rises in the distance

310
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:07,057
In this eternally dark place

311
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:12,854
I pray that at the end
Of this path we're taking

312
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:19,194
Will be a bright future waiting for us

313
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:22,572
I won't shed a tear

314
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:24,992
No matter what hardships may come

315
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:27,911
I'll ride the waves of fate

316
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:33,208
And take your hand
When it becomes too foggy

317
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,419
We can rely on each other

318
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:40,048
Until the morning sunlight comes

319
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:45,637
Dream us
The little girl who used to dream

320
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:50,934
Dream us
Shining brighter than the stars

321
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:56,189
Dream us
My heart will never change

322
00:21:56,273 --> 00:22:00,485
I'm still dreaming of you

323
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:02,529
With my eyes wide open

324
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:07,868
Even if the entire world ridicules me

325
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:11,955
For this path that I'm taking

326
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:18,879
I'll follow the map drawn
By my earnest heart

327
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:25,218
And run forward once again

328
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:31,266
Dream us
The little girl who used to dream

329
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:36,313
Dream us
Shining brighter than the stars

330
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:41,526
Dream us
My heart will never change

331
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:45,697
I'm still dreaming of you

332
00:22:46,364 --> 00:22:47,824
With my eyes wide open

333
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:50,535
Dream us

334
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:55,665
Dream us

335
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:04,091
You're so good!

336
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:06,218
To hear you in person was amazing!

337
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:08,762
Gosh, I can't believe I heard that live.

338
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:10,597
Thank you for letting us listen!

339
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,057
-It was my pleasure.
-Goodness.

340
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,141
Thank you.

341
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,026
I'll put the guitar in my car.

342
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,569
Mok-ha, you can ride in my car.

343
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:25,821
Okay.

344
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:27,948
Woo-hak, you can call shotgun.

345
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:29,032
I'll take my car.

346
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:33,578
-I'll drive, Dad.
-Really? Sure.

347
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:37,749
What about Ms. Yoon?

348
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:40,168
Is she still not picking up?

349
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:41,253
No.

350
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:43,839
No excuse could cut it.

351
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:46,091
If I were in her shoes,

352
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:47,801
I wouldn't want to see myself either.

353
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,179
I'll go see her and explain.

354
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,056
Goodness. It's okay.

355
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:56,393
Don't concern yourself with my business.

356
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:58,395
I'm separate from your family.

357
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:06,987
How are you going to apologize?

358
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:10,532
I don't know.

359
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:14,327
I'm afraid and don't know what to do.

360
00:24:16,454 --> 00:24:19,541
But avoiding it won't fix anything.

361
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:23,670
I should meet her first and talk.

362
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:26,423
Right.

363
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:35,098
What is she doing with those stones?

364
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:37,767
She's forming a stone tower.

365
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:40,687
Prayers tend to be answered here
thanks to the mountains.

366
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:56,536
There's something I learned
during my 15 years on the island.

367
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:09,549
Go!

368
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,927
Go away!

369
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:15,972
Don't come here!

370
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:18,016
Go away!

371
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,519
Please!

372
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:24,105
Praying…

373
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:27,943
won't bring miracles.

374
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:32,948
An oncoming typhoon

375
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:38,078
will still hit despite your prayers.

376
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:54,886
But you still pray because…

377
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:57,365
"Let's withstand the typhoon."

378
00:26:58,533 --> 00:27:00,327
"Let's make a miracle happen."

379
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:27,395
"I have the power within me."

380
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:40,909
Because you need that resolve.

381
00:27:58,301 --> 00:28:02,806
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR BEGINNING.
FROM YOUR FIRST FAN, YOON RAN-JOO

382
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:07,727
HEYDAY AGAIN

00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:10,355
TO MY FIRST FAN, THANK YOU.

BROTHERS SALON

386
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:39,175
When will you be done, Dad?

387
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:40,552
We're going to order Chinese.

388
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:42,470
In about 30 minutes.

389
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:44,055
-I want japchae rice.
-Okay.

390
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:47,517
Okay. What would you like?

391
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:49,853
For the first time in a while,

392
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:52,439
I'm finally going to see my family again.

393
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:56,401
I want to look like a good father.

394
00:28:57,444 --> 00:29:00,613
-Would that be possible?
-Of course. Just leave it to me.

395
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:24,429
That must be your family.

396
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:26,890
Yes, it is.

397
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:36,107
Seeing how

398
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:38,485
that woman looks familiar,

399
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:41,780
that must be my family.

400
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:43,531
Sorry?

401
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,534
Father.

402
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:49,204
Not yours.

403
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:19,734
BROTHERS SALON

404
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:32,455
What are you doing?

405
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:41,422
In my dreams, that man…

406
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:42,799
What?

407
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:45,009
That man appeared in my dreams.

408
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:47,846
He recognized Mom in this photo.

409
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:48,972
Oh, dear.

410
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:52,642
You must've had that dream
because he came looking for Mok-ha.

411
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:02,777
It's better to be safe than sorry.

412
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:05,697
Don't worry.

413
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,365
I'll protect you all.

414
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:10,493
I'll protect our family and Mok-ha too.

415
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:22,505
I'll protect us.

416
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:26,134
Protecting someone
isn't about how big you are.

417
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:27,886
It's about your heart.

418
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:28,970
I'll protect you.

419
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:32,974
We're similar.

420
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:37,312
No?

421
00:31:38,771 --> 00:31:40,356
I think we're similar.

422
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:42,317
-Our looks?
-Yes.

423
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:53,453
-Where's Bo-geol?
-He left early for the countryside.

424
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:55,830
What business does he have there?

425
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:56,915
Beats me.

426
00:31:57,498 --> 00:31:59,584
-Honey.
-Yes?

427
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:02,045
-Isn't this your underwear?
-Yes.

428
00:32:03,212 --> 00:32:04,297
What?

429
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,716
Ask Woo-hak.

430
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:09,761
Right. Well…

431
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:12,847
Woo-hak, you see…

432
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:17,101
There's something I'm curious about.

433
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:22,023
So it's about… Well…

434
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:23,900
It's a bit personal--

435
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:24,859
Woo-hak.

436
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:26,694
We were wondering…

437
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:31,282
How do you feel about Mok-ha?

438
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:32,367
What?

439
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,410
I mean,

440
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:36,454
you showed her quite a bit of attention.

441
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:39,582
In my opinion,

442
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:43,294
if you weren't just being friendly but…
How do I put it?

443
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,338
It's…

444
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,883
If you've developed
romantic feelings for her,

445
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:51,928
then Bo-geol--

446
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:53,596
That's what this is about, Mom?

447
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,933
I'm just being friendly.
No more, no less. That's it.

448
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,018
Right?

449
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:00,812
See? I told you.

450
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:02,271
You were right.

451
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:04,899
Honestly, I did almost
develop feelings for her.

452
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,275
-What?
-What?

453
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:08,403
But very briefly.

454
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:11,030
It was when I thought
maybe I was Jung Ki-ho.

455
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:12,907
I was attracted to her as Ki-ho.

456
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:15,284
You know how well I empathize.

457
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:17,745
-I have the "feeling" trait in my MBTI.
-Right.

458
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:19,831
Now that I know I'm not Ki-ho,

459
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:22,709
I see her as my brother's friend.
That's it. Satisfied?

460
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:25,461
-Okay. Done.
-Okay.

461
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:26,504
-Done.
-Okay.

462
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:28,631
Goodness.

463
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:30,550
It sounds more absurd by the minute.

464
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:33,428
Did you think Bo-geol and I

465
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:35,513
would've had a nasty fight over a girl?

466
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:37,640
It's possible to imagine such a thing.

467
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:39,017
Unbelievable.

468
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:42,478
Don't be so ridiculous, okay?

469
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:46,399
We're sorry.

470
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:48,234
-I'll take that.
-Okay.

471
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,111
Thanks.

472
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:54,782
It's very sunny today.

473
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:58,828
Goodness.

474
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:04,834
Why did he have to get so upset?

475
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:18,431
You know I was a police officer, right?

476
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,851
I can see through you.

477
00:34:22,518 --> 00:34:23,978
You're lying right now.

478
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:26,481
Ki-ho is hiding nearby.

479
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:02,058
Goodness!

480
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:04,852
Why are you dressed like that?

481
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:07,063
Hey, what are you doing here?

482
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:09,732
I see. The laundry.

483
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:11,317
Where are you headed?

484
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:14,695
I'm going to find out where Ran-joo is.

485
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:16,823
By yourself?

486
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:18,783
Do you have any company?

487
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:20,910
No, I can go alone.

488
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:25,081
And Bo-geol just happens to be away.

489
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:28,543
Did you have lunch?

490
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:30,586
I had a late breakfast.

491
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,839
Let's go together. I'll drop you off.

492
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:34,632
No, that's okay.

493
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:37,301
I don't want to eat alone.
Let's eat on our way there.

494
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:39,595
"Eat on our way there"?

495
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:43,349
Come on.

496
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:55,486
Okay, I'll go buy it.

497
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:56,445
Stay put.

498
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:00,992
Hello. May I take your order?

499
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:02,910
Two chicken sandwich combo meals, please.

500
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:05,246
Okay. Please drive up to the next window.

501
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:06,539
What was that?

502
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:07,748
Never seen one before?

503
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:16,465
It's "th," not "s."

504
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:18,843
"Th."

505
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:24,432
I get to eat with someone,
and you get a free ride.

506
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:25,850
That's a two-for-one. Nice.

507
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:28,769
Yeah, this is nice.

508
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,318
See?

509
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:37,820
It's so crispy
since we get to eat it right away.

510
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:39,113
It's a three-for-one.

511
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:41,616
I agree.

512
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,204
Woo-hak.

513
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:47,496
What?

514
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:49,165
Thanks.

515
00:36:57,089 --> 00:36:59,717
Bo-geol asked me to escort you.

516
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:02,511
He's busy with something today.

517
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:11,187
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

518
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:16,984
-One ticket to Chunsam Island.
-Okay.

519
00:37:22,156 --> 00:37:23,157
Here you go.

520
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:24,659
Thank you.

521
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:31,374
You still can't reach Ran-joo?

522
00:37:31,457 --> 00:37:32,500
No.

523
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:34,710
She hasn't reached out to you either?

524
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:36,587
No. Look.

525
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:41,968
I've been calling to give her this,
but she's not picking up.

526
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:47,682
This is a report
on the number of albums sold.

527
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:51,560
I did some quick calculations,
and to reach 20 million,

528
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:54,188
she has less than 20,000 to sell,

529
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,482
Yes, you're right.

530
00:37:56,565 --> 00:38:00,903
She has 19,345 albums left to sell now.

531
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:03,155
Yes. And here.

532
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:06,867
These people are interested in you.

533
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:10,746
Goodness. Why are there so many?

534
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:13,958
These are ones
I narrowed down from a pile.

535
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:17,503
There's an agency willing to release
an album as soon as you sign.

536
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:19,755
There's also a fashion magazine

537
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:23,175
that wants to do
a deserted-island-themed photo shoot.

538
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:25,886
So look carefully and make your decision.

539
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:29,015
Okay. Goodness.

540
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:31,183
I can't believe this.

541
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:34,020
And…

542
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:38,107
I would like to throw my hat
into this ring too.

543
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:40,318
SUGAR AGENCY

544
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:42,403
-You too, sir?
-Yes.

545
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:46,824
You should hurry and make up your mind
while their interest is still high.

546
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:49,910
This is your time
to be bold instead of cautious.

547
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:55,875
Okay. I'll discuss with Ran-joo
as soon as I see her and decide.

548
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:59,378
By the way, why has she disappeared?

549
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:02,381
She's too old to be rebelling.

550
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,635
I made a huge mistake.

551
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:08,304
What?

552
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:19,482
Do you know what you become
when you're too kind?

553
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:23,486
A pushover?

554
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:26,113
Yes. A pushover.

555
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:29,450
That's how I feel right now.

556
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:31,702
I feel like a pushover.

557
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:34,830
After everything she went through,

558
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:38,417
how could she give up so easily?

559
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:44,382
I'm sure it wasn't an easy decision.

560
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:47,968
Mok-ha must've had a good reason

561
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:50,054
to give up on her dream.

562
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:51,764
Exactly.

563
00:39:51,847 --> 00:39:53,307
And that reason

564
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:56,977
is bigger than Yoon Ran-joo.

565
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:00,147
You're right.

566
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:04,443
It's bigger than me.

567
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:07,113
And she won't change.

568
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:10,908
So how can I bet my life
on a girl like her?

569
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:12,701
Don't you agree?

570
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:17,748
You're right.

571
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:23,879
It's fascinating.

572
00:40:24,463 --> 00:40:27,675
How do you understand me so well

573
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:29,218
as if you can read my mind?

574
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:33,722
Of course, I understand you well.

575
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:35,307
Because…

576
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:37,351
you're…

577
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:40,896
You're…

578
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:43,315
Do you recognize me?

579
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:46,694
You're…

580
00:40:48,737 --> 00:40:50,030
You are…

581
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,616
Who are you?

582
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:55,119
Mom.

583
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:57,955
I'm your daughter.

584
00:40:58,038 --> 00:40:59,999
I'm Yoon Ran-joo, your daughter.

585
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:02,418
I'm Yoon Ran-joo though.

586
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:04,587
No, that's me.

587
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,338
Your name is Ko San-hee.

588
00:41:08,507 --> 00:41:11,886
"Ko San-hee"?

589
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:20,519
She's identifying herself as you
more and more as time goes by.

590
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:27,067
She looks up your name
dozens of times a day.

591
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:31,572
On search engines, video streaming sites,
and even social media.

592
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:35,493
What she finds online
directly affects her condition.

593
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:41,290
She's happy when she reads good articles
and depressed when she finds bad ones.

594
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:44,251
This is driving me insane.

595
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:47,755
I should get rid of her phone.

596
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:49,006
We've tried that.

597
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:51,926
She won't eat
until we give it back to her.

598
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:53,385
And her condition worsens.

599
00:41:55,429 --> 00:41:56,972
What should I do then?

600
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:02,019
When those articles
about your revival came out recently,

601
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:04,438
she came to her senses for a minute.

602
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:08,234
She said she had something to give you.

603
00:42:09,151 --> 00:42:10,152
What was it?

604
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:12,821
I'm not sure. It was only for a moment.

605
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:17,743
If you work hard and they write
a lot of nice articles about you,

606
00:42:17,826 --> 00:42:19,411
her condition will improve.

607
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:26,919
What kind of nice articles
are there for a singer in her forties?

608
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,505
They're all ones that ridicule me.

609
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:39,265
Brush off your worries
And let's cha-cha-cha

610
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,601
Goodness.

611
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:45,521
I'm sorry, but we're closed.

612
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:47,565
Hello, sir.

613
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:50,568
Who are you?

614
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:52,736
I'm Ki-ho.

615
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:54,572
Do you remember me?

616
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:56,740
Ki-ho…

617
00:42:58,033 --> 00:43:00,327
Jung Ki-ho, is that you?

618
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:04,498
Are you really Ki-ho?

619
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:06,959
Jae-sik, is it okay to carry heavy things?

620
00:43:07,042 --> 00:43:08,794
Shouldn't men protect their lower backs?

621
00:43:09,628 --> 00:43:12,506
It is him. It's Ki-ho!

622
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:13,591
Goodness.

623
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:15,384
Were you alive all along?

624
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:17,386
Goodness.

625
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:18,470
You little punk.

626
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:21,015
Your father has been looking
everywhere for you.

627
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:23,934
Goodness.

628
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:25,102
I can't believe this.

629
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:26,604
Here.

630
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:29,481
Can't you give me more vouchers?

631
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:32,192
There's construction this month,
so I need to park often.

632
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:33,277
I'm sorry.

633
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:36,238
If the vouchers are missing,
I need to pay for them myself.

634
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:39,283
I can tell you
were a former police officer.

635
00:43:39,366 --> 00:43:40,367
You're too strict.

636
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:41,660
I'm sorry.

637
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:46,457
MOON YONG-GU

638
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:50,836
Hello, Yong-gu. How have you been?

639
00:43:55,382 --> 00:43:56,216
Really?

640
00:43:57,217 --> 00:43:58,719
Are you sure it's Ki-ho?

641
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:00,220
I'm certain.

642
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:01,680
I saw him with my own eyes.

643
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:03,015
Jae-sik saw him too.

644
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:06,060
Ki-ho told us to keep it
a secret from his father!

645
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:07,144
So how could you--

646
00:44:07,227 --> 00:44:09,396
He said he was a photographer.

647
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,608
He travels around the country
and takes photos.

648
00:44:12,691 --> 00:44:14,485
Goodness, what do I do?

649
00:44:14,568 --> 00:44:16,779
You should be old enough
to know when to keep quiet.

650
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:18,822
Goodness, you know what?

651
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:21,992
I prepared a feast
of marinated crabs for him.

652
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:25,663
He said it was so delicious
and that he'd visit often.

653
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:31,043
Look. How about you come here?

654
00:44:31,126 --> 00:44:33,170
Yeah, and do a stake out.

655
00:44:33,253 --> 00:44:34,672
You should do a stake out.

656
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:36,173
All right.

657
00:44:36,882 --> 00:44:38,050
Thank you.

658
00:44:57,319 --> 00:44:59,321
You're wearing glasses often these days.

659
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:01,031
My eyes have felt dry.

660
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:03,617
I heard Mok-ha was going
to RJ Entertainment today.

661
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:07,246
I heard. She's meeting President Lee.

662
00:45:07,329 --> 00:45:08,831
You'll drive her there, right?

663
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:11,041
No.

664
00:45:13,627 --> 00:45:14,920
Just drop her off.

665
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:17,214
I'm busy today.

666
00:45:18,298 --> 00:45:19,466
Come on.

667
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,468
People have started recognizing her now.

668
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:23,971
They track her every movement
and post it online.

669
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:26,557
What if that man
follows her like last time?

670
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:29,601
Don't worry. She'll be okay.

671
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:31,478
I'll head out first.

672
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:34,773
You said you still had feelings for her.

673
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:35,858
This is--

674
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:38,318
This is how you show that?

675
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:39,778
"She'll be okay"?

676
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:42,573
Is that something you say
if you still have feelings for her?

677
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:45,784
How am I more worried about her?

678
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:07,055
By any chance,
have you seen Ran-joo around?

679
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:08,307
Who?

680
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:09,933
Ms. Yoon Ran-joo?

681
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:12,478
Yes, Ms. Yoon Ran-joo.

682
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:13,645
No, I haven't.

683
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:16,315
Artists don't visit the agency that often.

684
00:46:16,398 --> 00:46:18,275
Right. I'm aware of that.

685
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:19,485
But you see…

686
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:21,361
Why are you asking about that?

687
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:25,574
You're her manager, aren't you?

688
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:29,745
Ran-joo said

689
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:31,622
that she'd be dropping by today.

690
00:46:31,705 --> 00:46:34,541
I thought I'd ask
since I had business here anyway.

691
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:36,668
What business do you have here?

692
00:46:39,004 --> 00:46:41,173
President Lee wanted to see me.

693
00:46:41,256 --> 00:46:42,341
He did?

694
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:45,886
Why?

695
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:50,474
RJ ENTERTAINMENT
PRESIDENT LEE SEO-JUN

696
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:55,312
You want to sign me to a contract?

697
00:46:55,395 --> 00:46:56,271
Yes.

698
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:58,398
As an artist, not a manager.

699
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:04,655
You said I wasn't qualified last time.

700
00:47:04,738 --> 00:47:07,908
You said I was way too old to debut.

701
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:11,328
You seem to hold onto
long grudges, Ms. Seo.

702
00:47:12,704 --> 00:47:14,957
I'll take that as you saying
I'm consistent.

703
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:20,254
Relationships often change
depending on the circumstances.

704
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:23,257
We couldn't share
the same path in the past.

705
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:25,217
But now, things have changed.

706
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:26,468
How come?

707
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:30,639
People are very much interested in you.

708
00:47:31,723 --> 00:47:33,642
Your fame as of now

709
00:47:33,725 --> 00:47:36,478
is a resource that can't be measured
by money or time.

710
00:47:37,312 --> 00:47:38,605
And I want that.

711
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:41,817
We'll be showcasing our artists

712
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:43,986
in front of investors next month.

713
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:46,405
I'd like you to be on that stage.

714
00:47:47,489 --> 00:47:48,490
What do you say?

715
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:54,997
Thank you

716
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:57,541
for the great offer.

717
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:02,671
But I don't think
the circumstances have changed.

718
00:48:03,338 --> 00:48:06,383
Whether it was back then or now,

719
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:09,136
the most important thing to me

720
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:12,848
is selling 20 million of Ran-joo's albums.

721
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:18,020
You're still talking about that?

722
00:48:18,895 --> 00:48:20,897
We'll be achieving that goal shortly.

723
00:48:21,648 --> 00:48:23,650
If I ever decide to release an album,

724
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:27,195
that'll be after Ran-joo gets back half

725
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:28,655
of this agency's shares.

726
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:33,285
That order will never change,
so please remember that.

727
00:48:33,368 --> 00:48:36,246
You're devoting yourself to be
a manager instead of a singer?

728
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:37,497
Correct.

729
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:40,876
Think this through.

730
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:43,920
Interest is short-lived.

731
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:47,174
The fire will soon die out
if you don't add firewood.

732
00:49:02,814 --> 00:49:04,358
What are you doing here?

733
00:49:04,858 --> 00:49:06,902
I was too curious to just ignore it.

734
00:49:08,737 --> 00:49:10,405
It's nothing to be curious about.

735
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:14,117
Ran-joo sure is lucky

736
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:17,829
to have an unwavering fan like you.

737
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:22,834
She also had fans who cold feet like you.

738
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:26,129
If you came to audition that day…

739
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:38,809
I'll admit it.
You could be standing where I am now.

740
00:49:41,269 --> 00:49:43,188
But you should also admit

741
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:47,317
that you can have
a change of heart like I did.

742
00:49:49,194 --> 00:49:51,113
I'm afraid I can't do that.

743
00:49:52,989 --> 00:49:54,991
Ran-joo cut ties with you, didn't she?

744
00:49:55,992 --> 00:49:56,993
"Cut ties"?

745
00:50:00,288 --> 00:50:01,456
No, she didn't.

746
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:04,876
She will soon.

747
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:07,254
She'd adore and dote on you.

748
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:09,297
Then, she'll suddenly cut ties
and disappear.

749
00:50:10,132 --> 00:50:11,758
That's her specialty.

750
00:50:25,147 --> 00:50:29,401
I'd like Mok-ha to join my agency.
Can you talk her into it?

751
00:50:29,484 --> 00:50:31,111
This is Reporter Lee from Enter Click.

752
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:32,612
-I'd like an interview.
-Ran-joo.

753
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:34,531
We invite you and Ms. Seo
to our radio show.

754
00:50:34,614 --> 00:50:37,033
I asked Ms. Seo to join
our agency as an artist.

755
00:50:37,617 --> 00:50:38,869
But Ms. Seo was more focused

756
00:50:38,952 --> 00:50:40,996
-on the 20 million…
-This is Wonder Entertainment.

757
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:42,414
I'd like to recruit Ms. Seo.

758
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:46,084
Mok-ha seems to listen to you. Can you
persuade her to be on our show again?

759
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:48,962
Ran-joo, at least let me hear your voice.

760
00:50:49,045 --> 00:50:51,298
I miss you, Ran-joo.

761
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:04,811
POWER OFF

762
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:09,107
FOUR SEASON NURSING HOME

763
00:51:09,191 --> 00:51:11,067
I get it now after going through it.

764
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:14,738
As President Lee said, relationships
change depending on circumstances.

765
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:25,248
That premise

766
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,543
bothers me.

767
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:31,630
It seems you're blaming the circumstances

768
00:51:31,713 --> 00:51:34,174
when you're the one who changed.

769
00:51:35,717 --> 00:51:37,135
That's how it sounds to me.

770
00:51:55,654 --> 00:51:57,113
Gosh, that's refreshing.

771
00:51:57,197 --> 00:51:59,699
This spicy seafood stew
should be the signature dish.

772
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,077
Really? You should come by often then.

773
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,954
We won't ever charge you.

774
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:07,541
Hey, Ki-ho.

775
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:10,710
Your father came by a few days ago.

776
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:14,673
The zipper on my father's mouth
broke again.

777
00:52:14,756 --> 00:52:18,218
I did my best to stop him,

778
00:52:18,301 --> 00:52:20,554
but he told your father everything.

779
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:23,056
What did he say?

780
00:52:23,139 --> 00:52:26,351
You see, your father

781
00:52:27,143 --> 00:52:29,771
loves you so much.

782
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:32,065
He's so relieved that you're alive.

783
00:52:32,148 --> 00:52:33,275
He was thankful.

784
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:37,237
He was worried sick about you.

785
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:39,531
What else?

786
00:52:39,614 --> 00:52:41,283
And…

787
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:43,410
Well…

788
00:52:44,035 --> 00:52:46,246
I'm a bit hesitant to relay this message.

789
00:52:47,163 --> 00:52:49,416
But he wanted me to tell you this.

790
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:51,793
What is it?

791
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:56,256
He said he knew why you came.

792
00:53:02,888 --> 00:53:04,347
He said

793
00:53:04,931 --> 00:53:06,516
-you were lying…
-Ki-ho

794
00:53:07,058 --> 00:53:08,143
is lying.

795
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:13,231
To hide from me,

796
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:16,067
he probably changed his name.

797
00:53:18,236 --> 00:53:20,322
I must've finally found him.

798
00:53:20,822 --> 00:53:22,240
He was anxious,

799
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:26,286
so he probably came here to distract me.

800
00:53:33,835 --> 00:53:36,379
Tell him he doesn't need
to come all the way here.

801
00:53:37,505 --> 00:53:38,715
It's so far.

802
00:53:39,841 --> 00:53:41,343
If he just waits…

803
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:45,138
I will…

804
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:49,059
come find him.

805
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:08,328
STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS FOR DOMESTIC ABUSE

806
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:18,088
Five years?

807
00:54:19,965 --> 00:54:21,132
It's been way too long.

808
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,743
SENTENCE FOR PATRICIDE

809
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:57,502
Everyone, did you know?

810
00:54:58,086 --> 00:55:00,338
These two are trending
the most these days.

811
00:55:00,422 --> 00:55:03,717
Yoon Ran-joo and Seo Mok-ha,
K-pop's leading mentor and mentee,

812
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:06,553
appeared on Karaoke with the Stars,
our oldest segment.

813
00:55:06,636 --> 00:55:08,513
And that was 15 years ago.

814
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:10,724
All right, then.

815
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:13,268
Let's listen to their call at the time.

816
00:55:13,351 --> 00:55:14,894
Hello?

817
00:55:15,478 --> 00:55:16,312
Ran-joo?

818
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:18,189
Is it really you?

819
00:55:18,273 --> 00:55:20,650
This was Seo Mok-ha in middle school.

820
00:55:21,276 --> 00:55:23,653
Yes, it's me. Yoon Ran-joo.

821
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:24,779
It's me, Ran-joo.

822
00:55:25,321 --> 00:55:27,615
And this was Yoon Ran-joo
from 15 years ago.

823
00:55:31,369 --> 00:55:33,329
Ran-joo, it's really you!

824
00:55:34,956 --> 00:55:37,542
Ran-joo, I love you so much!

825
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:39,961
I truly love you!

826
00:55:40,712 --> 00:55:43,673
-Goodness.
-Oh, my. Ms. Seo Mok-ha.

827
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:45,884
You shouldn't cry already. Just a moment.

828
00:55:46,384 --> 00:55:48,136
This is Karaoke with the Stars.

829
00:55:48,219 --> 00:55:51,473
Today's guest has been topping
all music charts.

830
00:55:52,098 --> 00:55:54,893
She's Korea's number one diva.
The queen of K-pop.

831
00:55:56,394 --> 00:55:58,438
No, she's the goddess.

832
00:55:58,521 --> 00:56:00,356
I'm here with Yoon Ran-joo.

833
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:03,777
We're on the phone with the listener
who'll sing along with her.

834
00:56:04,402 --> 00:56:05,236
Ms. Seo Mok-ha?

835
00:56:05,904 --> 00:56:08,448
Yes. Hello…

836
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:10,241
How are you?

837
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:11,826
How are…

838
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:12,911
Ran-joo!

839
00:56:12,994 --> 00:56:16,122
Ran-joo, on the phone,

840
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:19,084
your voice sounds so beautiful.

841
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:20,418
She's adorable.

842
00:56:20,502 --> 00:56:24,214
I just love your accent, Ms. Seo Mok-ha.

843
00:56:24,297 --> 00:56:27,050
Goodness. How cute.

844
00:56:27,133 --> 00:56:28,259
Ran-joo.

845
00:56:28,343 --> 00:56:29,594
Can you…

846
00:56:29,677 --> 00:56:31,554
Can you say my name once more?

847
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:33,348
Ms. Seo Mok-ha.

848
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:36,434
You know what?

849
00:56:36,518 --> 00:56:39,395
I could die in peace right now.

850
00:56:40,605 --> 00:56:41,856
This right here.

851
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:43,483
Ki-ho… I mean.

852
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:44,984
Bo-geol hung up the phone.

853
00:56:45,485 --> 00:56:46,402
What?

854
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:47,695
What a jerk.

855
00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:50,490
Sadly, the call was cut off here.

856
00:56:50,573 --> 00:56:54,119
I cried for four days straight
because of this.

857
00:56:54,202 --> 00:56:55,370
For four days?

858
00:56:55,453 --> 00:56:57,622
Jeez, I would've cut ties with him.

859
00:56:57,705 --> 00:57:01,459
It would've been a moment
in history had she sung.

860
00:57:01,543 --> 00:57:02,585
What a shame.

861
00:57:02,669 --> 00:57:03,753
I agree.

862
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:06,589
What a shame.

863
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:08,508
That was Yoon Ran-joo and Seo Mok-ha

864
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:10,093
-from 15 years ago…
-Do you think

865
00:57:10,176 --> 00:57:12,178
Ran-joo is listening to this too?

866
00:57:14,472 --> 00:57:15,557
Why aren't you upset?

867
00:57:16,057 --> 00:57:17,058
Isn't it unfair?

868
00:57:17,142 --> 00:57:18,226
Let's be honest.

869
00:57:18,309 --> 00:57:19,310
If it weren't for you,

870
00:57:19,394 --> 00:57:21,855
she wouldn't have been able
to take the stage again.

871
00:57:21,938 --> 00:57:23,940
You just wanted a break
because you had to--

872
00:57:24,023 --> 00:57:25,024
Woo-hak.

873
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:27,902
Can I borrow your phone?

874
00:57:28,695 --> 00:57:29,779
What for?

875
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:30,780
Well…

876
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:34,075
She might not pick up my calls,
but she might pick up yours.

877
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:35,160
Unlock this.

878
00:57:59,100 --> 00:57:59,934
Ran-joo!

879
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:01,436
It's me, Mok-ha.

880
00:58:01,519 --> 00:58:02,937
It's Mok-ha, Ran-joo.

881
00:58:03,021 --> 00:58:04,063
Ran-joo!

882
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:05,690
Please don't hang up.

883
00:58:05,773 --> 00:58:07,358
Can you please--

884
00:58:07,442 --> 00:58:09,402
Can you please hear me out?

885
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:10,570
Ms. Seo?

886
00:58:13,072 --> 00:58:14,073
Ran-joo,

887
00:58:14,616 --> 00:58:15,617
is that you?

888
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:18,369
Yes, it is.

889
00:58:19,621 --> 00:58:20,663
What's wrong?

890
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:25,502
It's her number,

891
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:27,128
but someone else picked up.

892
00:58:27,212 --> 00:58:29,714
Can I speak with Ran-joo, please?

893
00:58:30,423 --> 00:58:32,342
You're talking to her.

894
00:58:33,426 --> 00:58:35,011
Where are you, Ms. Seo?

895
00:58:35,762 --> 00:58:36,930
Well…

896
00:58:37,555 --> 00:58:39,432
I'm on my way home.

897
00:58:39,974 --> 00:58:40,975
And where's that?

898
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:05,351
Mom!

899
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:08,021
Where did she go?

900
01:00:10,231 --> 01:00:11,733
My phone.

901
01:00:13,568 --> 01:00:14,986
Where is it?

902
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:04,118
BROTHERS SALON

903
01:01:13,461 --> 01:01:14,629
Mom!

904
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:18,716
Mom!

905
01:01:23,846 --> 01:01:25,431
She isn't picking up?

906
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:28,559
She only answers
when you call her "Ran-joo."

907
01:01:29,977 --> 01:01:31,396
Ran-joo!

908
01:01:31,896 --> 01:01:33,314
Ran-joo!

909
01:01:35,066 --> 01:01:36,901
Yoon Ran-joo!

910
01:01:41,239 --> 01:01:43,157
It's nice to meet you, Ms. Seo Mok-ha.

911
01:01:43,241 --> 01:01:44,242
I'm…

912
01:01:45,743 --> 01:01:46,828
Yoon Ran-joo.

913
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:50,331
I see. It's nice to meet you.

914
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:51,833
Well…

915
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,544
What brings you here?

916
01:01:54,627 --> 01:01:56,713
You said it was your dream
to sing with me.

917
01:01:57,422 --> 01:02:00,049
I came here to grant your wish.

918
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:03,594
She lies with such sincerity.

919
01:02:03,678 --> 01:02:05,513
I don't think she's lying.

920
01:02:05,596 --> 01:02:07,515
I think she's ill.

921
01:02:08,099 --> 01:02:09,559
Excuse me.

922
01:02:10,184 --> 01:02:11,394
You're getting a call.

923
01:02:11,477 --> 01:02:13,563
What? A call?

924
01:02:13,646 --> 01:02:14,522
Yes.

925
01:02:15,022 --> 01:02:16,524
Right.

926
01:02:25,158 --> 01:02:26,242
Hello?

927
01:02:26,325 --> 01:02:27,368
Mom!

928
01:02:27,452 --> 01:02:28,911
-Where are you now?
-Wait.

929
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:29,871
May I?

930
01:02:30,747 --> 01:02:31,664
Hello?

931
01:02:32,373 --> 01:02:33,374
Ran-joo?

932
01:02:34,792 --> 01:02:35,793
Ran-joo!

933
01:02:36,335 --> 01:02:37,712
It's me, Mok-ha!

934
01:02:38,463 --> 01:02:39,297
What?

935
01:02:39,797 --> 01:02:41,048
She's Yoon Ran-joo's mother?

936
01:02:41,132 --> 01:02:42,133
What?

937
01:02:42,842 --> 01:02:44,093
Did you get an exclusive?

938
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:47,764
No, that's not intriguing enough.
Dig deeper.

939
01:02:48,264 --> 01:02:49,265
Bye.

940
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:52,810
Anything about Yoon Ran-joo
is intriguing these days.

941
01:02:53,436 --> 01:02:54,604
What is it?

942
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:56,939
Someone is impersonating her mother.

943
01:02:58,191 --> 01:03:01,027
Jeez, all sorts of lunatics
are appearing now that she's popular.

944
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:02,528
Tell me about it.

945
01:03:09,827 --> 01:03:10,661
So?

946
01:03:11,162 --> 01:03:12,622
Is she really her mother?

947
01:03:12,705 --> 01:03:14,457
Is this Reporter Kang Woo-hak?

948
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:20,171
Speaking. Who is this?

949
01:03:20,254 --> 01:03:21,547
Hello.

950
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:24,759
You recently came by to cover
the hornet car accident.

951
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:26,844
Yes, I remember.

952
01:03:27,345 --> 01:03:29,222
You're the victim's wife, right?

953
01:03:29,305 --> 01:03:30,389
Yes, I am.

954
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:31,849
My name is Moon Young-ju.

955
01:03:32,558 --> 01:03:34,685
There's someone I'm looking for.

956
01:03:34,769 --> 01:03:36,020
You're looking for someone?

957
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:41,317
I'm not sure if you know,
but she recently appeared on Heyday Again.

958
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:42,693
Her name's Seo Mok-ha.

959
01:03:43,361 --> 01:03:46,030
I'd like to get her number.

960
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:50,368
What is this about?

961
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:54,330
Here.

962
01:03:56,123 --> 01:03:57,208
What is this?

963
01:03:57,291 --> 01:03:59,794
You wanted to look
for the person who caused the crash.

964
01:04:00,711 --> 01:04:04,632
I looked through the GPS
in your husband's car.

965
01:04:05,132 --> 01:04:08,302
It's a list of places he'd been
before the accident. Take a look.

966
01:04:08,386 --> 01:04:09,512
See if you recognize any.

967
01:04:11,055 --> 01:04:13,224
I thought you said
hornets caused the accident.

968
01:04:13,307 --> 01:04:14,642
Exactly.

969
01:04:15,434 --> 01:04:17,103
Imagine how uneasy I must've felt

970
01:04:17,186 --> 01:04:18,312
to go to the junkyard

971
01:04:18,396 --> 01:04:19,939
while off-duty

972
01:04:21,148 --> 01:04:23,150
in this scorching heat.

973
01:04:23,234 --> 01:04:26,779
Even the preliminary investigation
had closed the case already.

974
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:29,198
But I still looked into it, you know?

975
01:04:31,284 --> 01:04:32,493
You know what?

976
01:04:32,577 --> 01:04:33,870
I'm not thankful at all.

977
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:35,371
That's what

978
01:04:35,955 --> 01:04:37,540
police officers should do.

979
01:04:38,249 --> 01:04:40,126
So why are you showing off about it?

980
01:04:45,339 --> 01:04:46,632
"Damwon Building."

981
01:04:47,216 --> 01:04:48,718
"Jeongsan Building"?

982
01:04:48,801 --> 01:04:51,470
Jeongsan Building
was the last place he visited.

983
01:04:53,014 --> 01:04:54,181
Does it ring any bells?

984
01:04:54,807 --> 01:04:55,892
Did anyone there

985
01:04:55,975 --> 01:04:57,727
have resentment toward your husband

986
01:04:57,810 --> 01:04:59,395
or lend him money?

987
01:04:59,478 --> 01:05:01,188
Dae-woong had no enemies.

988
01:05:03,858 --> 01:05:06,319
How am I supposed to
know anything with just this?

989
01:05:06,402 --> 01:05:07,403
"Jeongsan Building"?

990
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:09,947
Hello, sir.

991
01:05:10,698 --> 01:05:12,533
The police officer suddenly arrived.

992
01:05:12,617 --> 01:05:13,492
It won't take long.

993
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:14,577
Wait…

994
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:15,661
Sir, that's…

995
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:19,415
There's someone I know at this building.

996
01:05:19,999 --> 01:05:20,833
Who?

997
01:05:22,126 --> 01:05:23,961
How do you know Ms. Seo Mok-ha?

998
01:05:24,045 --> 01:05:26,505
We went to the same middle school.

999

1001
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:42,271
Ki-ho.

1002
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:45,107
When I was on the island,

1003
01:05:46,275 --> 01:05:49,320
do you know what my biggest fear was?

1004
01:05:56,077 --> 01:05:57,411
The typhoons.

1005
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:03,626
Especially the ones

1006
01:06:04,669 --> 01:06:08,547
that lingered in the ocean the longest.

1007
01:06:24,397 --> 01:06:25,398
Where's my mom?

1008
01:06:26,107 --> 01:06:27,608
She's inside.

1009
01:06:48,295 --> 01:06:50,297
They feed off the ocean

1010
01:06:51,632 --> 01:06:54,010
and grow into humongous typhoons.

1011
01:06:55,636 --> 01:06:56,887
That's why

1012
01:06:57,596 --> 01:07:02,351
typhoons that linger in the ocean
frighten me the most.

1013
01:07:31,255 --> 01:07:33,466
I got a lot of calls
from people looking for you.

1014
01:07:34,175 --> 01:07:35,634
But you don't seem too busy.

1015
01:07:37,219 --> 01:07:38,304
I thought

1016
01:07:39,305 --> 01:07:41,140
I should apologize to you first.

1017
01:07:42,141 --> 01:07:43,184
Ran-joo.

1018
01:07:43,768 --> 01:07:45,102
I'm sorry.

1019
01:07:47,563 --> 01:07:49,231
I have no excuse.

1020
01:07:49,315 --> 01:07:51,400
I'm to blame for everything.

1021
01:07:52,443 --> 01:07:55,362
You tried your best
to help me achieve my dream.

1022
01:07:56,113 --> 01:07:58,074
But I ran away just like that,

1023
01:07:58,741 --> 01:08:00,451
so I understand how disappointed

1024
01:08:01,577 --> 01:08:03,204
you must be in me.

1025
01:08:04,038 --> 01:08:05,164
From now on,

1026
01:08:05,498 --> 01:08:06,791
this will never happen again--

1027
01:08:06,874 --> 01:08:09,376
No, it will keep happening.

1028
01:08:10,878 --> 01:08:12,129
No. Never.

1029
01:08:12,213 --> 01:08:14,590
"Never" is a word that doesn't exist.

1030
01:08:16,133 --> 01:08:19,011
You'll run away again
due to unavoidable circumstances.

1031
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:21,847
And you'll apologize to me again.

1032
01:08:27,603 --> 01:08:30,689
Betting my life on someone
like you is too pitiful to do.

1033
01:08:30,773 --> 01:08:31,857
It's such a waste.

1034
01:08:42,326 --> 01:08:43,244
Hello?

1035
01:08:44,495 --> 01:08:46,497
President Lee, it's me.

1036
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:49,375
Let's rewrite our contract.

1037
01:08:49,917 --> 01:08:51,794
You know what contract. My contract.

1038
01:08:53,504 --> 01:08:54,463
Tomorrow,

1039
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:57,550
let's terminate it.

1040
01:08:58,259 --> 01:09:00,344
I don't care about the 20 million albums.

1041
01:09:00,427 --> 01:09:01,428
Let's just end it.

1042
01:09:01,512 --> 01:09:02,555
Ran-joo.

1043
01:09:02,638 --> 01:09:03,973
What are you doing?

1044
01:09:05,182 --> 01:09:07,977
You've almost reached your goal.

1045
01:09:10,146 --> 01:09:12,106
I'm sick and tired of looking after

1046
01:09:13,023 --> 01:09:13,941
a talentless girl.

1047
01:09:15,776 --> 01:09:16,777
Ran-joo…

1048
01:09:18,779 --> 01:09:21,073
Those typhoons don't just shake the trees.

1049
01:09:22,491 --> 01:09:26,245
They're powerful enough to uproot them.

1050
01:09:27,788 --> 01:09:29,456
Just like how those typhoons grow

1051
01:09:29,957 --> 01:09:31,458
by feeding off the ocean,

1052
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:33,836
misunderstandings

1053
01:09:35,087 --> 01:09:36,547
grow by feeding off time.

1057
01:10:17,755 --> 01:10:18,756
Who's there?

1058
01:10:25,888 --> 01:10:27,056
Who--

1059
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:29,225
Father.

1060
01:10:30,184 --> 01:10:31,393
It's me.

1061
01:10:40,486 --> 01:10:41,487
I'm Ki-ho.

1062

CASTAWAY DIVA

SENTENCE FOR PATRICIDE

1064
01:11:14,436 --> 01:11:16,855
What are you doing here at this hour?

1065
01:11:17,564 --> 01:11:18,649
Well…

1066
01:11:19,733 --> 01:11:22,236
I didn't want to wake Woo-hak up.

1067
01:11:22,319 --> 01:11:23,821
Yeah.

1068
01:11:26,573 --> 01:11:28,784
I wonder what you were looking at.

1069
01:11:29,285 --> 01:11:30,953
You're even stuttering.

1070
01:11:33,706 --> 01:11:34,707
Were you

1071
01:11:35,249 --> 01:11:39,128
looking at something filthy
in secret by yourself?

1072
01:11:42,339 --> 01:11:44,174
You must be psychic.

1073
01:11:45,801 --> 01:11:47,678
Goodness.

1074
01:11:47,761 --> 01:11:49,179
You shouldn't do that!

1075
01:11:49,263 --> 01:11:51,598
That's a crime!

1076
01:11:52,349 --> 01:11:54,226
Fine. I won't look anymore.

1077
01:11:55,686 --> 01:11:56,687
You see…

1078
01:11:56,770 --> 01:12:01,734
I personally don't like men
who look at such things.

1079
01:12:02,276 --> 01:12:05,029
Don't you even think about it.
You should never.

1080
01:12:06,780 --> 01:12:08,407
Come on. Promise me.

1081
01:12:20,085 --> 01:12:21,086
Okay.

1082
01:12:22,713 --> 01:12:23,756
I'll never do it.

1083
01:12:24,673 --> 01:12:28,260
Don't ruin yourself
with something like that.

1084
01:12:30,763 --> 01:12:32,639
Okay. Thanks.

1085
01:13:24,608 --> 01:13:26,902
To show her how strong I am,

1086
01:13:26,985 --> 01:13:29,613
I thought I should make
the boldest decision ever.

1087
01:13:29,696 --> 01:13:31,782
I came to ask you for another favor.

1088
01:13:32,616 --> 01:13:34,284
I heard you're identifying fingerprints.

1089
01:13:34,368 --> 01:13:35,869
This is a tip-off, not a request.

1090
01:13:35,953 --> 01:13:37,246
Why did you lie?

1091
01:13:37,871 --> 01:13:40,416
So how was it?
Your first day without your father?

1092
01:13:41,041 --> 01:13:41,875
Don't let

1093
01:13:41,959 --> 01:13:44,545
President Lee find out about it.

1094
01:13:44,628 --> 01:13:46,046
All of us.

1095
01:13:46,130 --> 01:13:47,464
We're all worthless! Okay?

1096
01:13:47,548 --> 01:13:49,383
Giving up requires courage too?

1097
01:13:50,092 --> 01:13:51,468
Aren't you afraid of failing?

1098
01:13:51,552 --> 01:13:52,386
If that was the case,

1099
01:13:52,469 --> 01:13:54,138
then I wouldn't be here right now.

1100
01:13:54,221 --> 01:13:55,139
Are you ready?

1101
01:14:00,018 --> 01:14:02,020
