00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:55,054
CASTAWAY DIVA

2
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:58,057
Hey, come here.

3
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:06,232
Can't you see what's going on?

4
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:08,818
I've created a risk and a scandal for you.

5
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:11,821
I told you we had to take care
of these things immediately.

6
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:17,660
I'm sorry for calling so late.

7
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,704
I thought you'd be shocked by the news.

8
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:23,124
Everything was finalized,
but the reporter asked later at the end.

9
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:26,586
Yes. She signed the termination form.

10
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:29,047
Yes. You don't have to worry.

11
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:30,924
Goodbye.

12
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:39,724
What?

13
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:41,559
The termination form?

14
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:43,978
Ran-joo was the one who wrote it.

15
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:46,189
What else can I do in this situation?

16
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:49,067
If I get involved, it'll hurt our company.

17
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:51,653
I know.

18
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:53,488
Then why--

19
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:55,240
Why are you staring at me like that?

20
00:01:57,867 --> 00:01:59,619
There's dog hair on your head.

21
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:12,799
HELLO, I'M SEO MOK-HA

22
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:25,937
I can't think of a single thing to write.

23
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:33,194
Are you asleep? I'm eating alone.

24
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:36,030
Right now?

25
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:41,369
Where are you?

26
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:51,337
EPISODE 11

27
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:53,715
Why are you always eating alone?

28
00:02:58,303 --> 00:02:59,387
You actually came.

29
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:02,891
I told you last time.

30
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:06,811
I'd be there no matter when,
where, or what you're eating.

31
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:11,232
It feels like we last met ages ago.

32
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:15,069
I'm sorry for leaving
without saying goodbye.

33
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,865
Yeah. You should feel bad.

34
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:20,199
Jeez.

35
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,787
Is your shoulder all better now?

36
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,539
Yeah, it's fine.

37
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:31,544
I read the news.

38
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,380
Right.

39
00:03:35,214 --> 00:03:37,383
At tomorrow's press conference,

40
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,344
we're going to explain everything.

41
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:43,640
Reporters insinuate
what they want to say through questions.

42
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:47,810
I printed out
some questions you might get.

43
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:52,232
This is a rough idea of what to put
in your statement. Take a look.

44
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:54,067
Take your time and read through it.

45
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,986
Okay. I guess you really are a reporter.

46
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,613
-You bet.
-Gosh.

47
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:00,907
Don't get upset
and confrontational like last time.

48
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,575
When was I ever confrontational?

49
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,244
When you get upset

50
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:06,704
and raise your voice,
reporters don't like it.

51
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:09,082
That becomes a problem too?

52
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:10,375
Of course.

53
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:13,670
After all, they're human, too.
I bought some sausages.

54
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,380
Have one.

55
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:16,381
Sausages?

56
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:17,632
Isn't this yours?

57
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:18,841
I got one for myself too.

58
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,343
I was going to share.

59
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:23,388
SUNGJIN NEWS

60
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:29,310
Excuse me.

61
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:33,064
Hello, I'm Bong Du-hyeon
from Sungjin News.

62
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:34,899
Where can I park my car?

63
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:36,609
CULTURE REPORTER BONG DU-HYEON

64
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,451
Your card's not a parking voucher.

65
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,455
-Move your car.
-I'm here for a press conference--

66
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:50,623
Move your car now.

67
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:52,834
Or I'll call the cops.

68
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:54,836
But the parking lot is full…

69
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,047
What does he want me to do?

70
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,342
But everyone else parked here.

71
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:08,308
Where's Ran-joo?

72
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:09,726
She's in the restroom.

73
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,394
Should I button this?

74
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,564
Would the reporters think
I'm rude if I don't?

75
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:17,692
But it feels so stifling
when it's buttoned up.

76
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:20,278
-Let's do as Ran-joo said.
-What?

77
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:22,530
Leave the press conference to Ran-joo.

78
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:24,741
Just act like you've cut ties for now.

79
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,535
You don't have to suffer with her.

80
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:28,828
Your album's coming out.

81
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:31,372
It's okay to be a coward right now.

82
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,209
Don't you think it'd be better

83
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:37,962
to get the worst out of the way first?

84
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:44,385
I tried to lie and hide
my weaknesses a bit in the past.

85
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:46,220
And I learned my lesson.

86
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:48,556
I was so scared that I couldn't be myself.

87
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,058
You'll regret this decision.

88
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:52,894
Please. I'd regret it if I didn't do this.

89
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,023
Unbuttoned?

90
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:07,241
The reporter
who wrote that article came too.

91
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:10,953
Which one was it?

92
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:14,207
In the third row.

93
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:16,501
The one with the plaid shirt.

94
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,799
Hello, President Lee.
Fancy seeing you here.

95
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,887
It's been a long time.

96
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,016
Unbelievable.

97
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,769
What is it? Do you know that reporter?

98
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:44,320
PRESS CONFERENCE
FOR RJ ENTERTAINMENT'S YOON RAN-JOO

99
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:46,322
Ran-joo.

100
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,367
Have you had
a lot of press conferences before?

101
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:50,868
Yeah.

102
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:54,205
But that was when I was still famous.

103
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:56,874
I had my last one about 12 years ago.

104
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:59,544
What was it about back then?

105
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,214
It was about gambling.

106
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,091
What?

107
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:07,468
I think that one also took place here.

108
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:11,597
Is it true that you spent
hundreds of millions of won

109
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:12,640
gambling in Las Vegas?

110
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:15,184
No.

111
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:18,271
I was in Las Vegas for a photo shoot.

112
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:20,940
Why did you pick
a hotel that had a casino?

113
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:24,277
Most hotels in Las Vegas

114
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,320
have their own casinos.

115
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:28,614
Rumor has it you lost 50 billion won.

116
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,950
I don't even have that much money!

117
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:33,077
I wish I did!

118
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:37,165
Why is it that you're the only one
who's surrounded by such rumors?

119
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:45,923
The reporters should know.
What kind of question is that?

120
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:49,927
Exactly. Then, they wrote
more articles with the ugliest photos.

121
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,096
If you want my ugly photos,

122
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,432
search for my press conference
and you'll find tons.

123
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,564
Try to keep your head down
the entire time.

124
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:03,524
They'll start taking photos
when you look up.

125
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:05,109
Here.

126
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:06,694
Hydrate yourself now.

127
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:08,738
Or they'll take a photo of you drinking

128
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,239
and say that you're anxious.

129
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:13,451
Keep your answers as brief as you can.

130
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:14,952
Don't explain even if you get mad.

131
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:16,454
It's worse if they twist your words.

132
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:19,707
All right.

133
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:00,540
Hello.

134
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,375
I'm Yoon Ran-joo.

135
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,963
I'm sit before you
with a heavy heart today.

136
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,551
First of all,

137
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:15,304
the rumors about the shares
reported in the media

138
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,806
are mostly true.

139
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,230
In the past, President Lee Seo-jun and I

140
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:28,484
signed a contract stating
that if I sold 20 million albums,

141
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,904
I'd receive half the shares of the agency.

142
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,991
It's true that I appeared

143
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,660
on Heyday Again to achieve this goal.

144
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:41,539
The fact that I lip-synced on stage

145
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:42,748
is also true.

146
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,375
I BET MO-RAE WILL END UP LIKE RAN-JOO

147
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,544
But I had a more desperate reason

148
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:50,256
for doing that other than the desire
to claim the shares.

149
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:54,927
But whatever the reason may be,

150
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:57,763
in the process of this,
I made a disappointing decision.

151
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,016
I admit this

152
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:02,059
and I am remorseful.

153
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:03,936
I'm sorry.

154
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:22,830
Hello, I'm Seo Mok-ha.

155
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:27,168
I was the one who encouraged Ran-joo

156
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,295
to claim the shares.

157
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:32,298
PRESS CONFERENCE FOR YOON RAN-JOO

158
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:33,424
As her fan,

159
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:37,637
I just wanted her to find her place.

160
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:42,558
I was a naive fan
and only wanted the best for her.

161
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,769
But I think this wish

162
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:47,146
became a burden for her.

163
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,358
To everyone who showed

164
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:53,903
their love and support
for my story and singing,

165
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,238
I apologize.

166
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,283
We'll now take any questions you may have.

167
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:00,326
Yes?

168
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,162
This is a question for Ms. Yoon.

169
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:05,414
What will happen to the shares then?

170
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:07,875
I've given them up.

171
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:11,545
RJ Entertainment's shares are now safe.

172
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:16,300
In short, you had to appear
on TV to acquire the shares.

173
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:18,511
However, you couldn't sing.

174
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:21,138
So you dragged Ms. Seo
into this. Is this correct?

175
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:24,016
No, she didn't drag me into it.

176
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,768
I was asking Ms. Yoon.

177
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,062
Is this correct or incorrect?

178
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:30,689
That is correct.

179
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:37,113
My question is for Ms. Seo.

180
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:41,909
You said you encouraged
Ms. Yoon to claim the shares.

181
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:42,993
Why did you do this?

182
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:45,538
Did you want a part of the shares too?

183
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:47,540
I wasn't interested in the shares.

184
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:49,834
Then, why did you encourage her?

185
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:54,922
When Ran-joo was in her heyday in 2007,

186
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:57,091
I became stranded on a deserted island.

187
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:59,468
Then, I was rescued after 15 years.

188
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:03,556
She was still the same in my eyes.

189
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:06,434
But no one gave her
the recognition she deserved,

190
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:08,144
so it felt unfair to me.

191
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:12,440
It felt like even her agency
didn't appreciate her,

192
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,359
so I interfered.

193
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:22,783
If she took half of the shares,
would that make it feel fair for you?

194
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:28,289
No.

195
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:30,624
That wouldn't have been

196
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,168
nearly enough.

197
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,006
I want her

198
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:39,884
to remain a singer for a very long time.

199
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:42,261
I want her to be a singer

200
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:44,054
whose new songs climb the charts

201
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:46,724
and surpass those of other artists'.

202
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:49,518
She's being ridiculous.

203
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:52,188
-That's absurd.
-She's just saying that.

204
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:54,315
So one day…

205
00:12:57,485 --> 00:13:01,489
"Yoon Ran-joo isn't a risk to her agency."

206
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:06,160
"She's a legend."

207
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:09,497
I hope those kinds
of articles will be written.

208
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,714
What was that? Was she talking to me?

209
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:23,802
Do you believe
that day will come, Ms. Yoon?

210
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:33,270
No.

211
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:03,509
GIVER VS. TAKER

212
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,136
"Yoon Ran-joo wants

213
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,430
both the shares
and the top of the charts."

214
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,558
"Is the old star greedy
or just delusional?"

215
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:12,059
Damn it.

216
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:15,854
Why did they have to add the "old" part?

217
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:20,526
I'm going to print this article out

218
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:22,069
and carry it around with me.

219
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,280
Once you make it big again,

220
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,782
I'm going to read it
in front of this reporter.

221
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:30,494
For now, I'm going to avoid
all reporters like the plague and--

222
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:34,081
Goodness. Here comes the plague.

223
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,877
I believe you were talking about me.

224
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,379
I was just thanking you.

225
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:42,298
Now, there are many articles about me,

226
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,383
and it's great to finally trend for once.

227
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:45,801
It's my pleasure.

228
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:51,307
If you would've just fact-checked
with us before you wrote that article,

229
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,309
it would've been so much better, right?

230
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,561
It was based on what President Lee said.

231
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:57,521
Did I have to fact-check?

232
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,192
Based on what he said?

233
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,069
You leaked it?

234
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:06,280
That's not true.

235
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:09,700
You should've asked for an interview.

236
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:11,744
You can't write a story
from what you overhear.

237
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:13,203
Unbelievable.

238
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:16,290
Ran-joo.

239
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,588
It's not like I wrote lies.
Why are they so mad?

240
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:26,800
You took his side and wrote it.

241
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:27,885
That's not true.

242
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:30,554
A reporter doesn't side with anyone.

243
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,308
If I must, I side with the victim.

244
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,226
Call me if you need me.

245
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,197
SUNGJIN NEWS
CULTURE REPORTER BONG DU-HYEON

246
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:57,331
I didn't leak the information on purpose.

247
00:15:57,414 --> 00:16:00,167
He overheard me talk
at the golf course and wrote the story.

248
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,752
I would've stopped him had I known.

249
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:03,629
But it's true that you said it.

250
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:05,422
You think I'm a risk to your agency

251
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:07,049
and I'm dragging it down.

252
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,304
Am I wrong?

253
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:20,771
RJ had only four workers
when it was founded 15 years ago.

254
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:22,564
But now, there's over 100.

255
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:25,234
Do you think they decided
to work here because of you?

256
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:29,071
You couldn't have started
this company without me.

257
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,823
You wouldn't have come this far.

258
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:32,574
So how could you…

259
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:38,414
How could you treat me like trash?

260
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,417
What about you?

261
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:45,796
You just treated me like trash, too. No.

262
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:47,548
You always did.

263
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:50,968
-Me?
-I couldn't have started without you?

264
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:52,928
I wouldn't have come this far?

265
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,181
Then, what am I?

266
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:58,225
Trash?

267
00:16:58,308 --> 00:17:00,728
Yes. Did you just realize that?

268
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,859
The investors would beg to differ.

269
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:10,487
They'll only invest
if you're not a part of this company.

270
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:12,406
Because you'd only lower its value!

271
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:19,496
So which one of us is the real trash?

272
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:38,557
Once,

273
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:41,935
I visited a well-known fortune teller.

274
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:43,979
And the fortune teller told me

275
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,814
that I had the fate of a tree.

276
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:49,693
I'd offer shade and fruit

277
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:51,862
to those who'd come to me.

278
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:57,284
I'm jealous of your fate.

279
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:02,122
What for? It's a hell of an awful fate.

280
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:04,833
I'll just end up as firewood.

281
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:07,086
A giver.

282
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:10,214
I turned Lee Seo-jun into a CEO

283
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:12,132
and turned Eun Mo-rae into a star.

284
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:14,676
And now, they just take it for granted.

285
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:20,432
I guess it's true
that givers create takers.

286
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:28,899
CAREGIVER

287
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:32,069
Hello? Yes.

288
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:37,699
She saw the news, didn't she?

289
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:41,662
If not, then why is she doing worse?

290
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:44,623
Okay, I'll go there right now. Goodbye.

291
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,502
-Yong-gwan.
-I'll head straight to the nursing home.

292
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:56,760
That old woman.

293
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,265
What's gotten into her?

294
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:04,601
Why would dementia turn her into that?

295
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:07,187
Does she still think she's you?

296
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:08,272
Yeah.

297
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:12,234
Why me of all people?

298
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:16,280
It would've been better
if she thought she was Mo-rae.

299
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:22,536
Ran-joo.

300
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:23,704
What is it?

301
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:29,668
Do you not know why
you were named Yoon Ran-joo?

302
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:32,671
What do you mean?
She probably got it from a naming center.

303
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:37,009
Why do you ask? Did she say
my name determined my fate?

304
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:38,552
No, that's not why.

305
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:44,099
Remember when your mother
came to the rooftop room?

306
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,475
Of course, I do.

307
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,728
I was looking everywhere for her.

308
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:52,316
That's when she told me…

309
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:06,663
DAFFODIL

310
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,551
The reason you were named

311
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:21,970
Yoon Ran-joo.

312
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:25,849
Yoon Ran-joo!

313
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:28,435
-Yoon Ran-joo!
-Yoon Ran-joo!

314
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:30,437
-Encore!
-Yoon Ran-joo!

315
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:32,773
Thank you.

316
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,281
Mom?

317
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:45,911
Mom?

318
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:56,338
Mom.

319
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:58,298
Hi.

320
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:00,509
Mom.

321
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:04,012
What's your name?

322
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:05,555
My name?

323
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:08,558
It's Yoon Ran-joo, of course.

324
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:10,852
Then, what about Ko San-hee?

325
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:12,479
That's…

326
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,148
my real name.

327
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,484
Then, why are you Yoon Ran-joo?

328
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:21,280
That was my stage name

329
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:25,284
for when I became a singer.

330
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:29,746
Then, why didn't you become one?

331
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:43,802
Because I was suddenly blessed
with a beautiful gift.

332
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,181
Did you make it yet?

333
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:50,058
I'm almost done.

334
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,103
Here it is.

335
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:54,021
There it is.

336
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:58,608
Is it good?

337
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:00,569
Goodness, you eat so well.

338
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,780
What a good eater.

339
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,241
You can bet your life on her.

340
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,953
She'll be performing
on stage until she's 60.

341
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:11,079
Do you mean that?

342
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:27,304
HEYDAY AGAIN

343
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:50,577
You shouldn't have given up.

344
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,330
It must've broken your heart.

345
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:03,215
You were the one who was the giver.

346
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,553
And I was the taker.

347
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:12,140
Why are you a taker?

348
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:15,811
You're a gift.

349
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:31,076
When I was little…

350
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,372
you'd always sing that song for me.

351
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,042
Was that your song?

352
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:48,468
But…

353
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:53,306
I don't remember the lyrics.

354
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:57,060
I keep dreaming of it,

355
00:23:58,436 --> 00:24:00,105
but I can't remember the lyrics.

356
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:37,392
"Seo Mok-ha,
RJ Entertainment's Real Risk."

357
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:38,393
"Maker--"

358
00:24:38,476 --> 00:24:39,853
"Maker of Ludicrous Remarks."

359
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:41,771
"Dislike."

360
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:44,357
Have you seen this article?

361
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:45,609
Yeah.

362
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:47,903
They put this awful headline
just for clicks.

363
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:52,365
I feel disgusted as a fellow reporter.

364
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,828
Mok-ha must be having a tough time.

365
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:59,539
She hasn't even debuted,
and they're already bashing her.

366
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:00,624
Right.

367
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,418
Why don't you reach out to her?

368
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:06,880
I told you.

369
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:08,965
I'm not going to do that.

370
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:17,265
I think he's being careful,
because of the questioning.

371
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,811
He may not look like it,
but he's still a kid.

372
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:23,063
He has this much courage.

373
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:27,275
When is the interview?

374
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:28,860
Monday at 2 p.m.

375
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:31,905
What's the charge?

376
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:33,698
I'm not sure.

377
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:37,494
Our dad is guilty of fabricating
official documents.

378
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:39,496
But too much time has passed.

379
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:41,665
The problem is

380
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:44,459
every time he used the fabricated ID,
he committed a crime.

381
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,211
Every time?

382
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:47,879
Yeah.

383
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,131
He's been charged with a lot of crimes.

384
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:53,468
Falsifying information
on official documents.

385
00:25:53,551 --> 00:25:55,428
Use of fabricated official documents.

386
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:57,180
Forgery of private documents.

387
00:25:57,764 --> 00:25:59,557
Then, so…

388
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:01,768
How do you think things will turn out?

389
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,939
He'll either get off light or serve time.

390
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:07,983
Our house, salon,

391
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,277
and all the money we've saved

392
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:12,320
can also be taken away.

393
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:14,781
What about your job?

394
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:17,492
I've already resigned.

395
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:24,666
Bo-geol.

396
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:26,668
Ki-ho.

397
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:29,129
Come on out. I'll drive you home.

398
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:49,649
You told me to come
if I ever felt stifled.

399
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:51,985
That's why I came.

400
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:54,612
Because it felt suffocating.

401
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:57,532
I was worried.

402
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:23,892
You heard from Woo-hak, right?

403
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:26,436
We'll have to wait
for the results to be sure,

404
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:28,229
but it's very likely we'll serve time.

405
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:32,359
Then, it won't do us any good
if we're seen together.

406
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,320
So from now on--

407
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:37,030
I still have those feelings too.

408
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:39,240
Even to this day.

409
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:40,992
What do you mean?

410
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:42,077
Well…

411
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:45,121
I couldn't answer last time.

412
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:47,457
So I'm doing it now.

413
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:53,213
The past series of events have told me

414
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:54,923
you two used to be fond of each other.

415
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:56,007
So tell me.

416
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:58,635
Do you still have those feelings?

417
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:01,221
Goodness. Not at all.

418
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,474
Yes, I still do.

419
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,810
It'd be weird if I didn't.

420
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:08,645
What kind of lunatic searches 15 years

421
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:10,230
for someone he's uninterested in?

422
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:15,151
Of course, I do.

423
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:19,114
What kind of lunatic remembers

424
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:23,368
and cares about someone
she's uninterested in for 15 years?

425
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:26,621
Why are you telling me this right now?

426
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,583
Because this is the best timing.

427
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:33,670
It won't sound as sincere
if I say it after results.

428
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:36,840
No matter what the ruling may be,

429
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:39,759
I won't give up on you.

430
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,595
That's all you need to know.

431
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:46,099
I might have to serve time.

432
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:47,600
I don't care.

433
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:49,144
I could lose everything.

434
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:50,645
Did you forget?

435
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,689
I said 15 years ago

436
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:54,774
that I'd take care of you.

437
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:00,613
I'll stay strong.

438
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:02,699
So be honest

439
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:04,743
and tell the prosecutor

440
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:07,036
everything you want to say.

441
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:29,726
I emailed you the storyboard
for the music video, so check it.

442
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:32,520
It wasn't easy to borrow the set.
We won't have much time.

443
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,939
Make sure you study this. Got it?

444
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:24,948
AS IF IT'S YOUR LAST DAY

445
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:50,640
Young-ju.

446
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:54,394
Doctor,

447
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:56,688
can I hit him?

448
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:58,147
Of course not.

449
00:30:58,231 --> 00:31:00,567
He may be awake,
but he still needs to recover.

450
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:02,735
Rest up.

451
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:10,493
How long was I out for?

452
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:14,205
What do you think?

453
00:31:15,748 --> 00:31:16,749
Two days?

454
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:18,293
Three days?

455
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:21,671
Unbelievable.

456
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:23,923
Four months.

457
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:26,092
It's been over four months.

458
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:27,385
Jeez.

459
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:28,970
Four months?

460
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,641
You idiot.

461
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:38,813
I thought I'd end up a widow.

462
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,610
I'm sorry.

463
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:56,915
Mom.

464
00:31:57,457 --> 00:32:00,293
Were you happy
when people said I sang well?

465
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:09,260
You must think it's so unfair.

466
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:12,555
You sacrificed your life for me.

467
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:16,017
But look at me now.

468
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:18,937
At the concert…

469
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:23,274
what song are you going to sing?

470
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,281
I'm not sure.

471
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:33,201
What song should I sing?

472
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:43,378
Do I need to wear a tie
for the questioning?

473
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:45,129
Shouldn't I dress as I normally do?

474
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:47,966
You have to dress up
like this for an interview.

475
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:50,843
Goodness. Much better.

476
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:54,389
I rarely wore ties
even as a civil servant.

477
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:56,683
Honey.

478
00:32:58,101 --> 00:32:59,978
When we met at the office that day,

479
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:03,147
don't you regret following me out?

480
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:04,816
I don't.

481
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:06,776
You should say you do.

482
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:09,153
If you could turn back time,

483
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:11,447
say you would never do it.

484
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:13,783
Then they'll reduce the charges.

485
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:19,080
If I could turn back time,

486
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:22,041
I'd follow you out sooner.

487
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:27,380
You're unbelievable.

488
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:42,895
Let's go.

489
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:04,143
Mr. Kang Sang-doo, Ms. Song Ha-jung.

490
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:05,144
Yes.

491
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:06,729
-Ms. Song?
-Yes.

492
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:07,814
This way.

493
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,661
Oh, dear.

494
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,037
My goodness.

495
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,623
I was happy to hear
that my boss gave me a case.

496
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:27,333
But look how thick this case file is.

497
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:30,878
He must really adore you.

498
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:32,463
What is love?

499
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:36,592
Right.

500
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:40,346
Mr. Jung Bong-wan is here.

501
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:43,933
This way.

502
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:47,311
Sit over there.

503
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:58,281
Let me confirm your names first.

504
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,658
Your real name is Lee Uk.

505
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:02,994
Current name is Kang Sang-doo. Correct?

506
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:04,412
Yes, sir.

507
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:07,665
Your real name is Yang Jae-kyung.

508
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:09,500
Current name is Song Ha-jung.

509
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:11,043
Yes, sir.

510
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:15,756
You're her ex-husband, Jung Bong-wan.

511
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:17,592
I'm still her husband.

512
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:21,012
We never got a divorce.

513
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:23,806
You're right.

514
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:24,974
I understand.

515
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:27,727
I'll address you by your real names.

516
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:29,145
Would that be okay?

517
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:30,229
Yes, sir.

518
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:56,547
Who proposed stealing the identities?

519
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:57,882
I did.

520
00:36:57,965 --> 00:37:00,009
You were a civil servant back then.

521
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:01,344
Did you not know it's illegal?

522
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:02,678
I was aware.

523
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:04,513
But I still proposed it.

524
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:07,975
Did the rest of the family know?

525
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:12,230
My oldest child, Chae-ho,

526
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,232
had hurt his head.

527
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:17,276
He lost his memory, so he had no idea.

528
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:20,071
-And I--
-She didn't know either.

529
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:21,155
And Bo-geol--

530
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:23,532
I mean, Ki-ho didn't know either.

531
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:26,202
He probably thought
we'd just changed our names.

532
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:27,203
He's lying.

533
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:29,372
They all knew.

534
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:32,750
Not only did they change
their names but also their ages.

535
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:35,878
Who changes their ages
alongside their names?

536
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:39,590
Ms. Yang.

537
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:41,592
Please answer again.

538
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:44,136
Whether you knew it or not
makes a big difference.

539
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:46,514
Please be honest.

540
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:49,767
I knew.

541
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:51,644
I knew…

542
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:55,606
and so did Ki-ho.

543
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:00,861
Okay.

544
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,366
That prosecutor is a lunatic.

545
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:06,784
Be quiet.

546
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,328
-People will hear you.
-It's just too weird.

547
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:11,831
We've confessed, so why does he
want to cross-examine?

548
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:15,209
Maybe he's on his side.

549
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:27,972
It says you already confessed, Mr. Lee.

550
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:29,807
Yes, sir.

551
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:32,518
Yet you still pressed charges.
What is your reason?

552
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:33,936
Because I'm the victim.

553
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:38,024
I was the head of the household.
And my family was stolen from me.

554
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:42,153
We're talking about my family,
not some object I own.

555
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:45,072
How could I forget them?

556
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:48,784
Is that why you stalked them?

557
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:56,167
I was only striving to find my family.

558
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,461
"Stalking"?

559
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:02,298
What a heartless way to describe it.

560
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:04,300
Based on this record,

561
00:39:04,383 --> 00:39:07,428
your family ran away
due to domestic abuse.

562
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:08,512
That's right.

563
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:10,556
But that was 15 years ago.

564
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:14,310
Back then, I wasn't the best father.

565
00:39:14,393 --> 00:39:16,771
I very much regretted
what I did these past 15 years.

566
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:18,189
I felt great remorse too.

567
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:20,191
I want to show them I've changed,

568
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:23,569
but I didn't have the chance to.

569
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:28,115
Is that why you went to their salon
and caused a ruckus?

570
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,700
Even the police were called.

571
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:31,285
It's a misunderstanding.

572
00:39:31,994 --> 00:39:34,622
I thought this man had stolen my family.

573
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:37,416
So I went there to confront him.

574
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:42,671
You'll know from the CCTV footage

575
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:45,841
that Chae-ho was the one
using violence, not me.

576
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:48,552
He even choked me.

577
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:49,678
How dare you--

578
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:51,639
If your son choked you,

579
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:53,265
that's parental abuse.

580
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:54,975
No. He didn't assault him.

581
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:58,312
Chae-ho only grabbed
his collar while defending me.

582
00:39:58,396 --> 00:39:59,814
He was trying to protect me.

583
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:01,607
What was it called? Self-protect--

584
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:04,318
It was self-defense.

585
00:40:06,862 --> 00:40:10,241
Mr. Jung, do you want your son
to be punished for parental abuse?

586
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:11,575
Correct.

587
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:13,994
You wanted your family back.

588
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:16,247
-So you filed charges on them?
-Correct.

589
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:20,418
You also want to show them
you've been remorseful and full of regret?

590
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:21,877
Yes, that's correct.

591
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:25,589
Then, this is the best opportunity
for you to do that.

592
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:32,596
But you're blowing your chance.

593
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:39,186
You don't want to show regret and remorse.

594
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,564
I think you just want
to punish them severely.

595
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:43,816
Am I right?

596
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,785
If one's committed a wrongdoing,

597
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:58,622
I believe they deserve to be punished.

598
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:00,082
And only then

599
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:03,502
will I be able to show
my regret and remorse.

600
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:05,212
-And--
-One person

601
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,923
is lying to protect his children,

602
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:12,386
while the other is lying to punish them.

603
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:14,555
Then, which one do you think

604
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:17,850
is the real father?

605
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:39,079
Please take a seat.

606
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,332
-Mr. Kang Bo-geol, Mr. Kang Woo-hak.
-Yes.

607
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:42,249
Please come in.

608
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:58,098
You did well.

609
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:02,978
I'm someone

610
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:05,147
who's decided to give
his own life for his sons.

611
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:07,316
Do you see those insurance documents?

612
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:10,528
They'll receive
more than 100 million won when I die.

613
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:12,613
Do you still doubt my love for them?

614
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:15,533
I was going to ask you anyway.

615
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:20,079
Mr. Han Dae-woong
is your insurance broker.

616
00:42:21,288 --> 00:42:22,206
Dae-woong?

617
00:42:22,289 --> 00:42:23,457
Yes. You know him, right?

618
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:26,544
Yes, we went to the same middle school.

619
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:31,882
He got into a car accident
right after meeting with Mr. Jung.

620
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:33,050
Were you aware of this?

621
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:34,760
A car accident?

622
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:37,805
Was he badly hurt?

623
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:40,224
Yes, he's been unconscious
for four months now.

624
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:44,061
I took out three different insurances
because he's my son's friend.

625
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:48,107
He's like a son to me,
so why would I harm him?

626
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:51,193
I never said you did.

627
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:58,951
You said he got into an accident
right after seeing me so…

628
00:43:01,453 --> 00:43:02,830
Ask him once he wakes up.

629
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:05,082
He had visited that day

630
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:08,919
to thank me, and he even a brought gift.

631
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:10,546
You can ask him right now.

632
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:17,344
I covered that news four months ago.

633
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:21,515
Yesterday,

634
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,976
Mr. Han's wife told me that he woke up.

635
00:43:25,185 --> 00:43:27,187
What a relief.

636
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:30,941
Why didn't you tell me?

637
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:32,693
His wife told me not to.

638
00:43:34,236 --> 00:43:36,864
She thought it would be dangerous
if he found out.

639
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:41,452
Can Mr. Han give me his statement
over the phone right now?

640
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:42,536
Yes.

641
00:43:43,245 --> 00:43:44,246
Aren't we here

642
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:48,876
to question them for identity theft?

643
00:43:49,835 --> 00:43:51,503
Why bring up that other case now?

644
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:53,130
That's not related to this.

645
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:57,384
Let's find out if that's the case
after we talk with him.

646
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,777
They didn't say it'd rain today.

647
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:17,905
We don't have an umbrella.
What should we do?

648
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:25,954
Okay.

649
00:44:26,413 --> 00:44:27,873
Sir, Mr. Han is on the phone.

650
00:44:27,956 --> 00:44:28,832
Okay.

651
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:33,754
Mr. Han?

652
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:36,006
-Hello?
-Hello?

653
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:37,299
Dae-woong, are you okay?

654
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:39,176
Are you badly hurt?

655
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:40,511
Is that you, Ki-ho?

656
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:42,012
Yeah.

657
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:43,639
It's me. Ki-ho.

658
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:45,933
I heard your father is with you right now.

659
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:47,518
Don't let him near you.

660
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:48,894
He could hurt you.

661
00:44:48,977 --> 00:44:50,854
You can catch up later.

662
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:53,649
Mr. Han, I'm Prosecutor Lee Ji-gwang.

663
00:44:54,274 --> 00:44:56,527
I have a few questions
regarding this case.

664
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:57,945
All right.

665
00:44:58,028 --> 00:45:01,156
Did you meet with Mr. Jung Bong-wan
before the accident?

666
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,242
Yes, I did.

667
00:45:03,325 --> 00:45:04,451
I know it was a while ago,

668
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:07,287
but do you remember what you talked about?

669
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:09,665
It may have been a long time for others,

670
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:12,167
but it feels like yesterday to me.

671
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:14,711
I still remember everything vividly.

672
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:18,674
Ki-ho, have you met your father
at Seoul Station before?

673
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:22,136
Yeah, I have.

674
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:23,804
He met with me right afterward.

675
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:26,890
And he said…

676
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:28,475
-Dae-woong.
-Yes?

677
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:31,478
If he saw me as his father
and ran, he's a bad son.

678
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:34,231
If he saw me as an officer
and ran, then he must be guilty.

679
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:36,358
Either way, I must catch him.

680
00:45:36,942 --> 00:45:37,943
Mr. Jung.

681
00:45:38,026 --> 00:45:39,111
Ki-ho didn't run away

682
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:41,572
because he was scared of you.

683
00:45:41,655 --> 00:45:43,073
So please.

684
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:49,121
Please, sir. Don't look for him. Okay?

685
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,499
That's what he said word for word.

686
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:55,836
And you had a car accident
immediately after that, right?

687
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:56,920
How did it happen?

688
00:45:57,713 --> 00:45:58,714
Well…

689
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:00,841
I was driving.

690
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:04,511
Then, dozens of hornets
appeared inside the car

691
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:06,555
and started to attack me.

692
00:46:07,306 --> 00:46:09,141
I was meaning to stop the car,

693
00:46:09,641 --> 00:46:11,560
but I must've gotten stung.

694
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:14,104
The inside of my mouth
started to swell up,

695
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:16,565
and my vision became blurry.

696
00:46:17,649 --> 00:46:19,526
The dashcam footage showed

697
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:23,238
that it was Mr. Jung
who put the hornets in the car.

698
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:26,366
What do you say?

699
00:46:27,075 --> 00:46:30,037
I think this proves
that this case is very much related.

700
00:46:37,794 --> 00:46:39,254
Hello.

701
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:50,224
Since Mr. Jung Chae-ho
has no memory of that time,

702
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:53,143
I'll ask Mr. Jung Ki-ho one last question.

703
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:58,482
Were you aware
that Mr. Lee had committed identity theft?

704
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:06,949
Yes, I was.

705
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:10,244
Was there no other option?

706
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:12,371
You could've legally changed your names.

707
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:14,414
If we did,

708
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:18,085
he would've found us
just by requesting our records.

709
00:47:19,044 --> 00:47:20,796
After changing your names,

710
00:47:20,879 --> 00:47:23,590
you could've filed a request
to prevent him from finding you.

711
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:24,841
That would've worked.

712
00:47:24,925 --> 00:47:25,884
That law

713
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:28,720
didn't exist back then.

714
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:33,016
If that law had existed
15 years ago, then our father…

715
00:47:36,436 --> 00:47:38,397
wouldn't have committed identity theft.

716
00:47:41,316 --> 00:47:42,317
Our father…

717
00:47:45,237 --> 00:47:46,697
wanted to protect us,

718
00:47:47,656 --> 00:47:49,449
so he had no other choice.

719
00:48:07,634 --> 00:48:09,428
When will they tell us result?

720
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:11,430
I'm not sure.

721
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:13,849
It could be as early as a few days

722
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:15,475
or as late as a few months.

723
00:48:16,351 --> 00:48:17,352
No one knows.

724
00:48:24,526 --> 00:48:26,653
Goodness, it's raining cats and dogs.

725
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:28,739
Wait here.

726
00:48:28,822 --> 00:48:30,616
I'll go buy some umbrellas.

727
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:41,376
Good job.

728
00:48:46,965 --> 00:48:48,383
You all did well.

729
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:51,053
Good job.

730
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:32,094
Honey.

731
00:50:13,009 --> 00:50:16,012
I'd like you to do
Mok-ha's hair like this.

732
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:19,975
Mok-ha, take a look at this.

733
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:25,939
-Please do her hair.
-Okay.

734
00:50:26,022 --> 00:50:27,357
What are you talking about?

735
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:32,487
AS IF TODAY WAS YOUR LAST DAY

736
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:14,112
You know Yong-gwan jumped
through hoops to borrow this place, right?

737
00:51:14,821 --> 00:51:18,909
Make sure to give it your best.

738
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:24,873
Let's talk about love

739
00:51:57,906 --> 00:51:59,783
As if it's your last time

740
00:52:00,992 --> 00:52:04,663
As if today was your last day

741
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:13,755
Show your love

742
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:19,052
Shout it passionately out loud

743
00:52:20,512 --> 00:52:23,598
If you're not loving

744
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:27,102
You're not living

745
00:52:28,353 --> 00:52:31,356
We're out of time now

746
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:37,320
So as if we're praying

747
00:52:38,905 --> 00:52:42,075
In front of this candle of life

748
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:44,202
That could burn out

749
00:52:45,036 --> 00:52:47,497
Let's talk about love

750
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:08,810
Yes.

751
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:11,479
Those were the lyrics.

752
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:14,524
This was it.

753
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:50,393
After all we did to borrow this set,

754
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:52,812
how could you waste it like this?

755
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:56,483
I don't think I wasted it.

756
00:53:56,566 --> 00:53:57,984
This was very nice of you,

757
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:03,573
but you won't ever succeed
if you keep yielding to others.

758
00:54:04,699 --> 00:54:05,700
Ran-joo.

759
00:54:06,618 --> 00:54:08,787
Back when I lived on Chunsam Island,

760
00:54:09,704 --> 00:54:11,623
Ki-ho once asked me something.

761
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:15,085
He asked me what I'd do once I met you.

762
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:18,004
So I told him

763
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:22,217
I'd be focused as I sing.

764
00:54:23,885 --> 00:54:25,053
And you did just that.

765
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:29,849
So you successfully sing
in front of Yoon Ran-joo.

766
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:31,059
Then what?

767
00:54:31,142 --> 00:54:32,227
"Then what?"

768
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:37,816
Then…

769
00:54:41,486 --> 00:54:42,487
It's a secret.

770
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:47,659
Then what?

771
00:54:47,742 --> 00:54:49,119
And then…

772
00:54:51,579 --> 00:54:52,664
I was going to say

773
00:54:53,915 --> 00:54:55,500
that I wanted to be like you.

774
00:54:56,418 --> 00:54:58,086
That's what I wanted to tell you.

775
00:54:59,004 --> 00:55:01,673
I'd say I wanted
to become a singer like you.

776
00:55:05,927 --> 00:55:07,220
And what kind of singer is that?

777
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:10,015
Someone who made her mom
give up on her dream?

778
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:14,185
I didn't know what kind
of singer you were back then.

779
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:19,232
You were just a famous singer in my eyes.

780
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:21,609
But today,

781
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:25,321
it's finally become crystal clear

782
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:28,324
what kind of singer I want to be.

783
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:31,745
And what's that?

784
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:37,000
I can't explain it in words.

785
00:55:37,792 --> 00:55:42,255
Just exactly the type
of singer you were today.

786
00:55:43,923 --> 00:55:44,924
What are you talking about?

787
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:50,764
When I lost my voice, I thought,

788
00:55:50,847 --> 00:55:52,891
"I love singing,

789
00:55:54,934 --> 00:55:56,728
but singing doesn't love me back."

790
00:55:58,396 --> 00:56:01,191
"That's why it has abandoned me."

791
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:05,236
But after seeing my mom today…

792
00:56:09,365 --> 00:56:11,785
I realized I could never
give up on singing.

793
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:20,835
What choice do I have?

794
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:23,588
I'll have to keep pursuing it.

795
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:43,900
BROTHERS SALON

796
00:56:44,025 --> 00:56:47,779
TEMPORARILY CLOSED

797
00:56:47,862 --> 00:56:49,322
All right.

798
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:52,951
Okay.

799
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:55,703
How great is this?

800
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:58,289
I have no customers
at this hour on a weekday.

801
00:56:58,373 --> 00:56:59,916
And I get to trim your hair.

802
00:57:00,416 --> 00:57:02,544
This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance.

803
00:57:02,627 --> 00:57:03,628
Right.

804
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:06,631
This will be our last time
if we end up behind bars.

805
00:57:06,714 --> 00:57:08,383
You and your tongue.

806
00:57:08,466 --> 00:57:09,467
You fool.

807
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:12,679
Why ruin the moment
with something that hasn't even happened?

808
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:13,972
Enjoy it!

809
00:57:14,055 --> 00:57:15,598
Enjoy it like a man.

810
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:18,268
Enjoy this leisurely time like me--

811
00:57:18,351 --> 00:57:19,352
Honey.

812
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:21,229
We got mail.

813
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:24,357
What? Okay.

814
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,202
Thank you.

815
00:57:40,081 --> 00:57:41,082
What is it?

816
00:57:42,208 --> 00:57:45,795
My credit card expired,
so I ordered a new one.

817
00:57:47,922 --> 00:57:49,757
-Dad!
-Honey!

818
00:57:52,093 --> 00:57:54,429
Let's go trim your hair.

819
00:57:55,263 --> 00:57:56,431
I'll finish it for you.

820
00:58:04,689 --> 00:58:05,982
-What's wrong?
-Wait--

821
00:58:06,065 --> 00:58:07,775
It's three years, not four.

822
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:08,776
Okay.

823
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:10,737
And add a link to the music video below.

824
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:11,696
All right.

825
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:15,575
But Mr. Park, I thought
you were on Eun Mo-rae's team.

826
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:16,993
When you email the reporters,

827
00:58:17,577 --> 00:58:18,828
don't forget to include him.

828
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:20,330
Yes, sir.

"Yoon Ran-joo is No Longer a Risk
to RJ But a Legend."

834
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:22,642
I love the articles.

835
00:59:24,769 --> 00:59:29,315
"Yoon Ran-joo's new single
is climbing the charts."

836
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:34,737
"Her new song 'As If Today Was
Your Last Day' was released on the 16th,

837
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:39,158
and it has been well-received
by the public as it climbs the charts."

838
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:44,914
"Music critic Ahn Ju-seong
praised the song,

839
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:47,375
saying only Yoon Ran-joo

840
00:59:47,458 --> 00:59:50,837
could sing it with the right feel."

"'As If Today Was Your Last Day'

Yong-gwan.

844
01:00:16,487 --> 01:00:19,407
What rank is our song right now?

845
01:00:19,490 --> 01:00:22,201
Well, it differs for every chart,

846
01:00:23,369 --> 01:00:24,954
but it's always in the top ten.

847
01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:30,376
My mom is going to get so many royalties.

848
01:00:32,503 --> 01:00:34,464
It's a shame she didn't get to know that.

849
01:00:37,717 --> 01:00:39,093
I'm sure now

850
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:41,846
she'll keep watching over you
from the heavens.

851
01:00:56,152 --> 01:00:57,695
Do you think my mom's life…

852
01:01:06,537 --> 01:01:08,331
had a happy ending?

853
01:01:14,587 --> 01:01:16,881
You just need a happy ending.

854
01:01:18,466 --> 01:01:21,094
The person who completes her story

855
01:01:22,261 --> 01:01:23,262
is you.

856
01:01:34,607 --> 01:01:35,608
You're…

857
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:40,071
really incredible.

858
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:43,241
I am?

859
01:02:09,767 --> 01:02:11,477
Please write your name here.

860
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:12,979
Okay.

861
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:15,732
-Thank you.
-Have a nice day.

862
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:26,784
Is it from the prosecution?

863
01:02:27,493 --> 01:02:28,494
Yes.

864
01:02:37,336 --> 01:02:38,963
I hope it just ends here.

865
01:02:40,465 --> 01:02:42,592
Going to trial would be terrible.

866
01:02:42,675 --> 01:02:45,136
We can't help it if we do though.

Hello?

869
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:16,667
It's me. Ki-ho.

870
01:03:18,336 --> 01:03:20,213
The prosecutors' office sent us a notice.

871
01:03:29,597 --> 01:03:32,975
FROM SEOUL HANGANG PROSECUTORS' OFFICE
TO JUNG BONG-WAN

872
01:03:58,918 --> 01:03:59,752
Ran-joo.

873
01:04:00,878 --> 01:04:02,630
This won't open. What should I do?

874
01:04:03,339 --> 01:04:04,173
Is it locked?

875
01:04:05,883 --> 01:04:06,717
Yes.

876
01:04:07,468 --> 01:04:08,302
Do you have the key?

877
01:04:08,386 --> 01:04:09,887
No, I don't--

878
01:04:12,515 --> 01:04:13,766
One minute.

879
01:04:25,444 --> 01:04:27,655
DIARY
APRIL TO MAY 1970

880
01:04:35,288 --> 01:04:36,831
I think it's her diary.

881
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:41,919
There are old letters too.

882
01:04:47,258 --> 01:04:48,301
What is this?

883
01:04:58,603 --> 01:05:01,105
It looks like this document
had been shredded.

884
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:04,191
What kind of document is this?

885
01:05:06,152 --> 01:05:07,194
Hello, President Lee.

886
01:05:07,278 --> 01:05:08,279
Hello. Come on in.

887
01:05:09,030 --> 01:05:10,865
-It's nice to see you.
-Likewise.

888
01:05:10,948 --> 01:05:12,116
This way, please.

889
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:13,910
Hello.

890
01:05:18,289 --> 01:05:19,290
May I?

891
01:05:24,837 --> 01:05:26,964
I think this is
an overseas export invoice.

892
01:05:27,965 --> 01:05:28,966
What?

893
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:32,845
Didn't you release a Japanese album once?

894
01:05:33,888 --> 01:05:34,889
Yes, I did.

895
01:05:35,806 --> 01:05:37,475
I think it's been about a decade.

896
01:05:38,017 --> 01:05:40,978
The drama with my song
on its soundtrack was a hit there. Why?

897
01:05:41,479 --> 01:05:43,105
Wasn't your album in the market?

898
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:45,274
Was it?

899
01:05:46,275 --> 01:05:47,777
I think this is the invoice.

900
01:05:48,736 --> 01:05:50,821
But why would my mom…

901
01:05:54,116 --> 01:05:56,202
Don't let

902
01:05:57,286 --> 01:05:59,914
President Lee find out about it.

903
01:06:04,752 --> 01:06:05,920
How many were sold?

904
01:06:06,712 --> 01:06:10,424
About 140,000 albums.

905
01:06:12,927 --> 01:06:14,345
Doesn't this mean

906
01:06:15,930 --> 01:06:18,474
you sold over 20 million a long time ago?

907
01:06:20,101 --> 01:06:21,143
No way.

908
01:06:21,227 --> 01:06:23,354
Did President Lee
purposely leave this out?

909
01:06:24,897 --> 01:06:25,982
Just for the shares?

910
01:06:33,948 --> 01:06:35,324
In life…

911
01:06:37,118 --> 01:06:38,369
SHARE SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT

912
01:06:38,452 --> 01:06:42,790
you'll learn that some people become happy
over other people's misfortunes.

913
01:06:43,541 --> 01:06:47,086
Please let me know if you'd like to
revise anything in the contract.

914
01:06:49,046 --> 01:06:50,506
You'll learn

915
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:54,176
that many become jealous
of other people's successes.

916
01:06:55,803 --> 01:06:56,804
That's because…

917
01:06:57,805 --> 01:06:59,765
when their lives become pathetic,

918
01:07:00,599 --> 01:07:02,852
they refuse to blame themselves.

919
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:22,580
That's why they blame it on others

920
01:07:24,165 --> 01:07:25,791
and want to bring them down.

921
01:07:26,584 --> 01:07:28,085
Because that's easier.

922
01:07:42,475 --> 01:07:43,726
Goodness!

923
01:07:43,809 --> 01:07:44,894
We did it!

NOTICE OF CASE RESULT

925
01:07:52,943 --> 01:07:56,739
It's extremely difficult
to sincerely root for other people.

926
01:07:56,864 --> 01:07:59,617
NO CHARGES
LACK OF EVIDENCE

927
01:08:12,379 --> 01:08:13,714
And it's even harder

928
01:08:14,673 --> 01:08:16,300
to be genuinely happy for others

929
01:08:17,343 --> 01:08:21,138
without feeling any jealousy
or expecting anything in return.

930
01:10:14,084 --> 01:10:15,544
Mok-ha, that's the reason why

931
01:10:17,713 --> 01:10:18,923
you're incredible.

932
01:10:23,552 --> 01:10:24,845
Let's see.

933
01:10:26,722 --> 01:10:28,599
Are the colors too similar?

934
01:10:28,682 --> 01:10:29,683
It's too tacky.

935
01:10:30,351 --> 01:10:31,477
This one too.

936
01:10:32,436 --> 01:10:33,479
Pick the best one.

937
01:10:34,271 --> 01:10:35,105
Goodness.

938
01:10:35,189 --> 01:10:36,398
Gosh, let me get it.

939
01:10:38,442 --> 01:10:39,526
Mok-ha.

940
01:10:39,610 --> 01:10:41,779
Mok-ha!

941
01:10:41,862 --> 01:10:43,864
Goodness, I can't believe this.

942
01:10:43,948 --> 01:10:44,949
Is it you, Young-ju?

943
01:10:46,033 --> 01:10:47,660
Yes, it's me. Moon Young-ju!

944
01:10:47,743 --> 01:10:51,205
Goodness, Young-ju!

945
01:10:51,872 --> 01:10:54,124
Goodness! I heard the news!

946
01:10:54,208 --> 01:10:55,709
You're married now!

947
01:10:55,793 --> 01:10:58,295
How did you survive
on that dangerous island?

948
01:10:58,379 --> 01:11:00,965
What took you so long to reach out?

949
01:11:01,048 --> 01:11:03,133
I was dying to reach out to you!

950
01:11:04,009 --> 01:11:06,887
How's Dae-woong?
I heard he was badly hurt!

951
01:11:07,388 --> 01:11:08,681
-Dae-woong?
-Yeah.

952
01:11:09,181 --> 01:11:10,224
Goodness, Dae-woong.

953
01:11:10,724 --> 01:11:12,226
-Goodness.
-What's going on?

954
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:15,604
Dae-woong.

955
01:11:15,688 --> 01:11:17,523
Mok-ha. Ki-ho.

956
01:11:17,606 --> 01:11:19,525
Are you okay? Can you walk?

957
01:11:19,608 --> 01:11:22,695
I've been putting my all
into rehabilitation.

958
01:11:22,778 --> 01:11:24,613
I heard you didn't have to go to trial.

959
01:11:24,697 --> 01:11:26,407
I'm truly happy for you.

960
01:11:29,618 --> 01:11:30,577
All right.

961
01:11:30,661 --> 01:11:32,663
Let's not be all huddled up at the door.

962
01:11:32,788 --> 01:11:36,041
Why don't you come inside and chat?

963
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:38,460
Goodness.
I really wanted to see you, ma'am.

964
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:42,965
It's nice to meet you.
I'm Mok-ha's friend, Moon Young-ju.

965
01:11:43,841 --> 01:11:44,758
Nice to meet you.

966
01:11:44,842 --> 01:11:47,219
Gosh, come on in.

967
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:49,221
Yes. Come on in.

968
01:11:49,305 --> 01:11:51,348
Goodness, poor Dae-woong.

969
01:11:57,479 --> 01:11:58,939
This one is pretty.

970
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:00,399
I'll take this one.

971
01:12:00,482 --> 01:12:01,567
The biggest cake with fruit.

972
01:12:02,109 --> 01:12:03,027
-This one?
-Yes.

973
01:12:06,155 --> 01:12:07,823
-That'll be 62,000 won.
-Okay.

974
01:12:09,450 --> 01:12:11,243
LETTERING SERVICE

975
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:12,578
Could you write something

976
01:12:13,412 --> 01:12:14,997
on the cake for me too?

977
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:16,165
Of course.

978
01:12:16,248 --> 01:12:17,624
You can write it down here.

979
01:12:17,708 --> 01:12:20,294
Okay. One moment, please.

980
01:12:30,679 --> 01:12:31,680
Here you go.

981
01:12:34,391 --> 01:12:36,560
-Did you pick one?
-You startled me!

982
01:12:36,643 --> 01:12:38,312
What are you doing here?

983
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:40,356
It's raining.

984
01:12:40,439 --> 01:12:41,940
Jeez.

985
01:12:42,024 --> 01:12:43,859
You almost gave me a heart attack.

986
01:12:43,942 --> 01:12:45,736
-Which one did you get?
-It's a secret.

987
01:12:46,403 --> 01:12:48,364
-Which one?
-Just eat it later.

988
01:12:48,947 --> 01:12:51,367
-I mean, I will eat it.
-Just eat the cake.

989
01:12:52,785 --> 01:12:54,370
Why are you all upset?

990
01:12:54,453 --> 01:12:55,412
You scared me.

991
01:12:57,581 --> 01:13:01,210
Why didn't Woo-hak tell us
when he already knew?

992
01:13:01,293 --> 01:13:02,920
I told him not to.

993
01:13:03,545 --> 01:13:04,797
I made him promise me.

994
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:05,839
Why?

995
01:13:07,216 --> 01:13:08,926
I was terrified of Mr. Jung,

996
01:13:09,802 --> 01:13:11,512
and Dae-woong still wasn't stable.

997
01:13:11,595 --> 01:13:13,931
Even still.

998
01:13:14,056 --> 01:13:15,557
You should've called me.

999
01:13:15,641 --> 01:13:18,560
I was going to when the timing was right.

1000
01:13:19,061 --> 01:13:20,062
Like today.

1001
01:13:23,857 --> 01:13:26,193
Let's meet up often.
Nothing's holding us back now.

1002
01:13:26,276 --> 01:13:27,820
Yeah, let's do that.

1003
01:13:27,903 --> 01:13:30,239
By the way,
do you guys all have insurance?

1004
01:13:30,322 --> 01:13:32,783
For example, medical or dental insurance.

1005
01:13:34,201 --> 01:13:37,121
We just got here
and you're trying to sell insurance?

1006
01:13:37,204 --> 01:13:38,914
Cut it out while I'm still being nice.

1007
01:13:40,124 --> 01:13:42,584
Why is he taking so long to buy a cake?

1008
01:13:47,881 --> 01:13:51,927
Dad, don't tell me you wrote
something on the cake. That's tacky.

1009
01:13:52,010 --> 01:13:54,304
Jeez, I didn't.

1010
01:13:55,013 --> 01:13:56,432
But why would that be tacky?

1011
01:13:57,141 --> 01:13:58,600
So you did.

1012
01:13:58,684 --> 01:13:59,768
What did you write?

1013
01:13:59,852 --> 01:14:02,771
Something tacky
like you love us or whatever?

1014
01:14:02,855 --> 01:14:05,816
I didn't write anything,
but why would that be tacky?

1015
01:14:16,743 --> 01:14:18,162
Dad, what's wrong?

1016
01:14:19,705 --> 01:14:21,290
Dad.

1017
01:14:25,502 --> 01:14:26,795
What's going on?

1018
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:33,844
Call 911. Please call 911 right now!

1019
01:14:34,678 --> 01:14:35,762
Dad!

1020
01:14:37,681 --> 01:14:38,682
What do we do?

1021
01:14:40,601 --> 01:14:42,978
Call 911.

1022
01:14:43,061 --> 01:14:45,981
Please call 911!

1023
01:14:48,275 --> 01:14:49,610
Dad, no.

1024
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:51,361
Dad.

1025
01:14:56,241 --> 01:14:57,743
Wake up, Dad.

1026
01:14:58,285 --> 01:14:59,453
Dad!

1027
01:15:02,831 --> 01:15:04,541
Please call 911.

1028
01:15:07,377 --> 01:15:08,378
Dad.

1029
01:15:11,256 --> 01:15:12,758
Hello? Is this 911?

1030
01:15:12,841 --> 01:15:13,884
Dad.

1031
01:15:21,016 --> 01:15:22,100
Dad.

1032
01:15:28,398 --> 01:15:35,364
I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU

1033
01:15:35,697 --> 01:15:38,367
CASTAWAY DIVA

1034
01:16:19,199 --> 01:16:20,701
One, two, three.

1035
01:16:20,784 --> 01:16:22,369
Please.

1036
01:16:22,452 --> 01:16:24,621
You will never be able to divorce me.

1037
01:16:25,455 --> 01:16:26,582
You will also live

1038
01:16:26,665 --> 01:16:28,292
with my surname forever.

1039
01:16:29,167 --> 01:16:32,588
You want me to switch songs?
What are you talking about?

1040
01:16:32,671 --> 01:16:34,423
How low can you possibly go?

1041
01:16:34,506 --> 01:16:36,133
The biggest regret in life

1042
01:16:36,216 --> 01:16:38,135
is not expressing your true feelings.

1043
01:16:38,218 --> 01:16:40,512
When I found you on the deserted island,

1044
01:16:40,596 --> 01:16:42,055
do you think it was a coincidence?

1045
01:16:42,931 --> 01:16:45,309
How could that have been a coincidence?

1046
01:16:45,392 --> 01:16:47,019
-Seo Mok-ha!
-Seo Mok-ha!

1047
01:16:47,102 --> 01:16:48,353
It was fate.

1048
01:16:52,357 --> 01:16:54,359
