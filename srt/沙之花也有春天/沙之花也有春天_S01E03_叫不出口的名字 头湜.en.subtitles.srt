1
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:45,962
LIKE FLOWERS IN SAND

2
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:51,760
There's one in there.

3
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:05,148
You guys are always hanging out together.
Are you going to get married too?

4
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:08,443
No, I will never get married.

5
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:11,988
When I grow up, I won't get married.
I'll live like Mi-suk.

6
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:13,823
Who's Mi-suk?

7
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:18,203
Her role model.

8
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:25,460
Here. Have this one.

9
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:34,844
It's raining!

10
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:45,814
Hey.

11
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:05,959
EPISODE 3
DU-SIK IS NOT HER NAME

12
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:07,252
Honey.

13
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,972
"Honey"?

14
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:21,766
You were here?

15
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:30,233
I've been looking for you.

16
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:39,993
Is that your office?

17
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,037
Yes, it is. Kind of.

18
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:46,624
By the way, who is he?
Do you know each other?

19
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,877
-Right, I'm Du-sik's--
-He's a villager here.

20
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:50,253
What?

21
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,130
Also,

22
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:56,009
he's one of the wrestlers
on this ssireum team.

23
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:58,136
-So we were having a chat.
-I see.

24
00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:01,639
-No wonder your legs are so--
-Mr. Kim.

25
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:05,310
Let's talk about this another day.

26
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:10,607
Let's go.
You must be tired from all the driving.

27
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,983
I'll see you next time.

28
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,331
What was that?

29
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:29,042
What's wrong with her?

30
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,345
When did you arrive?

31
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:43,598
In the afternoon.

32
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:47,769
Why didn't you report to me
that you had arrived?

33
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:50,230
Report? That's not necessary.

34
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:52,857
You knew I was coming today.

35
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:57,362
I know, and you didn't have to.
You're just getting in my way.

36
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:01,824
Hey, that's just mean.

37
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:04,202
It's not like I wanted to come…

38
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:05,912
What's that?

39
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:14,003
What are you--

40
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,422
The villager is watching us.

41
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:20,468
Act affectionate.

42
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:23,846
I can't believe
I have to do this with you.

43
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,916
What's on your mind?

44
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:54,794
I'm just

45
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:58,798
worried about living
in this rural village.

46
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:03,594
Right. Did you hear
about Choi Chil-seong's autopsy result?

47
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:05,471
Yeah.

48
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,598
If there were signs of strangulation,

49
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:12,228
that must mean someone killed Choi
and threw him into the water, right?

50
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:15,898
But both his phone and dashcam are gone.

51
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,818
There's something fishy about this town.

52
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:20,987
Something definitely feels off.

53
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,781
Right. What were you
talking about earlier?

54
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:24,782
What do you mean?

55
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:26,951
With the ssireum wrestler
from the village.

56
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:29,120
You said you'd talk about it another day.

57
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:31,039
Well, it was just…

58
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:33,624
He said he'd retire all of a sudden.

59
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,460
He must be out of his mind.

60
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:43,342
What? Why?

61
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:45,845
Why are you so upset about him quitting?

62
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:47,388
That's up to him.

63
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:52,602
Go easy on the ssireum team duties.
We have a lot of work to do.

64
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:55,396
Hey. I know what I'm doing.

65
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:58,107
You're so grumpy.

66
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,193
Then, who is Du-sik?

67
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,361
-What?
-I heard you guys

68
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:04,280
talk about someone called Du-sik.

69
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:05,782
Who is Du-sik?

70
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:08,493
Tell me. Who is Du-sik?

71
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:09,911
How would I know?

72
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:11,788
What is wrong with you today?

73
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,956
You better be careful.

74
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,291
-I'm warning you.
-What?

75
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:18,503
We can't let them find out
why we're here and what we're doing.

76
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:19,545
-I know.
-Got it?

77
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,923
I'm going to be careful. Don't worry.

78
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:30,348
Did you check out Choi's route
from that day?

79
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:33,851
Yes. I went to the restaurant
and then the café.

80
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:36,395
The café was closed,
so I checked out the area.

81
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:39,732
But there aren't many CCTVs
in this village and…

82
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:41,400
Right.

83
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:45,863
This is the road
to the reservoir where Choi died,

84
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,323
and there's one here.

85
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,159
What was this road called?

86
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,706
GEOSAN LAKE, GEOSAN COUNTY OFFICE

87
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:03,506
Married? Du-sik is married?

88
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:06,801
But she said she'd never get married.

89
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:10,888
And why did she introduce me
like I'm a stranger?

90
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,557
She could've said I'm a friend.

91
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,516
Baek-du.

92
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:15,601
Oh, hey.

93
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:19,981
What are you mumbling on about?
Did something happen?

94
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:22,024
No, it's nothing.

95
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:28,656
Why are you staring at me like that?

96
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:30,616
Baek-du.

97
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:33,703
Du-sik.

98
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:36,539
What…

99
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:39,834
How do you know Du-sik?

100
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:42,628
Was Du-sik your first love?

101
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:45,006
What?

102
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,301
What are you talking about?

103
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:49,677
Was she not?

104
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:56,017
-Well, she was just…
-Sure.

105
00:07:56,392 --> 00:08:00,480
If not, why did you call her name
so desperately the other day?

106
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:01,814
I did? When?

107
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:02,899
"When"?

108
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,234
Right. It was that day.

109
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,653
The day you guys had the school reunion.

110
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:10,823
That night,
you were calling out Du-sik's name

111
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:13,451
while walking over there alone.
Don't you remember?

112
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:15,077
No, I don't.

113
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,208
Are you pretending
that you don't remember?

114
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,877
What? Why would I do that?

115
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,881
Did I do something embarrassing?

116
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:28,216
Well…

117
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:31,677
No. Nothing happened.

118
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:11,592
GEOSAN-GUN SSIREUM TEAM

119
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:14,512
NO ACCIDENTS FOR 6 DAYS

120
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:17,348
RESERVOIR CASE REPORT

121
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,813
Jeez.

122
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:27,483
You're one tenacious man, aren't you?

123
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,694
Why are you peeking at my report?

124
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:33,155
Come on. That's not a report.
That's a provocation.

125
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,908
-What?
-Just think about it.

126
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:39,704
Why do you think
the officers from Seoul collected

127
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:41,289
all the CCTV footage in town?

128
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:45,668
"We'll take it from here,
so you stay out of it."

129
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:47,253
That's what it means.

130
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:50,214
And now you're making a report about

131
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:53,676
how much effort you're putting into
what they don't want you to do.

132
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,304
You're just provoking the Seoul office.

133
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:59,599
So stop wasting your time and…

134
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:04,145
There comes your regular client.

135
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:07,607
Go and take care of his complaint.

136
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,776
Jeez, what is it this time?

137
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:23,331
Looks like you plan to stay a while.

138
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:26,000
That's enough to fill up an entire house.

139
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:29,295
You think? These are actually
the most modest ones I have.

140
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:32,798
You're supposed to be
an unemployed man here.

141
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:36,969
If you wear a different fancy watch
every day, people will find it suspicious.

142
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:40,097
Yu-gyeong, that's just a stereotype.

143
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:43,225
A rich and stylish unemployed man.

144
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:45,728
That's the character I'm going for.

145
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,189
All right.

146
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,566
By the way, Yu-gyeong,

147
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:52,693
do we really have to carry out…

148
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:56,572
the investigation like this?

149
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:58,658
What?

150
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:07,333
Now that Choi Chil-seong is dead,

151
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,794
maybe we should publicize
this investigation.

152
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:14,006
I just don't get why you insist
on carrying out the investigation here.

153
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:19,804
Because there is something here

154
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:21,972
that bothers me.

155
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:41,826
Hot!

156
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:44,870
You didn't have to run.

157
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:48,290
Dude, you're here almost every day.
Don't you have anything to do?

158
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:49,375
Actually, no.

159
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:53,421
Hey, sit here for a minute.
I have something to say to you.

160
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:54,672
What is it?

161
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:57,800
You know, on our reunion day…

162
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:59,927
The day you got wasted and caused a scene?

163
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,345
Yes.

164
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,431
Did you drive me home that day?

165
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:04,807
Me?

166
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,685
No way.
I woke up in the restaurant the next day.

167
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:08,602
Really?

168
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:11,230
Why? Did something happen?

169
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:13,149
No, nothing happened.

170
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,029
Why are you laughing?

171
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:22,867
-Yesterday, I looked through our yearbook.
-Our yearbook?

172
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:26,829
You said that woman looked like Du-sik,
so I got curious too.

173
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:29,081
I wanted to see if she actually looked

174
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,208
-like Du-sik.
-And what did you think?

175
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:33,085
What did I think?

176
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:35,212
She looks nothing like her.

177
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:37,548
Your eyes must have some serious problems.

178
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:39,216
That's so harsh.

179
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,554
I never told

180
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:46,474
-anyone about this, but…
-What is it now?

181
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:49,560
What are you doing?

182
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:58,694
I can't believe
he's spilling the beans already.

183
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:04,241
Really? You're not joking, are you?

184
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:05,409
I'm not joking.

185
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:08,704
-Are you sure?
-I'm sure.

186
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:10,372
Jeez.

187
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,584
Anyway, go back in.

188
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:15,085
-Okay.
-Don't tell anyone.

189
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:16,587
I won't.

190
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,298
-Bye.
-Bye.

191
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,519
What are you doing here?

192
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:39,777
What now?
What is it this time? What do you want?

193
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,571
We need to talk.

194
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,658
What? Why are you looking at me like that?

195
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:47,535
-You told him.
-Told him what?

196
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:50,371
You just told Seok-hui
that I'm Du-sik, didn't you?

197
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:53,499
I knew it. You can't even answer me.

198
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:54,833
You did tell him!

199
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:57,127
-You are Du-sik.
-What?

200
00:13:57,211 --> 00:14:00,798
I'm just stating facts.
What's wrong with that?

201
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:04,093
Have I ever admitted that I am Du-sik?

202
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:06,428
-No.
-See?

203
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:09,431
So am I Du-sik or not?

204
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,309
You're not.

205
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:18,899
Now I'm worried about Seok-hui.
He can't keep a secret. What do I do?

206
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,276
I didn't tell him.

207
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:21,986
What?

208
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:23,988
I didn't tell Seok-hui about you.

209
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:27,533
You hinted yesterday
that I should keep it quiet.

210
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,494
-You really didn't?
-No.

211
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,498
-Then, what did you say to him?
-What?

212
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:37,293
What were you talking about
with him just now?

213
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:43,507
Gosh, what are you looking for?

214
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:45,885
-A book.
-A book? What book?

215
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:49,513
There's this book I kept here,
thinking I might need it eventually.

216
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:50,723
Darn it.

217
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:52,224
Oh, here it is.

218
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,769
Why? Are you taking the exam again?

219
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:57,897
No, not me. It's for Baek-du.

220
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,148
Baek-du?

221
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:02,693
He's quitting ssireum for real.

222
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:06,906
He asked me about taking the police exam,
so I want to give him a taste.

223
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:09,116
-Really?
-It's a secret.

224
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:10,993
-Don't tell anyone.
-Okay.

225
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:14,246
I was just asking him

226
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:17,374
-for some career advice.
-What advice?

227
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:19,710
Career?

228
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:23,047
Why would you ask him
about something so important?

229
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:25,007
Don't you know anybody else?

230
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:29,094
No, that's not why.
I asked him what the police exam was like.

231
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:31,764
The police exam?

232
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:34,391
Why? Do you want to be a police officer?

233
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:35,559
What about it?

234
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,063
Are you serious?

235
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,690
You're going to take the police exam?

236
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,818
Jeez. Kim Baek-du!

237
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,321
Do you think
anyone can be a police officer?

238
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:50,532
Especially with your personality?
Do you know how dangerous it is?

239
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:54,078
It isn't dangerous.
Seok-hui always says he's bored.

240
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:56,997
That punk is selling you pipe dreams.

241
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:00,751
Don't be ridiculous, and think again.

242
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:02,670
That's just not for you.

243
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:05,381
Gosh, I can't believe this.

244
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:07,716
Oh, right.

245
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:10,427
Do you know

246
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,472
-anything about Choi Chil-seong?
-Who?

247
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:16,475
You know, the guy who died
in the reservoir recently.

248
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:19,395
He paid to you on the reunion day
at Jin-su's Restaurant.

249
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,063
Oh, that man.

250
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:24,024
I remember him. What about him?

251
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,693
-Do you know him?
-No way.

252
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:27,486
That was my first time seeing him.

253
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:28,737
Really?

254
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,031
You see, I'm the treasurer of the reunion.

255
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,075
It's a very important position.

256
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,327
So I was checking the reunion fees…

257
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:38,330
You have to pay it too.
You're so behind on your fees.

258
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:40,040
Do you prefer bank transfer?

259
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:41,917
-We don't accept cards--
-Mr. Kim Baek-du.

260
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:43,502
I told you

261
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,463
that I'm not Oh Du-sik.

262
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,090
You are just…

263
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:52,219
Anyway, I was collecting reunion fees
at the counter that day.

264
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:54,638
Then, that man came as a customer.

265
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,224
Was he alone?

266
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:59,268
Yes, he was alone.

267
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:02,187
So instead of Ms. Lim, I took the fee… No.

268
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:05,649
The money for the food.
That's all. Nothing else happened.

269
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:11,363
-Why are you asking this?
-What?

270
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,907
Why are you asking about that man?

271
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:16,035
And how do you know his name?

272
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,828
Choi what?

273
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:21,498
Well, it's just…

274
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:24,168
Why do you want to know that?

275
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,672
-I've got to go.
-Wait, hey.

276
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:35,763
Sorry about that.

277
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:38,640
I just have one question.

278
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:40,726
When…

279
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:45,898
When did you get married? Ma'am?

280
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,817
What?

281
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:54,615
Oh, when I got married?

282
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:57,576
Well, when was it? It was…

283
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:03,540
Why do you want to know that?

284
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:04,458
Sir?

285
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,376
What… Hey.

286
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:08,587
I mean…

287
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:11,381
Is it so wrong to ask that?

288
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:18,430
GEOSAN-GUN TEAM'S COACH YEON
FOUND DEAD, PRESUMED AS SUICIDE

289
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:19,348
Is that real?

290
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:24,937
Is what real?

291
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,064
The watch.

292
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:28,315
Is that a real one?

293
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:30,901
Oh, the watch.

294
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,695
Of course. It's not even that expensive.

295
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:36,490
You're the one who moved
into Du-sik's house, right?

296
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:38,826
Du-sik?

297
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:41,161
Oh, you must not know.

298
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:44,123
The house with the blue gate.

299
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:47,459
I hear that's where
a kid named Du-sik used to live.

300
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,463
That must be what she was talking about.

301
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:55,008
-What?
-Sorry? No, nothing.

302
00:18:56,176 --> 00:19:00,097
By the way, why didn't you open
the café yesterday? I was here.

303
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,349
Because I didn't want to.

304
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:06,520
Right. That is up to you, the owner.

305
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:11,775
-Anyway, by any chance…
-What's going on this time?

306
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:17,406
Something must've happened
to the ssireum team.

307
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:19,116
The ssireum team?

308
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:23,829
When those guys walk somewhere hurriedly,
it usually means

309
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:26,290
something's happened to the ssireum team.

310
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:45,517
We found evidence of a homicide
on Choi Chil-seong,

311
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,980
and Coach Yeon committed suicide.

312
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:55,861
What on earth is going on?

313
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:05,037
Why are you saying that now?

314
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,247
I tried to tell you at the barbecue place,

315
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:09,833
-but you kept--
-Who else have you told?

316
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:30,604
Gosh. I think we have a problem.

317
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:33,315
What do we do now?

318
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:36,193
I can't believe this.

319
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:39,446
COACH YEON:
I'LL JUST QUIT. I'M SORRY.

320
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:42,199
This is what he sent me last night.

321
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,370
I called him this morning
as soon as I woke up,

322
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:48,664
but his phone was off.

323
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,999
Did something happen?

324
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,251
Sorry?

325
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,419
-What do you mean?
-I mean,

326
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:57,256
it's a bit strange that he quit

327
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:59,758
when there was still time left
on his contract.

328
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:03,929
Not that I can think of.

329
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:09,768
But that's not the problem.
The next match is in just 15 days.

330
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:13,480
We can't prepare for the match
without a coach.

331
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:16,650
Where am I gonna find his substitute?

332
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:20,445
Gosh, this is a headache.

333
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:24,574
-Gil-su!
-Yes.

334
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,535
I vote for Gil-su.

335
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:29,329
No way. What about my store?

336
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:31,498
I have a flower shop to run.

337
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:33,709
What about you?

338
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:36,670
You've been a coach once, right?

339
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:40,173
Come on. That was less than six months.

340
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:43,135
Still, that's some experience.

341
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:45,512
No, I can't do it.

342
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:46,555
Why not?

343
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:51,685
Truth is, when I was coaching my juniors,

344
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:55,314
I realized that I got pretty aggressive

345
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:57,733
when they didn't seem to understand.

346
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:01,069
Come on! These days,
you can go to jail for that.

347
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,487
I know.

348
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:06,033
Since then, I don't teach anyone anything.

349
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:08,744
I can't be a coach.

350
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:11,330
-Goodness.
-Out of the question.

351
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:17,044
How about Geum-gang or Han-ra?

352
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:21,006
When they quit ssireum, they told me

353
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:26,053
they had no regrets and would never do
anything related to ssireum again.

354
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:28,722
-Well, I wish I could.
-Right?

355
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:31,933
Don't you have a spare coach
in your family?

356
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:56,541
ENGLISH VOCABULARY FOR EXAM PREP

357
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:02,005
Goodness. Kim Baek-du
is really surprising us.

358
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:06,384
He's putting up
such an impressive performance

359
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:09,221
against the Taebaek-class champion,
Lim Dong-seok.

360
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:11,098
I'm sure you're all equally surprised

361
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:13,934
by his unexpected impressive performance.

362
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:15,560
You're wrong.

363
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,938
I'm not surprised.

364
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:29,199
What's with him?

365
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:32,077
Why does he look so nervous?

366
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:45,549
So tell me. How much is the watch?

367
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:48,176
At least 20 million won.

368
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:53,473
Is he that rich? What does he do?

369
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:57,227
I don't know. But something about him is…

370
00:23:58,228 --> 00:23:59,729
kind of off.

371
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:00,897
Off?

372
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:03,859
Mi-ran, he can't be as off as you.

373
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:06,695
She's right.

374
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:10,365
-You should tell us now.
-Right.

375
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:12,242
How old are you?

376
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:15,787
Why do you live in this countryside
running a café?

377
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,668
There he comes.

378
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:23,211
-What?
-Who?

379
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:28,508
That's him? He's handsome.

380
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:30,844
-Oh, my.
-He's tall.

381
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:31,803
He's cute.

382
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:35,348
Hello, ladies.

383
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:37,142
-Oh, you.
-Hello!

384
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:38,685
Hi.

385
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:42,689
Here you go.

386
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:45,025
-Let's drink.
-Cheers.

387
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:50,405
Why didn't Yu-gyeong tell us

388
00:24:50,488 --> 00:24:52,616
-that she had a husband?
-Tell me about it.

389
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:54,701
-I know.
-We didn't know she was married.

390
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,286
-No.
-Here.

391
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:57,954
Oh, my.

392
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:00,707
-You eat so well.
-Oh, my.

393
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:02,250
-What's your name?
-There you go.

394
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:04,586
-Hyeon-uk.
-Okay.

395
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:06,379
Min Hyeon-uk.

396
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:07,881
-Uk?
-Uk!

397
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:08,840
Hi, Uk.

398
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:12,761
-Even his name is handsome.
-I know.

399
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:15,847
Your husband is Uk too. Song Yeong-uk.

400
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:19,351
Hey, Mi-ran.
Why would you bring him up here?

401
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:22,187
-Right.
-Not all Uks are the same.

402
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,188
Read the room.

403
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:25,315
The "Uk" in his name

404
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:28,360
must have a different meaning, right?

405
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:31,571
What do you do, by the way?

406
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:35,867
How did you buy such an expensive watch?

407
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:37,619
I'm unemployed.

408
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:38,787
Darn it.

409
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:41,081
-Oh.
-It must be the same "Uk."

410
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:45,418
Is your wife the only one
making money then?

411
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:49,172
She said she's a civil servant.
How could you be wearing such a fancy--

412
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:53,635
My wife has been appointed
as the general manager

413
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:55,971
of Geosan-gun Ssireum Team.

414
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:57,973
I can't trust him.

415
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:00,684
I saw the guys heading somewhere earlier.

416
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:02,769
Did something happen
to the ssireum team again?

417
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:03,812
I don't know.

418
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:07,023
-I heard the coach disappeared.
-I see.

419
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:10,110
As if they're part of the team.
He's not even their coach.

420
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:14,447
I guess everyone with "Uk" in their name

421
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:17,617
has a knack of getting on my nerves.

422
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:18,702
Right?

423
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:21,663
-Cheers.
-Drink.

424
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:23,873
-But Jong-mi.
-Yes?

425
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:27,335
I heard that coach had been
quite problematic.

426
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:28,920
-Why?
-What?

427
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:31,923
You know that coach used to be

428
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:34,759
on the same team as my hubby, right?

429
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:35,969
-Right.
-Apparently,

430
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:38,805
he often caused
these kinds of problems back then.

431
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:42,642
"These kinds of problems"?
What does that mean?

432
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:44,060
Well, you know,

433
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:46,980
he was into those things.

434
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:48,315
CHU~♥

435
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:51,067
-What are "those things"?
-What do you mean?

436
00:27:33,234 --> 00:27:35,695
Unbelievable.

437
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:36,654
Hey.

438
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:39,032
Get up. You can't sleep out here.

439
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:42,619
Ladies, I can't drink anymore.

440
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:45,413
What are you talking about?
How much did you drink?

441
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:47,415
Oh, Detective.

442
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:53,129
The people in this town drink so much.
I can't even drink water like that.

443
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:56,341
So why did you drink with them?
You can't even drink much.

444
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:58,802
-Go sleep inside.
-Okay.

445
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:05,892
-He had debts.
-What?

446
00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:09,729
Coach Yeon had
a ton of debts from gambling.

447
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:10,897
From gambling?

448
00:28:11,689 --> 00:28:13,441
-He gambled?
-Yes.

449
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:17,404
The loan sharks would come to the gym,
looking for him.

450
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:19,823
Everyone knows.

451
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:22,742
Maybe it was Coach Yeon

452
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:25,495
who did the match-fixing with Choi.

453
00:28:26,704 --> 00:28:28,790
Then, maybe they had a conflict,

454
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:31,209
and this happened.

455
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:35,088
Maybe Coach Yeon killed…

456
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:38,967
Choi Chil-seong.

457
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:40,677
Hey.

458
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:45,765
Maybe there are records on his phone
of him talking with Choi Chil-seong…

459
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:49,686
Are you asleep?

460
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:56,025
Fine. Sleep, then.

461
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,379
Baek-du.

462
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:18,089
Kim Baek-du.

463
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:19,841
Hey, baby brother.

464
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:26,806
Baek-du, what is this?

465
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:29,893
English Vocabulary for Exam Prep?

466
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:32,979
-Is it for a civil servant exam?
-Give it back.

467
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:34,981
So it's true!

468
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:37,025
Give it back already.

469
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:39,027
Why would you touch my stuff?

470
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:41,362
Baek-du.

471
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:45,450
Why do you have to choose something
you have zero talent for?

472
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:49,287
I said you could do anything
except ssireum and studying.

473
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:53,082
Are you challenging your destiny
or something?

474
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:57,337
Don't be like that. He learned
the alphabet earlier than you guys did.

475
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,880
Mom.

476
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:00,673
That has nothing to do with this.

477
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:03,218
They don't test your spelling to hire you.

478
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:04,969
Right. It's not a spelling test.

479
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:08,807
Be quiet. We're eating now.

480
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:15,522
Father.

481
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:16,856
Hey.

482
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:17,857
Is he angry?

483
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:19,859
It's because of you.

484
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:21,402
Why did you do that?

485
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,321
-What?
-Why did you suddenly…

486
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:24,531
It's obvious.

487
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:27,200
I know what he's thinking.

488
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:32,038
He just hates it so much
that Baek-du is quitting ssireum.

489
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:35,583
He's upset
that the great Kim Tae-baek's son

490
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:38,670
has to quit
without winning any championships.

491
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:42,048
Jeez. He already has two champion sons.

492
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:43,383
He's being greedy.

493
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:44,843
I know, right?

494
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:47,595
He's been cranky for days now.

495
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,098
Baek-du is walking on eggshells.

496
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,141
He didn't seem to eat much.

497
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:53,184
Hey, you're here.

498
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:54,143
-Hey.
-Hey.

499
00:30:55,395 --> 00:31:00,066
He's the weakest and the skinniest
of my three sons at that.

500
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:01,693
I feel so bad for him.

501
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:04,320
My gosh.

502
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:07,824
Jin-suk, you shouldn't say that
to other people.

503
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:13,037
Who would think that the 80 kg boy
is weak and skinny?

504
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:17,458
I'm not sure what they did,
but two nights ago,

505
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:20,044
they came back home covered in sand.

506
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:22,505
-Sand?
-I don't know.

507
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:25,258
Maybe he dragged him
to some sand pit and beat him

508
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:27,135
because he wanted to quit.

509
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:28,845
No way.

510
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:36,394
Well, I kind of understand him, though.

511
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:40,481
After working your butt off
to feed and support them,

512
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:45,069
it is quite upsetting to see your kids
work half-heartedly and then quit.

513
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:49,490
Thinking about all the money
you spent on them makes you flipping mad.

514
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:51,743
Has this happened to Jin-su too?

515
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:52,785
-Jin…
-Has it?

516
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:55,038
A short while before he graduated.

517
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:58,041
Rice cakes.
Didn't you say you had to buy some?

518
00:31:58,124 --> 00:32:00,209
-I did. Anyway, I didn't know.
-Yes.

519
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:02,086
What are you buying rice cakes for?

520
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,297
-Nothing.
-Hey, you're here.

521
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,215
How can I help you?

522
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:09,677
I want to buy some baekseolgi.

523
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:12,430
-Baekseolgi?
-Get the one with beans.

524
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:14,223
No, not just a piece.

525
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:16,184
I want to order a whole box of it.

526
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:18,686
A box? How much would that be?

527
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:22,523
I don't know. Maybe about 24 kg?

528
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:28,071
That's a lot.
What do you need so much for?

529
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:30,531
Are you throwing a party or something?

530
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:35,828
You can put
some letters on the rice cake too, right?

531
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:36,788
Of course.

532
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:40,625
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

533
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:45,672
Baek-du!

534
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:47,215
-Baek-du!
-Baek-du!

535
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:48,883
-Hey.
-Baek-du!

536
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,718
-Hi, Baek-du.
-Hey.

537
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:53,179
Why did you come back?
Did you forget something?

538
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:56,182
I need to talk to the head coach.
Is he inside?

539
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:58,059
-What?
-No, he's not in there.

540
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:00,353
He's not? Where did he go?

541
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:03,606
I don't know. He went out to do something.

542
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:06,651
Darn it. Why does this happen to me
all the time? Why now?

543
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:07,986
But Coach is here, right?

544
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:11,155
He isn't here either.

545
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:02,123
-He quit?
-Yes.

546
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:03,916
How could he just quit like that?

547
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,293
Well, he did.

548
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:07,211
What about your match, then?

549
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:09,797
The one in two weeks.
How will you prepare for it?

550
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,466
-By ourselves.
-We'll manage.

551
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:14,218
What? You can't prepare for a match
without a coach!

552
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:16,137
Tell me about it.

553
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,931
The governor said
he'd support the ssireum team,

554
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:22,060
but we've got no new wrestlers,
the coach is gone,

555
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:23,728
and some weird lady came in.

556
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:28,691
You probably don't know.
We've got some new manager or whatever.

557
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:30,526
She's so pretty.

558
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:31,861
I didn't know about that.

559
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:34,614
Some psycho lady came.
But don't worry about it.

560
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:37,992
You're only saying she's psycho
because she threw you over.

561
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:41,537
-Stop it.
-Are you upset?

562
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:43,289
Hey, Jeong-hun.

563
00:34:43,372 --> 00:34:47,085
I can't tell you why for certain reasons,
but you…

564
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,046
You better behave.

565
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:53,591
Or you could get beaten to a pulp.
Be careful.

566
00:34:58,054 --> 00:35:02,308
THE MECCA OF SSIREUM
GEOSAN-GUN SSIREUM TEAM

567
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:22,245
-Hello, ma'am.
-Hello.

568
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:24,831
Mr. Kim Beom-su.

569
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,125
Yes?

570
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:33,005
Let me just do it, Ms. Oh.

571
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:36,759
It may look easy,
but the sand is bumpy, so it can be hard--

572
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:38,803
It's okay. I'll try.

573
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:41,222
I've always wanted to try it for fun.

574
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:44,475
But this is not something you do for fun.

575
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:05,913
Have you ever done this before?

576
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:10,293
No, I was just copying what others do.
Was it all right?

577
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:13,004
Yes. You did a great job, actually.

578
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:15,923
I'll help you with this from time to time.

579
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:18,593
It's okay. You don't have to.

580
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:24,307
How's training these days?

581
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:27,810
It can't be easy without the coach.

582
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:35,276
By the way, about Coach Yeon.

583
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,236
Did something happen to him?

584
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:39,071
Sorry?

585
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:41,949
It's just that he quit so suddenly,

586
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:44,827
so I was wondering
if there was a particular reason.

587
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:47,914
I don't think so.

588
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:51,375
As far as I know,
there was no specific reason.

589
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:55,838
I wonder why he quit so suddenly, then.

590
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:05,014
-By the way…
-Hey, Beom-su!

591
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:07,600
What are you doing there? Come here.

592
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:13,814
Run!

593
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:19,946
What were you talking about?

594
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:21,322
Nothing.

595
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:24,116
-Don't say anything to her, okay?
-Okay.

596
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:30,498
That darn punk.

597
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:35,586
I'm going to make him regret his actions
before I go back to Seoul.

598
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:36,879
Seriously.

599
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:52,478
What's he doing here?

600
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,488
Hey! Kim Baek-du!

601
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:12,748
-What are you doing here?
-Hey.

602
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:16,502
You've got to be careful.

603
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:18,379
What are you doing here?

604
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:19,755
Sir?

605
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,759
I came to see the head coach.

606
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:26,095
But apparently he's off today, ma'am.

607
00:38:26,178 --> 00:38:27,596
Why do you want to see him?

608
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,223
You can tell me.

609
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:31,976
-Sir.
-You?

610
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:37,023
No, it's okay. I'll check with him
and come back later.

611
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:39,108
Hey, Kim Baek…

612
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:40,901
I mean, Mr. Kim Baek-du.

613
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:44,947
Are you,

614
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,867
by any chance,

615
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:50,870
close with Beom-su, sir?

616
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:01,380
Goodness, Beom-su. You're so strong!

617
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:14,435
Beom-su, take it easy.

618
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:16,270
Go, Baek-du!

619
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:57,269
Beom-su.

620
00:39:58,604 --> 00:40:02,024
Are you getting the hang of it now?

621
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:06,946
No, I'm still a little confused.
Can we do it one more time?

622
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:09,281
No, that won't be necessary.

623
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:11,742
I can tell

624
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:15,996
that you've almost mastered the skill.

625
00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:20,251
I would believe it
if you said you invented this skill.

626
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:24,130
It's just perfect.

627
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:25,423
Perfect…

628
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:27,800
No, I'm not that good.

629
00:40:27,883 --> 00:40:29,927
Can we try just one more time?

630
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:31,679
No need. You're perfect.

631
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:33,431
Come on. Just one more time.

632
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:35,015
-I--
-Please.

633
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,517
-Fine.
-One last time.

634
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:54,994
There's a place for everyone.

635
00:40:57,955 --> 00:41:01,834
You're doing a good job, Mr. Kim Baek-du.

636
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:09,675
-Baek-du.
-Yeah.

637
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,053
Oh, boy.

638
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:18,684
Are you okay? Did you overdo it today?

639
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:22,146
No way.

640
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:24,482
That was hardly exercise. I'm okay.

641
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:27,860
Your lips have been pale for a while.

642
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:29,945
Really?

643
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:34,575
I've actually been tasting blood
in the back of my throat.

644
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:42,833
I felt so lost without the coach,
and this was very helpful.

645
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,461
I really appreciate it.

646
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:49,465
Don't mention it. This is nothing.

647
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:57,223
Speaking of which, why did Coach quit?
Do you know anything about it?

648
00:41:57,306 --> 00:41:58,140
What?

649
00:42:00,267 --> 00:42:01,101
No.

650
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:03,812
Come on. Obviously, you know something.

651
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:06,065
Tell me.

652
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:08,067
I really don't know.

653
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:15,157
The guys told me not to tell anyone.

654
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:22,957
Jeez, I keep tasting blood in my throat.

655
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,751
I must have pushed myself too hard.

656
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:29,338
On the day of the match…

657
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:31,966
You saw it too, right?

658
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:33,759
What did I see?

659
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,431
I mean, before the match started,

660
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:41,809
Coach was arguing with someone outside.

661
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:43,561
He was arguing?

662
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:49,650
What's taking him so long?

663
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:52,111
Baek-du!

664
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:57,908
-Come on. You're up soon.
-Sure. I'm coming.

665
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:07,543
What's going on? Who is he arguing with?

666
00:43:20,889 --> 00:43:22,391
Oh, you're right.

667
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:23,851
I saw that too.

668
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:26,186
Right? You saw it too. Back then--

669
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,397
Who was he fighting with?

670
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:29,982
What?

671
00:43:30,065 --> 00:43:33,569
I saw him arguing with someone,

672
00:43:33,652 --> 00:43:35,571
but I didn't see who it was.

673
00:43:35,654 --> 00:43:36,905
Oh, it's…

674
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:40,451
Who was it? Did you see who it was?

675
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,252
Gosh, that was tough.

676
00:43:51,211 --> 00:43:52,713
I'm dead tired.

677
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:14,443
You saw him arguing with someone? Where?

678
00:44:14,526 --> 00:44:16,362
Well, you know,

679
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:18,572
before the match that day,

680
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:21,659
I went to the restroom a few times
because I was nervous.

681
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:23,619
About five, six times.

682
00:44:23,702 --> 00:44:28,040
I wasn't like this as a kid,
but now, whenever I get nervous…

683
00:44:28,123 --> 00:44:30,167
How can I put it? My stomach burns.

684
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:33,962
-When I get nervous--
-Just get to the point.

685
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:36,090
Right.

686
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:40,719
So he was seen behind the building.

687
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:42,221
Is that so?

688
00:44:42,304 --> 00:44:43,681
Yes.

689
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:46,517
-Who was he fighting with?
-What?

690
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:49,436
Who was the coach arguing with?

691
00:44:51,438 --> 00:44:52,606
I don't know.

692
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:54,191
You don't know?

693
00:44:54,274 --> 00:44:58,612
Beom-su said he didn't see that either.
The person was covered by something.

694
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:04,451
By the way,
why did you want me to ask that?

695
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:05,411
What?

696
00:45:05,494 --> 00:45:10,374
Why did you ask me to ask Beom-su
if he knew anything about the coach?

697
00:45:11,708 --> 00:45:12,543
Tell me.

698
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:14,753
Why?

699
00:45:15,337 --> 00:45:16,672
-Why--
-Excuse me.

700
00:45:17,673 --> 00:45:19,007
Mr. Kim Baek-du.

701
00:45:19,758 --> 00:45:20,717
What?

702
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:22,428
I think you can leave now.

703
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:24,555
Why are you suddenly being formal?

704
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:27,474
-Why--
-I'm busy. So please leave now.

705
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,601
But we were just talking.

706
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:35,399
You want me to leave now? What…

707
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:37,276
Fine. I'll leave.

708
00:45:49,788 --> 00:45:50,622
Oh, right!

709
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:53,083
Wait.

710
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:56,253
Anyhow,

711
00:45:58,589 --> 00:45:59,798
thank you.

712
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:01,884
What did you say?

713
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:05,429
I said, thank you.

714
00:46:06,054 --> 00:46:07,055
What?

715
00:46:09,224 --> 00:46:11,185
Seriously…

716
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:13,520
I said, thank you!

717
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:15,189
Thank you!

718
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:18,066
What's wrong with your ears?
Why can't you hear?

719
00:46:20,402 --> 00:46:22,529
Well, then.

720
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:24,281
Bye now.

721
00:46:31,872 --> 00:46:34,833
Who says "thank you" like that?

722
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:46,386
Gosh.

723
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:48,722
Oh, no. What's happening now?

724
00:46:48,805 --> 00:46:50,933
The umpire has challenged the call,

725
00:46:51,016 --> 00:46:54,561
and they are conducting a video review.

726
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:58,690
According to the video review,

727
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:01,360
the blue-satba competitor's elbow

728
00:47:01,443 --> 00:47:04,613
touched the ground first.
The winner is the red-satba competitor!

729
00:47:06,114 --> 00:47:09,159
Mister, are you sure?

730
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:10,953
I don't think so.

731
00:47:11,036 --> 00:47:14,081
Lim Dong-seok seems dumbfounded as well.

732
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:17,709
Of course. He's surprised
by the benefit he got.

733
00:47:28,428 --> 00:47:30,472
There was a wrestler
by the name of Lim Dong-seok.

734
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:32,766
He was the coach's favorite wrestler,

735
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:36,061
but he recently transferred
to another team.

736
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:40,649
He's upset because all the time and effort
he invested in that kid

737
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:43,277
ended up benefiting the other team.

738
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:47,489
Still, why does he look so devastated

739
00:47:48,865 --> 00:47:50,576
when his favorite boy won?

740
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:00,836
Why?

741
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:05,841
There's got to be something.

742
00:48:13,265 --> 00:48:14,683
Here.

743
00:48:14,766 --> 00:48:16,810
-Thank you. Bye.
-Bye.

744
00:48:23,191 --> 00:48:26,153
BADA SUPERMARKET

745
00:48:29,906 --> 00:48:30,991
Hello.

746
00:48:33,952 --> 00:48:35,120
Hey, Baek-du.

747
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:37,164
Do you know her?

748
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:38,790
Yes, she's…

749
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:40,500
Wait.

750
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:45,255
You're right. Why did I say hi to her?

751
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:04,316
-One, two!
-One, two!

752
00:49:04,399 --> 00:49:05,984
-One, two!
-One, two!

753
00:49:11,823 --> 00:49:12,908
Ms. Oh.

754
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:15,410
Are you busy?

755
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:19,206
We've got a new coach.

756
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:26,213
CONGRATULATIONS ON RETIREMENT

757
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:27,297
How much is it?

758
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:31,051
Excluding the rice, it's 210,000 won.

759
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:34,096
But I'll round it down to 200,000 won.

760
00:49:34,179 --> 00:49:35,889
No need. You'll get the full amount.

761
00:49:35,972 --> 00:49:37,683
Oh, Jin-suk.

762
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:39,559
Thank you!

763
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:41,228
-Here.
-Wait.

764
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:42,688
-What…
-Wait.

765
00:49:42,771 --> 00:49:44,773
-Here. Let me…
-Hey!

766
00:49:44,898 --> 00:49:46,274
What are you doing?

767
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:47,526
-Come on.
-What?

768
00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:48,610
What are you doing?

769
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:51,154
Don't be so cold like that.

770
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:54,825
Just let me do this much
for Baek-du's retirement.

771
00:49:54,908 --> 00:49:56,243
What the… Just take this.

772
00:49:56,326 --> 00:50:00,956
I wanted to give him
a retirement gift anyway.

773
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:03,875
-Gosh.
-You got Jin-su a suit

774
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:06,253
when he retired, remember?

775
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:08,088
Well, that's because…

776
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:09,256
It's okay. Take this.

777
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:11,299
Goodness. She's so strong.

778
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:12,509
-Come on.
-Put it back.

779
00:50:12,592 --> 00:50:13,844
She's the champions' mom.

780
00:50:14,636 --> 00:50:17,973
Please go and tell Baek-du

781
00:50:18,056 --> 00:50:23,061
that I said he did a great job

782
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:25,939
and I wish him the best.

783
00:50:26,022 --> 00:50:27,315
-Oh, you.
-Here.

784
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:28,400
Thanks, Hyeon-ja.

785
00:50:28,483 --> 00:50:31,445
-Round it down. I'll pay it all at once.
-Okay.

786
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:33,029
These are on the house, right?

787
00:50:33,488 --> 00:50:35,782
-I usually don't give out two.
-Unbelievable.

788
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:40,078
The day before yesterday,

789
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:43,331
I called this guy with the slightest hope
that he might say yes.

790
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:45,876
It's not like it could hurt,

791
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:48,670
so I thought I might as well
just give it a shot.

792
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:51,131
But he quietly listened to what I said

793
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:53,383
and said, "Okay, I'll do it."

794
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:55,761
He accepted!

795
00:50:56,261 --> 00:50:58,638
How amazing is that?

796
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:00,474
So I went to meet him yesterday

797
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:02,225
-and--
-Wait, sir.

798
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:04,060
-Yes?
-I…

799
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:06,980
I'm not sure who you're talking about.

800
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:08,648
Oh, right.

801
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,818
Look at me,

802
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:14,821
going on about him
without telling you who he is.

803
00:51:23,205 --> 00:51:26,458
It isn't easy to recruit a coach like him.

804
00:51:27,709 --> 00:51:31,296
Especially for a team like ours, you know.

805
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:34,633
So what do you think?

806
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:37,803
Not bad, right?

807
00:51:44,726 --> 00:51:48,104
Skill-wise, he's absolutely the best.

808
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:51,858
He's also pretty friendly,
so the boys will get along with him okay.

809
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:55,070
But above all…

810
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:58,615
Oh, my. What's he doing here?

811
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:01,409
…he's from Geosan.

812
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:03,203
He's a native.

813
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:19,427
Do you know it?

814
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:21,847
-I know.
-You're so strong.

815
00:52:22,722 --> 00:52:24,599
What did you eat to become so strong?

816
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:30,188
Wait, isn't that my boy?

817
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:40,073
Kwak Jin-su

818
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:42,784
is leaving Seongwon's coaching position

819
00:52:42,868 --> 00:52:45,287
and becoming our coach.

820
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:50,542
This is a massive jackpot for our team.

821
00:52:50,625 --> 00:52:52,419
Kwak Jin-su is coming as a coach?

822
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:56,339
All right. I'll meet with Jin-su
as soon as possible

823
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:58,091
and have the contract signed.

824
00:52:58,174 --> 00:53:01,094
Just so you know.

825
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:03,847
Wait, sir.

826
00:53:04,806 --> 00:53:08,310
Actually, there's someone
I wanted to recommend.

827
00:53:10,812 --> 00:53:14,357
Healthy fish good for your body

828
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:19,029
Here. Eat up.

829
00:53:22,782 --> 00:53:24,200
Did something happen?

830
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:26,244
No.

831
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:29,664
Then, why did you come without any notice?

832
00:53:29,748 --> 00:53:31,541
You left only recently.

833
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:36,087
Wait. Did you…

834
00:53:36,171 --> 00:53:38,048
Did you get fired?

835
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:40,383
It's nothing like that.

836
00:53:41,217 --> 00:53:43,011
Then, what is it?

837
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:44,763
Tell me.

838
00:53:47,015 --> 00:53:48,224
Oh, for goodness' sake.

839
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:52,437
Gosh, you're driving me crazy!

840
00:53:57,275 --> 00:53:58,944
-Mom.
-Yes.

841
00:53:59,986 --> 00:54:01,905
I'm going to settle down here.

842
00:54:01,988 --> 00:54:03,073
What?

843
00:54:05,825 --> 00:54:07,577
GEOSAN-GUN TEAM
COACH PARK DONG-CHAN

844
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:11,915
Hi. Just a second.

845
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:14,751
What's going on?

846
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:18,797
Yes.

847
00:54:20,298 --> 00:54:21,800
Yes, I've just arrived here.

848
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:23,802
Okay.

849
00:54:25,845 --> 00:54:27,639
"Conserve."

850
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:30,517
"To keep in a safe state."

851
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:31,726
Gosh, this is hard.

852
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:46,408
Gosh, you're so loud. Speak quietly.

853
00:54:47,993 --> 00:54:48,827
What?

854
00:54:49,661 --> 00:54:51,079
I did what?

855
00:54:57,544 --> 00:54:59,587
JIN-SU'S RESTAURANT

856
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:01,840
Baek-du. Are you listening?

857
00:55:03,049 --> 00:55:05,135
Yes, I'm here. I'm listening.

858
00:55:05,218 --> 00:55:08,221
Do you know what's even crazier?

859
00:55:08,304 --> 00:55:11,349
The head coach barely managed
to recruit Kwak Jin-su,

860
00:55:11,433 --> 00:55:13,810
but the new general manager opposed.

861
00:55:13,893 --> 00:55:16,688
Saying that she'd prefer you as a coach.

862
00:55:16,771 --> 00:55:18,064
What? No.

863
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:20,567
I never said I wanted to do that.

864
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:28,825
Wait.

865
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:34,831
Gosh, what is Du-sik up to?

866
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:40,587
There's literally nothing
to do these days.

867
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:45,341
I feel like even Snowball has been
behaving these last few days, right?

868
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:47,427
-Snowball is pregnant.
-What?

869
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:51,181
It's matured her. She won't run away
even when she's off-leash.

870
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:55,226
Oh, no. We lost our regular customer.

871
00:55:56,269 --> 00:55:59,481
Then, what do we write about
on our report now?

872
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:02,901
You go ahead.

873
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:12,035
Excuse me, ma'am.

874
00:56:13,244 --> 00:56:14,913
Ma'am?

875
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:19,042
I see you're in there. Could you
roll down the window for a second?

876
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:23,088
Should I call a tow truck?

877
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:25,131
I'm going to call one now.

878
00:56:28,259 --> 00:56:31,012
Ma'am, you're not allowed to park here.

879
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:36,893
May I see your driver's license, please?

880
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:44,275
PEACEFUL GEOSAN, THE HOME OF CLEAR SEAS,
GREEN MOUNTAINS, AND HAPPY RESIDENTS

881
00:56:49,114 --> 00:56:51,991
What the… Did they all go home already?

882
00:56:52,992 --> 00:56:54,911
Darn it.

883
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:22,272
Gosh, could you please just…

884
00:57:23,398 --> 00:57:24,315
Jeez.

885
00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:26,860
You're one weird woman.

886
00:57:28,903 --> 00:57:29,904
Chu Mi-suk?

887
00:57:33,032 --> 00:57:35,368
Chu Mi-suk?

888
00:57:38,663 --> 00:57:39,747
Hello, sir.

889
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:43,001
I'm new to this town,
so I'm a little lost.

890
00:57:43,084 --> 00:57:44,544
Is that so?

891
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:46,921
-Where are you going?
-Well…

892
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:50,592
The address is 15-2,
but it's not coming up on my GPS.

893
00:57:50,675 --> 00:57:52,510
Wait, 15-2?

894
00:57:53,386 --> 00:57:55,054
That's where Du-sik used to live.

895
00:58:02,770 --> 00:58:04,481
What are you doing there?

896
00:58:10,737 --> 00:58:12,906
Did you drop some money or something?

897
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:14,866
Why are you looking at the sand so fondly?

898
00:58:14,949 --> 00:58:16,659
I wasn't looking at anything.

899
00:58:17,243 --> 00:58:19,037
Didn't you get off work already?

900
00:58:20,121 --> 00:58:21,206
Why do you care

901
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:24,709
if I got off work or not?
It's none of your business.

902
00:58:24,792 --> 00:58:27,670
What are you up to?
Don't come in. The sand can hurt your…

903
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:30,632
Jeez.

904
00:58:31,716 --> 00:58:33,468
You haven't

905
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:36,596
changed at all.

906
00:58:37,597 --> 00:58:38,556
Well.

907
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:42,685
People don't change easily.

908
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:47,690
Oh, right. Why did you do that?

909
00:58:48,316 --> 00:58:49,484
What do you mean?

910
00:58:49,567 --> 00:58:51,110
The coaching position.

911
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:54,030
You told the head coach
I should be the coach here.

912
00:58:54,113 --> 00:58:55,156
Ma'am.

913
00:58:55,865 --> 00:58:59,035
It's not like there was no one to do it.
Jin-su said he'd do it.

914
00:58:59,118 --> 00:59:03,206
Why drag me in when I don't want anything
to do with ssireum anymore--

915
00:59:03,289 --> 00:59:05,124
What the heck?

916
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:07,835
-Hey!
-Hey, you. Kim Baek-du.

917
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:10,380
"Hey, you. Kim Baek-du"?

918
00:59:12,757 --> 00:59:14,133
Will you stop lying?

919
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:17,762
What do you mean, I'm lying?

920
00:59:17,845 --> 00:59:20,723
You quit ssireum because you hate it?

921
00:59:23,643 --> 00:59:24,978
Bullshit.

922
00:59:27,313 --> 00:59:28,690
You see,

923
00:59:29,732 --> 00:59:32,944
you may be able to fool others,
but not me.

924
00:59:38,366 --> 00:59:39,409
Do you know why?

925
00:59:48,126 --> 00:59:49,210
Because I am…

926
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,174
Du-sik.

927
01:00:10,315 --> 01:00:13,067
LIKE FLOWERS IN SAND

928
01:00:36,674 --> 01:00:37,967
Let's have a match.

929
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:42,055
You and I will have a match
to decide who should be the coach.

930
01:00:42,138 --> 01:00:44,015
This is all because of Oh Du-sik.

931
01:00:44,098 --> 01:00:46,392
Now, I'm in a pickle.

932
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:48,645
-Why are you doing this--
-Because I need you.

933
01:00:48,728 --> 01:00:50,980
Both the team and I need you.

934
01:00:51,064 --> 01:00:53,566
That lady… What's she doing here?

935
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:56,611
We want to check a few things
regarding the accident

936
01:00:56,694 --> 01:00:58,321
that happened here a while ago.

937
01:00:58,404 --> 01:01:00,657
A suspect in the murder
of Choi Chil-seong,

938
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:02,492
who we've chased for years.

939
01:01:02,575 --> 01:01:03,660
Me?

940
01:01:05,578 --> 01:01:07,580
