1
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:45,962
LIKE FLOWERS IN SAND

2
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:48,131
Attention, everyone.

3
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:49,382
GEOSAN SUMMER SSIREUM CAMP

4
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:53,261
As your coach,
I appreciate you training hard

5
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:55,805
in this hot weather.

6
00:00:56,556 --> 00:01:01,061
This year, we're going
to turn over a new leaf and work harder,

7
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:03,188
and definitely bring back the trophy

8
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:07,692
that Singye Elementary School
took from us last year. Understood?

9
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:09,194
-Yes, Coach!
-Yes, Coach!

10
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:10,361
All right.

11
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:13,198
Right.

12
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:16,534
About our team captain…

13
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:18,411
We don't have one right now.

14
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,288
Any volunteers?

15
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:24,667
He said it wouldn't take long.
I'm boiling here.

16
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:27,378
Come on, boys.
Having a captain is very important.

17
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,923
Every team needs a captain.

18
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:34,302
Fine. If nobody volunteers…

19
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:37,972
I'll give some privileges
to the captain then.

20
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:42,227
-You fourth-graders, listen carefully.
-Yes, Coach!

21
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:45,271
I could make you a captain too,
as long as you qualify.

22
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:46,940
-Got it?
-Yes, Coach!

23
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:49,484
If you become the captain,

24
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:53,238
I will meet with your homeroom teacher
and ask them to excuse you

25
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:56,407
-from cleaning duty.
-Did you hear that?

26
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:57,951
That sounds amazing.

27
00:01:58,034 --> 00:01:59,911
-Is he serious?
-Because

28
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:02,497
the captain must clean the ssireum ring.

29
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:06,126
One more thing.

30
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:11,339
When we ride the van to the game together,

31
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:14,050
the captain can sit alone
in the spacious passenger seat,

32
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,219
right next to me, Head Coach.

33
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:18,638
Imagine the open view you'll have there.

34
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:22,225
There's more.

35
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,770
If we win the game this year,

36
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:27,772
the captain will receive the trophy

37
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:31,109
and stand in the center
when we take a group photo.

38
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:34,362
Only the stars can be
in the center, you know.

39
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:36,573
And lastly,

40
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,117
when all of us train for three hours,

41
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:42,162
the captain will train for 180 minutes.

42
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:46,332
-How does that sound?
-Is he stupid?

43
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,751
Does anyone want to volunteer

44
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,879
for the captain position on our team?

45
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:53,798
If you want to, raise your hand.

46
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:03,391
EPISODE 6
WHAT CANNOT BE HIDDEN

47
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:06,728
What are you talking about?

48
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:08,062
Because of me? Why?

49
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:11,733
Do you…

50
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,904
Do you…

51
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:18,990
Do you…

52
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:20,700
have…

53
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:24,746
feelings for me?

54
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:26,789
What?

55
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,207
Answer me.

56
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:30,501
Do you like me?

57
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,713
Jeez. Come on.

58
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:35,298
What are you talking about?

59
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:38,384
I came back to help you
with the investigation.

60
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:39,385
What?

61
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:40,887
Why would you?

62
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,723
Well…

63
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:46,184
I want you to crack the case

64
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:48,895
that you're dealing with
and get a promotion in Seoul.

65
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:51,564
That's why I came back.

66
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:55,944
That's all?

67
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:58,947
Do you need another reason?

68
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,199
Look, this was a big decision for me.

69
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:02,659
It wasn't an easy decision.

70
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,744
You should know that, okay?

71
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:07,455
If you need
any inside information about the team,

72
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:10,833
ask me anytime.
I'll gladly be your spy and--

73
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:15,296
Spy, my foot!

74
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,048
You're just…

75
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:19,676
Seriously…

76
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:24,430
Never mind.

77
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,058
What? What is it this time?

78
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:28,309
Wait up.

79
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:33,523
Why wouldn't you want me to help?
What's the matter?

80
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,024
First love?

81
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:40,905
How did you know?

82
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:43,783
Well…

83
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:51,291
-I saw something.
-What did you see?

84
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:54,043
That's all I can tell you.

85
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,962
It's all I know.

86
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:58,965
Right.

87
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:03,428
If you learn anything more about Du-sik,

88
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:05,138
you should tell me too.

89
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:06,681
Give and take, you know.

90
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:08,224
Sure.

91
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:12,520
But I'm an outsider,
so I don't think I'll find out much.

92
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:15,273
Come on, you're too humble.

93
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:21,195
By the way,

94
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:23,656
are you sure about this?

95
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:25,158
What do you mean?

96
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:30,705
You saw those guys
gossiping about Dong-seok earlier.

97
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:36,461
And you're involved in this too.
Are you okay with all the gossip?

98
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:38,755
Dong-seok and I didn't do anything.

99
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:43,301
People don't care about that
when they gossip.

100
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:45,803
They just say whatever they want to say.

101
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:47,346
Gosh, who cares?

102
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,183
Don't worry about those things.

103
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,103
You're just clueless, aren't you?

104
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:59,817
Do you have any idea
how fast word can spread?

105
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:04,489
And nasty words spread even faster.

106
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,869
And they don't die down,

107
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:11,829
until they ruin everything.

108
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:13,873
Du-sik.

109
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:15,958
By any chance,

110
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,629
a long time ago…

111
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:21,923
What?

112
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:25,343
What are you trying to say?

113
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:28,387
-I mean…
-Honey.

114
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,142
Honey, my foot.

115
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,144
Shut your trap, understand?

116
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,607
Hey, I thought you went to bed.

117
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,651
I couldn't sleep without you.

118
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,277
So I went for a walk.

119
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:44,821
Jeez.

120
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:47,073
-Why are you two together?
-What?

121
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:49,867
Oh, we ran into each other over there.

122
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:50,993
Where exactly?

123
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,703
Over there is over there.

124
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:54,580
How do we know the exact location?

125
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:58,626
We're not a GPS map.
We can't tell you the exact coordinates.

126
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,044
"We"?

127
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:02,713
"We"?

128
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:04,423
Excuse me, Mr. Kim.

129
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:05,842
-Gosh, I'm tired.
-What…

130
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,261
What a long day it's been.

131
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:09,887
-Wait.
-Get inside now.

132
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,806
-Go now.
-You called him "honey" too.

133
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:13,766
-Mr. Kim, you should go home too.
-What?

134
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:14,809
"Mr. Kim"?

135
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:16,769
-See you tomorrow, Mr. Kim.
-Mr. Kim?

136
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:21,399
Unbelievable.

137
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:25,111
Seriously…

138
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,585
Did you go to Seongwon alone?

139
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:42,628
What?

140
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,297
Did you go by yourself?

141
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:48,134
Of course. Who would I have gone with?

142
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,845
-Are you close with Kim Baek-du?
-What?

143
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:54,682
No. Why would I be?

144
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,060
Why would I be close with him?

145
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,979
You're being ridiculous again.

146
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:04,317
It's just that I've seen you
with that boy a lot lately.

147
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,570
I told you. We just ran into each other.

148
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:10,907
Also, he's not a boy.

149
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:20,750
-What did you do today?
-Me? Nothing much.

150
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:25,630
Oh, right. You know Du-sik too, right?

151
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:30,092
-Who?
-Du-sik.

152
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,886
Someone who used to live here.

153
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,304
How do you know…

154
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:38,184
-Who told you that?
-The owner of Ran's Coffee.

155
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:42,063
-Ran's Coffee?
-Yes.

156
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:46,400
Remember you mentioned Du-sik
at the gym the other day?

157
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:47,818
I did?

158
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,363
When?

159
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,115
I don't remember.

160
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:57,828
So what about Du-sik?

161
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,164
Nothing. I just heard about her.

162
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:04,752
By the way, Yu-gyeong.

163
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:07,547
Well…

164
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,299
About the café owner…

165
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:12,218
Well…

166
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,556
Never mind.

167
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:19,308
What is it? What were you going to say?

168
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,352
Nothing. You must be tired. Get some rest.

169
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:27,525
What was that?

170
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:32,738
Ran's Coffee's owner talked about me?

171
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,909
I can't believe this.

172
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:38,661
"Honey"?

173
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:43,833
Honey, my foot. She's not his honey.

174
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:46,669
What a perv.

175
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,761
Do you like me?

176
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:58,055
Me?

177
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:03,686
Jeez. That would be ridiculous.

178
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:07,023
That's just nonsense.

179
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,359
What a weird thing to say.

180
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,030
GEOSAN POLICE STATION

181
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,591
WITNESS WANTED

182
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:36,886
INCIDENT LOCATION
BETWEEN GEOSAN COASTAL ROAD & GEOSAN LAKE

183
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:42,141
So Coach Yeon asked Lim Dong-seok
to fix the match,

184
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:44,143
but Lim refused.

185
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:47,772
Regardless, he practically lost the match,

186
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:50,983
but he accidentally won
because of an unexpected bad call.

187
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:54,779
So Coach Yeon found himself
stuck in a corner and disappeared.

188
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:58,699
And he ended up committing suicide
due to the overwhelming pressure, right?

189
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:02,995
I think someone came to meet
Coach Yeon at the arena that day.

190
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,372
Lim Dong-seok said

191
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:07,875
that Coach Yeon seemed anxious
throughout the entire match.

192
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:11,921
Someone who had been pressuring Coach Yeon
came to see him on game day?

193
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:14,507
Wait.

194
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:18,969
But that game was held
after Choi Chil-seong's death.

195
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:23,808
That means there's someone else
involved in this other than Choi.

196
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:25,976
We'll need to find out

197
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:29,814
if the three of them are
actually involved,

198
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:32,149
and if they are, how that came to be.

199
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:35,694
But there were so many people
at the arena that day.

200
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,029
What do we do?

201
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,365
Oh, well.

202
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:43,202
We've got to check
each of them one by one.

203
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:47,706
Right.

204
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,835
What were you going to say yesterday?
About the café owner.

205
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:53,045
It's really nothing.

206
00:11:56,215 --> 00:12:00,052
Have you been going around
gathering gossip?

207
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:02,304
You seem to have a lot of free time.

208
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:04,890
Have you found anything about Choi?

209
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:07,560
I'm going to do that now.

210
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:17,653
That punk…

211
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:28,122
-Here.
-What is it?

212
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:29,248
On the seventh?

213
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,208
When was that?

214
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:33,419
That's the day of the reservoir incident.

215
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:35,296
-About half a month ago.
-Come on.

216
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:36,797
I barely remember yesterday.

217
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:39,049
Half a month ago is almost
like a past life to me.

218
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:40,551
By the way,

219
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:42,887
what about that day?

220
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:45,598
Remember the man who died there that day?

221
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:49,059
It seems like something happened
just before he died.

222
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:50,102
Why?

223
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:53,105
Did somebody see something?

224
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:55,983
She didn't exactly say she did,
but I can feel it.

225
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:57,693
Who is she?

226
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:00,321
Snowball.

227
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,866
Are you kidding me?

228
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,743
You came here to say that nonsense?

229
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:07,036
It's not nonsense.

230
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:09,955
Snowball was barking alone
at the reservoir yesterday.

231
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,165
Isn't that strange?

232
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:13,292
Of course she barks. She's a dog.

233
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,419
She doesn't usually bark.

234
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:16,879
-Goodness.
-You know too.

235
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:19,924
Snowball even has a nickname.
Gandhi, the pacifist.

236
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:24,637
Isn't it strange that such a dog
was barking alone at the reservoir?

237
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,056
-Which part of the reservoir?
-Is this fun to you?

238
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:28,974
Is it?

239
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:35,189
Seriously, why are you even
playing along with this nonsense?

240
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:36,482
-Honey, it's--
-What?

241
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:40,945
I think Baek-du is seeing a girl.

242
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:41,946
-What?
-What?

243
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:43,781
What are you saying?

244
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,450
My hubby saw them
at the terminal yesterday.

245
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:50,538
I hope the flowers
won't be crushed on the way.

246
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:52,540
There he is.

247
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:53,707
Hello, sir.

248
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,254
This is the recipient's info.

249
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:02,383
Someone's supposed
to be waiting at the destination,

250
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:04,218
but try this number just in case.

251
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:06,178
Hey, wait up.

252
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:11,850
Is that Baek-du?

253
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:16,355
He saw Baek-du and some girl
walking close together.

254
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:18,857
Some girl? Who's the girl?

255
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:24,321
-I don't know.
-What?

256
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:26,991
My hubby only saw their backs.

257
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:29,076
It was really crowded there.

258
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:33,831
Hey. Do you know anything?
You guys are friends.

259
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:36,166
Well, we don't talk about that stuff…

260
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:37,710
-Why not?
-Wait.

261
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:40,170
Obviously, I wasn't thinking.

262
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:42,298
I must've been possessed by something.

263
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,218
Possessed by what?

264
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:49,513
You don't want to know.
It's some evil girl.

265
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,895
What is it? Did you hear something?

266
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,232
No, I didn't hear anything.

267
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:01,567
Oh, whatever.

268
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:05,279
If you don't know for sure,
don't gossip about it.

269
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:09,575
If you spread false rumors
about that family, you're all dead meat.

270
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:10,701
Okay.

271
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:13,078
Take this and go.

272
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:21,879
2023 GEOSAN DANO SSIREUM CHAMPIONSHIPS

273
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,134
By the way,

274
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:32,973
do you know if anyone came to see
the coach that day in the arena?

275
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,809
The coach was acting strange.

276
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:39,271
He seemed anxious
throughout the whole game.

277
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:45,986
He kept looking at the back
of the audience, as if he'd upset someone.

278
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,377
You saw him arguing with someone? Where?

279
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:05,756
So he was seen behind the building.

280
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:07,883
Who was he fighting with?

281
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:13,013
Beom-su said he didn't see that either.
The person was covered by something.

282
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:36,412
There aren't even any CCTVs here.

283
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,581
Kim Baek-du!

284
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:42,668
He wouldn't let him win
with the same technique.

285
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:47,214
Kim seized the chance
and scored with a counterattack.

286
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:03,272
He does look like he's looking at someone.

287
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:18,495
Darn it.
I can't find that person like this.

288
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,416
And this is the only video clip I have.

289
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,212
This is driving me crazy.

290
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:29,882
Attention, everyone.

291
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,260
Attention for what now?

292
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:44,855
The head coach just called me,

293
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:48,358
and the tournament draw
is getting delayed for some reason.

294
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,404
He'll give me a call once it's finished.

295
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:53,822
Just so that you know.

296
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,116
-Yes, Coach!
-Yes, Coach!

297
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:58,702
And…

298
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,955
since the game is just a few days away,

299
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:04,249
my mom made some samgyetang for you.

300
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:08,337
Thank you, Coach!

301
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,339
If you're free, come by and have some.

302
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:12,007
-Yes, Coach!
-Thank you!

303
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:14,176
Baek-du, are you coming too?

304
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,719
Sure. I can stop by.

305
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:16,887
Kim Baek-du.

306
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,473
You'll run 100 laps before coming.

307
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:21,141
What?

308
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:24,436
You need to work on the basics again.

309
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:29,900
Starting today, I want you to run 100 laps
after training. Okay?

310
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,029
All right. Dismissed.

311
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,740
-Dismissed.
-Wait, Coach.

312
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:39,618
What?

313
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:41,370
Just me?

314
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:59,555
You sound like you're drinking alcohol.

315
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:09,940
So that's what you drink
when you're angry?

316
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:12,985
How did you know I was angry?

317
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,154
I watched from upstairs.

318
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:20,784
Why did you have to peek at that?

319
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,662
Jin-su was being unfair.

320
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:26,290
-You've got to fight back.
-What?

321
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:31,295
He's just as uptight
as he was when he was little.

322
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:34,464
He needs to be more laid-back. Am I right?

323
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,180
You're right. That's Jin-su.

324
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:46,185
Did you find that out, by the way?

325
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:49,188
-Find out what?
-What Dong-seok said.

326
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,107
Did you find out
who came to see Coach that day?

327
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:55,485
I'm not even close to finding out.
I'm still clueless.

328
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:57,905
Really? But why?

329
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:00,657
There were so many people in the audience.

330
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:03,994
And the camera didn't capture
the audience close-up.

331
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:08,290
I only have brief shots of random footage,
so it isn't easy.

332
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,709
I see.

333
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:17,466
Hey, could this work?

334
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:21,762
If you zoom in close on the coach's eyes,

335
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:25,224
-maybe you can see the reflection of--
-Do you like American TV shows?

336
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:27,392
Yes.

337
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:32,272
Seriously, look.

338
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:35,025
If I'm close to you like this,

339
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:39,529
you can see the reflection
of yourself on my eyes.

340
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:41,365
Right?

341
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:43,659
There you go again, being ridiculous.

342
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:46,703
No, seriously. Look at me.

343
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:50,123
I can see my reflection now.

344
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:53,585
You see, the eyes are the most
reflective part of the human body.

345
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:54,962
Just look.

346
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:58,048
I can see myself on your brown eyes now.

347
00:20:58,131 --> 00:20:59,549
-I can't…
-Yes, you can.

348
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:01,093
-Just look at them.
-I can't.

349
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:02,010
Just try.

350
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,512
-You can see it.
-I said I can't!

351
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:04,554
-Try.
-Gosh, go away!

352
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:06,265
-You can--
-Kim Baek-du!

353
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:09,017
What are you doing there? Go run laps!

354
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,187
There he goes again.

355
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:17,317
Anyway, let me know if you need any help.

356
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:18,360
Bye.

357
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:24,074
Has he seriously lost his mind?

358
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:28,829
How dare he try to pull cheap tricks?

359
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:35,836
No, I'm not going.

360
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:39,881
Enjoy the food.
I'm too tired to eat chicken.

361
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:42,634
All right.

362
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:44,928
Enjoy. Bye then.

363
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:47,806
What?

364
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:51,476
I did run all 100 laps!

365
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,688
Tell him I didn't miss a single lap!

366
00:21:57,524 --> 00:21:58,859
Darn it.

367
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:02,821
Look, why would I go
to the reservoir at that hour?

368
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:03,905
I'm not crazy.

369
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,908
Then, could you ask around

370
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:11,121
and see if anyone was passing by
at that time on that day?

371
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:14,750
Jeez.

372
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:16,543
Gosh, you scared me.

373
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:20,464
What's up? Are you coming from training?

374
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:23,300
BADA SUPERMARKET

375
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:24,551
See?

376
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:27,596
Training at this age isn't easy.

377
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:30,932
Give it.

378
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:34,978
You should've just quit
when you said you'd retire.

379
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:38,440
Why did you go back?
You're only making it worse for yourself.

380
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:45,238
Right. Are you seeing a girl these days?

381
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:46,990
What?

382
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:50,118
Suk-hui said earlier

383
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:53,246
that Gil-su saw you
with some woman at the terminal.

384
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,498
Was that really you?

385
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:56,124
He said he saw a woman?

386
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,959
Did he see her face too?

387
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:00,378
No, just her back.

388
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:03,381
So he's right.

389
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,176
Who is she? Who are you seeing?

390
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:08,428
Don't be silly. I'm not seeing anyone.

391
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:09,513
I've got to go.

392
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,681
Oh, boy.

393
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:13,683
Gosh, this is painful.

394
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:15,185
Right, dating isn't for you.

395
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:18,355
Wait. So no more police exam prep, right?

396
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:19,731
Then, give my book back.

397
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:22,317
When I get married,
it'll be my family heirloom.

398
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:23,819
What book?

399
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:28,657
Jeez, you don't even remember.
You didn't even open the book, did you?

400
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:32,869
The police exam prep book.
I lent it to you a while ago.

401
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:34,412
Right. That book.

402
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:38,041
Where did that book go?

403
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:39,835
Geum-gang.

404
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:41,837
-Could you move the trivet mat?
-Sure.

405
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:50,554
Man, this looks good.

406
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:54,391
Hey, what is this, a whole aquarium?

407
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:57,310
Are you trying to gain weight?
You competing in a match?

408
00:23:57,394 --> 00:24:00,188
Their food comes in big portions
and it's very tasty.

409
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,607
I want to see how much I can eat.

410
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:04,109
But why?

411
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,903
Look. Doesn't it look amazing?

412
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:10,574
You're splattering it all over.

413
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:17,122
-Geum-gang.
-Yeah.

414
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:19,040
I'm thinking of starting a mukbang.

415
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:20,792
-Mukbang?
-Yes.

416
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:23,587
I didn't want to get into that business

417
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:26,631
because it kind of felt like cheating.

418
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:30,302
But my subscribers just
aren't interested in other things.

419
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:32,179
So I have no other choice

420
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:33,930
but to go back to my specialty.

421
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:36,600
Will that get you more subscribers?

422
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:42,272
Do you know
what draws people to other people?

423
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:43,190
What is it?

424
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:48,069
A question mark.

425
00:24:49,487 --> 00:24:50,572
It's a question mark.

426
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:53,366
That's how the human mind works.

427
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:55,118
You're drawn to someone

428
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:56,703
-who makes you curious.
-I see.

429
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:59,164
Let's say you met me
for the first time today.

430
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:00,916
And if I seemed mysterious,

431
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:04,294
then you'd want to see me again,
wouldn't you?

432
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:08,173
So imagine people see you
devouring food on a mukbang.

433
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:10,091
What would they think?

434
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,885
"He eats a lot."

435
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:14,137
"That's how he became so big."

436
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:16,056
"And that's why he does ssireum."

437
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:18,808
There would be no question marks.

438
00:25:19,517 --> 00:25:22,896
Okay? And now, think outside the box.

439
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:25,523
You do a mukbang where you eat little.

440
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:28,443
You eat slowly from a small bowl.

441
00:25:28,526 --> 00:25:31,571
Then, what would people think?

442
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:34,616
"Why is he eating so little?
Is he sick?"

443
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:36,201
You'll arouse sympathy.

444
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:37,911
"Wait. It's odd."

445
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:40,956
"He doesn't eat much, but he's big."
You make them curious.

446
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,709
All these question marks will make you

447
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:47,045
a streamer with a million subscribers!

448
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:49,089
Should I start a small-portion mukbang?

449
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:51,841
However, all of that aside,

450
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:54,844
do you really think
people would like to see you

451
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:56,388
eat like a pig?

452
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:01,518
Then, what?

453
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:06,189
What should I do
to arouse their curiosity…

454
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:09,150
Did you get an idea?

455
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:11,278
Eat up.

456
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:14,572
Help yourself.

457
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,867
-It's so good.
-It's a local chicken breed.

458
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:19,995
They're grass-fed, all organic.

459
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:21,371
It's delicious.

460
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:23,665
Man, look at this chicken.

461
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:26,209
This one fell down.

462
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:28,211
It's admitting defeat.

463
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:30,171
Who wants to eat it and win?

464
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:32,048
-Me.
-All right.

465
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:33,383
Just one more bowl.

466
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:35,427
-This is your third bowl.
-It's so good.

467
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,137
Now, you have to win, okay?

468
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:42,183
-It's so good.
-This is so tasty.

469
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:43,601
Hi, Coach.

470
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:46,604
I saw the brackets.

471
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:50,191
Overall, it seems okay.

472
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,279
Yes, I think we stand a chance.

473
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:56,865
All right.

474
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:01,661
By the way, about Kim Baek-du…

475
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:32,025
Kim Baek-du's definitely…

476
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:35,278
rubbed off on me.

477
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:40,283
NATIONAL NAMHANG SSIREUM CHAMPIONSHIPS
D-3

478
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:42,327
Let's give it a go.

479
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:45,246
Let's do this!

480
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:50,543
Oh, boy.

481
00:27:55,673 --> 00:27:57,133
Baek-du.

482
00:27:57,217 --> 00:28:01,221
I want you to listen carefully
to what I say.

483
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:03,390
-I don't want to.
-Hey.

484
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:07,060
I'm making this suggestion for your sake.

485
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:10,980
How do people react
to streamers these days?

486
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:15,360
They go, "What? Oh, my gosh!"

487
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:18,321
But when you say you play ssireum, "Oh…"

488
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:22,826
"I see." They'd be like this.
Do you know why?

489
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:24,953
Because it has no future.

490
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:29,999
Is that so? Then, why did you win
six championships before you retired?

491
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:32,877
What does it matter
whether I won six or sixteen?

492
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:36,256
My subscribers don't care.

493
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:40,510
Come on, Baek-du.

494
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:43,596
How about
we do a stream together next week?

495
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,723
No.

496
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:47,934
My subscribers
talk about you all the time.

497
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:50,895
They only ask me if we're really brothers

498
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:53,648
or if you have a girlfriend.
Things about you.

499
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:56,568
How do they even know about me?

500
00:28:56,651 --> 00:29:00,280
I posted a short video clip
of your Dano Championships match.

501
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:02,615
People watched that

502
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:05,785
and asked me to post the whole match,

503
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:08,371
and introduce you and all.

504
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:09,831
What? Hold on.

505
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:13,543
You filmed the match?

506
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:17,130
Come on. I'm a streamer.
Filming is what I do.

507
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:20,967
I have a four-hour, forty-minute video
of that day on this phone.

508
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:25,096
What were you filming for so long?

509
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,514
Everything.

510
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:29,142
I'm not good at filming,
so I just film everything

511
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:32,604
-and edit it later.
-Wait.

512
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:34,773
The audience.

513
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:38,026
Did you film the audience too?

514
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,447
-What?
-Tell me. Did you film the audience?

515
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:46,117
Are you serious?

516
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:50,330
I filmed everyone in detail
like a mug shot.

517
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:57,504
Darn it.

518
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:02,300
Kim Baek-du.

519
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:03,760
Hey.

520
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:05,929
Come back. Give me my phone.

521
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:07,222
Where are you now?

522
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:08,431
-Kim Baek-du!
-What?

523
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:09,849
Still at the gym?

524
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:11,309
Darn it.

525
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:13,728
The shoes are backwards.

526
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:16,523
Hey, wait!

527
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:19,818
Hey! Are you sure about this?
You'll be sorry!

528
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:21,528
Kim Baek-du!

529
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:44,676
I'm done.

530
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:49,222
Even if I keep watching this,

531
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:52,433
I'll never find anything.

532
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,702
Seriously,

533
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:14,497
who on earth was in the audience?

534
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:22,755
Du-sik!

535
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,883
I found it!

536
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:27,385
Oh, boy.

537
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:31,139
Hey.

538
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:33,516
I found it.

539
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,563
I found something

540
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:40,899
that can be really helpful to you.

541
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:43,693
What is it?

542
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:47,322
A video of the Dano Championships.

543
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:51,367
I've been scouring the video
up until just now.

544
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:54,787
This is a different one.

545
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:56,831
My brother, Han-ra, filmed it himself.

546
00:31:57,373 --> 00:31:59,042
It's four hours and forty minutes long.

547
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:02,337
-You got a call.
-What?

548
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:10,303
Anyway, he filmed the audience too.

549
00:32:10,386 --> 00:32:11,846
So check it out.

550
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,975
-Wait. Your foot.
-What?

551
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:19,062
Oh, this? It's okay.

552
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:21,189
It's just a scratch.

553
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:23,274
Go on and check out this video.

554
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:28,655
You're unbelievable.

555
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:32,241
I said, I'm coming now.

556
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:36,746
I didn't do anything.
What would I do with your phone?

557
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,414
Gosh.

558
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:44,087
I'm just borrowing it for a while
because my phone died.

559
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:46,381
Fine. I'm coming back now.

560
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:48,800
I'll be home in five minutes. Okay?

561
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:55,807
Jeez.

562
00:32:56,307 --> 00:33:00,186
He can be so annoying sometimes.
You know Han-ra, right?

563
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:04,023
You could've just sent the video file

564
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:06,317
instead of bringing his phone here.

565
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:08,027
I understand him.

566
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:11,739
I was just feeling rushed.

567
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:17,704
You could've just said,
"good job" or "thank you."

568
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:19,789
I think I deserve that much.

569
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,416
Goodness… Sure.

570
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:24,293
Thank you so much.

571
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,965
So how does it look?

572
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:34,053
Do you think it'll help?

573
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:36,681
What? Well, I'll have to see.

574
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:40,518
You can't find leads so easily.

575
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:43,896
You have to double and triple-check
to actually find something.

576
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:56,034
Could it be that person?

577
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:57,660
I don't think so.

578
00:33:58,453 --> 00:33:59,370
Maybe this person.

579
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,080
But that's me.

580
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:04,834
That's really me.

581
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:07,003
-No, this is you.
-Hey.

582
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:08,838
Did you even watch my match videos?

583
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:10,840
-I watched all of them.
-Then why…

584
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:12,008
Look.

585
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:13,968
I am looking. It's not you.

586
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:17,180
-What's wrong with you?
-This is you.

587
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:18,848
-You're crazy.
-Hey.

588
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:19,807
Hey.

589
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:22,393
-This is me.
-No, it's not.

590
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:23,978
-That's Jeong-gu?
-Yes.

591
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,396
Hey, guys. What's up?

592
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:27,482
-Hey.
-It's so complicated.

593
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:29,192
-Hey, Baek-du.
-It's confusing.

594
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:30,151
Hey.

595
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:31,402
-Hey, you came.
-Hey.

596
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:34,322
NAMHANG CHAMPIONSHIPS TAEBAEK CLASS

597
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:36,949
Who's Ahn Dong-min from Boeung City Hall?

598
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:39,410
-What?
-You don't know him?

599
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:40,495
Who is he?

600
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:42,580
-He really doesn't.
-Everyone knows him.

601
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:44,916
-We all know him.
-Who is he? What about him?

602
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:49,170
Baek-du, you should check out
other wrestlers' matches too.

603
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:52,131
He's the talk of the town these days.

604
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:53,841
For what?

605
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,426
I hear he's really strong.

606
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:58,471
Well, I heard this from someone I know.

607
00:34:58,554 --> 00:35:01,140
Apparently, he switched
from weightlifting.

608
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:02,850
-Weightlifting.
-No wonder.

609
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,310
-That sounds tough.
-Indeed.

610
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:07,438
I hear he doesn't have records
for his big three lifts.

611
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:09,023
-Why?
-Why not?

612
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:10,733
He has no limits.

613
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:13,027
-My gosh.
-Jeez.

614
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,196
-That's so cool.
-He's limitless.

615
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:18,199
The head coach did a great job
with the drawing. Good luck.

616
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:20,284
You're strong too.

617
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:22,870
-It's okay. Just beat him.
-You can do it.

618
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:25,456
-Seon-min, get ready for a stretch.
-Okay.

619
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:31,337
Let's warm up. One.

620
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,506
Two, three, four, five, six…

621
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:34,966
I can tell he's worried.

622
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:38,469
Two, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

623
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:40,179
Again?

624
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:43,224
What's wrong with the coach?

625
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:46,018
He picked the worst opponent
for Baek-du last time.

626
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:48,312
I can't believe he messed up again.

627
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:50,565
Seriously, what's wrong with that bastard?

628
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:52,984
God damn it.

629
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:57,864
Anyway, I got it.

630
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:00,950
No, it's not Jin-su's fault.

631
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:03,452
All right. Bye.

632
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:12,461
Darn it.

633
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:19,302
Hey, Kim Tae-baek.

634
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:23,014
Why don't you go
and give Coach Park a good slap?

635
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:24,432
I'll cover the settlement.

636
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:35,943
GEOSAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

637
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,345
Hello.

638
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:03,429
Hello.

639
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:07,725
How may I help you?

640
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:10,645
I just want to ask some questions.

641
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:15,066
Push the shoulder in.

642
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,987
There you go. Hold out.

643
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:22,156
Right now! Yes!

644
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:27,828
Jeong-hun, keep holding out.

645
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:29,830
-Well done.
-Darn it.

646
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:32,875
-Come on.
-Okay.

647
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:33,793
Let's try again.

648
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:36,587
All right.

649
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:40,633
Hi, Ms. Oh.

650
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:43,010
-Can we talk?
-Sure.

651
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:43,970
So…

652
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:46,472
About the upcoming match…

653
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:52,436
There's something I need to tell you
about the entry.

654
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:54,438
Entry?

655
00:37:55,564 --> 00:37:57,608
-Guys, gather around.
-Yes, Coach.

656
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:58,526
Gather up.

657
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:09,495
As I always say,

658
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:11,330
try to keep in good shape.

659
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:14,750
Don't go overboard
with the weight training, okay?

660
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:16,377
-Yes, Coach!
-Yes, Coach!

661
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:19,338
Won-ho, Jeong-hun,
when you go back to the dorm,

662
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:21,007
give each other a back massage.

663
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:23,259
Back injuries never heal completely.

664
00:38:23,342 --> 00:38:26,137
Take good care of yourselves
whenever you get a chance.

665
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:28,055
-Yes, Coach.
-Yes, Coach.

666
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:30,599
-And Ho-dong.
-Yes.

667
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:33,436
Start visualization before bed
starting today.

668
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:37,273
It may not sound that helpful,
but it helped me a lot.

669
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:38,733
Yes, Coach.

670
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:40,443
One more thing.

671
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:44,155
I don't know how it was before,
but there will be no training tomorrow.

672
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:48,326
I told the head coach about it too.

673
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:50,953
That's about it. Got it?

674
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:52,705
-Yes, Coach!
-Yes, Coach!

675
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:57,126
And Kim Baek-du.

676
00:38:57,877 --> 00:38:59,628
Sure. I'll run laps.

677
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:01,172
I'll run 100 laps and--

678
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:03,591
Don't compete in the upcoming match.

679
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:06,510
What?

680
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:10,848
Didn't you hear me?
You'll be excluded from this match.

681
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:11,974
Why?

682
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:14,268
Why are you excluding me?

683
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:17,938
I don't think you're ready yet.
Far from ready.

684
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,025
What… Look.

685
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:22,693
All right. Dismissed.

686
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:27,239
I'm not ready?

687
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:29,784
What are you doing? I said, dismissed!

688
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:32,453
-Yes, sir.
-Dismissed!

689
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:35,081
Beom-su, tidy up.

690
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:35,998
Okay.

691
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:58,813
I think it's better
for Baek-du to skip the upcoming game.

692
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:04,777
The coach says
that Baek-du doesn't seem to be ready yet.

693
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:08,406
And I agree with him.

694
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:10,116
Considering what happened recently,

695
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:12,535
and his absence during retirement,

696
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:17,706
I also think he should practice more
and compete when he's better prepared.

697
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:29,552
CHAMPIONSHIP WITHDRAWAL FORM
KIM BAEK-DU, TAEBAEK CLASS

698
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:34,557
You never know until the match ends.

699
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,476
Why are they thinking of losing already?

700
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,644
This is so annoying.

701
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:07,381
What was that for?

702
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:08,299
You…

703
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:10,551
We need to talk.

704
00:41:12,094 --> 00:41:13,095
Jeez.

705
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:23,355
What is it this time?

706
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:25,941
Did I do something wrong again?

707
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:29,320
Hey.

708
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:32,448
Don't you feel anything?

709
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:33,616
Aren't you upset?

710
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:35,075
About what?

711
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:37,620
About your exclusion
from the championship.

712
00:41:37,703 --> 00:41:41,457
If I were you, it'd make me so angry
that I wouldn't even be able to sleep.

713
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:44,627
That's what you're talking about?

714
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:46,045
It's okay.

715
00:41:46,128 --> 00:41:47,838
-I can compete in the next game.
-Hey.

716
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:50,925
Take the bull by the horns
and confront him.

717
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:54,553
Grab him by the collar and tell him
he has no right to tell you what to do.

718
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:58,140
Hey, don't try and start a fight
between Jin-su and me.

719
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:01,352
Jin-su must have his reasons.

720
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:04,021
-That's why--
-What a moron.

721
00:42:05,564 --> 00:42:06,440
What?

722
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:16,700
Now that I look back,

723
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:20,412
you've always had a soft spot for Jin-su.

724
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:23,916
-Me?
-Yes, you.

725
00:42:23,999 --> 00:42:26,293
That's not true.
I don't have such a thing.

726
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:29,505
Yes, you do. You've always been like that.

727
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:31,173
When?

728
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:33,467
Remember that time

729
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:36,053
you guys were deciding
on the team captain?

730
00:42:36,136 --> 00:42:38,305
I know you wanted to raise your hand,

731
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:40,641
but when Jin-su raised his hand,
you gave up.

732
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:42,393
Gosh, you.

733
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:45,062
You still remember that?

734
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:51,527
You were being such an idiot
that it was hard to forget.

735
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:52,903
Why did you do that?

736
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:57,408
There was no special reason.
It wasn't a big deal.

737
00:42:57,491 --> 00:43:00,035
I didn't want to make things awkward.

738
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:01,036
So what?

739
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:05,207
Is it the same with the championships?
Are you just listening to him

740
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:08,002
because you don't want
to make things awkward?

741
00:43:09,878 --> 00:43:13,591
Jeez, you're such a pushover.

742
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:20,097
Hey.

743
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:23,684
You've got to stop
putting others before you.

744
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,186
It's your life, not theirs.

745
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,522
That's not what it is. I just--

746
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:31,650
Just live your life!

747
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:35,070
If you want to do something, say it.
If you don't, say that too.

748
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:38,490
Otherwise, you'll regret it later.

749
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:41,160
Also…

750
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:49,668
I know why you have
a soft spot for Jin-su.

751
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:53,505
But listen, Baek-du.

752
00:43:54,506 --> 00:43:58,969
We all have our own baggage in life.

753
00:43:59,928 --> 00:44:03,891
Whether we live with it or leave it behind

754
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:07,478
is up to each of us, not other people.

755
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:11,857
So just think about yourself.

756
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:14,652
Remember what I said the other day?

757
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:17,655
Where are you supposed to be?

758
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:20,032
The ssireum ring.

759
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:22,201
It's the ssireum ring.

760
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:36,799
We're not excluding him because he's bad.
I can assure you that.

761
00:44:37,591 --> 00:44:40,636
Both Jin-su and I
believe in Baek-du's potential.

762
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:43,681
-It'll be better for him to get in--
-I got it.

763
00:44:44,306 --> 00:44:45,432
I know what you mean.

764
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:50,771
You wouldn't have decided this
if Baek-du was good.

765
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:55,150
Tae-baek, it really isn't like that.

766
00:44:55,734 --> 00:44:59,321
Don't be like this.
You know how much I care about Baek-du.

767
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:02,074
I was joking.

768
00:45:02,991 --> 00:45:04,284
Don't worry about me.

769
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:08,747
This kind of decision
is up to the coach and the head coach.

770
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:10,749
No need to ask my opinion.

771
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:15,462
You've got to work
on your drawing skills though.

772
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:18,173
Right.

773
00:45:21,301 --> 00:45:24,430
Jeez, I'm getting an earful
from everyone today.

774
00:45:24,513 --> 00:45:25,389
What do you mean?

775
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:27,266
Who gave you an earful?

776
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:28,767
Our general manager.

777
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:30,227
General manager?

778
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:32,479
Oh, maybe you don't know.

779
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:36,483
Governor Hong hired her out of the blue.

780
00:45:38,777 --> 00:45:41,321
It's the woman who moved
into Du-sik's old house.

781
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:47,453
I went to the office earlier
to get her signature

782
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:51,123
on Baek-du's withdrawal form,
and she chewed my butt out.

783
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:54,126
What did she say?

784
00:45:54,668 --> 00:45:59,131
She said no athletes
are fully prepared before a game,

785
00:45:59,631 --> 00:46:02,384
and since he was expecting to compete,

786
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:04,178
he'd be disheartened and all.

787
00:46:04,678 --> 00:46:07,598
Then she asked
if Baek-du agreed to it. Jeez.

788
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:09,266
It was intense.

789
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:15,314
But I can't just disregard her opinion.

790
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:19,026
She's actually pretty good at ssireum.

791
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:40,464
Hello, Coach.

792
00:46:42,257 --> 00:46:43,175
Hi.

793
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:45,260
I'm here to give you this.

794
00:47:03,695 --> 00:47:06,490
CHAMPIONSHIP WITHDRAWAL FORM

795
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:10,452
It only needs your signature now.

796
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:12,246
-But I--
-Okay.

797
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:14,122
I'll make sure to sign it on time.

798
00:47:14,206 --> 00:47:16,124
-Don't worry. You can go now.
-What?

799
00:47:17,834 --> 00:47:18,669
Okay.

800
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:38,855
Excuse me, Coach.

801
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:40,190
Yes.

802
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:45,779
About Mr. Kim Baek-du's problem
with losing his grip on the satba…

803
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:47,406
Yes.

804
00:47:48,156 --> 00:47:50,867
Maybe it's not because his grip is weak

805
00:47:51,743 --> 00:47:55,664
but because it gives him the advantage
of starting hand techniques early.

806
00:47:55,747 --> 00:47:57,541
Maybe he does that intentionally.

807
00:47:58,834 --> 00:47:59,668
Pardon?

808
00:47:59,751 --> 00:48:01,461
His instinct must be telling him

809
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:04,131
that he cannot physically
overpower his opponent,

810
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:07,050
so he might as well rely
on speed or technique.

811
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:10,262
He might be trying
to get into a form that's favorable to…

812
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:14,099
Well, of course,

813
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:18,103
I don't know much about ssireum

814
00:48:18,186 --> 00:48:20,355
and have very little knowledge,

815
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:23,108
so I'm not sure if this makes sense.

816
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:25,861
I just wanted to share what I think.

817
00:48:26,486 --> 00:48:27,321
That's all.

818
00:48:33,827 --> 00:48:34,828
Wait.

819
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:03,482
I think I went overboard.

820
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:07,819
I hope he didn't recognize me.

821
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:20,999
No way.

822
00:49:22,584 --> 00:49:25,337
Baek-du recognized me because he's weird.

823
00:49:26,963 --> 00:49:29,716
Nobody would recognize me.

824
00:49:31,843 --> 00:49:35,138
I think she definitely has ssireum
in her blood.

825
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:37,766
Either she's done it before

826
00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:40,435
or has a ssireum wrestler in her family.

827
00:49:41,269 --> 00:49:42,813
Why don't you ask her?

828
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:44,981
I did already.

829
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:46,149
But she said

830
00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:49,861
she just wrestled a little
as a kid, for fun.

831
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:54,574
But pros like us can tell.

832
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:58,286
You don't get that form
from doing it just for fun.

833
00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:01,164
I think she learned ssireum
from a very early age.

834
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:04,584
Why, thanks.

835
00:50:12,592 --> 00:50:15,971
By the way,
there's something strange about her.

836
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:17,431
What is it?

837
00:50:19,224 --> 00:50:22,519
She keeps asking about Coach Yeon.

838
00:50:22,602 --> 00:50:24,604
-Coach Yeon?
-Yes.

839
00:50:25,564 --> 00:50:26,732
What did she ask about?

840
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:31,445
She asked me if something happened
to Coach Yeon before he died

841
00:50:32,237 --> 00:50:34,781
and if someone came
to see him on the day of the match.

842
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:37,325
Oh, right.

843
00:50:38,326 --> 00:50:41,079
When I popped into the office
the other day,

844
00:50:42,038 --> 00:50:43,915
she was watching a video of the match.

845
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:46,710
And Coach Yeon's face was on the monitor.

846
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:50,797
Maybe they knew each other.

847
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:54,760
Doesn't it sound strange?

848
00:51:07,189 --> 00:51:10,066
Just live your life!

849
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:14,571
If you want to do something, say it.
If you don't, say that too.

850
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:17,616
Otherwise, you'll regret it later.

851
00:51:23,663 --> 00:51:25,499
Where did I put it?

852
00:51:49,898 --> 00:51:51,775
Baek-du, are you okay?

853
00:51:53,902 --> 00:51:54,945
Sorry, what?

854
00:51:56,488 --> 00:51:57,864
Your shirt is inside out.

855
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:00,617
Is it?

856
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:04,079
Right. Okay.

857
00:52:58,091 --> 00:53:00,969
About Mr. Kim Baek-du's problem
with losing his grip on the satba…

858
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:04,681
Maybe it's not because his grip is weak

859
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:09,394
but because it gives him the advantage
of starting hand techniques early.

860
00:53:10,103 --> 00:53:11,938
Maybe he does that intentionally.

861
00:53:12,772 --> 00:53:15,859
Did you decide not to include Baek-du
in the upcoming game?

862
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:17,944
How did you know that?

863
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:20,113
How can I not

864
00:53:20,655 --> 00:53:22,949
when all the men in town
are talking about it?

865
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:24,534
Is that so?

866
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:31,374
They were badmouthing you,
saying that you're too stubborn.

867
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:34,878
It's actually true.

868
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:40,383
Why did you exclude him?
It's not like it costs money.

869
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:44,346
What is it?

870
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:48,266
Do you think you'll be ashamed
if Baek-du doesn't do a good job?

871
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:50,352
No, that's not--

872
00:53:50,435 --> 00:53:54,564
Or is it because Baek-du is just that bad?

873
00:53:58,151 --> 00:54:01,404
How bad is he that you'd exclude him
right before the game?

874
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:02,781
No, Baek-du is good.

875
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:08,036
He's the most talented ssireum wrestler
that I know.

876
00:54:15,627 --> 00:54:19,422
That idiot just doesn't know
how to make use of his talent.

877
00:55:24,612 --> 00:55:25,613
Hey, you're back.

878
00:55:27,907 --> 00:55:29,492
Gosh, you scared me!

879
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:33,413
Why did you have the lights off
when you're home?

880
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:35,373
I thought you weren't home.

881
00:55:36,332 --> 00:55:40,128
It's been a while since I've walked around
like this. I'm so tired.

882
00:55:42,088 --> 00:55:44,674
What were you doing
walking around like that?

883
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:53,850
Didn't you say you were devastated
to be in the boondocks?

884
00:55:53,933 --> 00:55:55,101
You're adapting well.

885
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:05,028
Are you Du-sik?

886
00:56:12,452 --> 00:56:13,328
What?

887
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:14,871
It's you, right?

888
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:16,831
Oh Du-sik.

889
00:56:43,024 --> 00:56:44,400
Kwak Jin-su!

890
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:45,902
Hey, Jin-su!

891
00:57:15,515 --> 00:57:19,811
The kids' boss who lived in this house
20 years ago, Oh Du-sik.

892
00:57:21,187 --> 00:57:24,607
I heard she moved to Seoul
when she was in fourth grade.

893
00:57:27,068 --> 00:57:28,862
Now it all makes sense.

894
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:33,741
It did seem like
you and Kim Baek-du knew each other.

895
00:57:34,701 --> 00:57:35,618
Wait.

896
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:38,580
-Hyeon-uk--
-Can I ask you something?

897
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:43,334
What on earth happened?

898
00:57:45,336 --> 00:57:46,337
What do you mean?

899
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:47,964
Du-sik.

900
00:57:48,923 --> 00:57:49,883
Du-sik's father.

901
00:57:50,842 --> 00:57:52,594
And Du-sik's friend's father.

902
00:57:52,677 --> 00:57:54,762
Only the three know what happened.

903
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:04,772
I did my research.

904
00:58:04,856 --> 00:58:07,066
WRESTLER MURDERED
FOR REJECTING MATCH-FIXING?

905
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:11,404
But I couldn't find any details.

906
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:14,741
HEAD COACH OF SSIREUM TEAM
CHARGED WITH MURDER OF WRESTLER

907
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:19,412
Murder suspect, Mr. Oh,
and his daughter, Ms. Oh.

908
00:58:21,122 --> 00:58:22,248
Ms. Oh.

909
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:25,001
Oh Du-sik.

910
00:58:26,878 --> 00:58:28,379
Oh Yu-gyeong.

911
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:34,511
You must know exactly what happened

912
00:58:36,012 --> 00:58:38,139
in this village 20 years ago.

913
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:41,059
Because you're Du-sik.

914
00:58:48,149 --> 00:58:49,275
What is it?

915
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:50,527
What do you want?

916
00:58:52,278 --> 00:58:54,113
I wanted to be the captain too.

917
00:58:55,573 --> 00:58:56,574
What?

918
00:58:57,158 --> 00:58:59,202
I wanted to be the captain too.

919
00:58:59,702 --> 00:59:01,162
When we were in fourth grade.

920
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:07,919
Does anyone want to volunteer

921
00:59:08,002 --> 00:59:10,129
for the captain position on our team?

922
00:59:10,922 --> 00:59:12,966
If you want to, raise your hand.

923
00:59:26,688 --> 00:59:27,897
Okay. Jin-su.

924
00:59:28,481 --> 00:59:30,942
Kwak Jin-su in fourth grade.
Come on up here.

925
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:39,284
As of today,
Kwak Jin-su is the captain of the team.

926
00:59:39,826 --> 00:59:41,619
Let's all give him a big hand.

927
00:59:44,914 --> 00:59:46,457
Congratulations, Jin-su.

928
00:59:47,041 --> 00:59:48,960
Please lead our team well.

929
00:59:51,754 --> 00:59:52,672
So what?

930
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:56,634
Do you want to take credit
for yielding to me back then?

931
00:59:57,176 --> 00:59:58,136
No, that's not it.

932
00:59:58,761 --> 00:59:59,929
Then, what is this about?

933
01:00:00,013 --> 01:00:04,309
I just thought I should tell you
that I wanted it too.

934
01:00:10,565 --> 01:00:12,358
I want to do it.

935
01:00:15,361 --> 01:00:16,195
The match.

936
01:00:17,905 --> 01:00:19,824
I want to compete in the match.

937
01:00:19,907 --> 01:00:22,869
So… let me compete.

938
01:00:24,829 --> 01:00:26,080
You see,

939
01:00:27,165 --> 01:00:29,500
I've loved ssireum since I was little,

940
01:00:30,209 --> 01:00:32,170
whether I won or lost.

941
01:00:33,004 --> 01:00:35,006
I just love ssireum.

942
01:00:36,382 --> 01:00:39,010
And I've always been serious about it.

943
01:00:41,512 --> 01:00:43,264
So let me compete. No…

944
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:48,728
I have to compete in this match!

945
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:07,205
LIKE FLOWERS IN SAND

946
01:01:30,728 --> 01:01:32,480
Du-sik, I'm competing in tomorrow's match.

947
01:01:32,563 --> 01:01:33,439
You got this!

948
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:35,108
Where are the others?

949
01:01:35,191 --> 01:01:37,694
They should be here by now.
Why is no one coming?

950
01:01:37,777 --> 01:01:41,864
The café owner kept talking about Du-sik.

951
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:44,575
I'm thinking
she might have done that on purpose.

952
01:01:44,659 --> 01:01:47,286
Don't walk! Keep running!

953
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:49,247
Want to hang out in my room later?

954
01:01:49,330 --> 01:01:52,417
What are you trying to pull here?

955
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:54,210
-Did you hear that?
-Hear what?

956
01:01:54,293 --> 01:01:56,546
-They're all dropping out of the game.
-What?

957
01:01:56,629 --> 01:01:57,630
Which team is that?

958
01:01:59,632 --> 01:02:01,634
