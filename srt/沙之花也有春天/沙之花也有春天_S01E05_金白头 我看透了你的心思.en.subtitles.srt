1
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:45,962
LIKE FLOWERS IN SAND

2
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,256
Du-sik's dad?

3
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:51,718
No way. Her dad is Oh Jun.

4
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:53,094
What about it?

5
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:55,555
Oh Jun can commit crimes too.

6
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:57,474
But still.

7
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:58,725
It's Oh Jun.

8
00:00:58,808 --> 00:01:01,519
Oh Jun is a legend.

9
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:02,437
She's right.

10
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:04,230
My dad saw it too.

11
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:09,319
He said Du-sik's dad
had a huge fight with Uncle Cheol-yong.

12
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:12,280
So are you saying

13
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:15,200
Oh Jun really did that
to Uncle Cheol-yong?

14
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:17,702
Let's go.

15
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:22,665
Hey, Baek-du. Class is starting soon.

16
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:23,917
Let's go.

17
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:55,990
Baek-du, hit his leg.

18
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:01,121
Seok-hui, just keep running around!
Don't try to catch the ball!

19
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:02,580
Just dodge it!

20
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:10,547
Oh, my gosh!

21
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,049
-Oh, no. Are you okay?
-Are you okay?

22
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,467
What do we do?

23
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:29,649
EPISODE 5
KIM BAEK-DU, I SEE RIGHT THROUGH YOU

24
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:59,345
GEOSAN-GUN SSIREUM TEAM

25
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:19,032
There are two virtues that my father has
always emphasized to us, his three sons.

26
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:40,386
One is that a real man
must hold his head high.

27
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,935
JIN-SU'S RESTAURANT
HOME-COOKED MEALS

28
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:47,852
Oh, dear.

29
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:51,648
There.

30
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:56,778
My body aches.

31
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:07,038
He said that a real man
never avoids challenges

32
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:09,082
but confronts them head-on.

33
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:17,757
Second.

34
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:21,386
A real man never goes back on his word.

35
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:23,930
One's word is one's heart,

36
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:27,350
so one should neither utter it carelessly
nor retract it.

37
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:43,825
God damn it.

38
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:47,495
Look at what your son said.

39
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:50,248
I can't believe this.

40
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:53,001
Why is he being so wishy-washy?

41
00:04:58,172 --> 00:05:00,049
I want to go back!

42
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:04,721
But I usually

43
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,390
don't listen to my father.

44
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:08,641
-All right.
-Thanks.

45
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:09,809
Now, stop that.

46
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:20,528
Ten more.

47
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:21,529
Ten!

48
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,744
What are you doing? Be careful!

49
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,370
Hello!

50
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:30,747
I, Kim Baek-du,

51
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:34,083
announce that I'm back
on the Geosan-gun Ssireum Team

52
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,293
as of today!

53
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:37,628
I hope we get along!

54
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:45,762
What's going on now?

55
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:55,104
What on earth are you talking about?

56
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,022
Why would you…

57
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:58,524
-That's just nonsense--
-24-Hour Scene.

58
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:00,651
Your favorite TV show

59
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,862
that you loved when you were little.

60
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:04,322
She was on it.

61
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,866
What do you mean?

62
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:08,242
Mi-suk.

63
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:10,536
Your role model on the show.

64
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:14,040
No wonder she looked familiar to me.

65
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:16,793
She looked so familiar
that I even said hi to her.

66
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:18,795
Seriously, Du-sik.

67
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:22,965
Did you really think
I'd believe she was your mother-in-law?

68
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:27,512
We always watched that show together
when we were young!

69
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:29,555
Don't you turn this around on me.

70
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,766
You said she must be my mother-in-law.

71
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:34,811
Saying that you thought
you saw her on Love and War.

72
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:37,438
Also, why not?

73
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:40,399
Why can't she be my mother-in-law?

74
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:43,194
-You never know.
-Are you kidding me?

75
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:47,740
In 2002, Mi-suk was 27 years old.

76
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:50,952
But your husband…
He's not your husband either, is he?

77
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:54,872
Anyway, you said
that he's 32 or something.

78
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:57,500
It just doesn't add up.

79
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,046
Technically, you can have babies
at age 18--

80
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,464
Oh, please. That's enough.

81
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:05,133
Just stop now.

82
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:10,513
Fine.

83
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,349
I am a cop,

84
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:15,810
and I'm not married.

85
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:21,149
And I'm here undercover
for an investigation.

86
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:22,775
Undercover?

87
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,444
For what investigation?

88
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:25,403
Choi…

89
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:30,366
It's confidential.
Don't you know what "undercover" means?

90
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:34,412
Then it must have something to do
with our ssireum team. Am I right?

91
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,874
That's why you came to the team
as a manager, right?

92
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:39,959
You know what, Du-sik?

93
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:42,837
You should've joined us as an athlete.

94
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,672
That would've looked more natural.

95
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:47,133
Was it because we had no women's team?

96
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:51,596
What a shame. If there were,
you would've won all games in all classes.

97
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:53,431
Wait.

98
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:59,312
Is that why you said that the other day?

99
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:00,271
What do you mean?

100
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:04,317
The other day, you said to me,
"I need you."

101
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,360
"I want you to come back to…"

102
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:09,780
Did you say all that
to use me for the investigation?

103
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,532
-What?
-Jeez.

104
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:13,993
Oh Du-sik, you sneaky brat.

105
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:16,329
-What did just say?
-You heard me.

106
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:18,080
-You see…
-You're not even useful!

107
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,082
You always use me for your own good.

108
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,501
It hurts my feelings.

109
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:22,835
Jeez.

110
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,795
-Are you seriously--
-No excuses.

111
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,714
You have no right to make excuses.

112
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:28,508
I've got to go.

113
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:34,263
Right.

114
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:36,140
See you tomorrow.

115
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:43,981
Is that what he meant?

116
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:47,610
Jeez.

117
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:53,157
Seriously, you're just unpredictable.

118
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:56,577
Seriously, I don't understand
what you're thinking.

119
00:08:56,661 --> 00:09:00,498
Do you think you can just quit
and join the team whenever you want?

120
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,333
Let me go.

121
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:05,670
You wanted to retire, then you wanted
to be a coach, and now this?

122
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:07,338
-Gosh, my ear!
-Do you realize

123
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:09,423
how many times you've changed your mind?

124
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:12,760
-Gosh, just…
-You're giving me a headache.

125
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:14,303
Let go of me.

126
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,346
Take a seat.

127
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:18,975
Jeez, you almost ripped my ear off.

128
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:25,481
Do you mean it this time?
Do you really want to come back?

129
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:29,235
You're going to change
your mind again, aren't you?

130
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:30,861
No! This time, I'm serious!

131
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,197
Gosh.

132
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,241
But why?

133
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:38,035
What?

134
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:40,288
Why the sudden change of heart?

135
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:42,957
What happened last night?

136
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,716
Nothing much.

137
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,856
"What was that 40,000 won about?"

138
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:10,109
"What was it about that money

139
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:13,195
that you had to try so hard
to give it to him?"

140
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:15,489
-I stole the money!
-"I stole it."

141
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:18,618
-I kept the change!
-"I kept the change."

142
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:23,414
-It's actually been weighing on me.
-"It's actually been weighing on me."

143
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,166
Then, after a few days,

144
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:27,918
I heard in the neighborhood meeting
that the man died.

145
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:30,087
On the day after the reunion at that.

146
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:32,840
He threw himself into the reservoir.

147
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,343
Hearing that story

148
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:40,222
made me feel so uncomfortable.

149
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:45,311
So I tried to give
the money back many times.

150
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:52,026
But… Ms. Lim isn't usually
around the restaurant.

151
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:55,071
But since then, she's always been
hanging out in the restaurant.

152
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,657
It was driving me crazy too.

153
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:03,579
Detective, I haven't spent that money yet.

154
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,668
What a nut.

155
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:21,180
Why is this woman always involved
with Choi Chil-seong?

156
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:29,271
"On June 7, 2023, around 10:00 p.m.,

157
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,941
what were you doing and where?"

158
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:34,860
I was doing yoga
on the rooftop of the building.

159
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:40,116
Why were you doing yoga there
in the middle of the night?

160
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,971
By the way,
why did Choi visit this café so often?

161
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:07,101
It's not like they make good coffee.

162
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:15,734
Wait.

163
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:23,951
CHOI CHIL-SEONG, 56, DEAD
MATCH-FIXING

164
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:24,869
I'm hungry.

165
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,630
But it's been almost 40 years
since I retired.

166
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,174
Why now?

167
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:40,384
Just take it. Thanks to Baek-du,

168
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:44,763
everyone's retirement is
being celebrated in this town.

169
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:46,640
What do you mean?

170
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:50,227
Baek-du went back to the ssireum team.

171
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:51,312
What?

172
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:54,023
Why did he suddenly change his mind?

173
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:57,067
Who knows what he's thinking?

174
00:12:57,151 --> 00:13:00,237
When I woke up this morning,
he'd already left for training.

175
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:02,406
And the fridge was full of rice cakes,

176
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,117
about to explode.

177
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:08,078
My mother is very upset.

178
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:10,956
But Tae-baek must be happy…

179
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,459
Hold on a second.

180
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:15,794
Jin-su is coaching Baek-du now?

181
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:17,129
I guess so.

182
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:20,257
That must be awkward for Baek-du.

183
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:25,471
They're friends, but they fought over
the coaching position just yesterday.

184
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:30,309
It'll be too awkward for him
to call Jin-su "Coach."

185
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:33,521
I can bet on it.

186
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:41,111
Good grief, could he be any more fickle?

187
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:44,156
He should be embarrassed.

188
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,659
Just how many times
has he changed his mind?

189
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:49,703
Even pancakes
don't need to be flipped so often.

190
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:52,665
Come on. We all know
Baek-du can be silly sometimes.

191
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:56,752
By the way, I don't understand Jin-su.

192
00:13:56,835 --> 00:13:59,713
Why did he choose to coach this team,
not the better team?

193
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,215
-Tell me about it.
-I know.

194
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:03,050
As you get older,

195
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:04,552
you miss your hometown--

196
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:06,053
Not again!

197
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:08,222
It's not just about the team.

198
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:13,269
All of Jin-su's friends are in Seongwon.
He was there for almost half of his life.

199
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,145
-Right.
-He has friends here too.

200
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:17,731
-Baek-du, Seok-hui and--
-Ridiculous!

201
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,817
They're not friends anymore.

202
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:24,697
Exactly. I saw Baek-du and Jin-su
run into each other the other day,

203
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,615
-and they didn't say hi.
-Really?

204
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:29,201
-Yes.
-How funny.

205
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:32,162
They used to hang out together
all the time as kids.

206
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:33,497
What's happened to them?

207
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:36,917
They used to bicker a lot back then too.

208
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:40,045
But Du-sik stood her ground in the middle,

209
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:41,797
keeping the boys in check.

210
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,049
-So they never actually fought.
-Right.

211
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:45,634
-All thanks to Du-sik.
-Right.

212
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:46,635
Du-sik?

213
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:50,848
Who's Du-sik?

214
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:55,352
You blabbermouth.
Why did you bring her up?

215
00:14:57,271 --> 00:15:00,691
Well, Du-sik is someone
who used to live in this town--

216
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:03,068
Shut it.

217
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,236
Do you know Du-sik?

218
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,822
-That hurts.
-Du-sik is just someone

219
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:09,199
who used to live here.

220
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:12,119
How can I put it?

221
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:14,163
-The kids' boss.
-The kids' boss.

222
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:15,873
I'll give you some more of that.

223
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:17,875
-What did you say?
-Go home now.

224
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,960
-I'll keep him quiet.
-Go.

225
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:22,338
Hold the satba tight.

226
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,340
Come here.

227
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:27,051
Check this out.

228
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:34,892
Hey, Kim Baek-du!

229
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,440
Is this a joke to you?

230
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:43,943
-What's wrong?
-"What's wrong"?

231
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:48,572
I mean,

232
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:50,699
-what's wrong, Coach?
-You.

233
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,285
How many times did I tell you
to hold onto the satba?

234
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:54,745
-But--
-Satba-gripping is

235
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:56,330
the most basic ssireum skill!

236
00:15:57,373 --> 00:16:01,001
Why did you come back
if you don't even know the basics?

237
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:05,339
Just join some amateur club.
That'd suit your level.

238
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,346
Now I understand why Kim Baek-du,

239
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:15,307
once a ssireum prodigy,
has never won a championship

240
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:17,059
and ended up a nobody.

241
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:23,774
Try again.

242
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:26,276
Why does he keep treating me like…

243
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:31,657
What happened to Kwak Jin-su?

244
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,869
He didn't have to be like that
in front of all the juniors.

245
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:39,081
He could've just said it in private

246
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:42,167
instead of humiliating him like that.

247
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,547
Well, even when he was young,

248
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:47,798
-he was--
-Ms. Oh.

249
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:52,302
How about we have a team dinner today?

250
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:53,262
Sure.

251
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:57,808
I don't know why,
but the governor gave us a bonus…

252
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:02,813
The governor…

253
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:07,401
Damn it.

254
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,446
What are you doing there?

255
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,697
What?

256
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:16,744
Oh, I was just checking
if the training was going all right.

257
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:19,705
Have you eaten yet?

258
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:21,832
Of course. Look at the time.

259
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:22,958
Right.

260
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:34,470
Have a seat here.

261
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:37,681
Surprise! Here's some
refreshing mulhoe for you!

262
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:43,854
Take it.

263
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:45,439
-Hey.
-Pour the broth in.

264
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,651
Sorry there isn't much food.

265
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:51,737
No way. You even gave us mulhoe.

266
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,448
If I had known you were coming,

267
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:57,659
I would've made sure
to prepare a proper feast for you.

268
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:00,579
I hope you like some of the food at least.

269
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:02,289
This is so embarrassing.

270
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:04,124
No, don't say that.

271
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,502
The bonus from the governor

272
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:09,213
was just enough to get the boys
a couple rolls of gimbap.

273
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:10,380
What's with him?

274
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,300
If you need more food,

275
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:15,886
-just raise your hand immediately.
-Yes, ma'am!

276
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:17,888
I'll chop and prepare some more,

277
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:20,557
and serve it right to your table!

278
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,643
-Thanks, ma'am.
-Thank you.

279
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:25,646
-Thank you for the food!
-Thank you for the food!

280
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:28,816
-Try it.
-Eat up.

281
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:30,359
-Where is he?
-This is nice.

282
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:31,318
I love it.

283
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,030
-Pour some more broth.
-The broth.

284
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:53,882
It's not like

285
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:58,554
this is the only restaurant in Geosan.

286
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:01,890
Why do they always have to have
a team dinner here?

287
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,560
You little…

288
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:07,729
Where do you want to go then?

289
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,398
Come on, Ms. Lim!

290
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:10,774
-It hurts.
-What?

291
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:16,155
Baek-du, you saw me this morning
and hightailed it, didn't you?

292
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:19,658
Jeez.

293
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:22,995
You always find
creative ways to entertain me.

294
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,497
Are you ashamed?

295
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,124
Because you stole 40,000 won?

296
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:29,918
-Please don't talk about--
-You see,

297
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:33,255
I just don't understand you.

298
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:36,884
I mean, even back in primary school--

299
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:37,968
Elementary school.

300
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:39,261
Fine. Elementary school.

301
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:41,430
-Yes.
-Even back in elementary school,

302
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:44,308
you used to swipe cash

303
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:47,394
to buy ice cream all the time.

304
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:48,812
But that's…

305
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:51,481
Jin-su did it with me.

306
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:52,983
I know!

307
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:55,444
So just keep doing what you've been doing.

308
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:57,487
Don't act like you're all grown up now.

309
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:01,033
Ms. Lim, I didn't even use that money.
I still have it here.

310
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:02,743
Gosh, you punk.

311
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:05,120
Don't be silly.

312
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,079
Put it back in.

313
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:11,835
Baek-du, can you do me a favor?

314
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:13,587
Okay.

315
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:18,592
Could you please
be friends with Jin-su like before?

316
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:22,721
He may not act all friendly,

317
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:25,265
-but he's actually pretty nice.
-Ms. Lim.

318
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:28,810
He came down on me
for three hours straight today.

319
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,187
Is that so?

320
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:35,108
Well, since he was little, you--

321
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:36,068
Ms. Lim.

322
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:38,820
We're actually close.

323
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,698
You may not know this,

324
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:44,368
but Jin-su and I
have always been best friends.

325
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:46,828
Oh, you.

326
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:48,789
You don't say.

327
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:50,290
Fine, then.

328
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:52,960
They'll finish all the food.

329
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:55,796
-I'll go join them now.
-Go ahead.

330
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:05,555
I mean.

331
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:07,683
I guess it'd be weird

332
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:10,269
to find the phone here
after all this time.

333
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:13,605
It happened a while ago,
so of course it's gone.

334
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,484
What are you doing there?

335
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:20,696
-Are you looking for something?
-What?

336
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,239
Oh, it's just…

337
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,785
I think I dropped something here.

338
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:30,122
What are you looking for?
Do you need help?

339
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:33,959
No, I'm good.
It probably isn't here anyway.

340
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:37,546
Is the café closed today?

341
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:40,215
You live in Du-sik's house, right?

342
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:41,717
Pardon?

343
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:45,554
The one with the blue gate
at the end of the alley.

344
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:49,308
I told you
that's where someone called Du-sik lived.

345
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:52,436
Right. Well…

346
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,229
But why…

347
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,565
I'm just saying.

348
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:01,737
-Good luck, then.
-Thanks.

349
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,412
Who on earth is this Du-sik?

350
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:13,540
Why is everyone talking about this person?

351
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:14,791
Du-sik…

352
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:20,464
-Are you enjoying the food?
-Yes.

353
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:22,591
Fill up your glass.

354
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:24,801
Let's hear our manager's toast.

355
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:26,261
Why don't you make a toast?

356
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:32,476
I'm very glad

357
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:35,520
to have come here
as the manager of the team.

358
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:39,316
I hope you can all stay healthy
while you're on the team.

359
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:44,112
I also hope that the Geosan-gun
Ssireum Team will regain its past glory,

360
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:48,658
become number one in the country,
and deliver many champions.

361
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:52,204
Let's go, Geosan-gun Ssireum Team!

362
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:54,956
-Let's go!
-All right. Let's do this.

363
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,208
Let's go!

364
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:57,542
-My goodness.
-Let's go!

365
00:22:58,085 --> 00:22:59,753
Let's all chant together.

366
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:02,214
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

367
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:08,136
Eat your fill, guys. Jin-su, eat up.

368
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,304
Thank you, Coach.

369
00:23:09,387 --> 00:23:10,972
It's cooked nicely. Let's eat.

370
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,557
It looks so good.

371
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:14,768
-Hold on.
-Give me beer.

372
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:17,354
Let me see. It's all cooked.

373
00:23:18,396 --> 00:23:19,731
-One second.
-Okay.

374
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,441
Come on, eat up.

375
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:22,943
-Come on.
-What are you doing?

376
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:25,821
It's all cooked. Wait. Let me check.

377
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:28,907
Come on. Eat up. This is all cooked.

378
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:31,076
Nice.

379
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:33,203
-By the way,
-Yes.

380
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:34,996
about Coach Yeon…

381
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:39,126
Did something happen to him
on the day of the game?

382
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:42,504
Did he have a fight, for example?

383
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:43,755
A fight?

384
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:45,757
No way. A fight with whom?

385
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:46,758
Coach.

386
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:49,010
I've been meaning to ask.

387
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:51,805
Did Coach Yeon really quit?

388
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:56,601
He wouldn't even answer the phone,
so I was wondering

389
00:23:57,644 --> 00:23:59,938
-if it was about his gambling debt.
-Hey.

390
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:02,941
Stop talking about the old coach
in front of our new coach.

391
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:06,111
-I'm okay.
-No, it's because

392
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:09,072
-I lent him some money.
-What?

393
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:10,282
But I can't reach him.

394
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:12,492
What? You lent him money?

395
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:15,620
-How much?
-Not much. About 300,000 won.

396
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:16,913
About 300,000?

397
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:20,041
He borrowed some from me too.

398
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,334
How much?

399
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:22,836
A little over 500,000 won.

400
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:24,129
My goodness.

401
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:27,090
I lent him 500,000 won twice.
One million in total.

402
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:28,925
-One million?
-Seriously?

403
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:31,511
I also lent him 1.2 million.

404
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:32,637
What? How…

405
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:35,891
What is this, some kind of an auction?

406
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,267
Why did you lend him…

407
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:40,645
Anyone else? Who lent him money?

408
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:41,980
-Not me.
-I have no money.

409
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:43,231
I haven't.

410
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:46,818
I lent him

411
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,280
2.5 million…

412
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:54,326
Oh, boy.

413
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:56,244
My gosh.

414
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,496
We have the winner here.

415
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:01,416
My goodness.

416
00:25:13,511 --> 00:25:14,512
We need to talk.

417
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:16,723
What?

418
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:18,725
Why? What is it?

419
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:21,561
Gosh, let go of me.

420
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:24,397
What's the matter? Are you drunk?

421
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:25,523
Are you kidding me?

422
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:28,026
Who gets drunk
after just four shots of soju?

423
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:28,985
Me.

424
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,864
So what is it?
Why did you drag me out here?

425
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:36,534
We could've just talked there.
Why did you drag me to this dark place--

426
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:38,245
Why did you lend him money?

427
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:40,956
Did you not know he was gambling?

428
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,292
He said he'd pay me back right away, so…

429
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,419
Where did you even get that much money?

430
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:48,505
Look, Du-sik.

431
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:51,258
I'm not that poor, you know.

432
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:54,344
And you stole 40,000 won?

433
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:55,887
What…

434
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:59,015
How did you know?

435
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:04,813
Well, I just did it because I was tempted.

436
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:08,441
And Ms. Lim and I talked it out already.
I asked for her forgiveness.

437
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:13,655
So 2.5 million, huh?

438
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:16,700
Where did you get that money?

439
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:19,661
It was mine. I gave him all I had.

440
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:22,664
I know.

441
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:26,334
I was actually going to call him tomorrow
and ask him to pay me back.

442
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:29,796
There was a salary cut,

443
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:33,133
-so the situation isn't--
-What? There's been a salary cut too?

444
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:35,927
You didn't know? I thought you knew.

445
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:38,847
If there was a cut
from your original salary,

446
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:41,099
you're almost paying to play there.

447
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:43,059
You think this is some kind of a gym?

448
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:46,396
Enough already.
I can always ask my mom to help me out.

449
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:48,523
Oh, my gosh!

450
00:26:48,606 --> 00:26:51,151
I'm kidding. Jeez.

451
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:56,239
Fine. I'll call him tomorrow
and tell him to give the money back.

452
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:58,408
You won't get it back.

453
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:00,201
What?

454
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:05,290
You'll never get the money back.

455
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:06,958
Why?

456
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:09,127
Why?

457
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:21,514
The one with the blue gate
at the end of the alley.

458
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:25,185
I told you
that's where someone called Du-sik lived.

459
00:27:58,301 --> 00:28:01,513
OH DU-SIK, KIM BAEK-DU

460
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:08,478
Champion Lim Dong-seok
is certainly on a streak now.

461
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:12,649
Since winning
his first champion title in 2021,

462
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:14,567
he's always been at the top.

463
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:16,611
Right. Champion Lim Dong-seok

464
00:28:16,694 --> 00:28:20,365
never really stood out
when he was in high school.

465
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:22,450
-Since Coach Yeon Sang-cheol,
-This man…

466
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:24,536
the coach of his current team,

467
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:26,204
recruited him,

468
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:28,373
his skills have improved drastically…

469
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:30,792
Kim Baek-du, you will

470
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:34,379
-never get the money back.
-The coach must be so proud

471
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:36,548
of his keen eye for talent.

472
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:40,593
Even now, he's coaching him.

473
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:42,470
That's not why.

474
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:45,056
When two wrestlers from the same team--

475
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:51,396
He's coaching him.

476
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:53,565
That's not why.

477
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:55,734
When two wrestlers from the same team--

478
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:00,780
What was that?

479
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:05,994
What was he whispering to him
before the match started?

480
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,685
Police investigations have revealed

481
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:37,233
the man in his forties, found dead
in his car in a field in Geosan County

482
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:41,905
around 1:00 a.m. on June 13,
to be a coach of a ssireum team,

483
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:43,448
which is shocking everyone.

484
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:47,744
The police discovered that the man
was involved in illegal gambling…

485
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:49,871
That must be Geosan County, right?

486
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:51,289
Yes.

487
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:52,874
Obviously, that's Geosan.

488
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:55,126
Man, what is going on?

489
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:59,464
And that reservoir incident
was just a few days ago. Right?

490
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:02,342
Where did he go this time?

491
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:04,469
Now, over to the weather.

492
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,263
-The heatwave is still ongoing…
-Jeez.

493
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:09,224
What's he doing there?

494
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:11,184
I don't know.

495
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:14,562
The temperatures in inland areas
will soar to 37 °C

496
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,940
as well as the apparent temperature.

497
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:25,782
Did you hear that?

498
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:27,992
-What's going on?
-Jeez.

499
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:29,410
Let's go.

500
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:30,537
-Goodness.
-Okay.

501
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,955
-Honey, watch the store.
-Okay.

502
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:32,997
I'll be right back.

503
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:34,874
It won't take long. Let's go.

504
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:37,126
-Jeez.
-They're acting like

505
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:39,212
they're going off to war or something.

506
00:30:39,295 --> 00:30:41,256
-Am I right?
-Tell me about it.

507
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:43,299
I just don't understand them.

508
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:45,760
It's like the game, Spot the Difference.

509
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:49,264
One of them looks so awkward in there.
He doesn't fit in.

510
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:51,474
-Who?
-My husband.

511
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:57,856
I mean, he's never held a satba before.
What's he doing there?

512
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:59,649
-This is just hilarious.
-Goodness.

513
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:15,832
Come on now!

514
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:21,129
Why do they care so much?

515
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,217
He committed suicide.

516
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:27,552
-Who?
-Coach Yeon.

517
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:28,678
Man.

518
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:33,266
Illegal gambling is
usually associated with that other thing.

519
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:35,059
What other thing?

520
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:36,603
Match-fixing.

521
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:38,438
You better watch what you say.

522
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:39,647
Match-fixing? Why?

523
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,190
-What about it?
-Jeez.

524
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:42,859
-Hey.
-Hello.

525
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:44,027
Hello.

526
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:44,944
Hello.

527
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:47,906
So? Did he leave a note?

528
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:50,325
On the news, they said there was no note.

529
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:53,995
But the police must've said it was suicide
because they were sure.

530
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:56,497
That's not what's important.

531
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:59,167
I'm 100% sure
he was being chased by a broker

532
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,919
after messing up the match-fixing.

533
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:04,255
Come on.
We all experienced it 20 years ago.

534
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:05,798
-Stop.
-Am I wrong?

535
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:07,967
Stop talking nonsense.

536
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:10,261
I watched the game that day.

537
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:12,263
What was he called? The…

538
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:13,473
-Chestnut Bread.
-Right.

539
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:14,766
Gongju's Chestnut Bread.

540
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:17,727
That chestnut bread guy
won the championship as usual.

541
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:18,645
He's right.

542
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:20,229
So what match-fixing?

543
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:22,649
No, that's not it.

544
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:26,778
One of the matches that day
was actually pretty fishy.

545
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:27,904
What do you mean?

546
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:29,364
What are you talking about?

547
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:31,115
Come on, guys.

548
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:32,700
The last match with Baek-du.

549
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:37,288
The result was overturned
after a video review. Remember?

550
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:42,710
And that must have ruined
all of Coach Yeon's plans.

551
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:44,671
That happens all the time.

552
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:45,797
He's right.

553
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,632
What's your problem?

554
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,347
You never respect what I say!

555
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:55,848
No wonder

556
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:58,434
he didn't answer my call.

557
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:01,854
I'm still in shock.
I just can't keep it together.

558
00:33:02,605 --> 00:33:07,110
Now what happens
to the money he borrowed from us?

559
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:09,070
Will we never get it back?

560
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:10,947
-Dude.
-Why would you say that?

561
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:11,948
-What?
-I hate you.

562
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:13,491
-Why bring that up now?
-What?

563
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:16,411
Guys, I heard a weird rumor.

564
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:17,578
What is it?

565
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,288
At the Dano Championships, Coach…

566
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:22,667
-Never mind.
-Say it.

567
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:23,876
What is it?

568
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:25,753
Don't tell anyone.

569
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,505
-I promise I won't.
-I won't.

570
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:30,133
Rumor has it

571
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:34,095
that the coach made Lim Dong-seok
throw the match.

572
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:35,805
-Really?
-No way.

573
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:37,682
That doesn't make any sense.

574
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:41,978
If it weren't for the bad call,
Baek-du would've won.

575
00:33:42,061 --> 00:33:42,895
-Right.
-True.

576
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:44,105
Technically, he won.

577
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:45,023
Right.

578
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:46,024
Rumor has it

579
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:51,029
that the coach asked Dong-seok
to let Baek-du win.

580
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:52,822
-It sounds like a stretch.
-Really?

581
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:53,948
Think about it.

582
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:56,743
That's the day Coach disappeared.

583
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:58,244
-What?
-I mean…

584
00:33:58,995 --> 00:33:59,829
What?

585
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:02,623
I mean, there's got to be some connection.

586
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:03,541
Come on.

587
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:07,378
That's some really weird rumor.

588
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:08,963
Who told you that?

589
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,965
-Who am I?
-Geosan's ace reporter.

590
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,425
-Exactly.
-I see.

591
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:15,678
We never know.

592
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,972
Only Dong-seok must know the truth.

593
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,057
No.

594
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,391
Baek-du must know it too.

595
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:21,976
Think about it.

596
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:25,229
If Dong-seok went easy on him
at the end of the game,

597
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:28,274
Baek-du must have noticed it,
unless he's a fool.

598
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:30,276
Let's go ask him. Where is he?

599
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:31,402
Don't do that.

600
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,279
-What? Why do you always…
-Jeez.

601
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:35,239
Seriously. Don't you do that.

602
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:38,284
Are you stupid?

603
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:41,412
Just think about it.
Baek-du must be in an awkward situation.

604
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:45,583
Let's say Dong-seok tried
to fix the match as the coach asked.

605
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:48,795
Then, why would he go
for the match with Baek-du?

606
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:50,171
Why?

607
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:53,174
Because that match had the highest stakes.

608
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:56,677
When the worst one beats the best one.

609
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,681
But he could have just said…

610
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:02,517
-Hey.
-Stop mumbling.

611
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:27,667
Come on. Everyone knows
Baek-du isn't competitive at all.

612
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:32,964
I've never seen anyone smile so brightly
after losing a match

613
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:35,049
besides Baek-du.

614
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:37,802
He knows that we can't be mad
at a smiling face.

615
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:39,804
I think so too.

616
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:42,640
There's no way
that kid would've fixed the match.

617
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:45,518
He doesn't care if he wins or not.

618
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:49,397
That's not true.
You're not getting the point.

619
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,274
Baek-du didn't fix the match.

620
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:52,942
He was just used.

621
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:55,695
Because his performance
has been always bad.

622
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:57,822
Those other guys used him.

623
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:00,158
Really? Are you sure?

624
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:03,327
Someone like him is rare in our family.

625
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:06,789
Seriously. Maybe Baek-du
isn't our real brother.

626
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:07,790
-Hey.
-What?

627
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:10,585
I heard a lot of babies
were switched at birth

628
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:12,336
-in the past.
-Stick to the point.

629
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,590
-Mother.
-Mom.

630
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:17,175
-Jeez.
-We brought some berries.

631
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:20,219
We're not suspecting you or anything.

632
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:21,304
I'm sorry.

633
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:25,183
What? Stop saying nonsense.

634
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:27,602
Put it down and get inside now!

635
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:28,895
Yes, Mother.

636
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:30,313
Come on.

637
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:31,814
Go. Now!

638
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:33,149
-Hurry.
-It's stuck.

639
00:36:33,232 --> 00:36:34,108
Fine.

640
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:38,237
What the hell are you talking about?

641
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:39,155
-Mom.
-What?

642
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:40,489
We didn't say it

643
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:43,242
-because we don't believe you.
-What? What about me?

644
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:45,745
-You think I was cheating?
-No, maybe by mistake--

645
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:48,039
-Am I a cuckoo or what?
-No, of course not.

646
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:49,624
-You're not.
-Just go!

647
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:51,125
-Don't get us wrong.
-Go!

648
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:53,336
-Hey.
-Yes?

649
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:55,254
-Twenty years ago…
-Yes.

650
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:57,048
Was it similar to this?

651
00:36:57,131 --> 00:36:58,758
-You mean Du-sik's father?
-Yes.

652
00:36:58,841 --> 00:37:01,344
Now that I think about it,
there was match-fixing

653
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:04,639
and death involved then, too.
It is indeed similar.

654
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:07,058
History is repeating itself.

655
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:08,851
I guess so.

656
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:35,628
Did you know about it?

657
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:37,964
What?

658
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:40,007
Yes.

659
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:44,762
Is your investigation related to this?

660
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:48,140
Yes, kind of.

661
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:56,148
Gosh, what on earth
is happening in this town?

662
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:02,071
Don't worry about it

663
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:04,991
and just focus on your training.

664
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:09,078
Hey.

665
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,205
Kim Baek-du.

666
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:14,458
Don't let this distract you.
The match is just around the corner.

667
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:16,168
Get ahold of yourself.

668
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:19,547
Okay.

669
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:25,011
By the way,

670
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:28,889
would it affect your investigation?
Is it going to be all right?

671
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:34,395
Well, Coach Yeon did seem
a bit suspicious that day,

672
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:38,065
but he's gone now.
I can't ask him anything.

673
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:40,568
What was suspicious?

674
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:43,863
What you heard from Beom-su the other day.

675
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:48,075
That Coach Yeon was arguing
with someone outside the arena.

676
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:52,079
And this might not mean anything,

677
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:55,249
but he was whispering
to a wrestler before his match--

678
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:56,292
Who?

679
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:58,794
-Dong-seok?
-Yes.

680
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:02,757
He was whispering to that guy
for quite a while.

681
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:08,137
That kind of bothers me too,
so I want to look into it.

682
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:12,058
Hey.

683
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:15,728
Is Lim Dong-seok
on the Seongwon City Hall Team?

684
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,397
Yeah, he's in Seongwon.

685
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:27,281
I think I should go meet him.

686
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:34,789
TICKET
FROM GEOSAN TO SEONGWON

687
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:08,739
-Hey! How did you--
-Keep it down.

688
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:10,741
There are people here. Keep it down.

689
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:15,037
How did you come here?

690
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:17,415
Well, obviously, I took a day off.

691
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:20,126
Will you please be quiet?
There are people here.

692
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:30,302
Where did it go? Oh, here it is.

693
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:32,096
Look at you, all excited.

694
00:40:32,888 --> 00:40:35,724
You think this is a field trip?

695
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:41,188
We never went on a field trip together
when we were young.

696
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:46,068
You disappeared
a few days before our school camping trip.

697
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:53,534
I even asked my mom
to make anchovy gimbap, your favorite.

698
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:55,995
But you just left like that.

699
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:02,918
Hold on. What about today's training?

700
00:41:03,502 --> 00:41:04,670
I ditched it.

701
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:06,297
Are you crazy?

702
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,840
Gosh, stop it.

703
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:10,342
-Sorry.
-You little…

704
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:12,344
Hey.

705
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:15,014
I'm not doing this just for fun.

706
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,851
There's something I want to ask Dong-seok.

707
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:24,690
All right.

708
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,652
Oh, right. Du-sik.

709
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:29,612
What?

710
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:32,281
Since we're going all the way to Seongwon,

711
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:36,619
we should try their specialty ribs, right?

712
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:38,913
Do you have money?

713
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:40,122
You don't.

714
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:42,500
You have money.

715
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:47,713
-You're so shameless.
-Fine. Sorry. Here.

716
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:50,299
Hey. Did you wash your hands?

717
00:41:50,382 --> 00:41:52,384
They're clean. I washed them.

718
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:54,178
-I'll have one too.
-Good. Eat it.

719
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:55,262
All right.

720
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:57,139
Let me…

721
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:03,187
Snowball.

722
00:42:04,104 --> 00:42:05,397
Snowball!

723
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:07,900
Where did she go?

724
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:13,030
Snowball!

725
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:15,783
Snow…

726
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:19,787
You said she changed after having babies.

727
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:23,123
She must have postpartum depression.
Parenting is hard.

728
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:26,877
Oh, boy.

729
00:42:29,129 --> 00:42:31,674
How long do I have to look for Snowball…

730
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:36,095
Are you looking for her?

731
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:39,807
What the…

732
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:47,731
SEONGWON NATIONAL SPORTS CENTER

733
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:53,862
Can you believe him?
How could he come to training after that?

734
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:55,614
I heard he was close with the coach.

735
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:58,200
If I were him, I would take some time off.

736
00:42:58,784 --> 00:43:00,494
He sure is no ordinary guy.

737
00:43:01,495 --> 00:43:05,332
Did you hear that he threw the match
at the Dano Championships?

738
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:07,751
I hear that's why the coach died.

739
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:09,044
-Really?
-Yes.

740
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:10,504
He was supposed to lose,

741
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:13,549
but the plan went south
because of a bad call.

742
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:14,592
Damn.

743
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:17,970
Then, they should investigate
all the games that he's won.

744
00:43:18,053 --> 00:43:20,180
-They should.
-Totally.

745
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:28,105
I said I don't have money.

746
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:30,149
You're making money these days.

747
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:35,487
There are so many people here.

748
00:43:39,658 --> 00:43:40,618
Hey, Dong-seok!

749
00:43:42,411 --> 00:43:43,370
Dong-seok is here.

750
00:43:44,204 --> 00:43:46,790
There you were, Dong-seok.

751
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:49,418
Hey.

752
00:43:50,252 --> 00:43:54,298
So the rumor was true.
You guys really have a dessert section.

753
00:43:54,381 --> 00:43:56,216
Talk about success, man!

754
00:43:56,300 --> 00:44:00,095
You crushed me in every game
to come to this rich team.

755
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:01,764
Can I eat this?

756
00:44:01,847 --> 00:44:04,141
Hey, let's eat. Come on.

757
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:06,769
Hey, come here.

758
00:44:25,287 --> 00:44:27,456
I didn't know there was a management team.

759
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,168
It's actually new.

760
00:44:31,251 --> 00:44:35,673
The team was formed after you left,
which was very recent.

761
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:44,264
What?

762
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:46,767
What do you mean?

763
00:44:48,977 --> 00:44:50,729
Just ask away and go.

764
00:44:54,817 --> 00:44:56,902
You're here to ask me something, right?

765
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:04,910
Since the news got out, I've been asked
the question hundreds of times.

766
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:08,247
Tomorrow, I have to explain it
to the association too.

767
00:45:09,581 --> 00:45:11,792
So you two can just ask the question.

768
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:13,627
Fine. I have something to ask you.

769
00:45:14,753 --> 00:45:18,298
In fact, I wanted to ask this
right after the match that day.

770
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:19,258
Look, Baek-du.

771
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:21,218
To be honest--

772
00:45:21,301 --> 00:45:22,553
Are your back teeth okay?

773
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:24,680
What?

774
00:45:24,763 --> 00:45:27,724
I mean, during the match that day,

775
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:32,229
you were grinding your teeth!
I could hear you doing it.

776
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:36,817
After acting all respectful
and friendly towards me…

777
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,403
Hearing your back teeth grinding,

778
00:45:39,486 --> 00:45:42,030
I felt so betrayed.

779
00:45:42,114 --> 00:45:43,449
Why take it so seriously?

780
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:56,753
The day before the Dano Championships,

781
00:46:00,215 --> 00:46:01,800
after the training,

782
00:46:02,801 --> 00:46:05,179
Coach Yeon said he'd like to talk with me.

783
00:46:06,221 --> 00:46:07,639
Dong-seok, please.

784
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:10,726
I'm your coach… No.

785
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:15,063
I'm like your brother. Please help me.

786
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:16,899
Please.

787
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:20,068
No one will know.

788
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:23,280
Losing one match won't look suspicious.

789
00:46:23,363 --> 00:46:27,284
They'll just think
you aren't feeling your best.

790
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:30,579
Honestly, I was torn.

791
00:46:31,497 --> 00:46:33,707
I was torn until the game.

792
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:37,836
After all, I am where I am now,
thanks to him.

793
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:45,302
But… it just felt wrong.

794
00:46:49,014 --> 00:46:50,599
So I told him I wouldn't do it.

795
00:46:52,017 --> 00:46:53,685
I said I just couldn't.

796
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:59,107
If you don't do this,
I won't be able to stay here.

797
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:01,693
Seriously, man. I might actually die.

798
00:47:03,111 --> 00:47:04,863
But I still said I couldn't.

799
00:47:05,822 --> 00:47:07,115
You might not believe me,

800
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:08,825
-but I really--
-I believe you.

801
00:47:10,702 --> 00:47:14,248
As someone
who held your satba that day, I know it.

802
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:16,041
I know you didn't play foul.

803
00:47:16,124 --> 00:47:18,210
I know that better than anyone.

804
00:47:22,297 --> 00:47:23,507
Darn it.

805
00:47:26,426 --> 00:47:27,344
But Baek-du,

806
00:47:29,429 --> 00:47:31,682
everything is messed up now.

807
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:35,769
I didn't know
he'd actually end up like that.

808
00:47:35,852 --> 00:47:37,604
I didn't know he was serious.

809
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:39,022
So…

810
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:45,904
after hearing what happened to him,
I keep asking myself.

811
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:51,535
"Maybe I made the wrong decision."

812
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:54,246
"Maybe I should've listened to him."

813
00:47:54,329 --> 00:47:55,205
Are you nuts?

814
00:47:56,331 --> 00:47:58,083
How could you…

815
00:47:59,751 --> 00:48:02,045
I came all the way here
to hear this nonsense?

816
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:05,215
Paying 29,400 won for each trip,
and in total…

817
00:48:06,174 --> 00:48:07,718
Well, 53,000 something.

818
00:48:07,801 --> 00:48:09,678
I had to wake up early too, you know.

819
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:12,806
I'm poor these days

820
00:48:12,889 --> 00:48:14,933
because I had a salary cut!

821
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:17,060
Look, Lim Dong-seok!

822
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:20,230
I'll say this just once,
so listen carefully.

823
00:48:20,897 --> 00:48:24,610
You didn't do anything wrong!

824
00:48:25,485 --> 00:48:28,155
If anyone did, it's the coach

825
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:30,949
who tried to drag you into his own mess!
Am I wrong?

826
00:48:33,952 --> 00:48:35,412
Right.

827
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:38,081
He's right.

828
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:45,005
By the way,

829
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:50,719
do you know if anyone came to see
the coach that day in the arena?

830
00:48:52,971 --> 00:48:53,972
Somebody

831
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:58,477
saw the coach arguing
with someone in the arena that day.

832
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:02,814
I wonder if that person is the one
who directed the match-fixing.

833
00:49:03,732 --> 00:49:06,276
No. I didn't…

834
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:08,570
Oh, right.

835
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:12,949
Well, I didn't see anyone,

836
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:15,619
but the coach was

837
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:18,538
acting strange that day.

838
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:22,292
He seemed anxious
throughout the whole game.

839
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:27,547
He kept looking at the back
of the audience, as if he'd upset someone.

840
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:29,841
Who?

841
00:49:29,925 --> 00:49:32,302
-Did you see who that was?
-No.

842
00:49:33,428 --> 00:49:35,931
There were too many people,
so it was hard to tell.

843
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:55,992
Ma'am, I told you
to change her leash to a thicker one.

844
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:56,993
Come on.

845
00:49:57,077 --> 00:49:59,996
Anything thicker than that
would be like a ball and chain.

846
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:04,042
Besides, a thicker leash
won't do the trick either.

847
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:06,712
She always manages
to pull herself out of it.

848
00:50:07,462 --> 00:50:11,091
If she's that smart,
you should send her to college.

849
00:50:12,008 --> 00:50:15,137
Well, if that's what she wants,
I can do that.

850
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:17,723
So where was Snowball this time?

851
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:19,599
She was near the reservoir.

852
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:23,186
The reservoir?
That's not her stomping ground.

853
00:50:24,062 --> 00:50:25,647
She was barking there earlier.

854
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:27,399
-What?
-She barked?

855
00:50:27,482 --> 00:50:29,192
-My Snowball barked?
-Yes.

856
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:32,195
No way.

857
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:34,364
Snowball never barks.

858
00:50:35,574 --> 00:50:38,118
She's so docile that she never barks,

859
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:40,495
even when someone takes her food.

860
00:50:41,246 --> 00:50:45,125
She'd be like, "Okay, you eat it,"
and just let them take it.

861
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:49,004
She's like Gandhi. She's a pacifist.

862
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:02,976
Hey!

863
00:51:04,436 --> 00:51:05,312
Baek-du!

864
00:51:05,979 --> 00:51:07,481
Dong-seok, what's up?

865
00:51:10,692 --> 00:51:12,235
What's the matter?

866
00:51:15,363 --> 00:51:17,199
Right. Well…

867
00:51:17,824 --> 00:51:20,786
I'll leave you two alone, so you can talk.

868
00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:22,704
What? Why…

869
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:24,790
Okay, ma'am.

870
00:51:28,543 --> 00:51:29,419
Baek-du.

871
00:51:30,003 --> 00:51:30,921
What?

872
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:37,594
You know it too, right?

873
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:39,638
Know what?

874
00:51:41,723 --> 00:51:44,643
That you technically won that day.

875
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:49,481
I hit the ground first.
You knew that, right?

876
00:51:51,483 --> 00:51:54,027
Well, I wasn't sure.

877
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:56,738
You did win that day.

878
00:51:57,864 --> 00:51:59,908
-It was a bad call.
-Forget it.

879
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:04,287
We gave it our all in the match that day,

880
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:07,123
and the referee said you won.

881
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:11,795
The referee's call is part of the match.

882
00:52:15,924 --> 00:52:19,386
Did you know that I rejoined the team?

883
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:23,515
You better watch out.

884
00:52:23,598 --> 00:52:26,810
You know I can be pretty intimidating
if I want to be.

885
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:30,397
Of course I know that.

886
00:52:30,897 --> 00:52:33,066
-Why are you laughing at me?
-I'm not.

887
00:52:33,149 --> 00:52:34,442
I think you are.

888
00:52:34,526 --> 00:52:36,319
-Wait.
-Attention.

889
00:52:37,362 --> 00:52:38,864
Don't laugh at me.

890
00:52:38,947 --> 00:52:40,240
Okay. Stop.

891
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:42,409
Jeez, you've become so muscular.

892
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:45,829
The dog never barks,
but she barked at the reservoir.

893
00:52:46,454 --> 00:52:48,206
What do you think this means?

894
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:49,499
Nothing.

895
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:53,712
It means there was something
between the reservoir and Snowball.

896
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:57,591
What do you think that was?

897
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:00,302
Maybe she saw a ghost.

898
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:04,764
You know, people say
that dogs can see ghosts.

899
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:11,062
-I'm just saying--
-You've got a point.

900
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:12,022
What?

901
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:13,982
The dead man's spirit

902
00:53:14,065 --> 00:53:17,485
must be wandering around the reservoir
after his wrongful death,

903
00:53:18,403 --> 00:53:20,572
trying to let everyone know the truth.

904
00:53:21,114 --> 00:53:23,074
Then, Snowball saw his ghost.

905
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:23,992
Okay.

906
00:53:24,075 --> 00:53:25,744
The ghost must have said,

907
00:53:25,827 --> 00:53:27,370
-What?
-"Snowball."

908
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:29,706
"I didn't drown myself here."

909
00:53:29,789 --> 00:53:32,250
"Someone killed me and threw me in."

910
00:53:33,418 --> 00:53:36,671
"Please let others know about this."

911
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:40,884
What if Snowball was barking
to tell everyone the truth

912
00:53:40,967 --> 00:53:42,135
after hearing this?

913
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:47,766
Or what if Snowball saw something there?

914
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:53,980
Right.

915
00:53:58,318 --> 00:53:59,611
Gosh, I'm tired.

916
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:03,782
Tell me.

917
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:08,286
You came here
to comfort Lim Dong-seok, didn't you?

918
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:09,245
What?

919
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:15,293
You didn't come here
to check if his back teeth were okay.

920
00:54:17,379 --> 00:54:19,005
You came here to comfort him.

921
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:22,258
I was worried about his teeth too.

922
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:28,640
Look. If I were you,

923
00:54:28,723 --> 00:54:31,434
I would've slapped his face
as soon as I saw him.

924
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:33,353
What?

925
00:54:33,895 --> 00:54:35,855
Just think about it.

926
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:37,774
When he was asked for the favor,

927
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:40,819
he should've reported it,
dropped out of the game,

928
00:54:40,902 --> 00:54:43,196
or at least told you about it.

929
00:54:43,279 --> 00:54:44,572
You said you were close.

930
00:54:44,656 --> 00:54:47,701
He totally made a fool of you.
Look at what happened.

931
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:49,119
Now, you're involved too.

932
00:54:49,202 --> 00:54:51,162
Stop it.

933
00:54:51,246 --> 00:54:52,831
It wasn't Dong-seok's fault.

934
00:54:53,915 --> 00:54:56,668
Things have become so complicated for him,

935
00:54:56,751 --> 00:54:58,878
and now, he's being blamed
for what he didn't do.

936
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:01,256
Imagine how devastated he must be.

937
00:55:01,339 --> 00:55:04,134
Seriously, you…

938
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:12,726
-Seriously, you are…
-I'm what?

939
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:18,106
You haven't changed one bit.

940
00:55:19,357 --> 00:55:20,859
What do you mean?

941
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:25,238
What is it? Tell me.

942
00:55:26,197 --> 00:55:28,366
Du-sik, what do you mean?

943
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:34,914
Is that a water deer?

944
00:55:38,793 --> 00:55:42,172
I've seen one,
and it looked exactly like that.

945
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:44,758
It's a dog.

946
00:55:50,263 --> 00:55:51,556
Wait.

947
00:55:52,223 --> 00:55:54,559
About the reservoir…

948
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:58,146
Sorry. Never mind.

949
00:56:04,402 --> 00:56:05,987
By the way, about Du-sik…

950
00:56:08,281 --> 00:56:09,908
-Du-sik?
-Yes.

951
00:56:09,991 --> 00:56:13,369
The person you mentioned the other day
who lived in my house.

952
00:56:14,245 --> 00:56:16,748
Oh, did I?

953
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:20,460
I guess I did. What about it?

954
00:56:21,002 --> 00:56:24,380
Well… What was Du-sik like?

955
00:56:24,964 --> 00:56:25,882
Why do you ask?

956
00:56:26,633 --> 00:56:29,385
Nobody wants to talk about Du-sik.

957
00:56:30,011 --> 00:56:33,056
Even if I ask directly. It's strange.

958
00:56:34,474 --> 00:56:36,434
Of course they don't tell you.

959
00:56:36,518 --> 00:56:38,561
-It's a taboo word here.
-Come on.

960
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:40,772
It can't be that big a secret.

961
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:48,655
It seems there is
some pretty huge story behind Du-sik.

962
00:56:50,156 --> 00:56:51,282
Story?

963
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:10,844
I wonder what Du-sik's family will do now.

964
00:57:11,427 --> 00:57:13,847
I guess they'll have to leave soon.

965
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:16,057
I feel so bad for them.

966
00:57:16,141 --> 00:57:17,308
Even if they stay here,

967
00:57:17,392 --> 00:57:19,060
-That poor girl.
-I wouldn't like it.

968
00:57:19,144 --> 00:57:20,728
-I feel so bad.
-I can't believe

969
00:57:20,812 --> 00:57:22,897
that Jun fixed the match.

970
00:57:22,981 --> 00:57:25,692
How could he do that to Cheol-yong?

971
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:27,735
Keep it down. She might hear you.

972
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:38,538
What the…

973
00:57:39,247 --> 00:57:40,540
He fell asleep already.

974
00:58:38,139 --> 00:58:41,601
Why do you keep following me?
Stop following me!

975
00:58:42,602 --> 00:58:44,604
I said, leave me alone. Why are you…

976
00:58:46,022 --> 00:58:47,649
Why are you bothering me?

977
00:58:51,986 --> 00:58:53,446
Oh Du-sik!

978
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:57,075
Oh Du-sik!

979
00:58:58,743 --> 00:59:01,079
Why are you crying?

980
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:04,165
I'm the one who wants to cry!

981
00:59:05,416 --> 00:59:10,296
I'm the one who should be crying, not you!

982
00:59:36,197 --> 00:59:38,408
I don't know what the story is, though.

983
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:44,247
I tried to dig a little, but everyone
gets upset whenever I mention Du-sik.

984
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:46,749
So you don't know.

985
00:59:47,625 --> 00:59:50,503
But I heard that nobody knows
what happened exactly.

986
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:52,046
What?

987
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:57,635
Only three people know
what happened to Du-sik's family then.

988
00:59:58,428 --> 00:59:59,637
Who are they?

989
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:02,348
Du-sik.

990
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:04,601
Du-sik's father.

991
01:00:05,184 --> 01:00:06,894
And Du-sik's friend's father.

992
01:00:11,232 --> 01:00:12,775
But why do you ask about them?

993
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:15,737
Just because.

994
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:20,283
By the way,

995
01:00:21,784 --> 01:00:24,621
-do you know Du-sik is a woman?
-What?

996
01:00:27,707 --> 01:00:30,627
Du-sik is a woman?

997
01:00:57,779 --> 01:00:59,864
Enough sleep. Wake up now.

998
01:00:59,947 --> 01:01:02,617
-Why do you sleep for so long?
-Gosh.

999
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:04,410
Move. I need to get off.

1000
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:07,622
You didn't have to hit me.

1001
01:01:10,416 --> 01:01:12,960
I'm the only one in this town
who knows it.

1002
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:18,508
It's just so obvious to me,
but people don't see it.

1003
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:21,969
Are you curious?

1004
01:01:22,929 --> 01:01:26,474
I wasn't, but I am now.

1005
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:29,602
Du-sik is…

1006
01:01:31,604 --> 01:01:33,314
Baek-du's first love.

1007
01:01:44,325 --> 01:01:45,702
All right.

1008
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:53,376
Hey, Kim Baek-du.

1009
01:01:58,214 --> 01:01:59,465
Did you

1010
01:02:00,842 --> 01:02:03,094
-make my nose bleed on purpose?
-Nosebleed?

1011
01:02:04,178 --> 01:02:07,515
I'm the one who always had nosebleeds
because of you. I never…

1012
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:14,105
-Oh, no!
-Are you okay?

1013
01:02:14,188 --> 01:02:16,649
-Are you okay?
-I think she's bleeding.

1014
01:02:21,529 --> 01:02:23,406
-Du-sik, are you okay?
-Are you okay?

1015
01:02:23,489 --> 01:02:25,950
Don't tilt your head back. It's dangerous.

1016
01:02:26,701 --> 01:02:28,786
Go tell the school nurse about it.

1017
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:30,580
Are you okay, Du-sik?

1018
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:32,665
Why did you do that?

1019
01:02:33,875 --> 01:02:37,712
You're not supposed to hit a girl so hard.

1020
01:02:38,296 --> 01:02:41,132
Why did you even hit Du-sik?
She was on defense.

1021
01:02:42,967 --> 01:02:46,471
You crossed the line.
Du-sik is our friend.

1022
01:02:47,096 --> 01:02:48,181
Seriously.

1023
01:02:48,264 --> 01:02:53,269
You just made Du-sik's ugly nose
even uglier. How could you do that?

1024
01:02:53,352 --> 01:02:56,147
She'll have to live with it
for the rest of her life.

1025
01:03:01,068 --> 01:03:03,446
Oh, that.

1026
01:03:03,946 --> 01:03:06,491
I didn't mean to hit your face.

1027
01:03:06,574 --> 01:03:08,159
I'm sorry. Did it hurt a lot?

1028
01:03:10,328 --> 01:03:11,496
Well…

1029
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:14,999
It actually made my life easier at school.

1030
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,044
Because you took all the blame.

1031
01:03:20,671 --> 01:03:21,714
Right.

1032
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:24,592
I completely forgot

1033
01:03:25,301 --> 01:03:27,512
that you were always like this.

1034
01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:32,183
What do you mean, I'm like this?

1035
01:03:32,266 --> 01:03:33,142
You?

1036
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:37,605
You're such a pushover.

1037
01:03:40,107 --> 01:03:41,692
Hey.

1038
01:03:41,776 --> 01:03:44,862
You're too caring for your own good.

1039
01:03:44,946 --> 01:03:48,282
You're happy as long as others are happy.

1040
01:03:48,366 --> 01:03:51,202
You're easy-going
and you worry about nothing.

1041
01:03:53,037 --> 01:03:53,955
Still,

1042
01:03:55,331 --> 01:03:58,793
going back to the ssireum team
was a very good decision.

1043
01:04:00,086 --> 01:04:01,504
Why do you think so?

1044
01:04:04,882 --> 01:04:06,425
Because you like ssireum.

1045
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:09,262
You can't live without it.
You like it more than I do.

1046
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:13,850
Did you think I didn't know?

1047
01:04:13,933 --> 01:04:16,018
I told you. Try hard all you want.

1048
01:04:16,102 --> 01:04:18,354
-I can see right through you.
-That's not all.

1049
01:04:18,771 --> 01:04:19,605
What?

1050
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:23,359
There's another reason why I came back
to the ssireum team.

1051
01:04:23,901 --> 01:04:24,944
Can't you see that?

1052
01:04:34,745 --> 01:04:35,746
It's because of you.

1053
01:04:41,586 --> 01:04:43,754
I came back because of you.

1054
01:04:47,508 --> 01:04:48,801
What do you mean?

1055
01:04:50,344 --> 01:04:52,346
Don't you get it?

1056
01:04:53,097 --> 01:04:56,142
I came back to the team because of you.

1057
01:05:15,494 --> 01:05:18,372
LIKE FLOWERS IN SAND

1058
01:05:41,854 --> 01:05:43,981
-Honey.
-"Honey"?

1059
01:05:44,065 --> 01:05:46,943
Honey, my foot. She's not his honey.

1060
01:05:47,026 --> 01:05:48,027
Let's give it a go.

1061
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:49,153
Let's do this.

1062
01:05:49,236 --> 01:05:51,405
Baek-du, don't compete
in the upcoming match.

1063
01:05:51,489 --> 01:05:52,531
Why?

1064
01:05:52,615 --> 01:05:54,241
Why shouldn't I?

1065
01:05:54,325 --> 01:05:56,077
You never know until the match ends.

1066
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:58,371
Why are you thinking of losing already?

1067
01:05:58,454 --> 01:06:00,289
Did you find out?

1068
01:06:00,373 --> 01:06:04,001
If you zoom in closely
on the coach's eyes…

1069
01:06:04,085 --> 01:06:05,753
I think Baek-du is seeing a girl.

1070
01:06:06,337 --> 01:06:08,631
I thought I should tell you now.

1071
01:06:10,883 --> 01:06:12,885
