1
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:45,962
LIKE FLOWERS IN SAND

2
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,374
Hey, Du-sik.

3
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,546
It's four in the morning.

4
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:29,923
What are you doing here?

5
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,969
Did you watch the soccer game earlier?

6
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:37,347
Ahn Jung-hwan is so cool, isn't he?

7
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:41,726
To be honest, I thought we'd lose today.

8
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:45,396
But they did such an incredible job.

9
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:50,735
Maybe I should just quit ssireum
and start playing soccer.

10
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:52,529
What do you think?

11
00:01:56,783 --> 00:02:00,537
But seriously,
what are you doing here at this hour?

12
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:02,872
What's the matter?

13
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:04,916
Can't sleep?

14
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,044
Too excited about tomorrow's picnic?

15
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,387
Do you want some anchovy gimbap?

16
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:21,391
My mom made a ton
so we could share tomorrow.

17
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:25,103
Should I go bring some now?

18
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:26,521
Baek-du.

19
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:34,404
Promise me…

20
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:39,284
that you'll be a champion
when you grow up.

21
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:41,578
What?

22
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,166
And when you become a champion,

23
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,461
don't forget to tell people about me.

24
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:52,130
Okay?

25
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:56,050
About what?

26
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,052
What should I tell them?

27
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:00,221
I don't know.

28
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:03,808
You can say whatever you want.

29
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:07,937
I just want to see

30
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:11,900
if you'll still remember me then.

31
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:13,860
What?

32
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,406
You're talking
as if you won't be hanging with me then.

33
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,661
Du-sik.

34
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,249
What are you talking about?

35
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:32,462
Of course, I'll still be hanging with you.
You're being silly now.

36
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:33,421
Right?

37
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:38,718
Go back to bed now.

38
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:42,555
Or you'll be too tired to play tomorrow.

39
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:46,142
All right. You should go to bed too.

40
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:51,940
Du-sik.

41
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:55,068
Mom said she's making tteokbokki
for us tomorrow,

42
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:57,195
so you should come over after the picnic.

43
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:58,780
You're coming, right?

44
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:04,911
Sure.

45
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:06,871
Sounds good.

46
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:09,916
See you tomorrow.

47
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:22,637
Take care.

48
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,848
Kim Baek-du.

49
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:11,853
Du-sik.

50
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:14,147
Du-sik.

51
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,190
Du-sik!

52
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:20,278
Du-sik, where are you going?

53
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:24,532
Du-sik, wait!

54
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,618
Where are you going?

55
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:30,079
Oh Du-sik!

56
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:34,208
Oh Du-sik! Hey!

57
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,503
Oh Du-sik!

58
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,548
Where are you going?

59
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:44,969
Oh Du-sik!

60
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:49,932
Where are you going?

61
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:57,607
EPISODE 7
NEW DAY, NEW INCIDENT

62
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,736
It's just…

63
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,573
It's not even a pleasant memory.

64
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:08,826
That's why I never brought it up.

65
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,414
Did something bad happen?

66
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:16,459
My dad…

67
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,758
My dad killed a person, apparently.

68
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:27,804
Twenty years ago,

69
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:30,848
my dad was this ssireum team's head coach.

70
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:34,602
And one of the wrestlers
on the team died back then.

71
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:38,231
And people said

72
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:41,692
that my dad suggested to that wrestler

73
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,861
that they throw a match…

74
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,364
Throw a match?

75
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:53,246
But he refused and they ended up fighting.
They said that was how it happened.

76
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:57,083
There was no evidence

77
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,585
and he was officially acquitted.

78
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:05,174
But people don't like
a boring ending like that.

79
00:07:07,426 --> 00:07:10,930
I don't know if they couldn't believe it
or just didn't want to,

80
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:12,807
but nobody believed it.

81
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:14,684
So we left.

82
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:20,064
Because we couldn't live
like that any longer.

83
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:22,608
Actually…

84
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,862
we were kicked out.

85
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,865
So why did you come back here?

86
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:33,494
We could've sent someone else.

87
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:37,206
-So why--
-Choi Chil-seong was here back then.

88
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:38,916
What?

89
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,794
I think everything that happened here

90
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:45,173
was Choi Chil-seong's doing.

91
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:29,550
Du-sik, I'm competing in tomorrow's match.

92
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:32,178
I did good, right?

93
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:35,389
Are you proud of me?

94
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:37,475
Are you asleep?

95
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:40,061
Already?

96
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:50,363
Gosh, you really haven't changed.

97
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,930
62-9 BUKNAM-DONG
ROOM 304, ROSE INN

98
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:43,332
Seok-hui once told me that on the morning

99
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,544
of his fifth police exam,
having already failed four times,

100
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:50,590
he suddenly burst into tears
while putting his socks on.

101
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,927
NATIONAL NAMHANG SSIREUM CHAMPIONSHIPS
D-2

102
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:57,430
NATIONAL NAMHANG SSIREUM CHAMPIONSHIPS
D-1

103
00:09:57,513 --> 00:09:59,765
Our family's specialty,
the seaweed stem dish.

104
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,690
Back then, I thought
it was because Seok-hui was such a loser.

105
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,609
But now, I understand.

106
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,071
Do that later.

107
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,157
Baek-du, look.

108
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,076
These are the last champion trunks
I have left.

109
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,287
-Maybe today, you can--
-This time…

110
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:27,710
I don't want any of you to come this time.

111
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:32,715
I don't want any of you
to come cheer for me.

112
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:33,924
What are you saying?

113
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:37,803
My subscribers have been dying
to watch your next match.

114
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,473
Subscribers? Are you serious right now?

115
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:41,974
This is my mother.

116
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,601
Mom, say hi.

117
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:44,977
-Okay.
-Nice to meet you.

118
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:46,562
I understand.

119
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,482
But Father!

120
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:59,241
Baek-du, these trunks
have the tiger's energy.

121
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,701
Tiger…

122
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:06,123
Good luck.

123
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,291
Good luck.

124
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:13,339
Mr. Kim Baek-du
is now taking his first step.

125
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:14,715
-Hey.
-A step towards victory.

126
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:17,218
Go, Geosan-gun Ssireum Team!

127
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:18,469
Go, Kim Baek-du.

128
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,514
Are you sure you're okay by yourself?

129
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:24,850
-Here. Take the tiger.
-Fine. Give it here.

130
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:26,268
Yes! All right.

131
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:27,770
Stay focused, okay?

132
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,605
Don't forget to call me.

133
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,273
You can go back in now.

134
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:32,233
-All right.
-Okay.

135
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:33,442
-We will.
-Just go.

136
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:34,527
Don't lose focus.

137
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,529
Baek-du, you got this. Okay?

138
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:40,408
My family has always
been supportive of me,

139
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:42,952
even though I've never done well
in championships.

140
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:45,371
You got this!

141
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:49,458
And I feel the heart behind it.

142
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:52,795
That must be why Seok-hui cried.

143
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:28,747
I'm leaving now.

144
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:30,749
Wait, Yu-gyeong.

145
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:36,547
I've been up all night thinking…

146
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:38,841
You don't look like it.

147
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:40,259
Anyway…

148
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,180
Are you sure
about continuing this investigation?

149
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:45,598
What do you mean?

150
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:48,184
Right now, Kim Baek-du
is the only one who knows,

151
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:51,937
but soon, more and more people
will find out that you're Oh Du-sik.

152
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:56,358
Haven't you been keeping
Kim Baek-du quiet to avoid that?

153
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:59,653
I don't think it'll stay that way--

154
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:01,071
As long as you keep quiet.

155
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:05,367
And I don't care if everyone finds it out.

156
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:08,329
I have to take this investigation.

157
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:13,667
All right.

158
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:16,712
I knew you would say that.

159
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:18,839
I was just saying.

160
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:22,301
I knew that I wouldn't be able
to stop you.

161
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,345
Oh, right.

162
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:27,097
I forgot to tell you.

163
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:37,274
The café owner kept talking about Du-sik.

164
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:41,278
At first, I thought
she was just some weirdo.

165
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:45,241
But now, I'm thinking
she might have done that on purpose.

166
00:13:57,795 --> 00:14:00,297
She kept talking about Du-sik?

167
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:02,550
But why?

168
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:05,553
What about Du-sik?

169
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:15,854
-Hey, Du-sik.
-Jeez.

170
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,483
Why did you ignore my texts?

171
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,611
Well, that's because…

172
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,947
You see, I have this thing

173
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,700
where I can't sleep
when my texts are ignored.

174
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,952
I'd like you not to do that again.

175
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:33,956
-All right.
-How could you ignore my text?

176
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,959
No, hold on.

177
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:40,713
You seem to be acting up lately.

178
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:43,173
What?

179
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:44,675
Behave yourself.

180
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:45,926
I'm keeping score.

181
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:49,972
Fine.

182
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,601
Du-sik, wait up.

183
00:14:58,063 --> 00:14:59,648
What did Jin-su say yesterday?

184
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:02,192
-Jin-su?
-Yeah.

185
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:05,237
When you told him
you wanted to participate.

186
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:08,407
Did you guys fight?

187
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:12,828
No way. He just said, "Sure, then."
That was it.

188
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:14,747
What?

189
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:16,707
After all that pushback.

190
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,751
-Now he decides--
-Du-sik.

191
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:21,712
You're coming
to the match tomorrow, right?

192
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:24,048
-To cheer for me, right?
-Come on.

193
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:27,301
Do I have to? Both the coach
and the head coach will be there.

194
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:30,554
Of course, you should.
You're the general manager.

195
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:32,806
I am, but still…

196
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:34,934
Wait.

197
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:37,061
I'm not your general manager.

198
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:38,103
I'm…

199
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:41,774
a police officer.

200
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:45,778
An officer of the Violent Crimes Unit
of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency.

201
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:48,864
So you're not coming?

202
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:52,284
I would love to.

203
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,662
Whenever you lose focus,

204
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:56,956
I can go smack your head.

205
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,668
However,

206
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:04,630
I've just entered a new phase
in the investigation.

207
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,508
I'm at a crucial juncture right now.

208
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:08,467
Understand?

209
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,264
But still,
shouldn't I be your priority over work?

210
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:16,183
I don't have a match every day.

211
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:29,029
Was it Namhang?

212
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:32,449
Why? Are you coming?

213
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:36,912
Where are the other guys, by the way?

214
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:38,914
You're right.

215
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:42,167
They should be here by now.
Why is no one coming?

216
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:48,716
GEOSAN-GUN SSIREUM TEAM

217
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:04,815
BAEK-DU

218
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,318
Slow down. It's dangerous.

219
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:10,529
Are you kidding me right now?

220
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:13,115
Is this supposed to be some sort of prank?

221
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:16,160
Seriously, I've never heard

222
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:20,080
of an athlete missing
his team's bus on game day!

223
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:22,875
Jeez. How could you miss the meeting time

224
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,752
after training for years now?

225
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:27,254
I told you. I went there on time.

226
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:29,423
That's the time we usually meet up.

227
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:32,509
I have no idea
why they got together early today.

228
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:35,721
I kept waiting, but they wouldn't show up
or answer my call.

229
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:40,017
Also, why don't you have
a driver's license yet?

230
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,352
Everyone gets one
after finishing high school.

231
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:44,271
What have you been doing until now--

232
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:45,230
I tried to.

233
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,316
I tried to get a driver's license.

234
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:48,859
But…

235
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:50,736
I…

236
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,530
failed the written exam twice,

237
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:54,948
so I gave up.

238
00:17:57,701 --> 00:18:00,120
Jeez, you…

239
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:09,797
Everything she does is just so suspicious.

240
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:22,226
It's so nice here, isn't it?

241
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:23,143
It is.

242
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:25,938
Don't go. Gather up here.

243
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:27,106
-Hey, come here.
-Okay.

244
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:29,942
All right.

245
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:33,904
To wish you guys good luck for the match,

246
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:36,990
I booked our accommodation
with an ocean view.

247
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,951
So what should you do now?

248
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:40,285
-We'll do our best…
-Yes.

249
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:42,538
You'll have to do well. All right?

250
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,373
-Yes, Coach.
-Good.

251
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:47,459
Go to your rooms
and weigh yourselves first.

252
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:49,419
If you're near the limit,

253
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:52,422
don't even swallow saliva
until the weigh-in. Okay?

254
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:53,882
-Head Coach.
-Yes?

255
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,342
I don't see Kim Baek-du.

256
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:56,301
What?

257
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:58,804
What?

258
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,181
Where did he go?

259
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:02,641
-Baek-du?
-Well…

260
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:06,562
We thought Baek-du wasn't competing.
So we didn't wait for him.

261
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:12,526
I got a lot of missed calls.

262
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:14,069
Let me see.

263
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,237
Jeez.

264
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:18,782
Why is that patrol officer standing there

265
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:21,451
listening to both sides?

266
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:25,122
Does he think he's Solomon or what?
I've got no time for this.

267
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:29,168
Gosh, this place is just…

268
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:30,752
Are you having a good time?

269
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,754
Is that why you're singing?

270
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,756
Listen, Du-sik.

271
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:39,052
Why don't we leave earlier next time
so we can drive along this coast?

272
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:41,138
It takes about an hour longer,

273
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:43,932
but the road has
a spectacular view all year round.

274
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,435
Do you want to be knocked to the ground?

275
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:49,229
If you ever miss the team bus again,

276
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:50,898
I'm seriously going to do that.

277
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:52,274
-Got it?
-Oh, right!

278
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:55,694
We should stop by the rest stops
on the way. Don't forget.

279
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:58,238
Gosh, could you please!

280
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:00,782
-What?
-What's wrong with you? Jeez

281
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:03,118
Gosh, I love this place.

282
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,536
Jeez.

283
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,539
You just can't stay out of trouble,
can you?

284
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:11,001
Hi, Snowball. You must've been thirsty.

285
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:14,171
Don't you have any work to do?

286
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:17,216
You're on duty now,
and you're just hanging out with a dog.

287
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:20,010
Come on. I wasn't hanging out with her.

288
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:23,430
If I wanted to hang out,
I would've done so with Baek-du or Jin-su,

289
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:25,098
not a dog I can't even talk to.

290
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:28,310
Are you sure?
I think you two are of the same level.

291
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:29,811
My gosh!

292
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:33,649
Snowball, look what you're making me
go through. Stop running away!

293
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,150
Oh, boy.

294
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,860
Did she run away again?

295
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:38,445
Where was she today?

296
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:42,574
She was heading to the reservoir again,
but I caught her.

297
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:46,411
There must be a reason
why she keeps going to the reservoir.

298
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,414
Hey, Lee Gyeong-mun!

299
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:58,006
Where are you coming from?

300
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:00,926
I asked you
to watch the store for a minute,

301
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:03,095
and you couldn't even do that?

302
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:06,348
Why are you always roaming about?

303
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,767
Were you born
with itchy feet or something?

304
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:09,685
-I--
-Also,

305
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:13,480
you should've at least told me
that you were going out.

306
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:15,691
I mean, we have rice cakes on the stall.

307
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:18,402
You were practically
asking for thieves to come!

308
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:19,528
Have you lost your mind?

309
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,363
Oh, Snowball is here.

310
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:25,325
-Snowball.
-Lee Gyeong-mun. Hey!

311
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:29,621
Come on. Can't you see?
She's telling you to stop fighting.

312
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:31,707
Gandhi, you love peace, right?

313
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:35,752
Right. On the way here,
I saw the café was closed.

314
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:38,130
Which one? Mi-ran's café?

315
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:41,675
Well, she opens and closes the café

316
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:43,510
when she feels like it.

317
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:45,137
She's one bold business owner.

318
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:47,806
Really? Is that okay though?

319
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:50,684
Who's to say it's not okay?
She's the owner.

320
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:53,812
Is that so?

321
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:58,442
NAMHANG REST STOP

322
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:05,574
What's taking him so long?

323
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:11,955
Du-sik!

324
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:17,919
Seriously, does he think
we're going on a picnic or what?

325
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:23,050
Isn't the weigh-in soon?
Are you sure you can eat so much now?

326
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:25,385
I don't gain weight
no matter how much I eat.

327
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:26,345
WELCOME TO NAMHANG

328
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:30,974
Kim Baek-du, 81 point…

329
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:32,934
two?

330
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:34,728
What? How…

331
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:37,773
Hey, Kim Baek-du.

332
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,733
Why did you gain so much weight?

333
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:40,984
This can't be right.

334
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:44,071
I weighed 79.7 kg yesterday.
Something's not right.

335
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:47,324
Then how could you gain
more than 1 kg overnight?

336
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:48,992
-How strange.
-You…

337
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:50,994
What did you eat today?

338
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:51,912
Today?

339
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:55,791
Nothing much. I had breakfast and…

340
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:59,211
Right. I had some food from the rest stop.

341
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:01,838
Walnut cookies and a fish cake bar.

342
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:05,550
Right. And a couple of baby potatoes…

343
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:07,552
Baby potatoes?

344
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:10,680
Man, are you crazy?
Who eats like that before a weigh-in?

345
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:13,183
I never go over 80 kg
no matter how much I eat.

346
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:16,478
You're the one who insisted on competing!
Have you lost your mind?

347
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:20,440
Don't just stand there.
Put on a sweatshirt and go run laps!

348
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:24,736
Come on. Get going.

349
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:35,580
Don't walk! Keep running!

350
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:39,417
Jeong-hun!

351
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:47,175
I'm sorry he had to bother you
when you're busy with your own work.

352
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:49,177
It's okay.

353
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,762
If it weren't for you,

354
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:53,223
he could've been in serious trouble.

355
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:55,934
You technically saved his life.

356
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:58,728
Come on. You flatter me.

357
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:02,482
Well, it would've been better

358
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:06,319
if you hadn't let him eat though.

359
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:08,905
Pardon?

360
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:11,283
I mean,

361
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:15,370
it would be a shame
to be disqualified because of his weight

362
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:17,581
after barely making it here.

363
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:22,836
Hey, Baek-du!

364
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:25,505
You can't lose weight like that!

365
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:28,341
Hey!

366
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:31,636
Carry someone on your back.
That'll definitely do it!

367
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:33,555
Who?

368
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:36,516
Should I go?

369
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:39,978
Forget it.

370
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:42,355
He's trying to lose weight,
not break his back.

371
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:43,732
Go.

372
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:47,903
Gosh, what will we do?
The weigh-in is soon.

373
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:52,657
To lose 1.4 kg,
he should really be carrying someone…

374
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:03,752
Why are you all looking at me like that?

375
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:09,549
Come on. Am I that heavy?

376
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:13,136
Stop messing with me.

377
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,805
I'm not that heavy.

378
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:17,390
-Du-sik.
-Seriously.

379
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:20,143
Du-sik.

380
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:24,231
You see,
I can literally taste blood in my throat.

381
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:28,109
But it seems you've been eating well

382
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:30,528
for the past 20 years,

383
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:31,821
so I'm happy.

384
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:35,825
Hey, put me down.

385
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:37,327
-Hey.
-I said, put me down.

386
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:38,912
-Don't move.
-Let me just…

387
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:39,955
You're tiring me!

388
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,414
Don't move.

389
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:43,500
You're so dead later.

390
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:48,546
-Hey!
-Wait.

391
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,715
You almost dropped me! Hold tight!

392
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,385
-Your arms!
-All right.

393
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:54,594
-Gosh.
-You're just…

394
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:58,640
Geosan-gun Ssireum Team, Kim Baek-du.

395
00:25:58,723 --> 00:25:59,599
Yes.

396
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:00,725
-Baek-du.
-Yeah?

397
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:21,496
Put your big toes down.

398
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:35,176
I got a pass!

399
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:39,222
Jeez.

400
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:41,016
That was so close!

401
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:43,268
Yes!

402
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:45,979
Can I get two cups?

403
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:47,605
Thank you.

404
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,941
Don't eat that. It's mine.

405
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:51,151
Man.

406
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:52,444
See, Baek-du?

407
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:54,779
You gain weight too, if you eat a lot.

408
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:57,282
Everyone gains weight when they eat a lot.

409
00:26:57,365 --> 00:27:00,702
I worked out so hard
that I'm starving now.

410
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:02,412
Eat up.

411
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:04,748
-And you, stop eating.
-Okay.

412
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:06,458
-Eat up, guys.
-Yes, Coach!

413
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:07,667
Excuse me.

414
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:11,546
Do you have anything other than seafood?
Something non-seafood?

415
00:27:11,629 --> 00:27:14,632
You do realize
that we're in a sashimi restaurant, right?

416
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:16,843
I don't feel like sashimi today.

417
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:18,762
What's wrong?

418
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:21,431
You said
you could eat only sashimi for every meal.

419
00:27:21,514 --> 00:27:23,266
If you're not eating that, give it to me.

420
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,851
Sure. Have it.

421
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,897
Hey, don't take so much.

422
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:33,234
We have a lot here.

423
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:34,736
Is this for you two?

424
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:44,245
Yes.

425
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:47,957
Where?

426
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:50,043
A pay phone in the market?

427
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:52,379
There were six calls from there.

428
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:55,882
We've verified every call Yeon had
over the past three months

429
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:57,425
except for that one.

430
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,886
INVESTIGATION TEAM 3

431
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:02,764
No, it couldn't have been Choi Chil-seong.

432
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:05,809
He had a call with this number
after Choi died too.

433
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:09,938
I'm thinking there may have been someone

434
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:12,732
between Choi Chil-seong
and Yeon Sang-cheol.

435
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:15,485
Wait.

436
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:17,654
Where are you now?

437
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:19,656
Namhang?

438
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:26,079
I told you to go undercover,
and you're just playing around.

439
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:27,747
That's enough.

440
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:29,416
Anyway, you better hurry up.

441
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:31,543
I clearly said we had no time.

442
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,253
Wait, Captain.

443
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:35,171
What?

444
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:38,675
About what I asked earlier…

445
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:41,136
It's not done yet, is it?

446
00:28:41,719 --> 00:28:42,762
Hey.

447
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:45,390
You know
they're slow with official documents.

448
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:48,435
Just wait. They said it'd take a few days.

449
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:51,229
Okay.

450
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:55,525
All right.

451
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:57,527
Bye.

452
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:08,246
Hey, what are you doing out here?

453
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:10,874
Well, nothing.

454
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:11,791
What's wrong?

455
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,711
There's nothing to eat in there, right?

456
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:18,423
It's okay. I ate a bit. What about you?

457
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:20,759
Why did you come out here?

458
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:24,345
Shouldn't you eat well today
for the match tomorrow?

459
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:27,056
It's okay. I'm not that hungry.

460
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,809
If I get hungry later,
I can have some cup noodles.

461
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:34,230
Want to hang out…

462
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:37,484
in my room later?

463
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:39,027
What?

464
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:41,613
Why?

465
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:43,615
To have ramyeon and chill.

466
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:45,241
How about it?

467
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:53,958
You…

468
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:57,253
What are you trying to pull here?

469
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:58,880
What is it this time?

470
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:03,009
Do you even hear yourself?
Hang out in your room and chill?

471
00:30:03,092 --> 00:30:04,302
And have ramyeon?

472
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:07,013
-You're a dirty dog.
-Hey.

473
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:09,057
You sneaky punk!

474
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,266
What are you thinking?

475
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,893
Where did you learn that?

476
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:13,770
Wait, what are you talking about?

477
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:15,730
I said, come over and have ramyeon.

478
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,357
As a late night snack.

479
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:20,109
I mean, you couldn't eat much here,

480
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:21,986
so you'll get hungry later.

481
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,947
So I wanted to make you some ramyeon.

482
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:26,950
Gosh, you hit me for nothing.

483
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:28,576
Is that so?

484
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:34,332
Du-sik, you've got to listen to what I say

485
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:36,709
more literally, with a pure mind.

486
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:40,964
I know we're grown-ups over 30,

487
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:44,425
but talking about ramyeon
doesn't always imply something sexual.

488
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:47,554
No, I was just…

489
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:56,104
Gosh.

490
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:00,400
I love the sea breeze. It's so refreshing!

491
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:03,987
-It is.
-Man.

492
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:06,322
This is nice.

493
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:11,995
By the way, why did you change your mind?

494
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:13,663
What?

495
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:15,456
About the match.

496
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:18,960
Why did you change your mind
and decide to compete?

497
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:20,920
Did you suddenly feel more confident?

498
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:23,381
Do you think you'll do a good job?

499
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:25,049
No, not really.

500
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:28,386
Frankly speaking, I'm glad
just to be participating.

501
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:29,304
You know?

502
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:35,268
What is it this time?

503
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:37,270
Why are you glaring at me like that?

504
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:42,358
You have no ambition, do you?

505
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:43,902
What?

506
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:45,528
"I want to be a champion."

507
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:47,864
"I want to be famous like before."

508
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:49,949
"I want my fame back."

509
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:51,075
Something like that.

510
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:53,077
Come on.

511
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:57,165
You see, if you get too greedy,
you have to pay the price later.

512
00:31:58,124 --> 00:32:01,961
And I heard my preliminary opponent
is really strong.

513
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:03,421
Guess what his nickname is.

514
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:05,298
"Hercures."

515
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:06,799
So how will I beat him?

516
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:10,053
It's "Hercules," you idiot.

517
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:14,974
"Cures, cules." What's the difference?

518
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:18,144
What's the difference in our weight now?

519
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:19,979
About 30 kg?

520
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:25,360
I don't think so.
Judging from when I carried you earlier,

521
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:27,153
we probably weigh the same--

522
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:30,073
Gosh.

523
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:33,034
Come on. I'm right.

524
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:35,119
I'm just stating the facts.

525
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:39,916
I may have overpowered you when we
kids, but you're way stronger than me now.

526
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:42,543
But I just threw you over.

527
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,212
No, that's not fair.

528
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:45,964
You suddenly used the technique--

529
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:50,093
Then you do the same!
Do you warn opponents beforehand?

530
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:53,054
Actually, I've been curious.

531
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:55,682
When you were little,
you would slyly throw over

532
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:57,934
boys who were twice as big as you.

533
00:32:58,017 --> 00:32:59,727
What are you so scared of now?

534
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,854
Why did you let go of your greed?

535
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:03,898
Are you a saint or what?

536
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:06,526
Be your old self.

537
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:09,737
Just wrestle like Kim Baek-du used to.

538
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:21,749
What are you doing?

539
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:23,376
Stand up.

540
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:25,545
Are you going to sleep here?

541
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:29,090
Stand up now.

542
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:32,510
Why did you have to say

543
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:34,012
that I was sly though?

544
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:37,181
Is this what you call sly?
Pulling a slick move like this?

545
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:38,599
All of a sudden?

546
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:40,852
This is what you call sly, right?

547
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:42,270
You told me to be…

548
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:48,526
sudden…

549
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:54,157
Du-sik.

550
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:56,993
I'm so sorry.

551
00:33:57,493 --> 00:33:58,828
I'm really sorry.

552
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:01,330
-Sorry, Du-sik.
-You! Come here.

553
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:02,498
-Sorry.
-Come here.

554
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:03,416
-Sorry!
-You…

555
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:05,084
-Come here!
-I said sorry!

556
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:06,878
Have you lost your mind?

557
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:09,088
Stop it.

558
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:10,882
-Stop what?
-You can hurt me.

559
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:13,384
-I said I was sorry!
-Hey!

560
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:16,262
You've been in there long enough.
Come on out.

561
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:19,015
I can't. I can't stop it.

562
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:23,352
Gosh, I'm so sorry.

563
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:25,521
Baek-du.

564
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:27,690
Hey, Beom-su.

565
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:29,984
Where did you go in the middle of dinner?

566
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:32,528
I just…

567
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:35,323
-I took a walk.
-A walk, I see.

568
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:38,743
Why is your face so red, by the way?

569
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:40,369
Is it red?

570
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,538
No, it's not.

571
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:44,832
Yes, it is. It's so red.

572
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:47,043
Look in the mirror.

573
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:49,629
-It's like you're wearing makeup.
-No, I'm not.

574
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:54,133
My stomach hurts. Maybe I ate too much.

575
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:55,968
Go use the restroom.

576
00:34:56,677 --> 00:34:58,554
-All right. See you later.
-Okay.

577
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:03,226
Sang-uk, come on out.

578
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:04,977
Just finish up and come out.

579
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:07,021
-I'm sorry, but--
-Gosh, just…

580
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:34,423
NAMHANG ARENA

581
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:36,926
I think we need more chairs there.

582
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:39,720
I told them to bring some more.
They're coming now.

583
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:44,517
Right.

584
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,102
-Did you hear that?
-Hear what?

585
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:49,355
One of the teams had dinner
at the sashimi restaurant

586
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:50,940
by the beach yesterday,

587
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:53,609
and all the team members
got food poisoning.

588
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:54,944
So they're all pulling out.

589
00:35:55,027 --> 00:35:56,612
What? Which team is that?

590
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,657
Which team was it?

591
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:02,910
Right. It was the Geosan-gun Ssireum Team.

592
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,871
-Geosan-gun?
-Yes.

593
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:06,497
I can't believe that happened.

594
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:07,665
-What a shame.
-Right?

595
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:09,876
Food poisoning before the match?

596
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:11,252
Tell me about it.

597
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:14,380
MASS FOOD POISONING OUTBREAK IN NAMHANG

598
00:36:14,463 --> 00:36:16,841
I can't believe these guys.

599
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:19,719
Why do they always give me a hard time?

600
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:22,638
Sir.

601
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:26,893
The ssireum team has just requested

602
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:31,689
that the sports committee
cover the hospital bills.

603
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:32,857
What should we…

604
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:36,527
These guys are giving me a headache.

605
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:39,906
Seriously,
if their match was the next day,

606
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:44,035
they should've just eaten
some packed meals in their rooms,

607
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:46,329
not go out to the beach

608
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:48,706
and eat raw fish!

609
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:55,171
It seems they're thinking
of all kinds of ways to screw me over

610
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:57,298
instead of doing ssireum.

611
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:58,966
They have to be.

612
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:02,261
I'm paying for the trip, food,
accommodation, everything,

613
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:05,765
and now they want me to pay
their hospital bills too. Am I wrong?

614
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:07,600
You're right, sir.

615
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:12,521
There's a limit to my patience.

616
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:13,940
These punks.

617
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:16,108
It could've been worse though.

618
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,778
Not everyone is pulling out.

619
00:37:18,861 --> 00:37:20,446
One of them is still competing.

620
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:23,574
Well, that's very fortunate.

621
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,202
So who is he?

622
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:29,205
THE 23RD NAMHANG
NATIONAL SSIREUM CHAMPIONSHIPS

623
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:37,630
Oh, boy.

624
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:43,594
Where is she? I don't see her.

625
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:53,521
Where are you?

626
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:55,022
DU-SIK

627
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:57,108
Hey, where are you?

628
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:00,278
When are you coming?

629
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:21,132
In Row S, at the back.

630
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:23,301
S…

631
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:32,226
Stop looking around

632
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,103
and focus on warming up.

633
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:35,146
Where is she?

634
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:38,524
Oh, there she is.

635
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:53,205
Yes, Captain.

636
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,085
About the thing you asked…

637
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:01,297
About the café owner.

638
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:06,510
Yes.

639
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:08,888
By the way,

640
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,349
don't you have something to tell…

641
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:14,101
Never mind.

642
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:16,854
Call me as soon as you find something.

643
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:18,522
Okay.

644
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:31,911
You know something, don't you?

645
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:34,455
The reason why Yu-gyeong came here.

646
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:37,708
Isn't that
why you approved this investigation?

647
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:42,254
EMPLOYEE INFORMATION
OH YU-GYEONG

648
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:45,091
I didn't know these backstories.

649
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:29,677
I get she's a bold owner,
but isn't this too much?

650
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:40,980
Come on, you're too humble.

651
00:40:42,314 --> 00:40:45,568
I know you can find out now
if you want to.

652
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:47,695
I can?

653
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:50,156
-How will I--
-Because you're a cop.

654
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,118
Are you not?

655
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:57,079
What do you mean?

656
00:40:58,664 --> 00:40:59,748
Or maybe not.

657
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:12,720
Let me introduce the wrestlers.

658
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:14,388
In the blue satba

659
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:16,932
is Kim Baek-du of Geosan-gun Ssireum Team.

660
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:19,143
Age 32.

661
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:21,520
Height at 178 cm and weighing in at 80 kg.

662
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:23,105
His best placement is fifth place

663
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:26,275
in Taebaek class
at the 2022 Chuseok Championships.

664
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:28,360
His opponent in the red satba

665
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:30,946
is Ahn Dong-min
from Boeung City Hall Ssireum Team.

666
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:34,825
Age 25, 185 cm in height,
and weighing in at 79 kg.

667
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:38,746
He debuted two years ago
and hasn't won a championship yet,

668
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:42,708
but he's always made it
to quarterfinals, which proves his skill.

669
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:45,044
-Dong-min.
-Yes.

670
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:47,880
Kim Baek-du is all washed up now.

671
00:41:47,963 --> 00:41:50,216
So just crush him
with your strength. Okay?

672
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:51,133
Yes, Coach.

673
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:56,055
Red, blue.

674
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:05,606
Attention.

675
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:07,399
Bow.

676
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:10,486
To the center.

677
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:24,917
The Namhang Ssireum Championships.

678
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,920
Kim Baek-du from Geosan
versus Ahn Dong-min from Boeung.

679
00:42:38,472 --> 00:42:41,100
-Knees up!
-Kim Baek-du seems to be struggling.

680
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:42,768
-His face is all red.
-Stand up.

681
00:42:42,851 --> 00:42:45,479
Right. Ahn Dong-min has great strength,

682
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,856
so it won't be easy getting a head start

683
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,191
at the satba standoff.

684
00:42:52,027 --> 00:42:54,196
The first preliminary match begins.

685
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:10,379
Push and Throw!

686
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:17,845
Ahn Dong-min wins this round easily
with his specialty, Push and Throw!

687
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:20,848
Kim Baek-du tried
to hold out until the end,

688
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:22,891
but the attack was so sudden

689
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:25,394
that it probably baffled him.

690
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:00,012
When you were little,
you would slyly throw over

691
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:03,474
boys who were twice as big as you.

692
00:44:03,557 --> 00:44:06,518
Be your old self.

693
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:09,730
Just wrestle like Kim Baek-du used to.

694
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:11,690
Blue, red!

695
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:28,290
Kneel.

696
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:34,004
Bring the knees closer.

697
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:36,131
Grab satbas!

698
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:48,477
Knees up!

699
00:44:50,312 --> 00:44:51,563
Stand up.

700
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:56,110
Ready.

701
00:44:57,569 --> 00:44:58,529
Hold your position.

702
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:00,406
Hold your position!

703
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:01,615
Hold your position!

704
00:45:05,452 --> 00:45:06,537
Blue, warning!

705
00:45:07,496 --> 00:45:10,666
Kim Baek-du didn't take position
fast enough.

706
00:45:10,749 --> 00:45:12,918
-He received a warning.
-Move back.

707
00:45:13,001 --> 00:45:13,836
Kim was lagging.

708
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:16,296
-In the first satba standoff.
-Hold your position.

709
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:19,049
-So he wants a good position this time.
-Hold it.

710
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:21,135
-He should be mindful about the warning.
-Ready.

711
00:45:21,718 --> 00:45:23,720
Now, the second round begins.

712
00:45:24,763 --> 00:45:27,057
Ahn Dong-min won the first round.

713
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:29,226
Let's see who's going to win this round.

714
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:38,235
Ahn Dong-min lifted him! Lifting Throw!

715
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,614
Kim Baek-du is holding out.

716
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:50,080
Kim Baek-du made an incredible move!

717
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:52,374
Now, the game is tied again.

718
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:57,296
That's right. Kim predicted Ahn's move,

719
00:45:57,379 --> 00:46:01,091
quickly lowered his position,
and pushed himself against Ahn,

720
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:03,343
countering his skill.

721
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:05,679
That was a very smart move.

722
00:46:05,762 --> 00:46:07,431
Throw him over in the next round.

723
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:08,891
-Yes, Coach.
-You got this.

724
00:46:08,974 --> 00:46:10,309
-Thanks.
-Go for it.

725
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:22,613
Blue, red!

726
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:43,175
Kneel.

727
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:49,139
Bring your knees closer.

728
00:46:51,016 --> 00:46:51,975
Grab satbas.

729
00:46:58,398 --> 00:47:01,527
The two wrestlers are locked in
an intense satba standoff.

730
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:06,031
It seems that they're both trying
to lower their positions.

731
00:47:06,114 --> 00:47:08,325
Is it okay to wear
the waist satba like this?

732
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:09,743
-Put your arm closer.
-Okay.

733
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:15,541
Knees up.

734
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:18,669
-The score is 1-1.
-Stand up.

735
00:47:18,752 --> 00:47:19,920
The third round begins.

736
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:23,298
Let's see which wrestler
will continue their challenge

737
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:25,592
to become a Taebaek-class champion.

738
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:53,579
Latching Hook!

739
00:47:53,662 --> 00:47:56,498
Both wrestlers are attempting
Latching Hook at the same time!

740
00:48:00,002 --> 00:48:03,046
That was amazing, Kim Baek-du!

741
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:07,384
He came from behind to claim victory
against the hot favorite, Ahn Dong-min,

742
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:09,678
continuing his challenge to be a champion!

743
00:48:11,513 --> 00:48:14,141
The two wrestlers just attempted
a Latching Hook

744
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:15,601
at the same time.

745
00:48:15,684 --> 00:48:18,478
But Kim Baek-du took it a step further.

746
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:22,065
He pulled the back of Ahn's knee,
throwing off his balance.

747
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:25,485
He instantly used
the Popliteal Hook technique.

748
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:27,696
That was a very smart move.

749
00:48:36,455 --> 00:48:38,915
BLUE: KIM BAEK-DU
RED: NOH JIN-TAE

750
00:48:42,836 --> 00:48:44,588
Kim Baek-du lifts him.

751
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:50,594
Kim wins the first round,
beating his opponent

752
00:48:50,677 --> 00:48:53,013
with Lifting Throw,
followed by Push and Throw.

753
00:48:56,808 --> 00:48:58,644
KIM BAEK-DU: 1
NOH JIN-TAE: 0

754
00:49:11,239 --> 00:49:13,825
Kim's Lifting Throw,
combined with an inner leg skill,

755
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:15,911
secures him a ticket to the round of 16!

756
00:49:15,994 --> 00:49:18,121
Kim Baek-du is on a roll today.

757
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:19,790
As soon as Noh lost balance,

758
00:49:19,873 --> 00:49:21,917
Kim threw him over right away.

759
00:49:22,584 --> 00:49:24,503
-I know!
-He made it to the next round?

760
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:30,676
Look at his leg!

761
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:32,427
That's an amazing inner leg skill.

762
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:33,929
That was incredible.

763
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:38,475
Tell me about it!

764
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:41,895
Stand up.

765
00:49:42,562 --> 00:49:43,522
Ready.

766
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:59,287
He easily throws Shin Gi-beom
with Clenched Interception!

767
00:49:59,746 --> 00:50:02,082
SHIN GI-BEOM: 0
KIM BAEK-DU: 1

768
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:14,344
Countering Shin's outer leg skill,

769
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:16,763
Kim Baek-du of Geosan Team secures a win!

770
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:17,973
-Baek-du.
-He's good.

771
00:50:18,056 --> 00:50:20,934
Kim Baek-du briskly
moves on to the quarterfinals

772
00:50:21,017 --> 00:50:22,728
backed by his various techniques.

773
00:50:22,811 --> 00:50:23,812
Well done.

774
00:50:24,312 --> 00:50:25,480
Well done, man.

775
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:30,986
JANG GEUN-SU: BLUE
KIM BAEK-DU: RED

776
00:50:56,803 --> 00:50:58,680
Kim continues his smart strategy

777
00:50:58,764 --> 00:51:02,476
of breaking the opponent's balance
and then employing an outer leg skill.

778
00:51:19,284 --> 00:51:23,997
Kim was on the brink of defeat
against Jang's Lifting Throw,

779
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:26,291
but he turned the tables
with a suplex move!

780
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:34,257
Kim is absolutely on fire today.

781
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:36,676
He breezes through to the semifinals.

782
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,595
-Yes.
-Does he have a stye?

783
00:51:38,678 --> 00:51:41,097
Why does he keep blinking?

784
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:42,349
Look at his eyes.

785
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:44,518
He's totally high.

786
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:46,937
Could he have invited a lady friend?

787
00:51:48,647 --> 00:51:49,523
A lady friend?

788
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:52,067
That must be why he was acting weird,

789
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:53,985
and saying we shouldn't come.

790
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:55,987
He was definitely acting strange.

791
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:57,781
Are you sure?

792
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:07,123
There can't be a lady friend in there.

793
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:10,126
She must be older than him.

794
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:25,892
Did you see me?

795
00:52:26,601 --> 00:52:29,771
I was really on fire just now, wasn't I?

796
00:52:36,069 --> 00:52:37,737
Just as expected,

797
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:41,533
Lim Dong-seok of Seongwon City Hall
proceeds to the finals.

798
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:12,272
Baek-du.

799
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:14,232
Hey, Dong-seok.

800
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:15,650
Did you win your semifinal?

801
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:17,777
-Yes, I guess.
-Man.

802
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:21,489
You always have to be
the champion, don't you?

803
00:53:22,073 --> 00:53:23,742
You're doing well yourself today.

804
00:53:23,825 --> 00:53:24,659
You think?

805
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:27,078
See? I told you.

806
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:28,872
I said you better watch out.

807
00:53:30,123 --> 00:53:32,334
I heard everyone else
is in the hospital now.

808
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:33,335
You're alone today.

809
00:53:33,919 --> 00:53:36,546
Well, what can I do about it?

810
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:39,299
Life happens, you know?

811
00:53:40,508 --> 00:53:42,385
-It's okay.
-Just win this next round.

812
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:43,887
So we can meet in the finals.

813
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:46,056
Gosh, okay.

814
00:53:46,139 --> 00:53:47,515
Keep it up, man.

815
00:53:52,854 --> 00:53:55,106
I told her not to ignore my texts,

816
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:56,691
and she's doing just that.

817
00:54:28,473 --> 00:54:31,518
NAMHANG ARENA
THE 23RD NAMHANG SSIREUM CHAMPIONSHIPS

818
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:35,689
In the blue satba is
Kim Baek-du from Geosan-gun Ssireum Team.

819
00:54:37,899 --> 00:54:39,025
The blue satba enters.

820
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:41,861
Kim Baek-du of Geosan-gun Ssireum Team.

821
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:45,782
Kim Baek-du seems to be
in excellent shape today.

822
00:54:45,865 --> 00:54:49,911
He's shown great performances today,
making it to the semifinals.

823
00:54:49,995 --> 00:54:54,708
At this rate, he might actually be able
to win his first championship today.

824
00:54:57,419 --> 00:54:59,504
Contending against Kim Baek-du,

825
00:54:59,587 --> 00:55:03,008
in the red satba, is Ha Chang-bae
of Gyeongan-gun Ssireum Team.

826
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:05,010
He's 185 cm tall and weighs in at 80 kg.

827
00:55:05,093 --> 00:55:06,886
And he's turned 24 this year.

828
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:09,889
This is his first pro championship ever.

829
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:12,392
-Chang-bae.
-Still, he has managed to power through

830
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:14,144
to the semifinals.

831
00:55:14,227 --> 00:55:16,438
He is certainly a hot favorite today.

832
00:55:17,022 --> 00:55:21,276
That's right. Both contestants are going
for their first champion title today.

833
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:25,363
I'm so curious to find out
which wrestler will emerge triumphant.

834
00:56:06,738 --> 00:56:07,697
Kneel.

835
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:17,957
Grab satbas.

836
00:56:23,963 --> 00:56:25,882
So this is how these two made it here!

837
00:56:25,965 --> 00:56:29,135
The two wrestlers refuse to budge
in this satba standoff.

838
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:32,931
It's also a skill to make it harder
for your opponent to grasp your satba.

839
00:56:33,014 --> 00:56:35,809
It may look like
they're just getting ready,

840
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:39,437
but there's already an intense match
going on over there.

841
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:41,523
-Now, let's see.
-Stand up.

842
00:56:41,606 --> 00:56:45,193
Which contestant will face off
against Seongwon's Lim Dong-seok,

843
00:56:45,276 --> 00:56:48,279
-who's already made it to the finals.
-Ready!

844
00:56:52,492 --> 00:56:54,494
Ha Chang-bae lifts Kim!

845
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:57,956
He's attempting Clenched Interception.

846
00:57:03,419 --> 00:57:05,296
An inner leg skill!

847
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:07,966
Rear Knee Takedown!

848
00:57:08,049 --> 00:57:11,219
The moment
Ha lost balance and started falling,

849
00:57:11,302 --> 00:57:12,887
Kim used Rear Knee Takedown.

850
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:16,141
He didn't lose focus until the end
and threw his opponent over.

851
00:57:16,224 --> 00:57:17,767
He's very experienced indeed.

852
00:57:19,727 --> 00:57:21,563
What are you doing here?

853
00:57:21,646 --> 00:57:23,064
The head coach sent us here.

854
00:57:23,731 --> 00:57:26,234
We're feeling a little better
than the others.

855
00:57:26,317 --> 00:57:27,360
What?

856
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:29,404
But you don't look well.

857
00:57:29,487 --> 00:57:30,488
This…

858
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:33,825
Don't worry, and just head back.

859
00:57:33,908 --> 00:57:35,076
You should go rest.

860
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:38,621
No, the head coach said
he felt bad seeing you compete alone,

861
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:40,874
so we should help you stay strong.

862
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:42,542
Help me stay strong?

863
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:45,795
It looks like
I should help you stay strong.

864
00:57:45,879 --> 00:57:50,300
I can't believe you made it this far
all by yourself. I'm really impressed.

865
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:54,179
It's okay. The general manager is here,
cheering for me.

866
00:57:54,262 --> 00:57:55,555
That's been giving me strength.

867
00:57:56,347 --> 00:57:58,558
The general manager? Where is she?

868
00:57:58,641 --> 00:58:01,644
She's over there. Right over…

869
00:58:02,770 --> 00:58:03,730
Where?

870
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:04,981
Over there…

871
00:58:05,523 --> 00:58:06,858
I don't see her.

872
00:58:07,817 --> 00:58:10,361
-Over there, the green…
-Oh, right.

873
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:14,365
Ms. Oh headed back to Geosan
because something came up.

874
00:58:15,575 --> 00:58:18,411
I heard Head Coach talking to her
over the phone at the ER.

875
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:20,872
What?

876
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:30,381
Hello…

877
00:58:55,448 --> 00:58:57,075
KIM BAEK-DU: 1
HA CHANG-BAE: 0

878
00:58:58,243 --> 00:59:00,161
Blue! Come on in!

879
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:07,293
Mr. Kim Baek-du, please get in the ring.

880
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:09,170
Hey, what are you doing?

881
00:59:10,129 --> 00:59:11,965
Baek-du, get in the ring.

882
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:15,927
Baek-du, come on.
What are you doing all of a sudden?

883
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:17,345
Yeah, I'm going.

884
00:59:30,316 --> 00:59:31,526
Go for it!

885
00:59:34,112 --> 00:59:37,782
The tension in the air
between the two wrestlers is palpable.

886
00:59:50,461 --> 00:59:51,921
About the café owner.

887
00:59:54,132 --> 00:59:57,343
Her father was a wrestler
on the team you're working for now.

888
00:59:57,427 --> 00:59:59,220
Joo Cheol-yong,

889
00:59:59,304 --> 01:00:02,473
the victim of the murder
that happened there 20 years ago.

890
01:00:03,725 --> 01:00:04,892
She's his daughter.

891
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:09,439
It's been a while.

892
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:15,320
Time flies.

893
01:00:17,071 --> 01:00:18,197
Right?

894
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:20,033
Du-sik.

895
01:00:34,505 --> 01:00:37,342
LIKE FLOWERS IN SAND

896
01:01:00,865 --> 01:01:04,077
I told her I couldn't sleep
when my texts are ignored.

897
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:06,245
I won't be able to sleep until next year.

898
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:09,040
I'm following that woman
named Mi-ran right now.

899
01:01:09,123 --> 01:01:11,501
She's heading somewhere with a big bag.

900
01:01:11,584 --> 01:01:14,796
Du-sik! Oh Du…

901
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:16,756
Did something happen yesterday?

902
01:01:16,839 --> 01:01:18,508
Nothing happened.

903
01:01:18,591 --> 01:01:21,010
What could happen between me and him?

904
01:01:21,094 --> 01:01:22,136
Hey, Oh Du-sik.

905
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:23,596
What was that face just now?

906
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:24,847
Snap out of it!

907
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:27,642
Du-sik, I remembered something.

908
01:01:29,602 --> 01:01:31,604
